and a moving mechanism.                       The case main body stores a toner.
The rotator         is   stored in        the case main body and rotates                around
a rotation         axis.       The transmitter          is   arranged outside the case
main body and transmits rotation                        to the rotator.           The moving
mechanism moves the transmitter                        between a first        position        and
a second position              which is        arranged at an outside of the first
positioninarotationaxisdirectionoftherotator.                                      Themoving
mechanism includes a holder holding the transmitter.                                    As the
holder moves with respect to the case main body, the transmitter
moves between the first position and the                              second position.

a toner case is              detachably attached to an attachment part                              of
an image forming apparatus.                          The toner case includes a case
main body, a rotator, a transmitter and a moving mechanism.
The case main body stores                      a toner.       The rotator           is    stored in
the case main body and rotates around a rotation axis.                                             The
transmitter           is  arranged outside the case main body and transmits
rotation          to     the   rotator.           The    moving      mechanism          moves      the
transmitter           between a first          position      and a second position               which
is    arranged at an outside of the first                         position        in    a rotation
axis direction             of the rotator.              The moving mechanism includes
a holder holding the transmitter.                         The attachment part              includes
a restriction part which comes into contact with the holder
torestrictrotationoftheholder.                              Asthecasemainbodyrotates

The toner case includes acasemainbody, arotator,                                   atransmitter,
and a moving mechanism.                       The case main body stores a toner.
The rotator           is   stored in      the case main body and rotates                      around
a rotation          axis.      The transmitter            is  arranged outside the case
main body and transmits rotation                          to the rotator.              The moving
mechanism moves the transmitter                          between a first            position       and
a second position              which is        arranged at an outside of the first
positioninarotationaxisdirectionoftherotator.                                            Themoving
mechanism           includes        a   holder       holding      the     transmitter.             The

outer face of the storage 31 of the case main body 21.                                          The
shutter       28 is   capable of opening and closing the discharge port
33 of the storage 31.
 [0069]          Withreference to FIG. 3, the connector29ofthe                               toner
container 15 includes a connecting                           shaft   91 and a connecting

connected to the driving gear 52 of the exposed piece 47 of
the     supporter        24   via      an  idle       gear       93.   According           to   the
configuration described above,                       the supporter 24 is              connected
to the conveyer 23 via the idle                      gear 93 and the connector 29.
                                                 16

 [0070]      Next, the attachment part 16 will be described in
detail.
 [0071]      With reference to FIG.           13 and FIG.       14,   an upper side
of the attachment part       16 is coveredwith an openable and closable
top cover 100,       and a front     side of the attachment part                16 is
covered with an openable and closable                    front cover 101.          By
opening the top cover 100 and the front cover 101,                       it becomes
possible to attach and detach the toner container 15 to and
from the attachment part 16.             With reference to FIG.               14,  to
the attachment part        16,   the toner container 15 is               detachably
attached along an attachment direction                  Z from the upper side
to the lower side.
 [0072]      With reference to FIG. 15,               the attachment part 16
includes a pair       of left    and right       frames     103   (only the right
frame 103 is    shown in FIG. 15) anda driving coupling 104 arranged
in an approximate center portion of the right frame 103.
 [0073]      In   an inner face of each frame 103 of the attachment
part  16, an attachment groove 110 is              provided.        The attachment
groove 110 has a first         groove part         111,  a second groove part
112 provided at a downstream side of the first                    groove part     111
in the attachment direction        Z and a third      groove part      113 provided
at the downstream side of the second groove part 112 in the
attachment direction Z.            The   first      groove part         111 narrows
toward the downstream side in          the attachment direction              Z.   The
second groove part      112 has a width narrower than the first               groove
part 111 and the third groove part                  113.
 [0074]         In   the   inner    face      of   the    right      frame   103,     a
communication hole 114 is         provided at       a position       corresponding
to the third      groove part     113.     In   the inner face of the right
                                       17

frame 103,      an insertion         groove 115 is        provided.          On a face at
the downstream side of the insertion                 groove 115 in the attachment
direction Z, a restriction part 116 is provided.
 [0075]       With reference           to FIG.       7   and    FIG.    8,   the driving
coupling 104 of the attachment part                     16 is    exposed through the
communication hole 114 of the right frame 103.                               The driving
coupling 104 is         rotatably       supported by a holding member 118.
The driving coupling 104 is               connected to a driving source 119
constituted by a motor and the others.
 [0076]       Next, an operation to discharge the toner from the
toner container 15 will be described.
 [0077]       With reference to FIG. 3, when the toner is                      discharged
from the toner container 15,                in  a state     where the transmitting
coupling 61 of the transmitter 25 is coupled to the driving
coupling 104 and the discharge port 33 of the storage 31 is
opened,     the driving source             119 is      driven.        When the driving
source 119 is        driven,       the driving coupling 104 is                 rotated   by
rotation     driving force from the driving source 119.                            When the
driving coupling 104 is              thus rotated,        rotation        of the driving
coupling 104 is transmitted             to the agitator         22 by the transmitter
25 and the supporter 24,               and the agitator             22 is   rotated.     As
a result, the toner stored in the storage 31 is agitated by
the agitator 22.
 [0078]       When the driving coupling 104 is                  rotated     as described
above,     the rotation         is  transmitted to the conveyer 23 by the
transmitter 25,          the supporter 24,              the idle gear 93 and the
connector      29,    and the conveyer 23 is               rotated.        As a result,
as shown in     an arrow A in        FIG.   3,  the toner stored in           the storage
31 is    conveyed toward the discharge port 33 of the storage 31
bytheconveyer23.              The tonerthus       conveyedtowardthedischarge
                                              18

port 33 of the storage 31 is                     discharged through the discharge
port 33 of the storage 31 to the outside of the toner container
15.      The toner discharged to the outside of the toner container
15 is      replenished to the developing device 10                        (refer    to FIG.
1).
 [0079]         Next,     a work to check operation of the transmitter
25byaworker,           suchas auser andaserviceman, willbe                       described.
 [0080]         In the state         where the toner container 15 is               detached
from the attachment part 16, the holder 64 is in the second
holdingposition             (refer      to FIG. 11 andFIG.       12),  and the inclined
piece 72 and the non-inclined piece 73 of the guided part                                 71
of    the    holder       64    respectively           come   into   contact       with  the
downstream side inclined                   part    84 and the non-inclined part           85
of the guide part              82 of the cover 27.             The transmitter         25 is
held in the second position                       (refer to FIG. 8) by the holder
64,     and the transmitting coupling                      61 of the transmitter 25
protrudes to the right                 side (the outside in        the left-and-right
direction)        further        than the engaging wall 77 of the cover 27.
 [0081]         From this        state,      the worker presses the boss part             69
of the holder 64 to the upper side.                         Consequently,        the holder
64 rotates       with respect to the case main body 21 from the second
holding position              (refer to FIG. 11 and FIG. 12)                 to the first
holding position             (refer      to FIG.     9 and FIG.   10)  against biasing
force of the coil           spring 65.            Consequently,     the inclined       piece
72 of the guidedpart 71 of the holder 64 moves along the downstream
side inclined part 84 of the guide part 82 of the cover 27,
and a boundary portion between the inclined                           piece 72 and the
non-inclined piece 73 of the guided part                        71 comes into contact
with the upstream side inclined part                         83 of the guide part        82.
Consequently,          the holder 64 moves to the left                side (the inside
in   the left-and-right              direction),         and the transmitter         25 held
                                                  19

by the holder 64 moves from the second position                             (refer      to FIG.
8)   to the first          position       (refer      to FIG.    7) .   As a result,          the
transmitting coupling 61 of the transmitter 25 is retracted
to an inside of the engaging wall 77 of the cover 27.                                   In this
state, an entire portion of the transmitter 25 is retracted
to the inside of the cover 27.
 [0082]        Next, the worker releases the pressing of the boss
part     69 of the holder 64.              Consequently,         the holder 64 rotates
with respect to the case main body 21 from the first                                   holding
position       (refer       to FIG.     9 and FIG.       10)   to the second holding
position       (refer to FIG. 11 and FIG. 12) by the biasing force
of the coil spring 65.                  Consequently, the inclined piece 72
of the guided part            71 of the holder 64 moves along the downstream
side inclined part 84 of the guide part 82 of the cover 27,
and the inclined            piece 72 and the non-inclined piece 73 of the
guidedpart 71 respectively                  come into contact with the downstream
side inclined          part     84 and the non-inclined part               85 of the guide
part     82.   Consequently,            the holder 64 moves to the right                    side
 (the      outside       in     the    left-and-right           direction),           and     the
transmitter        25 heldby the holder 64 moves from the first                      position
 (refer to FIG. 7) to the second position                            (refer to FIG. 8).
As a result,          the transmitting             coupling 61 of the transmitter
25protrudes to the right               side (the outside in the left-and-right
direction)        further        than the engaging wall 77 of the cover 27.
 [0083]        As described above,               in the present embodiment,              as the
holder 64 rotates              with respect to the case main body 21,                         the
transmitter         25 moves between the first               position       and the second
position.          By      applying       such      a   configuration,           it    becomes
possible       to move         the   transmitter         25   in    the   left-and-right
direction       by a simple operation.                  Accordingly,         the worker is
allowed to easily             check whether the transmitter                 25 is    normally
operated.
                                                 20

 [0084]            Next,      an operation to set             the toner container 15 to
the attachmentpart16byaworker,                           suchasauserandaserviceman,
will be described.
 [0085]            In the state           where the toner container 15 is                detached
from the attachment part 16, the holder 64 is in the second
holdingposition                 (refer       to FIG. 11 andFIG.       12),    and the inclined
piece 72 and the non-inclined piece 73 of the guided part                                       71
of     the     holder         64    respectively          come    into    contact       with   the
downstream side inclined                       part   84 and the non-inclined part              85
of the guide part                  82 of the cover 27.             The transmitter           25 is
held in the second position                         (refer to FIG. 8) by the holder
64,     and the transmitting coupling                         61 of the transmitter 25
protrudes to the right                      side (the outside in         the left-and-right
direction)           further         than the engaging wall 77 of the cover 27.
The shutter            28 closes the discharge port 33 of the storage 31.
 [0086]            When the worker sets the toner container 15 to the
attachment part                16,    as shown in       FIG.   2,  the worker inserts          the
toner container 15 to the attachment part                          16 along the attachment
direction           Z.     As shown in           FIG.    16,  when the toner           container
15 is       inserted         to a predetermined position                  in   the attachment
part 16,          the restriction part 116 provided in the insertion
groove 115 comes into contact with the boss part                              69 of the holder
64.       This restricts rotation of the holder 64.
 [0087]            From this         state,      when the worker further            inserts    the
toner container 15 to the attachment part                          16 along the attachment
direction Z, as shown in FIG. 17,                            the toner container 15 is
attached           to     the      attachment          part    16.       Consequently,         the
restriction             part     116 provided in           the insertion         groove 115 of
the attachment part                    16 presses the boss part              69 of the holder
64,     and the holder 64 moves from the second holding position
                                                    21

 (refer      to FIG.       11 and FIG.         12)    to the first       holding position
 (refer      to FIG.       9 and FIG.      10)     against the biasing force of the
coil spring 65.               Consequently, the inclined piece 72 of the
guided part          71 of the holder 64 moves along the downstream side
inclined        part     84 of the guide part               82 of the cover 27,          and the
boundary          portion         between       the     inclined       piece      72    and  the
non-inclined piece 73 of the guided part                             71 comes into contact
with the upstream side inclined part                             83 of the guide part        82.
Consequently,            the holder 64 moves to the left                  side (the inside
in    the left-and-right             direction),           and the transmitter           25 held
by the holder 64 moves from the second position                               (refer     to FIG.
8)    to the first          position        (refer     to FIG.      7) .  As a result,       the
transmitting coupling 61 of the transmitter 25 is retracted
to the inside of the engaging wall 77 of the cover 27 and faces
the driving coupling 104.
 [00881          Additionally,           as the toner container 15 is                 attached
to the attachment part                16 as described above,              as shown in       FIG.
17,     the engaging wall 77 of the cover 27 passes through the
first      groove part          111 and the second groove part                     112,   and is
engaged with the third               groove part          113 of the attachment groove
110 of the right frame 103.                        Meanwhile, the engaging part 34
of the case main body 21 passes through the first                                  groove part
111 and the second groove part 112,                             and is engaged with the
third      groove part         113 of the attachment groove 110 of the left
frame 103           (not shown in figures).
 [00891          Next, in the statewhere therestrictionpart116comes
into contact with the boss part 69 of the holder 64 and the
rotation of the holder 64 is restricted, the worker rotates
the case main body 21 with respect to the holder 64 from the
first     rotatingposition              (refer      to FIG.      4) to the secondrotating
position         (refer      to FIG.     5)    along the rotating           direction       RD1.
As a result,           the shutter        28 opens the discharge port 33 of the
                                                   22

storage 31.
 [00901         Additionally, as the case main body 21 is                          rotated       from
the first rotating position to the second rotating position
as described above,            the cover 27 rotates                  integrally           with the
case main body 21.              Consequently, as shown in FIG.                              18,   the
pressing of the holder 64 to the first                        holding position                 (refer
to FIG.      9 and FIG.     10) by the restriction                part     116 is       released,
and the holder 64 moves from the first                        holding position                 (refer
to FIG.       9 and FIG.      10)   to the second holding position                            (refer
to FIG.      11 and FIG.      12) by the biasing force of the coil                            spring
65.      Consequently, the inclined piece 72 of the guided part
71 of the holder 64 moves along the downstream side inclined
part     84 of the guide part            82 of the cover 27,               and the inclined
piece 72 and the non-inclined piece 73 of the guided part                                          71
respectively         come into contact with the downstream side inclined
part 84 and the non-inclined part                           85 of the guide part 82.
Consequently, the holder 64 moves to the right                            side (the outside
in    the left-and-right          direction),            and the transmitter                25 held
by the holder 64 moves from the first                         position          (refer      to FIG.
7)    to the second position              (refer      to FIG.      8) .    As a result,           the
transmitting coupling 61 of the transmitter 25 protrudes to
the right        side    (the outside in            the left-and-right                direction)
further      than the engaging wall 77 of the cover 27,                         and is     coupled
to the driving coupling 104.
 [0091]         Additionally, as the case main body 21 is                          rotated       from
the first rotating position to the second rotating position
as described above, as shown in FIG.                      17 and FIG. 18, the engaging
wall 77 of the cover 27 rotates                       in   the third        groove part           113
of the attachment groove 110 of the right                       frame 103.            Meanwhile,
the engaging part            34 of the case main body 21 rotates                              in  the
third     groove part       113 of the attachment groove 110 of the left
frame 103        (not shown in       figures).            Thereby,       the engaging wall
                                                 23

77 and the engaging part                  34 are restricted            from being removed
from the attachment grooves 110 of the frames 103, and the toner
container         15    is    restricted         from     being       detached          from      the
attachment part 16.                  By the above operation, the setting of
the toner container 15 to the attachment part                             16 is      completed.
 [0092]         When       the toner container 15                is    detached from the
attachment part             16,    the worker rotates            the case main body 21
from the second rotatingposition                      (refer    to FIG.       5) to the first
rotating     position         (refer      to FIG.   4) and then pulls           out the toner
container 15           from the attachment part                  16 along a direction
opposite to the attachment direction Z.
 [0093]        In the present embodiment, as described above, the
toner container 15 includes the moving mechanism 26 which moves
the transmitter             25 between the first             position         and the second
position      which is        arranged at the right                side     (the outside in
the left-and-right               direction)       of the first          position.            By the
moving mechanism 26,                as the case main body 21 is                   rotated        from
the first       rotating        position       to the second rotating                  position,
the transmitter            25 is moved from the first            position        to the second
position.           By     applying         such   a    configuration,              it    becomes
possible to move the transmitter                   25 to the right          side by a simple
operation and to reduce a worker's load for the attachment and
detachment work of the toner container 15.
 [0094]        The moving mechanism 26 includes the holder 64 which
rotates between the first holding position where the holder
64 holds the transmitter                 25 in the first      position         and the second
holding position             where the holder 64 holds the transmitter                             25
in    the second position.                By applying such a configuration,                        it
becomes possible to make the moving mechanism 26 to be a simple
structure.
                                                24

 [00951         The base part            67 of the holder 64 is           inserted       in the
guide wall 76 of the cover27.                     By applyingsuchaconfiguration,
it   becomes possible to rotatably                      support the holder 64 by the
cover 27 by using a simple structure.
 [00961         The upstream side inclined                 part     83 and the downstream
side inclined          part      84 of the guide part            82 of the cover 27 are
inclined       to the right          side      (the outside in        the left-and-right
direction) from the upstream side to the downstream side in
the rotating        direction        RD2,     and the holder 64 includes the guided
part 71 coming into contact with the upstream side inclined
part     83 and the downstream side inclined part                        84.     By applying
such a configuration,                 it   becomes possible to move the holder
64 in      the left-and-right              direction       surely as the cover 27 is
rotated.
 [0097]         The transmitter              25 is    supported by the supporter 24
in the state where the transmitter 25 is movable along the
left-and-right            direction         and is     not rotatable      with respect to
the supporter 24,             and the coil         spring 65 is       interposed between
the supporter 24 and the transmitter                          25.     By applying such a
configuration,            it   becomes possible to integrate                 the supporter
24,    the transmitter             25 and the coil          spring 65 and to arrange
them in a narrow space.
 [00981         The printer         1 includes the toner container 15 and the
attachment part            16 to which the toner container 15 is                   detachably
attached.          By      applying          such    a   configuration,          it    becomes
possible to replace the toner container 15 easily.
 [00991         By the way, in           some cases, with an opening and closing
operation of the top cover 100 provided in the printer main
body 2 or the attachment operation of the toner container 15
to the attachment part                   16,   the driving coupling             104 is    moved
                                                  25

to be coupled to the transmitting coupling 61.                                      However, to
achieve such a configuration,                      the attachment part              16 requires
a   driving       mechanism          to move       the driving           coupling        104,     and
therefore, the attachment part 16 may be complicated in its
structure.
 [0100]         However,         in   the present embodiment,                as the case main
body 21 is      rotated       from the first         rotating      position       to the second
rotating position in the state where the toner container 15
is attached to the attachment part 16,                              the moving mechanism
26 moves the transmitter                  25 from the first        position       to the second
position,         and the transmitting                coupling 61 is            coupled to the
driving coupling 104.                    By applying such a configuration,                        the
attachment part              16 does not require the driving mechanism to
move the driving coupling 104 so that                           it   becomes possible to
suppress the complication of the structure                                of the attachment
part      16 and to achieve space saving of the printer                                 main body
2.
 [0101]         Additionally,              as the toner container 15 is                  attached
to the attachment part                   16,   the restriction            part    116 provided
in   the attachment part                16 presses the holder 64,               and the holder
64 moves from the second holding position                            to the first         holding
position       against the biasing force of the coil                            spring 65.          In
the     state     where       the     toner     container       15    is    attached         to the
attachment part              16,    as the case main body 21 is                   rotated        from
the first        rotating         position       to the second rotating                position,
the pressing of the holder 64 to the first holding position
by the restriction             part      116 is   released, and the holder 64 moves
from the first            holding position           to the second holding position
by the biasing force of the coil                        spring 65.          By applying such
a configuration, it becomes possible to move the holder 64
between       the      first      holding position             and    the      second     holding
position by using a simple structure.

 [0102]        In thepresent      embodiment, entireparts         of the agitator
22 and the conveyer 23 are stored in the case main body 21.
On the other hand,          in another embodiment, parts         of the agitator
22 and/or the conveyer 23 may be stored in                the case main body
21.
 [0103]         In the present embodiment, an entire part of                        the
transmitter        25 is    arranged outside the case main body 21.                  On
the other hand, in another embodiment,            apart    of the transmitter
25 may be arranged outside the case main body 21.
 [0104]        In   the present embodiment,      the configuration of the
present disclosure is            applied to the printer       1.      On the other
hand,      in another embodiment,        the configuration of the present
disclosure        may be applied to an image forming apparatus,                   such
as    a     copying    machine,     a  facsimile    and   a   multifunctional
peripheral, other than the printer 1.
 [0105]            <A    second    embodiment>      Hereinafter,          a  second
embodiment of the present disclosure will be described with
reference to FIG. 19             to FIG. 22.
 [0106]        Firstly, the toner container 151 according to the
second embodiment will            be described.    The same configurations
as the toner container 15 according to the first embodiment
are not explained.
 [0107]        With reference to FIG. 19 and FIG. 20,                   the moving
mechanism 153 of the toner container 151 includes a locking
mechanism 154,        in   addition to the holder 64 and the coil            spring
65.       The   locking       mechanism   154  includes     a    pair     of   first
projections 155           (only one of them, the one at the near side
on the figure,         is   shown in  FIG.  19 and FIG.     20)    and a pair        of
                                         27

second projections               156     (only one of them,           the one at the near
side on the figure,                 is   shown in       FIG.    19 and FIG.         20) .   Each
first      projection        155 is      protruded from each guided part                   71 of
theholder 64 totherightside                    (theoutsideintheleft-and-right
direction).           Each second projection                156 is    protruded from each
guide part          82 of the cover 27 to the left                    side     (the inside in
the left-and-right direction).
 [0108]          Next, the attachment part                 152 according to the second
embodiment will           be described.            The same configurations as the
attachment part            16 according to the first                   embodiment are not
explained.
 [0109]          With reference            to FIG.     21 and FIG.         22,   in  the inner
face of the right frame 103 of the attachment part 152,                                      the
insertion         groove 115 is provided.               On the face at the downstream
side in      the attachment direction                Z of the insertion            groove 115,
the restriction           part     161 is    provided.          In the insertion          groove
115, apressingrib              162 extendingalongthe attachmentdirection
Z isprovidedadjacenttotherestrictionpart                                161.     Thepressing
rib    162 includes a pressing face 163 at a rear upper side (the
downstream side in the rotating                  direction        RD1) of the restriction
part 161.
 [0110]          Next,    an operation to set              the toner container 151 to
the attachmentpart 152byaworker,                        suchasauserandaserviceman,
will    be described.            The same operations as the first                   embodiment
are not explained.
 [0111]           In the state       where the toner container 151 is                 detached
from the attachment part 152, each first projection 155 and
each second projection 156 of the locking mechanism 154 are
engaged with each other,                  and the holder 64 is            held in    the first
holding position             (refer       to FIG.    19)    against the biasing force
                                                28

of the coil           spring 65.            That is,       the holder 64 is           held in      the
first      holding position              by the locking mechanism 154.                     Thereby,
the transmitting              coupling 61 of the transmitter                     25 is   retracted
to the inside of the engaging wall 77                                of the cover 27.
 [0112]           When the worker sets                the toner container 151 to the
attachment part               152,     the worker attaches the toner container
151 to the attachment part                     152 along the attachment direction
Z.     Consequently,             as shown in         FIG.    21,   the boss part           69 of the
holder 64 comes into contact with the restriction                                   part      161 and
the     pressing          face      163     of  the     insertion         groove       115    of   the
attachment part 152.
 [0113]           Next,      the worker rotates               the case main body 21 from
the first         rotating         position       to the second rotating                 position.
Consequently, as shown in FIG. 22,                              the pressing face 163 of
theinsertiongroove                   115presses the bosspart                 69.    Thepressing
releases        the engagement of each first                      projection        155 and each
second projection                156 of the locking mechanism 154.                          That is,
the holding of the holder 64 in                         the first       holding position            by
the     locking         mechanism          154   is    released.           Consequently, the
holder 64 rotates from the first holding position                                         (refer to
FIG.     19)    to the second holding position                        (refer      to FIG.      20)  by
the biasing force of the coil spring 65.                                   Consequently, the
holder         64    moves       to     the    right        side     (the     outside         in   the
left-and-right              direction),         and the transmitter               25 held by the
holder 64 moves from the first                      position       to the second position.
As a result,            the transmitting              coupling 61 of the transmitter
25protrudes to the right                   side (the outside in the left-and-right
direction)           further        than the engaging wall 77 of the cover 27
and is       coupled to the driving coupling 104.
 [0114]           In the present embodiment, as described above, the
toner container 151 includes the coil spring 65 biasing the
                                                    29

holder        64    to    the    second     holding         position          and  the  locking
mechanism 154 holding the holder 64 to the first                              holding position
against the biasing force of the coil                              spring 65.        Therefore,
in the state where the toner container 151 is detached from
the     attachment          part     152,    it     becomes         possible       to  hold    the
transmitter            25 in    the first       position        by the holder 64 and to
retract        the transmitting           coupling 61 of the transmitter                    25 to
theinside          of the engagingwall 77 of the cover27.                         Accordingly,
it    becomes possible to suppress the transmitting                                 coupling 61
from      being       damaged      by   impact        applied         from     the   outside    at
transporting of the toner container 151.
 [0115]           Additionally, the locking mechanism 154 includes the
first      projection         155 provided in            the holder 64 and the second
projection           156 which is       provided in           the cover 27 and engaged
withthe firstprojection                  155.      Byapplyingsuchaconfiguration,
it becomes possible to constitute the locking mechanism 154
without adding dedicated members.
 [0116]           Additionally, in          the state         where the toner container
151 is       attached to the attachment part                         152,     as the case main
body 21 is        rotated     from the first         rotating        position     to the second
rotating          position,        the    pressing          face      163     provided   in    the
attachment part             152 presses the holder 64,                     the holding of the
holder 64 in          the first     holding position            by the locking mechanism
154 is      released, and the holder 64 moves from the first                            holding
position         to the second holding position                       by the biasing force
of the coil            spring 65.       By applying such a configuration,                       it
becomes possible to move the holder 64 from the first                                   holding
position to the second holding position surely.

of the present disclosure                  will     be described with reference to
FIG. 23 and FIG. 24.

 [0118]           The toner container 171 (an example of a toner case)
according to the third                embodiment includes a manipulation member
172,      in    addition to each component of the toner container 15
according to the first                 embodiment.            In the toner container 171,
the components other than the manipulation member 172 have the
approximate           same      configurations               as   the    toner     container  15
according to the first                  embodiment,            except that        the boss part
69 of the holder 64 extends from an end portion at the outside
in the radial direction of the arm part 68 to the left side
 (the inside in          the left-and-right                  direction)       and the shutter
28      is    formed       in     a    cylindrical            shape,      and     their   detail
explanations are omitted.
 [0119]           The manipulation member 172 of the toner container
171      is     arranged        at     the     right        side      (the    outside    in  the
left-and-right             direction)          of the storage 31 of the case main
body 21.           That is,        the manipulation member 172                      is arranged
outside the case main body 21.                             The manipulation member 172
is    rotatable       around the first               rotation        axis X between a first
manipulating            position           (refer         to    FIG.     23)     and   a  second
manipulating position                   (refer       to FIG.        24).    The manipulation
member 172 is          connected to the shutter                     28 via a gear mechanism
 (not shown).
 [0120]           The manipulation member 172 includes a main body part
173,      a manipulated part              174 extending linearly                  from an outer
circumferential              face of the main body part                    173 to an outside
in a radial direction                   (a direction separated from the first
rotation axis X) and a pressing part 175 extending linearly
from the outer circumferential face of the main body part                                    173
to the outside in            the radial        direction          (the direction      separated
fromthe first          rotationaxisX).                  Thepressingpart175isformed
in    a laterally         laid      U-shape.          Into an inner circumference             of
                                                   31

the pressing part 175, the boss part 69 of the holder 64 is
engaged.
 [01211           In the toner container 171 having the above described
configuration, in a state where the manipulation member 172
is   arranged at the first              manipulating position       (refer      to FIG.
23),    thepressingpart175ofthemanipulationmember172presses
the boss part           69 of the holder 64,         and the holder 64 is            held
in   the first       holding position.          Consequently,     the transmitter
25 is       held in the first position by the holder 64,                        and the
transmitting coupling 61 of the transmitter 25 is retracted
to an inside of the through hole 79 of the cover 27                             (only a
part of the cover 27 is                 shown in FIG. 23 and FIG. 24).                The
shutter        28 closes the discharge port 33 of the case main body
21.
 [0122]           From this state, when a worker, such as a user and
a    serviceman,           presses      the   manipulated      part     174     of    the
manipulationmember 172 to the rear side, themanipulationmember
172 is      rotated      from the first      manipulating position           (refer    to
FIG. 23) to the second manipulating position                       (refer to FIG.
24) .      Consequently,          the pressing of the holder 64 to the first
holding position             by the manipulation member 172 is              released,
and the holder 64 rotates                with respect to the case main body
21 from the first          holding position      to the second holding position
by the biasing force of the                   coil spring     65.   Consequently,
according to the sameprocess as the first                embodiment, the holder
64 moves to the right               side  (the outside in    the left-and-right
direction),          and the transmitter        25 held by the holder 64 moves
from the first           position      to the second position.         As a result,
the transmitting             coupling 61 of the transmitter            25 protrudes
to the right         side (the outside in the left-and-right              direction)
further than the through hole 79 of the cover 27.                             Thereby,
the transmitting             coupling     61 is  enabled to be coupled to the
                                             32

driving coupling 104.
 [0123]       When the manipulation member 172 is                    rotated        from the
first     manipulating position           (refer     to FIG.       23)    to the second
manipulating position            (refer     to FIG.     24)     as described above,
the rotation       of the manipulation member 172 is                    transmitted         to
the shutter28, andthe shutter28 rotates.                        Thereby, the shutter
28    opens the discharge port 33 of the case main body 21.
 [0124]          From    this     state,      when    the      worker       presses       the
manipulatedpart 174 of the manipulation member 172 to the front
side,     the manipulation member 172 is                rotated       from the second
manipulating        position         (refer      to   FIG.       24)     to    the     first
manipulating position            (refer    to FIG.      23).       Consequently,          the
pressing part        175 of the manipulation member 172 presses the
boss part      69 of the holder 64,           and the holder 64 rotates                 with
respect to the case main body 21 from the second holding position
to the first      holding position         against the biasing force of the
coil     spring 65.     Consequently,          according to the same process
as the first      embodiment,         the holder 64 moves to the left                   side
 (the     inside    in    the    left-and-right             direction),            and    the
transmitter 25 held by the holder                    64 moves         from the second
position     to the first     position.          As a result,        the transmitting
coupling      61 of the transmitter            25 is    retracted         to the inside
of the through hole 79 of the cover 27.                     Thereby,        the coupling
of the transmitting coupling 61 to the driving coupling 104
is inhibited.
 [0125]       When the manipulation member 172 is                    rotated        from the
second manipulating position                (refer     to FIG.       24)    to the first
manipulating position            (refer     to FIG.     23)     as described above,
the rotation       of the manipulation member 172 is                    transmitted         to
the shutter      28,   and the shutter          28 rotates.          As a result,         the
shutter     28 closes the discharge port 33 of the case main body
                                           33

21.
 [0126]          In the present embodiment,           as the manipulation member
172 is     rotated     between the first        manipulating position              and the
second manipulating position, the holder 64 rotates between
the first holding position and the second holding position.
By applying such a configuration,                 it   becomes possible to move
the transmitter         25 along the left-and-right           directionbya          simple
operation.
 [0127]          In  the present embodiment,            the manipulation member
172 rotates between the first manipulating position and the
second manipulating position.                   On the other hand,          in    another
embodiment,          the  manipulation       member       172   may     move    linearly
between         the   first     manipulating         position        and   the      second
manipulating position.
 [0128]             <A   fourth    embodiment>           Hereinafter,          a    fourth
embodiment of the present disclosure will be described with
reference to FIG. 25 and FIG. 26.
 [0129]          In the toner container 181 (anexample ofa                 toner case)
according to the fourth embodiment,                   the components other than
the moving mechanism 182 and the shutter                 183 have the approximate
same configurations as the toner container 15 according to the
first      embodiment,      and their    detail      explanations are omitted.
 [0130]          The moving mechanism 182 of the toner container 181
includes        the holder 186 and the coil              spring       187  (an example
of a pressing member).
 [0131]          The holder 186 of the moving mechanism 182 is                    movable
along       the      left-and-right       direction         (the       rotation         axis
directions         of the agitator    22 and the conveyer 23) with respect
                                           34

to the case main body 21 between the first holding position
 (refer      to FIG.      25)     where the holder 186 holds the transmitter
25 in    the first        position       and the second holding position                     (refer
to FIG.        26) where the holder 186 holds the transmitter                                 25 in
the second position.
 [0132]          The holder 186 includes                 a base part         189 formed in          a
cylindrical shape with the first rotation axis X as an axis
center,         an    arm    part     190     extending        linearly       from     an     outer
circumferential              face of the base part                189 to an outside in             a
radial      direction         (a direction       separated from the first               rotation
axis X),         and a first rack piece 191 extending linearly from
an end portion at the outside in                        the radial        direction         of the
arm part       190 to the left           side (the inside in            the left-and-right
direction)         .    The base part         189 rotatably         holds the transmitter
25.      On a lower face of the first                   rack piece 191,           a first       rack
gear 192 is           provided.         The first      rack gear 192 is            meshed with
a pinion gear 193 from an upper side.
 [0133]          The coil spring 187 of the moving mechanism 182 is
interposed between the supporter 24 and the transmitter 25.
The coil spring 187 presses the transmitter 25 to the right
side      (the outside in the left-and-right direction),                                  and the
transmitter            25 is     pressed against the holder 186 by the coil
spring 187.
 [0134]          The shutter          183 of the toner container 181 includes
a shutter         main body 194 and a second rack piece 195 extending
from a right            end portion of the shutter                   main body 194 to the
right      side (the outside in              the left-and-right           direction).            The
shutter       main body 194 is             arranged along a lower face                 (an outer
face)      of the storage 31 of the case main body 21.                              On an upper
face of the second rack piece                      195,     a second rack gear 196 is
provided.            The second rack gear 196 is                  meshed with the pinion
                                                 35

gear 193 from a lower side.
 [01351         In the toner container 181 having the above described
configuration,           in   a state       where the holder 186 is            arranged in
the first       holding position              (refer    to FIG.     25),  the transmitter
25 is held in the first position by the holder 186, and the
transmitting coupling 61 of the transmitter 25 is retracted
to the inside of the through hole 79 of the cover 27 (not shown
in FIG. 25 andFIG. 26).                 The shuttermainbody194 of the shutter
183 closes the discharge port 33                          of the case main body 21.
 [0136]         From this        state,      when the shutter          183 is  moved to the
leftside       (onesideintheleft-and-rightdirection),                           theshutter
main body 194 of the shutter                       183 opens the discharge port 33
ofthecasemainbody21.                     Consequently, theholder186connected
to the shutter           183 via the pinion gear 193 moves to the right
side      (the other side             in the       left-and-right direction) with
respect to the case main body 21 from the first                          holding position
 (refer to FIG. 25) to the second holding position                                  (refer to
FIG.     26) .    Consequently,           the transmitter           25 held by the holder
186 moves from the first                  position       to the second position,            and
the transmitting             coupling 61 of the transmitter                   25 protrudes
to the right       side (the outside in the left-and-right                       direction)
further than the through hole 79 of the cover 27.                                    Thereby,
the transmitting             coupling         61 is    enabled to be coupled to the
driving coupling 104.
 [0137]         From this        state,      when the shutter          183 is  moved to the
right     side    (the other side in                the left-and-right         direction),
the shutter       main body 194 of the shutter                 183 closes the discharge
port 33 of the case main body 21.                           Consequently, the holder
186 connected to the shutter                     183 via the pinion gear 193 moves
to the left       side (the one side in               the left-and-right         direction)
with respect to the case main body 21 from the second holding
                                                  36

position      (refer    to FIG. 26) to the firstholdingposition                      (refer
to FIG. 25) .        Consequently, the transmitter25heldbythe                       holder
186 moves from the second position                     to the first    position,        and
the transmitting         coupling 61 of the transmitter               25 is   retracted
to the inside of the through hole 79 of the cover 27.                           Thereby,
the coupling of the transmitting coupling 61 to the driving
coupling 104 is           released.
 [0138]        In thepresent       embodiment, theholder186ofthemoving
mechanism 182 moves along the left-and-right direction from
the first holding position              (refer       to FIG.  25) where the holder
186 holds the transmitter            25 in the firstposition           and the second
holding position           (refer   to FIG.     26) where the holder 186 holds
the transmitter          25 in    the second position.              By applying such
a configuration,           it   becomes possible to move the transmitter
25 along the left-and-right                direction       by a simple structure.
