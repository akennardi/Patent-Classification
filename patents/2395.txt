                   CASE FOR A PORTABLE LISTENING DEVICE
                                   RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]     The present application is related to international patent application number
PCT/US2016/035583 (published as international publication number WO 2016/196838 Al) filed
on 2 June 2016, the described embodiments of which are hereby incorporated herein by
reference.
[0002]     The present application is related to Australian patent application number <removed-apn>
filed on 23 September 2016, the described embodiments of which are hereby incorporated herein
by reference.
                                          BACKGROUND
[0003]     The described embodiments relate generally to portable listening devices such as
earbuds and other types of headphones, and to cases for storing and/or charging such devices.
[0004]     Portable listening devices can be used with a wide variety of electronic devices such as
portable media players, smart phones, tablet computers, laptop computers, stereo systems and
other types of devices. Portable listening devices have historically included one or more small
speakers configured to be place on, in, or near a user's ear, structural components that hold the
speakers in place, and a cable that electrically connects the portable listening device to an audio
source. Other portable listening devices can be wireless devices that do not include a cable and
instead, wirelessly receive a stream of audio data from a wireless audio source.
[0005]     While wireless portable listening devices have many advantages over wired devices,
they also have some potential drawbacks. For example, wireless portable listening devices,
typically require one or more batteries, such as a rechargeable battery, that provides power to the
wireless communication circuitry and other components of the device. Single use batteries need
to be replaced when their charge is depleted while rechargeable batteries need to be periodically
recharged. Also, if the portable wireless listening device is a pair of wireless earbuds, the
                                                    1

1002035081
earbuds can be relatively small and easy to lose when not in use. Further, achieving high-end
acoustic performance from the relatively small earbuds can challenge manufacturers due to the
reduced amount of space available within each earbud.
                                               SUMMARY
[0006]     Some embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a case that can store and charge a
portable listening device, such as a pair of wireless earbuds or other types of headphones. In
various embodiments the case can include one or more features that can improve the user
experience associated with using the case and the portable listening device. For example, some
embodiments of the disclosure pertain to a case for wireless earbuds that includes a detector that
detects if the earbuds are stored in the case along with a detector that detects if a lid of the case is
opened or closed. Circuitry within the case can use information from the detectors to improve
the user experience associated with charging the earbuds, pairing the earbuds to a host device,
such as a portable media player or other source of an audio signal, and/or turning one or more
features of the earbuds off to extend the life of any battery used to power the earbuds.
[0007]     In other embodiments, a case for a portable listening device can include a lid that, when
closed, encloses the listening device within the case and when open exposes the stored listening
device so that a user can remove the listening device from the case. The lid can be pivotably
coupled to a housing of the case with a bi-stable hinge with an over center configuration where
the lid is in a stable position when it is either closed or fully open and is unstable at positions in
between such that the lid tends to move to the open or closed position. The bi-stable operation of
the lid can provide a positive user experience in opening and closing the lid as the lid moves
easily, and with minimal effort, between closed and fully open positions. In other embodiments
a case for a portable listening device can be configured to magnetically attract and retain the
listening device within the case. Still other embodiments facilitate the pairing of a wireless
portable listening device with a host device and/or automatically turn OFF the wireless radio of a
wireless portable listening device when the device is stored and fully enclosed within the case
and automatically turn ON the wireless radio upon opening the case lid. Various embodiments
of the disclosure can include all of the above features together or just some of the features.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0091]     Some embodiments of the present disclosure relate to portable listening devices and
cases for containing and/or charging such devices that have improved features that can improve
the user experience associated with using the case and/or the portable listening device. While the
present disclosure can be useful for a wide variety of portable listening devices, some
embodiments of the disclosure are particularly useful for wireless earbuds and cases for wireless
earbuds as described in more detail below.
[0092]     For example, in some embodiments a pair of wireless earbuds are sized and shaped to
fit within a case that can also include a rechargeable battery and charging circuitry. The pair of
earbuds can be charged when an earbud detector within the case detects that the earbuds are
placed within the case. Further the case can include sensors to detect if the lid is open such that
the wireless radio within each earbud can be activated so they are ready for use by the user.
Similarly, when the lid is closed the wireless radio can be shut off so the charge in the earbud
batteries is conserved.
[0093]     In another example the case can have a pairing button on it that is operable to place the
earbuds in a pairing mode. In a further example the case can also have one or more charge
indicator lights to inform the user of the charge level in the case battery as well as the charge
level in each earbud.
[0094]     In another example the case can have a lid with an over center configuration such that
the lid is in a first stable position when in a closed position and is in a second stable position
when in the open position, but is in an unstable position in-between the closed position and the
open position. In some embodiments the over center configuration can be achieved by using two
pairs of magnets while in other embodiments it can be achieved with a torsion spring. In further
examples the case can have one or more magnets within it to attract the earbuds into cavities
formed within the case and to retain them until a user removes them.
[0095]     In another example the case can be liquid-tight to prevent liquid from damaging the
internal circuitry. The electrical connections for both the earbud recharging and for recharging
the case can be resistant to penetration by a liquid.
                                                    16

1002035081
[0096]     In another example the earbuds can have an acoustic insert that forms one or more
acoustic ports such as a bass port vent and a rear vent that enable the internal speaker to provide
audio performance in the confined space within the earbud housing.
[0097]     In another example the earbud case can be used to initiate Bluetooth@ pairing of the
earbuds with a host device. In one embodiment a lid position sensor detects when the lid is open
and initiates pairing of the earbuds.
[0098]     In order to better appreciate the features and aspects of portable listening devices and
their cases according to the present disclosure, further context for the disclosure is provided in
the following section by discussing several particular implementations for earbuds and a case for
earbuds according to embodiments of the present disclosure. The specific embodiments
discussed are for example purposes only and other embodiments can be employed in other
portable listening devices and cases that can be used for other portable listening devices as well
as other devices.
[0099]     As used herein, the term "portable listening device" includes any portable device
designed to play sound that can be heard by a user. Headphones are one type of portable
listening device, portable speakers are another. The term "headphones" represents a pair of
small, portable listening devices that are designed to be worn on or around a user's head. They
convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound that can be heard by the user. Headphones
include traditional headphones that are worn over a user's head and include left and right
listening devices connected to each other by a headband, headsets (a combination of a headphone
and a microphone); and earbuds (very small headphones that are designed to be fitted directly in
a user's ear). Traditional headphones include both over-ear headphones (sometimes referred to
as either circumaural or full-size headphones) that have earpads that fully encompass a user's
ears, and on-ear headphones (sometimes referred to as supra-aural headphones) that have earpads
that press against a user's ear instead of surrounding the ear. As used herein, the term "earbuds",
which can also be referred to as earphones or ear-fitting headphones, includes both small
headphones that fit within a user's outer ear facing the ear canal without being inserted into the
ear canal, and in-ear headphones, sometimes referred to as canalphones, that are inserted in the
ear canal itself.

EARBUD CASE
[0100]     FIG. 1 depicts a simplified plan view of a case 100 for a pair of wireless earbuds
according to some embodiments of the disclosure. As shown in FIG. 1, case 100 includes a
housing 105, also called a body, having one or more cavities 1 10a, 1 Ob configured to receive a
pair of earbuds 1 I5a, 115b. In some embodiments, cavities 1 10a, 1 Ob can be positioned
adjacent to each other on opposite sides of a center plane of case 100. Each cavity 1 10a, 11 Ob
can be sized and shaped to match that of its respective earbud 1 15a, 1 15b. Each cavity can
include a stem section 1 16a, 1 16b and a bud section 1 17a, 1 17b. Each stem section 1 16a, 1 16b
can be an elongated generally cylindrical cavity that extends from its respective bud section
1 17a,1 17b towards a bottom 106 of case 100. Each bud section 1 17a, 1 17b can be offset from its
respective stem section 1 16a, 116b and open at an upper surface 108 of housing 105.
Embodiments of the disclosure are not limited to any particular shape, configuration or number
of cavities 11 Oa, 11 Ob and in other embodiments cavities 11 Oa, 11 Ob can have different shapes to
accommodate different types of earbuds, different configurations and/or can be a single cavity or
more than two cavities.
[0101]     Case 100 further includes a lid 120 attached to housing 105. Lid 120 is operable
between a closed position where lid 120 is aligned over one or more cavities 1 Oa, 1 Ob fully
enclosing pair of earbuds 115 a, 1 15b within the housing, and an open position where the lid is
displaced from the housing and cavities 11 Oa, 11 Ob such that a user can remove the earbuds from
the cavities or replace the earbuds within the cavities. Lid 120 can be pivotably attached to
housing 105 and can include a magnetic or mechanical system (not shown in FIG. 1) that
provides lid 120 with a bi-stable operation, as described more fully below. In some
embodiments case 100 can also include a charging system 125 configured to charge pair of
earbuds 115 a, 1 15b; one or more magnets 130 configured to orient and retain the pair of earbuds
within one or more cavities 1 Oa, 1 Ob; and other features that are further described below.
[0102]     FIG. 2 is a simplified block diagram of system 200 according to an embodiment of the
present disclosure. System 200 can include pair of earbuds 202a, 202b, a case 204 for the pair of
earbuds, and a power source 205 for charging the case. Earbuds 202a, 202b can be positioned
within case 204 (e.g., within an interior space or cavity of the case defined by a housing or an
insert within the housing) where they can be conveniently stored and charged. Case 204 can be
                                                  18

1002035081
representative of case 100 and earbuds 202a, 202b can be representative of earbuds 1I5a, 115b
discussed above with respect to FIG. 1.
[0103]     Each earbud 202a, 202b can each have one or more inputs 255, internal components
260 and one or more outputs 265. In some embodiments one or more inputs 255 can be a
microphone input and one or more buttons or sensors that register a user's touch. In various
embodiments an accelerometer or a capacitive sensor can be used as an input 255 and can be
activated, for example, by a user to answer a call or command earbuds 202a, 202b to enter a
pairing mode that can be indicated by a light on either or both earbuds. In various embodiments
one or more internal components 260 can include a speaker, a microphone, a rechargeable
battery, a processor, and/or other circuitry and components. In various embodiments one or
more outputs 265 can be audio from a speaker, a light or other indicator. In some embodiments
the indicator light can indicate an incoming call, a battery charge level, a pairing mode or other
function.
[0104]     In some embodiments each of earbuds 202a, 202b can include a wireless radio that can
be both an input 255 and an output 265 device. The wireless radio can enable the earbuds to
receive an audio signal from an audio player, such as a smart phone. In some embodiments one
or more of earbuds 202a, 202b include a radio that can also transmit an audio signal such as a
microphone signal from one or more of the earbuds. In yet further embodiments, one or more of
earbuds 202a, 202b can include a radio that can transmit communication signals that can
command the receiving device (e.g., a host device such as a smartphone) to perform one or more
functions such as, but not limited to, connect a phone call, disconnect a phone call, pause audio
playback, fast forward or rewind audio playback or mute a microphone signal. The wireless
radio can employ any short range, low power communication protocol such as Bluetooth@, low
power Bluetooth@, or Zigbee among protocols.
[0105]     Case 204 can include a case processor 210, an earbud detector 215, radio 217, a lid
sensor 220, case charging circuitry 225, a battery 227 and earbud charging circuitry 230. Case
204 can also include an earbud interface 245 that enables circuitry within case 204 to
communicate with and/or charge earbuds 202a, 202b and power source interface 250 that
couples the case to wired or wireless power source 205, such as an AC or DC power source or an
inductive charging pad. In some embodiments, case charging circuitry 225, battery 227, earbud
                                                  19

1002035081
charging circuitry 230 and interfaces 245 and 250 are all representative components of charging
system 125 shown in Fig. 1.
[0106]     Power source interface 250 can be part of a receptacle connector for a micro USB
connector, a Lightening connector or other connector that can provide power to earbud case 204.
Alternatively, or in addition to a receptacle connector, power interface 250 can include a wireless
power receiver, such as one or more wireless power receiving coils, that can receive inductive
power from power source 205. Earbud interface 245 can transfer power and/or data between
case 204 and the earbuds via case transfer interface 270 in each earbud. Earbud interface 245
can include an electrical connector, such as one of the connectors described herein with respect
to FIGS. 4A-8C, a different type of electrical connector, or a wireless power transmitter, such as
a wireless power transmitting coil that can transmit inductive power to an inductive power
receiver within the earbuds.
[0107]     Case processor 210 can be configured to control various functions of case 204 as
described in more detail below. In some embodiments, earbud detector 215 includes one or
more sensors that detect when one or both of earbuds 202a, 202b are placed within case 204. In
one embodiment earbud detector 215 can be a circuit that periodically "pings" the earbud
contacts within case 204 to determine if either earbud 202a, 202b is present. In other
embodiments earbud detector 215 can be any type of mechanical or electrical sensor, such as, but
not limited to, a magnetic sensor, an optical sensor, a switch, a hall effect sensor, a flux sensor, a
capacitive sensor, a photodetector, a proximity detector, a momentary switch or any other type of
sensor.
[0108]     In embodiments where earbud detector 215 is a flux sensor, the flux sensor can be
beneficial to minimizing power consumption of case 204. As an example, a flux sensor can be
formed in case 204 for each earbud from a coil of wire and one or more magnets within earbuds
202a, 202b. Each flux sensor can be configured to generate a current in the coil of wire when an
earbud is inserted or withdrawn from case 204 and the magnet within the earbud passes through
the coil of wire. In a further example, a flux sensor can function as a completely passive sensor
that requires no power to operate, and generates its own energy to notify processor 210 of the
removal or replacement of either earbud 202a, 202b within case 204. In some embodiments a
hall effect sensor can also be beneficial to minimize power consumption. In various
                                                 20

1002035081
embodiments, one or more sensors can be beneficial so that a voltage bias (e.g., a ping) need not
be applied to the earbud connectors, thus mitigating contact corrosion and/or oxidation in moist
environments.
[0109]     In one example case 204 can include separate earbud receiving cavities within the case,
such as cavities 11 Oa, 11 Ob described above, and earbud detector 215 can include first and
second earbud detectors - one detector for each cavity. The first earbud detector can be
operatively coupled to detect when an earbud (e.g., a left earbud) is inserted within a first of the
cavities and the second earbud detector can be operatively coupled to detect when an earbud
(e.g., a right earbud) is inserted within the other cavity. In other embodiments a single detector
can detect when either earbud 202a, 202b is placed within case 204.
[0110]     In response to detecting the insertion of an earbud within the case, earbud detector 215
can generate a detect signal that can be sent to and processed by other circuitry within case 204
to initiate charging of the buds. When earbud detector 215 includes first and second detectors
that can detect the insertion of the left and right earbuds (or first and second earbuds that are
interchangeable between the left and right ears), respectively, each earbud detector can generate
a separate detect signal that can initiate charging of the detected earbud only.
[0111]     Similar to initiating charging, earbud detector 215 can also be used to stop charging.
For example, earbud detector 215 can detect when either or both of the earbuds are removed
from the case and generate a removal signal that stops the charging of the removed earbud or
earbuds.
[0112]     In some embodiments earbud detector 215 can initiate the charging process of each
earbud 202a, 202b when the earbud detector detects that electrical contact is made between the
earbuds and corresponding charging contacts within the housing (e.g., within each cavity 110a,
1 Ob). More specifically, in various embodiments earbud detector 215 can periodically "ping"
the charging contacts to see if either or both earbuds 202a, 202b are present within each cavity
1 Oa, 1 Ob. Even if either or both earbuds 202a, 202b have zero battery charge they can still
have a characteristic impedance or other electrical characteristic that enables earbud detector 215
to detect that they are connected to the charging contacts and initiate charging with earbud
charging circuitry 230. The charging contacts and electrical connection between earbuds 202a,
202b and case 204 will be discussed in detail below. In some embodiments earbud detector 215
                                                   21

1002035081
is part of processor 210 and the processor does the sensing. In other embodiments, earbud
detector 215 is separate active/passive components. In various embodiments, case 204 does not
include a case processor 210 and instead, circuitry comprising various active and/or passive
components is configured to perform the functions described herein and attributed to the
processor.
[0113]     In some embodiments case processor 210 can communicate with pair of earbuds 202a,
202b by sending and receiving data through earbud interface 245 (and through case interface of
either or both earbuds) and can communicate with power source 205 by sending and receiving
data through power source interface 250. That is, in various embodiments earbud interface 245
and power source interface 250 can be capable of carrying both power and data signals for single
or bidirectional communication. In some embodiments separate power and data contacts can be
used while in various embodiments one set of contacts is used for both power and data. For
example, in some embodiments power source 205 can be a computing device that communicates
with power source interface 250 through an interface (not shown), such as a USB interconnect or
a Lightning interconnect developed by Apple Inc. The interconnect can provide DC current to
case battery 227 for charging and can provide bidirectional communication between case
processor 210 and the computing device. In another example power source 205 can transmit
firmware updates to both case processor 210 and pair of earbuds 202a, 202b through the same
contacts that are used to charge the devices. Data communication between earbud interface 245
and pair of earbuds 202a, 202b can use a similar communication protocol as discussed above or
any other protocol such as, for example, serial communications.
[0114]     In some embodiments case 204 can include a wireless radio 217 that enables the case to
transmit and receive data communications with earbuds 202a, 202b and a host device (e.g., a
smartphone, a tablet computer, a laptop computer or the like) in addition to, or instead of, relying
on data exchange through interfaces 245 and 250. For example, wireless radio 217 can be used
to initiate a pairing sequence between earbuds 202a, 202b and a host device. In another example
radio 217 can be used to receive a music download from a host device to be stored in case 204.
[0115]     Lid sensor 220 can detect when a lid to the case (e.g., lid 120 shown in FIG. 1) is in the
open position and when the lid is in the closed position. In some embodiments case processor
210 is coupled to lid sensor 220 and receives signals from the lid sensor indicating when the lid
                                                 22

1002035081
is opened and closed. More specifically, in some embodiments lid sensor 220 can generate and
send an "open" signal to processor 210 upon detecting when the lid is opened, and lid sensor 220
can generate and send a "closed" signal to processor 210 upon detecting the closure of the lid.
Processor 210 can be configured to communicate with pair of earbuds 202a, 202b to turn ON
their wireless radios when the lid is in the open position (e.g., in response to receiving the "open"
signal) so they are ready for use by a user and turn OFF their wireless radios when the lid is in
the closed position (e.g., in response to receiving the "closed" signal) to conserve their power. In
various embodiments lid sensor 220 can also trigger case processor 210 to enter a pairing mode
when the case lid is opened, as explained in more detail below. In some embodiments case
processor 210 can communicate with pair of earbuds 202a, 202b through earbud interface 245
and case interface 270 using a wired connection as discussed above, while in other embodiments
case processor 210 can communicate with earbuds 202a, 202b through interfaces 245 and 270
wirelessly in addition to, or instead of, using a wired connection. In some embodiments lid
sensor 220 can be any type of mechanical or electrical switch including, but not limited to, a
momentary switch, a capacitive sensor, a magnetic sensor (e.g., hall effect) or an optical sensor.
[0116]     Case battery 227 provides power for the circuitry associated with case 204 and can be a
rechargeable battery that can be charged by power source 205 and enclosure charging circuitry
225 through power source interface 250. Case battery 227 is also coupled to earbud interface
245 and can charge pair of earbuds 202a, 202b in conjunction with earbud charging circuitry
230. In some embodiments earbud charging circuitry 230 can charge pair of earbuds 202a, 202b
anytime they are properly stored within cavities 1 Oa, 1 Ob even though case 204 is not coupled
to power source 205. Thus, case 204 can be capable of charging pair of earbuds 202a, 202b
while the case is, for example, in a user's pocket as long as case battery 227 has sufficient
charge. In various embodiments case battery 227 can be sealed within case 204, while in some
embodiments the case battery can be removable for servicing and/or replacement with another
charged battery. Case processor 210 can additionally be coupled to case charging circuitry 225
that can control the charging of case battery 227 (e.g., control the voltage and current supplied to
the battery to optimize the speed of charging and the life of the battery). In some embodiments
case charging circuitry 225 can include a DC/DC converter, an AC/DC converter, battery voltage
level monitoring circuitry and/or safety features to properly charge case battery 227.
                                                  23

1002035081
[0117]     Similarly, in some embodiments case processor 210 can be coupled to earbud charging
circuitry 230 that can control the charging of batteries within pair of earbuds 202a, 202b (e.g.,
control the voltage and current supplied to the batteries to optimize the speed of charging and the
life of the batteries) through earbud interface 245. In various embodiments earbud charging
circuitry 230 can include a DC/DC converter, battery voltage level monitoring circuitry and/or
safety features to properly charge earbud batteries.
[0118]     In various embodiments case 204 can include one or more charge indicators 235 that
can indicate a charge level of case battery 227 and/or the pair of earbud batteries such that a user
can see the indicators on an outer surface of case 100 (see FIG. 1). In some embodiments charge
indicators 235 can include three LEDs, one indicating the status for case battery 227 and one for
indicating the status of the battery in each of pair of earbuds 202a, 202b. In various
embodiments charge indicators 235 can be a first color (e.g., green) if the respective battery is
near full charge, a second color (e.g., amber) if the respective battery is less than 75 percent
charged and a third color (e.g., red) if there is no charge or limited charge. In some
embodiments, charge indicators 235 can include multiple LEDs for each of battery 227, earbud
115a and earbud 115b, where the number of LEDs lit indicate the strength of the battery for each
component. For example, in one particular instance three sets of three LEDs can be included on
case 204.
[0119]     In some embodiments case 204 can also include one or more user input devices 240.
Each included input device 240 can be a button or other type of input that, in response to being
activated by or otherwise receiving input from a user, generates a signal that can be
communicated to processor 210 or other circuitry within case 204. Processor 210, or the other
circuitry, can then act upon the signal. For example, in various embodiments the wireless radios
used by pair of earbuds 202a, 202b can be a Bluetooth@ or other radio system that requires a
pairing sequence to establish communication between the pair of earbuds and a wireless
transmitter in an electronic device. In such embodiments, if input device 240 is a wireless
pairing button, processor 210 can send a signal to the earbuds via earbud interface 245 to place
the wireless radios within pair of earbuds 202a, 202b into a pairing mode. More specifically, in
some embodiments the user can depress a pairing button located on case 204 that notifies case
processor 210 to instruct pair of earbuds 202a, 202b via interface 245 to enter a pairing mode. In
                                                   24

1002035081
some embodiments pair of earbuds 202a, 202b can be required to be within the case (e.g., within
cavities 110a, 1 Ob as shown in FIG. 1) while entering the pairing mode while in other
embodiments the earbuds may not need to be within case 204 and only need to be within
wireless communication range of the case. Further details with regard to wireless pairing will be
discussed later in the application.
[0120]     Now referring to FIG. 3, a simplified cross-sectional perspective view of case 100 is
illustrated. As shown in FIG. 3, case 100 includes housing 105 having cavities 110a, 1 Ob for
holding pair of earbuds 115a, 115b and various electronic circuitry. Case 100 further includes
lid 120 attached to housing 105 and operable between a closed position where lid 120 is aligned
over one or more cavities 1 Oa, 1 Ob fully enclosing pair of earbuds 115 a, 115b within housing
and an open position where the cavities 11 Oa, 11 Ob are exposed such that a user can remove or
replace the earbuds within the cavities.
[0121]     As discussed above, lid 120 can be pivotably attached to housing 105 with joint 305
enabling the lid to be operable between a closed position and an open position. In some
embodiments lid 120 can have a bi-stable position where it is stable in the closed and open
positions, but unstable between those positions such that it tends to be attracted to either the
closed or the open position. In various embodiments the bi-stable operation can be enabled by
employing a first pair of magnetic elements 31 Oa, 31 Ob and a second pair of magnetic elements
315a, 315b, as discussed in more detail below. In some embodiments a lid sensor 220 can be
disposed in housing 105 and configured to detect when lid 120 is in the closed position (e.g.,
when a detectable medium 320 is adjacent the lid sensor) and when the lid is in the open position
(e.g., when the detectable medium is not adjacent the lid sensor). In some embodiments the
detectable medium can be a magnetic material.
[0122]     Pair of earbuds 115 a, 115b can fit within cavities 1 Oa, 1 Ob each of which is sized and
shaped to accept one of the earbuds. In some embodiments, when each earbud is fully inserted
within its respective cavity 11 Oa, 11 Ob, a portion of each earbud extends out of the cavity
enabling a user to easily grab and remove the earbud from the case. Lid 120 can include a cavity
(or pair of cavities 360a, 360b as shown in FIG. 3) into which the portion of each earbud that
extends out of its respective cavity 1 Oa, 1 Ob, extents into. While not shown in FIG. 3, each
                                                   25

1002035081
cavity 360a, 360b can be sized and shaped to match the size and shape of the portion of each
earbud the cavity surrounds to more securely store the earbuds within case 100.
[0123]     Each earbud can include a speaker assembly (not shown in FIG. 3) disposed within a
housing of the earbud. The speaker assembly can include a driver unit aligned to emit sound
from the directional sound port. The driver unit can include an electromagnetic voice coil, a
speaker diaphragm and a driver magnet (shown in FIG. 3 as magnet 325) operatively coupled to
the voice coil to move the diaphragm in response to electrical signals and produce sound. In
addition to the driver magnet, earbuds according to some embodiments of the disclosure can
include an additional magnetic plate 330 that is not operatively coupled to the voice coil. Either
or both of magnet 325 and magnetic plate 330 can be attracted to at least one housing magnetic
component 130 disposed within case 100. The attraction can be strong enough to magnetically
secure first earbud 115a into first cavity 110a and second earbud 115b into second cavity 110b,
as discussed in more detail below. In some embodiments magnetic plate 330 can be made from a
magnetic material and in various embodiments it can be made with a metal injection molding
process. In some embodiments magnetic plate 330 is magnetized while in other embodiments it
is not magnetized but is magnetically attractable.
[0124]     To increase the magnetic attraction between magnetic component 130 and magnetic
plate 330, the magnetic plate 330 in each earbud can be positioned direction adjacent to the
earbud housing. Additionally, the magnetic plate be contoured to match the curvature of the
housing thereby ensuring a minimum distance between the magnetic plate and the housing across
the surface are of the magnetic plate. Similarly, at least some or the housing magnetic
components 130 can be disposed as close as possible to the surface of the receiving cavity at a
location that is spaced directly apart from where the magnetic plate 330 will be when an earbud
is received within the cavity. In some embodiments the housing components 130 can be
contoured to match the curvature of the receiving area (which matches the curvature of its
respective earbud) to minimize the distance between the housing magnetic component 130 and
the magnetic plate 330.
[0125]     In some embodiments housing 105 and lid 120 can be made from the same material
while in various embodiments they can be made from different materials. In some embodiments
                                                 26

1002035081
both housing 105 and/or lid 120 can be made from a plastic material, stainless steel, aluminum or
any other material.
[0126]     Charging system 125 can include a circuit board 335 or other electrical routing
structure, a rechargeable case battery 227, electrical interconnects 340 to pair of earbuds 115a,
115b, one or more electronic components, such as case processor 210, and an electrical
connector 345 for connecting to power source 205 (see FIG. 2). In some embodiments connector
345 can, for example, be a non-proprietary interface such as a USB connector or can be a
proprietary interface such as the Lightning connector developed by Apple Inc. In various
embodiments connector 345 can be liquid-tight, as discussed in more detail below. One or more
charge indicators 235 can be visible on an exterior surface 350 of case 100. In some
embodiments each earbud in pair of earbuds 115a, 115b can be electrically coupled to charging
system 125 by a connector 347 disposed at an end of a stem portion of each earbuds 115 a, 115b,
as discussed in more detail below.
EARBUD CONNECTORS
[0127]     FIGS. 4A-8C illustrate several examples of electrical connectors that can be used
between each individual earbud in pair of earbuds 115a, 115b and case 100 (see FIG. 3), similar
to connector 347 in FIG. 3. While each of FIGS. 4A-8C illustrate an earbud connector for a first
earbud 115a, it is to be understood that second earbud 115b can be configured identical to first
earbud 115a and thus include a similar electrical connector. Additionally, while the
embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 4A-8C include external contacts that are disposed at the end of
a stem of the earbud, the contacts can be at different locations in other embodiments.
[0128]     FIGS. 4A and 4B are simplified cross-sectional views of an electrical connector 400
that can be incorporated into earbud case 100 and an electrical connector 405 at the end of a stem
portion of an earbud 115a according to an embodiment of the disclosure. Electrical connector
405 can be used to conduct power and/or data according to some embodiments of the disclosure.
Connector 405 can be part of an earbud interface and can include first and second earbud
contacts 410, 415, respectively. A bottom view of electrical connector 405 is illustrated in FIG.
4B. In some embodiments, earbud contacts 410, 415 can be annular and separated by an
insulator 420. Receptacle connector 400 can be used in a case such as case 100 illustrated above
and can have a first earbud case contact 425 and a second earbud case contact 430. First annular
                                                 27

1002035081
contact 410 can interface with first earbud contact 425 and second annular contact 415 can
interface with second earbud contact 430. First and second annular contacts 410, 415 can be any
type of conductive material including gold, silver or palladium plated copper.
[0129]     In some embodiments first and second earbud contacts 410, 415, respectively are power
and ground contacts. That is, either of first and second earbud contacts 410, 415, respectively
can be used for power while the other can be used for ground. As examples, in some
embodiments first contact 410 is used for power and second contact 415 is ground while in other
embodiments first contact 410 is used for ground and second contact 415 is used for power. In
various embodiments other connector configurations can be used that have more than two
contacts.
[0130]     First and second earbud case contacts 425, 430 can be coupled to charging system 125
(see FIG. 3) with electrical interconnects 340 in case 100 to facilitate charging and
communication of each earbud 115 a, 1 15b. In various embodiments a circular microphone
aperture 435 can be located in the center of second annular contact 415 of each earbud 115a,
11 5b to facilitate two way telephonic communication and/or noise cancellation. Microphone
aperture 435 can be covered by an aesthetic acoustic mesh to protect the microphone from debris
and damage.
[0131]     FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate another example receptacle connector 500 that can be
incorporated into earbud case 100 and an electrical connector 505 at the end of a stem portion of
an earbud 115a according to an embodiment of the disclosure. Connector 500 has one annular
contact and one center contact, however, as described in more detail below. Connector 505 can
be part of an earbud interface and can include first and second earbud contacts 510, 515,
respectively. A bottom view of electrical connector 505 is illustrated in FIG. 5B. In some
embodiments, ring contact 510 can be ring shaped and circular contact 515 can be circular with
the contacts separated by an insulator 520 (e.g., insulator 520 can be an air gap). Ring contact
510 can interface with first earbud contact 525 and circular contact 515 can interface with second
earbud contact 530. In various embodiments a circular microphone aperture 535 can be located
between ring contact 510 and circular contact 515 so one or more of pair of earbuds 1 15a, 1 15b
can be used for two way telephonic communication.
                                                 28

1002035081
[0132]     FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate another example receptacle connector 600 that can be
incorporated into earbud case 100 and an electrical earbud connector 605 disposed at the end of a
stem portion of an earbud 115a according to an embodiment of the disclosure. Receptacle
connector 600 can make electrical contact with electrical earbud connector 605 as described in
more detail below. Earbud connector 605 can be part of an earbud interface and can include first
and second earbud contacts 610, 615, respectively. A bottom view of electrical earbud connector
605 is illustrated in FIG. 6B. As shown in FIG. 6B, contacts 610, 615 can be spaced from each
other in an oppositional and symmetrical relationship. In some embodiments, each of earbud
contacts 610 and 615 can have a partial annular shape (i.e., a partial ring) with the open portions
of each contact facing the other. For example, contact 610 can include ends 61 Oa, 61 Ob and
contact 615 can include ends 615a, 615b where end 610a is spaced apart from end 615a and end
610b is spaced apart from end 615b. While FIG. 6B illustrates each of contacts 610, 615 as half
rings, in other embodiments the contacts can include shorter length arcs and/or have different
opposing shapes altogether.
[0133]     Earbud contacts 610, 615 can be separated from each other by an insulator 620 (e.g.,
insulator 620 can be a dielectric material as discussed in more detail below). Earbud contact 610
can interface with first earbud case contact 625 and earbud contact 615 can interface with second
earbud case contact 630. In various embodiments a circular microphone aperture 635 can be
located between earbud contacts 610 and 615 enabling pair of earbuds 115a, 1 15b to be used for
two way telephonic communication. Receptacle connector 600 can include a contact carrier 640
that retains earbud case contacts 625, 630 as described in more detail below. In some
embodiments, contact carrier 640 can make earbud receptacle cavity 645 liquid-tight.
[0134]     In some embodiments, each of the first and second earbud contacts 610, 615,
respectively, can include a contact portion that extends into an earbud receiving cavity of the
earbud case when the earbud is positioned within the cavity. Receptacle connector 600 can
include a pair of earbud case contacts 625, 630 that are positioned on opposite sides of and
extend into the earbud receiving cavity. Earbud case contacts 625, 630 can be held within
receiving slots 628, 633 of a contact carrier 640 as discussed further below. The contact portion
of each earbud contact 610, 615 can have an arcuate cross-section that makes contact with
arcuate contact portions 626, 631 of contacts 625, 630 respectively, during a mating event when
                                                 29

1002035081
the earbud is inserted into the earbud receiving cavity. The combination of arcuate surfaces on
the earbud contact and earbud case contact enable a contact wiping motion each time the earbuds
are inserted within and drawn out of the receptacle connector, creating a reliable interconnect. In
FIG. 6A, contacts 625, 630 are illustrated in a deflected state that illustrates their approximate
position when earbud 115a is fully inserted into its receiving cavity such that the earbud contact
is engaged with the earbud case connector.
[0135]     The same contacts 625, 630 are also illustrated in FIG. 6A in a non-deflected state 627,
632 showing the contacts extending into the earbud receiving cavity prior to being mated with
the earbud contacts of earbud 115a. During a mating event, as earbud 115a is inserted deeper
into the earbud receiving cavity, the earbud case contacts 625, 630 come in contact with the
earbud contacts and deflect outward. The exterior contacting surfaces of the earbud contacts and
earbud case contacts rub against each other during both the mating event and during a de-mating
event when the earbud 115a is withdrawn from the earbud receiving cavity. In various
embodiments the deflecting arcuate portions 626, 631 of contacts 625, 630 respectively, are
deflected by arcuate portions of first and second earbud contacts 610, 615, respectively during
insertion and withdrawal of the first and second earbuds. Since the arcuate portions are in direct
contact and contacts 625, 630 are in a deflected (e.g., spring loaded state), pair of earbuds 115a,
115b has a vertical (e.g., ejecting) force applied to them when fully mated with the case. In some
embodiments, as discussed in more detail herein, one or more magnets can be used to overcome
the vertical force and hold the earbuds within their respective cavities.
[0136]     In some embodiments one of contacts 625, 630 can be arranged to make contact with
the earbud contacts 610, 615, first by preloading one of contacts 625, 630 at a different height
than the other (e.g., sequential contacts). This can be useful in some embodiments to make a
ground connection to the earbud first before making an active electrical connection with it. The
wiping contacts and the sequentially contacting contacts can be used in any of the connector
embodiments disclosed herein.
[0137]     In various embodiments contact carrier 640 can include a debris recess 609 disposed
below the contact interface region. Debris recess 609 can have a cup-like shape defined by
sidewalls 609a and can be useful for providing a location for debris that falls into either earbud
cavity. Debris recess 609 can be disposed between earbud case contact receiving slots 628, 633
                                                  30

1002035081
and spaced apart from the contact area so the debris does not interfere with the earbuds making
electrical contact with receptacle connector 600. Debris recess 609 can further be open to the
earbud receiving cavity so that debris can be periodically cleaned out as needed. In some
embodiments a separate debris recess 609 is disposed under each earbud contact area while in
other embodiments a single debris recess can be sufficiently wide to capture debris from both
contact areas.
[0138]     Debris recess 609, or a similar debris capture structure, can be included in any of the
connector embodiments disclosed herein. In one embodiment debris recess 609 has a depth
below arcuate portions 626, 631 of contacts 625, 630 that is 50 percent or more than a diameter
of debris recess 609. In another embodiment debris recess 609 has a depth that is 75 percent or
more than the diameter of debris recess 609 while in another embodiment its depth is 100 percent
(e.g., having a depth to diameter ratio of 1:1) or more of the diameter.
[0139]     In some embodiments contacts 625, can be made out of a copper, nickel and silver
alloy while in other embodiments they can be made out of a phosphor and bronze alloy, and in
other embodiments a different alloy can be used.
[0140]     Now referring to FIG. 6C an exploded view of receptacle connector 600 is shown. As
shown in FIG. 6C, connector 600 includes first and second shells 650, 655 that define receiving
cavities for a pair of earbuds retaining and guiding a stem portion of each earbud into case 100
(see FIG. 1). While not shown in FIG. 6C, the receiving cavity in each shell can include an
elongated tube portion that opens to a larger earbud receiving opening. The elongated tube
portion can be sized and shaped to accommodate the stem section of an earbud and the larger
earbud receiving opening can be sized and shaped to partially or fully accommodate the ear
interface portion (i.e., the portion of the earbud that fits within a user's ear).
[0141]     In some embodiments shells 650, 655 can be separate components joined together by
the contact carrier while in other embodiments shells 650, 655 can be a single component that
can be formed, for example, in a molding process, a 3D printing process or with a milling
process. Contact carrier 640 holds first and second earbud contacts 625, 630, respectively, that
can interface with a first earbud, and also holds third and fourth earbud contacts 660, 665,
respectively, that can interface with a second earbud. A collar 670 can be bonded to a top
surface 675 of contact carrier 640. In some embodiments collar 670 can have a removable tie
                                                   31

1002035081
bar (not shown in FIG. 6C) that holds the three pieces of the collar together during assembly and
that can then be removed after assembly such that the tie bar is not included within a finished
earbud case.
[0142]     Distal ends 680, 685 of first and second shells 650, 655, respectively, can be narrower
than the elongated tube portion of shell 650, 655, and each distal end 680, 685 can be fit within
and bonded to collar 670 forming a completed shell and receptacle connector assembly 690,
illustrated in FIG. 6D. In the completed assembly, each earbud case contact 625, 630 fits within
a respective contact opening of shell 650 and each earbud case contact 625, 630 fits within a
respective contact opening (e.g., opening 687 visible in FIG. 6C) of shell 655. Each contact
opening (e.g., opening 687) enables its respective contact to extend into the earbud receiving
cavity within its respective shell 650, 655 to make electrical contact with an earbud contact
during a mating event. When assembled, shell and contact assembly 690 can create a liquid-tight
seal as defined herein. Shell and contact assembly 690 can subsequently be assembled into a
case, such as case 100 illustrated in FIG. 1. In some embodiments first and second shells 650,
655 can be a single shell having two cavities, one cavity for each earbud.
[0143]     As defined herein, a liquid-tight seal shall mean a seal that conforms to one or more of
the following ratings as defined by the International Protection Rating and International
Electrochemical Commission (IEC) 60529 that can also be known as the I.P.68 rating. In some
embodiments the liquid-tight seal will protect the connector assembly against the harmful ingress
of water and have a "liquid ingress" rating between 1 (dripping water) and 8 ( immersion beyond
1 meter). In various embodiments the liquid-tight seal shall be rated between 1 (dripping water)
and 4 (splashing water) while in some embodiments the liquid-tight seal shall be rated between 2
(dripping water with device tilted at 15 degrees) and 5 (water jet). In various embodiments the
liquid-tight seal shall be rated between 3 (spraying water) and 6 (powerful water jets) while in
some embodiments the liquid-tight seal shall be rated between 4 (splashing water) and 7
(immersion up to 1 meter). In various embodiments the liquid-tight seal shall be rated between 5
(water jets) and 8 (immersion beyond 1 meter) while in some embodiments liquid-tight shall
mean the seal will protect the electronic device against liquid ingress up to 100 feet for 30
minutes.
                                                   32

1002035081
[0144]     Now referring to FIGS. 7A and 7B another example of a receptacle connector 700 is
illustrated that is similar to connector 600 illustrated in FIGS. 6A and 6B. Receptacle connector
700 has a different configuration for the contacts and the contact carrier, however, as described
in more detail below. This embodiment can use the same earbud connector shown in FIGS. 6A
and 6B, where the earbud contacts are semicircular and separated by an insulator.
[0145]     A contact carrier 740 holds first and second earbud contacts 725, 730, respectively, that
can interface with a first earbud, and also holds third and fourth earbud contacts 760, 765,
respectively, that can interface with a second earbud. A cap 770 can be bonded to a bottom
surface 775 of contact carrier 740 with a layer of adhesive 773. As illustrated in FIG. 7B, distal
ends of first and second shells 750, 755, respectively, can be fit within and bonded to contact
carrier 740 forming a completed shell and receptacle connector assembly 790. Shell and contact
assembly 790 can be liquid-tight, meeting one or more of the ranges as defined herein. Shell and
contact assembly 790 can subsequently be assembled into a case, such as case 100 illustrated in
FIG. 1.
[0146]     Similar to contact carrier 640, first and second earbud contacts can have an arcuate
cross-section and can make contact with arcuate portions of receptacle connector contacts 725,
730. The combination of arcuate surfaces can enable a wiping motion each time the earbuds are
inserted within and drawn out of the receptacle connector, creating a reliable interconnect.
Further, in some embodiments one contact can be arranged to make contact with the earbud first.
In one example the contacts can be preloaded at different heights. This can be useful in some
embodiments to ground the earbud first before making an active electrical connection with it.
[0147]     Now referring to FIGS. 8A and 8B another example of a receptacle connector 800 is
illustrated that is similar to connector 400 illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B. Receptacle connector
800 has a different configuration for the inner and outer contacts, however, as described in more
detail below.
[0148]     In some embodiments, earbud contacts 810, 815 can be annular and separated by an
electrical insulator 820. First annular contact 810 can interface with first earbud contact 825 and
second annular contact 815 can interface with second earbud contact 830. First and second
annular contacts 810, 815 can be formed from any type of conductive material including copper
and copper alloys and can be plated with any metal. In various embodiments a circular
                                                   33

1002035081
microphone aperture 835 can be located in the center of second annular contact 815 so one or
more of pair of earbuds 115 a, 1 15b (see FIG. 1) can be used for two way telephonic
communication. Microphone aperture 835 can be covered by an aesthetic acoustic mesh to
protect the microphone from debris and damage.
[0149]     Similar to contact carrier 640, first and second earbud contacts can have an arcuate
cross-section and can make contact with arcuate portions of contacts 825, 830 respectively in
receptacle connector 800. The combination of arcuate surfaces can enable a wiping motion each
time the earbuds are inserted within and drawn out of the receptacle connector, creating a reliable
interconnect. Additionally, as shown in FIG. 8A, in some embodiments an exterior surface 821
of the earbud stem can be flush with an exterior side surface of the earbud contacts. Further, in
some embodiments one contact can be arranged to make contact with the earbud first. In one
example the contacts can be preloaded at different heights. This can be useful in some
embodiments to ground the earbud first before making an active electrical connection with it.
[0150]     Now referring to FIG. 8C an exploded view of receptacle connector 800 is shown
illustrating how it can be coupled to first and second shells 850, 855 that retain and guide a stem
portion of each earbud into case 100 (see FIG. 1). Contact carrier 840 holds first and second
earbud contacts 825, 830, respectively, that can be used with a first earbud, and also holds third
and fourth earbud contacts that can be used with a second earbud. Contact carrier 840 can be
bonded to distal ends 880, 885 of first and second shells 850, 855, respectively, forming a
completed shell and receptacle connector assembly. Shell and contact assembly can create a
liquid-tight seal as defined herein. Shell and contact assembly 690 can subsequently be
assembled into a case, such as case 100 illustrated in FIG. 1. In some embodiments first and
second shells 850, 855 can be a single shell having two cavities, one cavity for each earbud.
[0151]     In some embodiments the electrical connector (for example connector 405 in FIG. 4A)
on pair of earbuds 115 a, 11 5b may not be an annular (e.g., ring shaped) external contact-type
connector and can be any other type of electrical connector, such as, but not limited to a pin and
socket, a pin and contact pad or a wiping arm and contact pad. In various embodiments one or
more contact pads can be located on a vertical portion of the stem portion of the pair of earbuds
and a wiping arm can interface with them. In another example an interface connector can be
disposed on the ear portion of the earbud housing. A mating connector can be disposed within
                                                   34

1002035081
the case and can interface with the connector when the earbud is placed in its respective cavity.
In some embodiments such a connector can be gold plated to minimize corrosion that can occur
as a result of being in contact with a user's ear for extended periods of time. In yet further
examples wireless inductive charging of the earbuds can be used.
MAGNETIC RETENTION OF EARBUDS
[0152]     FIGS. 9A and 9B illustrate front and rear perspective views, respectively, of one of
wireless earbuds 115a, 115b. As shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B, earbuds 115a, 115b include an
external housing having an ear interface portion 903 and a stem portion 910. Ear interface
portion 903 can be formed to fit at least partially within a user's ear and can be non-occluding, as
discussed in more detail herein. An aesthetic acoustic mesh 915 can fit on ear interface portion
903 and allow sound to travel from an internal speaker to a user's ear. Some embodiments can
have one or more user inputs 955 that can be used to answer a call, pause or mute playback, or
perform other functions. The outer housing for pair of earbuds 115 a, 115b can be made from a
plastic material including, but not limited to, ABS or a polycarbonate.
[0153]     Now referring to FIG. 10, a top view of housing 105 (see FIG. 1) of case 100 for pair of
earbuds 115a, 115b is illustrated. As shown in FIG. 10, housing 105 can include multiple
retention magnets 905a-905h for the earbuds and one or more sensors. Earbuds 115a, 115b can
be inserted in cavities 110a, 1 Ob and retained in the cavities by the retention magnets 905a
905h. Each cavity 110a, 1 Ob can include a stem section 116a, 116b and a bud section 117a,
117b. Earbud retention magnets 905a-905d are used to retain first earbud 115a and retention
magnets 905e-905h are used to retain second earbud 115b. However, in other embodiments
fewer or additional retention magnets 905a-905h can be used and the magnets can vary in
geometry, size and placement from those depicted.
[0154]     Lid sensor 220 can be used to detect whether lid 120 (see FIG. 1) is closed or open. In
the embodiments illustrated in FIG. 10, lid sensor 220 is disposed between cavities 1 Oa, 1 Ob,
but the lid sensor can be located differently in other embodiments. Lid magnets 910a, 910b can
be used for operating the lid (not shown in FIG. 10), as discussed in more detail below, and in
some cases can increase the strength of retention magnets 905a-h, as also discussed in more
detail below. Cross-sectional view A-A is shown in FIG. 11 and illustrates a side view of how
earbud 115 a can be oriented relative to the magnets discussed above.
                                                   35

1002035081
[0155]     FIG. 11 illustrates a cross-sectional view of earbud 115 a in case 100. As shown in FIG.
11, earbud 115 a is secured within cavity 11 0a in housing 105. In some embodiments earbud
115a can have a speaker magnet 325 and/or a magnetic plate 330 positioned to align with earbud
retention magnets 905f and 905h. Speaker magnet 325 and/or magnetic plate 330 can be
attracted to one or more earbud retention magnets 905f and 905h and one or both can include a
magnetic material.
[0156]     As defined herein, a magnetic material is any material that is capable of being attracted
by or acquiring the properties of a magnet to attract magnetic materials. This includes
ferromagnets (i.e., magnets including iron) as well as non-ferrous magnets. Some example
magnetic materials are, but are not limited to: neodymium, steel, nickel, cobalt, and alnico, an
aluminum-nickel-cobalt alloy, some alloys of rare earth metals, and some naturally occurring
minerals such as lodestone. In comparison, a magnet is a magnetic material that is magnetized
so it attracts a magnetic material.
[0157]     In one embodiment magnetic plate 330 can include a magnetic material and magnets
905f and 905h can be oriented and positioned to be within a distance to attract the magnetic plate
with sufficient force to retain earbud 115a in housing 105 even if the housing is inverted or
shaken. However, the strength of retention magnets 905f, 905h can be selected to allow a user to
grasp earbud 115 a with their fingers and remove it from housing 105 by applying a force greater
than the force of magnetic retention. In further embodiments one or more of retention magnets
905f, 905h can be positioned and oriented to attract speaker magnet 325 which can assist with
attracting earbud 115a into housing 105 and retaining it. In other embodiments, an earbud
ejection mechanism can be included in the case. For example, a mechanical ejector that pushes
the earbuds out when the lid is opened (or when an ejection button is pushed).
[0158]     In some embodiments additional magnets such as those depicted in FIG. 10 can be used
to augment the attraction and retention forces imparted on magnetic plate 330 and/or speaker
magnet 325. More specifically, lid magnet 910b can be used to attract lid 120 (or a magnetic
material 1105 disposed within the lid) and can also be used as a part of a Halbach array to
augment the magnetic field of earbud retention magnets 905 to attract earbud 115a from a greater
distance and to retain it more securely. A Halbach array is a special arrangement of permanent
magnets that augments the magnetic field on one side of the magnetic array while cancelling the
                                                   36

1002035081
field to near zero on the other side. Retention magnets 905e, 905f and 905g (see FIG. 10) can
also be used as a part of the Halbach array.
[0159]     Now referring to FIG. 12, a cross-sectional view B-B of housing 105 is shown from
FIG. 10. As shown in FIG. 12 three earbud retention magnets 905e, 905f and 905g are disposed
within housing 105 to secure earbud 115a within its cavity. In some embodiments, magnets
905g and 905e can have an angled upper surface to partially conform to the circular shape of ear
interface portion 805 of earbud 115a. Any configuration or arrangement of magnets can be used
to attract speaker magnet 325 and/or magnetic plate 330. In some embodiments a carrier 920 can
be formed to retain and position one or more of retention magnets 905a-905h.
[0160]     Also, as described above with respect to FIG. 3, the magnetic plate 330 in each earbud
can be positioned direction adjacent to the earbud housing and be contoured to match the
curvature of the housing (as shown in FIGS. 11 and 12) to ensure a minimum distance between
the magnetic plate and the housing across the surface are of the magnetic plate and increase the
magnetic attraction between the housing magnetic components and magnetic plate 330 using
minimal magnetic material. Similarly, some or all of the housing magnetic components 905a
905h can be disposed as close as possible to an appropriate surface of the earbud case and
contoured in shape to match the surface.
MAGNETICALLY ACTUATED CASE
[0161]     FIGS. 13-21 illustrate case 1300 having a lid with a magnetically actuated over center
position and several example magnet geometries. As shown in FIG. 13, case 1300 can be similar
to case 100 illustrated in FIG. 1 and used to retain a pair of earbuds, however case 1300 can be
used for myriad other purposes such as, for example, but not limited to, a container for storing
medicine, a container for storing cigars or a recharging container for a miniature portable media
player.
[0162]     Now referring simultaneously to FIGS. 13 and 14, in some embodiments case 1300 can
include a housing 1305 having a receiving opening 1301, a bottom face 1302 disposed opposite
of the receiving opening. Similar to the cases discussed above, case 1300 can have a closed
position, illustrated in FIG. 13 where a housing 1305 is covered by a lid 1310 that is pivotally
coupled to the housing. Case 1300 can also have an open position, illustrated in FIG. 14 where
                                                  37

1002035081
lid 1310 is pivotally displaced from housing 1305 by an angle theta. Case 1300 can further
include an upper wall 1303 opposite a lower wall 1304 and a first sidewall 1306 opposite a
second sidewall 1307 where the walls extend between receiving opening 1301 and bottom face
1302 defining a cavity 1308 that communicates with receiving opening 1301. Receiving opening
1301 can be further defined by four wall ends 1309a, 1309b, 1309c and 1309d including ends of
upper wall 1303, lower wall 1304, first sidewall 1306 and second sidewall 1307, respectively.
[0163]     A first pair of magnetic elements 1315a, 1315b can be oriented such that they repel one
another and are disposed proximate pivotable joint 1317 with first magnetic element 1315a of the
first pair disposed within housing 1305 and a second magnetic element 1315b of the first pair
disposed within lid 1310. In some embodiments first pair of magnetic elements 1315a, 1315b can
both be magnets. A second pair of magnetic elements 1320a, 1320b are oriented such that they
attract one another and are disposed proximate to a wall end 1309a opposite pivotable joint 1317
with a first magnetic element 1320a of the second pair of magnetic elements disposed within
housing 1305 and a second magnetic element 1320b of the second pair of magnetic elements
disposed within lid 1310. In some embodiments both magnetic elements 1320a, 1320b can be
magnets while in another embodiment one of the magnetic elements can be a magnet while the
other element is a magnetic material.
[0164]     In some embodiments case 1300 can be configured to create an over center
configuration for lid 1310 where the lid is in a first stable position when in the closed position
(illustrated in FIG. 13) and is in a second stable position when in the open position (illustrated in
FIG. 14), but is in an unstable position in-between the closed position and the open position. In
some embodiments this can be achieved by the attractive forces between second pair of magnetic
elements 1320a, 1320b over powering the repulsive forces of first pair of magnetic elements
1315a, 1315b when lid 1310 is transitioned from the open position to the closed position. This
condition can be explained graphically as illustrated in FIG. 15.
[0165]     In some embodiments any of the magnetic arrangements disclosed herein can be
arranged in a multipole configuration to concentrate the magnetic field within and between the
magnets. In some embodiments a multipole can be used for magnetic elements 1320a and 1320b
where 1320a has a north end adjacent a south end and 1320b has a south end that attracts to
1320a's north end, and has a north end that attracts to 1320a's south end. In other embodiments
                                                  38

1002035081
any other arrangement can be used. A multipole arrangement can be beneficial to attenuate
magnetic fields outside of the case so they don't negatively interact with other magnetic objects
such as cards with magnetic strips on them.
[0166]      FIG. 15 illustrates a graph of the magnetic forces on lid 1310. As shown in FIG. 13, lid
1310 has an over center position due to forces imparted on it from two pairs of magnetic
elements. As discussed above, first pair of magnetic elements 1315a, 1315b (see FIGS. 13 and
14) are oriented to have repulsive forces which are shown as the line on the graph labeled
FRepulsion.  Similarly, second pair of magnetic elements 1320a, 1320b are oriented to have
attractive forces which are shown as the line on the graph labeled FAttraction. From examination
of FIG. 14 it can be seen than an angle of theta       = 0' is when lid 1310 is closed and an angle of
theta  =  180' is when the lid is fully open (e.g., pivotally displaced from housing 1305 to its
maximum extent). At some angle labeled X is an over center position for lid 1310 where it is
unstable and it will "automatically" (i.e., through magnetic attraction) move either towards the
closed position or the open position.
[0167]      Continuing to refer to FIG. 15, at an angle of 0' lid 1310 is closed and the attractive
forces   (FAttraction) of second pair of magnetic elements 1320a, 1320b are greater than the repulsive
forces   (FRepulsion)  of first pair of magnetic elements 1315a, 1315b so the lid is secured in the
closed position. In some embodiments, even if first pair of magnetic elements 1315a, 1315b and
second pair of magnetic elements 1320a, 1320b have the same strength, the over center design
will work since the leverage the first pair of magnetic elements has on the pivotable joint is less
than the leverage the second pair of magnetic elements has on the pivotable joint. More
specifically, since first pair of magnetic elements 1315a, 1315b are closer to the pivotable joint it
will apply less torque to lid 1310 than second pair of magnetic elements 1320a, 1320b.
[0168]      However, as lid 1310 transitions to greater angles of theta (i.e., when transitioning to an
open position), second pair of magnetic elements 1320a, 1320b moves apart from one another
faster than first pair of magnetic elements 1315a, 1315b. Since magnetic forces vary
exponentially with distance, the FAttraction falls much faster than FRepulsion, therefore at some angle
of X0 the   FRepulsion  overcomes the FAttraction and the lid will be attracted to the open position.
When transitioning from the open position to the closed position the reverse happens and after
the over center point is reached the lid will be attracted to the closed position.
                                                       39

1002035081
[0169]     In some embodiments first pair of magnetic elements 1315a, 1315b can be configured
to stop lid 1310 from fully opening (i.e., where theta is 180'). In some embodiments first pair of
magnets 1315a, 1315b can be configured to be repulsive, therefore in such embodiments the
magnetic elements could be elongated such that when lid 1310 rotates close to the 1800 open
position first pair of magnetic elements 1315a, 1315b repel each other such that the weight of the
lid is supported by their repulsive force and the lid is essentially suspended in a semi-open
position. Some shapes of magnets such as an "L" can be used to enhance the forces to support
lid 1310 in a semi-open position. In various embodiments the force vector of first pair of
magnetic elements 1315a, 1315b can be adjusted to increase or decrease this effect, as discussed
in more detail below.
[0170]     In some embodiments case 1300 can be designed to have a particular feel for a user.
For example, in one embodiment case 1300 can be designed so a user can hold case 1300 in their
hand in the closed position and by snapping their wrist lid 1310 will snap open and remain in the
open position without resting against 1305. In further embodiments lid 1310 can be in the open
position and the user can snap their wrist and close the lid. In further embodiments a user can
use their hand to try to open lid 1310 and once the lid has been moved a certain distance the lid
will snap or spring open. In further embodiments a user can grasp lid 1310 and move it towards
the closed position and at a certain distance the lid will snap or spring closed.
[0171]     Now referring to FIG. 16 another embodiment of a case 1600 with a magnetically
actuated lid 1604 is illustrated. As shown in FIG. 16, case 1600 has one pair of magnetic
elements having misaligned poles (i.e., force vectors) and another pair of magnetic elements
having a high permeability material used to increase magnetic forces. Similar to previous
embodiments, lid 1604 is pivotally attached to housing 1603. However, in this case first pair of
magnetic elements 1605a, 1605b are oriented so the force vectors are not directly aligned as
illustrated by the arrows. In this scenario, lid 1604 can still have an over center position,
however the    FRepulsion from first pair of magnetic elements 1605a, 1605b will be less than the
scenario illustrated in FIG. 13. However, one feature of such a misalignment of force vectors
can be used to resist lid 1604 from transitioning to a 1800 fully open position. More specifically,
magnetic forces from first pair of magnetic elements 1605a, 1605b can resist lid 1604 from going
to the closed position, but can also resist lid from going to the 1800 open position. Other
                                                    40

1002035081
variations of misaligned magnetic force vectors can be used and are within the scope of this
disclosure.
[0172]     Continuing to refer to FIG. 16, second pair of magnetic elements 1610a, 1610b can
have a high permeability material 1615a, 1615b at least partially surrounding them to increase
the forces of attraction between the second pair of magnetic elements. A high permeability
material as discussed herein can be any material with a relatively high permeability. The
permeability of a material is the measure of the material's ability to support the formation of a
magnetic field within itself. More specifically, it is the degree of magnetization that a material
obtains in response to an applied magnetic field. Thus, the more "magnetically conductive", or
the less resistant a material is to magnetic fields, the higher its permeability. Following this
behavior, high permeability material 1615a, 1615b as discussed herein can essentially re-direct
the magnetic fields from second pair of magnetic elements 161 0a, 161 Ob so the attractive forces
are increased. High permeability materials can also be used on repulsive magnets, lid magnets or
magnets used to attract and secure earbuds within the case.
[0173]     FIG. 17 illustrates another embodiment of a case 1700. As shown in FIG. 17, case
1700 has springs attached to the first and second pairs of magnetic elements to change the over
center behavior of the lid. Case 1700 can have a first pair of magnetic elements 1705a, 1705b
configured to be repulsive and a second pair of magnetic elements 171 0a, 171 Ob configured to
attract. However, in this embodiment springs 1707a, 1707b can be attached to first pair of
magnetic elements 1705a, 1705b and springs 1717a, 1717b can be attached to second pair of
magnetic elements 1710a, 17 1Ob. Springs 1707a, 1707b, 1717a, 1717b can be used to change
the over center position and behavior of lid 1704. For example, when in the closed position, first
and second magnetic elements 1705a, 1705b can repel each other and compress springs 1707a,
1707b, relieving some of the repulsive forces. Conversely, while in the closed position second
pair of magnetic elements 1710a, 17 1Ob can be attracted closer together resulting in higher
attractive forces since springs 1717a, 1717b allow the magnetic elements to move closer
together. Other configurations of springs can be used with magnetic elements without departing
from this disclosure.
[0174]     Now referring to FIGS. 18-21, various magnet geometries can be used in the cases
discussed above. These are only examples, and other geometries can be used without departing
                                                   41

1002035081
from the disclosure. FIG. 18 shows a square bar 1800, while FIG. 19 shows a rectangular bar
1900. FIG. 20 shows an "L" shaped bar 2000 while FIG. 21 shows a cylindrical bar 2100.
SPRING ACTUATED CASE
[0175]     Now referring to FIGS. 22A-22D a case and a spring actuated hinges are illustrated.
As shown in FIG. 22A, case 2200 has a lid 2210 with a spring actuated over center mechanism
2220. Case 2200 can be similar to case 100 illustrated in FIG. 1 and case 1300 illustrated in FIG.
13 and in some embodiments can used to store and charge a pair of earbuds or other type of
portable listening device. In other embodiments, however case 2200 can be used to store a
variety of other objects different than portable listening devices.
[0176]     Similar to the cases discussed above, case 2200 can have a closed position, illustrated
in FIG. 22A where a housing 2205 is covered by a lid 2210 that is pivotally coupled to the
housing. Case 2200 can also have an open position, illustrated in FIG. 22D where lid 2210 is
pivotally displaced from housing 2205. A spring actuated over center mechanism 2220 is shown
in more detail in the expanded view in FIG. 22A. Lid 2210 includes an extension 2225 attached
to the lid and disposed on an opposite side of pivotable joint 2230 from the lid. That is, when lid
2210 rotates about pivotable joint 2230, extension 2225 also rotates about the pivotable joint.
Extension 2225 has a rounded distal end 2226 that is in contact with a spring loaded arm 2235
such that the lid resists rotating from the open position to the closed position until the lid is
moved past an over center position (illustrated in FIG. 22C) when the lid is then impelled to the
closed position (illustrated in FIG. 22D).
[0177]     Spring loaded arm 2235 is attached to a second pivotable joint 2240 at a first end and
extends to a distal tip 2245. Spring loaded arm 2235 can have a rounded distal tip 2245 with a
first and second surface 2246, 2247, respectively arranged opposite each other and extending
between the distal tip and the first end. In the illustration in FIG. 22A, spring loaded arm 2235
has a rotational force from a torsion spring applying a clock-wise torque. As lid 2210 is moved
towards the open position, extension 2225 rotates in a clock-wise direction about pivotable joint
2230, slides along a first portion 2248 of first surface 2246, and forces arm 2235 in a counter
clock-wise direction increasing the clock-wise torque on the arm. Thus, spring loaded
mechanism 2220 resists lid 2210 transitioning from the closed position (illustrated in FIG. 22A)
towards the open position (illustrated in FIG. 22D.)
                                                   42

1002035081
[0178]     FIG. 22B illustrates an isometric view of spring loaded mechanism 2220. As shown in
FIG. 22B, spring loaded mechanism 2220 includes a spring loaded arm 2235, extension 2225,
torsion spring 2250 and spring stop 2255. Torsion spring 2250 is formed around a pin of second
pivotable joint 2240, however in other embodiments a different configuration for the mechanism
can be used including, but not limited to, cantilevered springs and coil springs.
[0179]     FIG. 22C illustrates case 2200 with a partially open lid 2210. As shown in FIG. 22C,
lid 2210 is shown in an over center position where the lid is in a first stable position when in the
closed position (illustrated in FIG. 22A) and is in a second stable position when in the open
position (illustrated in FIG. 22D), but is in an unstable position in-between the closed position
and the open position. In some embodiments the over-center performance of lid 2210 can be
achieved by extension 2225 having a rounded distal end 2226 that is in contact with arm 2235
that has a clockwise torque applied to it. In various embodiments extension 2225 is oriented
perpendicular to first surface 2246 when in the unstable position in-between the closed position
and the open position. In some embodiments arm 2235 and or distal end 2226 can have a
lubricant and/or one or more lubricant channels on it to maintain a low coefficient of friction
between the parts and to provide smooth actuation.
[0180]     FIG. 22D illustrates case 2200 with a fully open lid 2210. As shown in FIG. 22D, lid
2210 is past the over-center position and is in a stable open position. In some embodiments the
stable position can be achieved by extension 2225 being past the over center location on arm
2235, with extension 2225 sliding along a second portion 2249 of first surface 2246, and the arm
holding the lid open due to the clock-wise torque applied to the arm by torsion spring 2250 (see
FIG. 22B).
EARBUD CASE WITH WIRELESS CHARGING TRANSMITTER
[0181]     Reference is now made to FIG. 23, which illustrates an earbud case 2300 that includes
a wireless power transmitting component 2330 that enables the case to wirelessly charge an
accessory electronic device outside of the case instead of within the case. For example, as shown
in FIG. 23, case 2300 is depicted as wireless charging a watch 2301 that is placed over and
aligned with wireless power transmitting component 2330. While FIG. 23 illustrates a watch as
the accessory device being charged, embodiments of the disclosure can be used to wirelessly
charge other appropriate electronic devices as well. In some instances, embodiments of the
                                                  43

disclosure are particularly well suited for use with portable electronic media devices because of
their potentially small form factor. As used herein, an electronic media device includes any
device with at least one electronic component that can be used to present human-perceivable
media. Such devices can include, for example, portable music players (e.g., MP3 devices and
Apple's iPodTM devices), portable video players (e.g., portable DVD players), cellular telephones
(e.g., smart telephones such as Apple's iPhone devices), video cameras, digital still cameras,
projection systems (e.g., holographic projection systems), gaming systems, PDAs, as well as
tablet (e.g., Apple's iPad devices), laptop or other mobile computers. Some of these devices can
be configured to provide audio, video or other data or sensory output.
[0182]     In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 23, case 2300 can include all or some of the
features of case 204 discussed above with respect to FIG. 2 along with a second charging system
in which a wireless power transmitting component 2330 is positioned within housing 2335
adjacent to an exterior charging surface 2340. In some embodiments exterior charging surface
2340 can be any exterior surface of case 2300. Wireless power transmitting component 2330 can
be configured to wirelessly transmit power across housing 2335 to a power receiving coil (not
shown in FIG. 23) of watch 2301 when the watch is positioned outside housing 2335 adjacent to
exterior charging surface 2340, as discussed in more detail below.
[0183]     As further shown in FIG. 23, watch 2301 includes a casing 2302 that houses a display
2304 and various input devices including a dial 2306 and a button 2308. Watch 2301 can be
worn on a user's wrist and secured thereto by a band 2310. Casing 2302 also houses electronic
circuitry (not shown in FIG. 23), including a processor and communication circuitry. A battery
(not shown in FIG. 23) internal to casing 2302 powers watch 2301. The battery can be recharged
by a wireless power transfer system and watch 2301 can include circuitry configured to operate
as a receiver in the wireless power transfer system while wireless power transmitter component
2330 is a transmitter in the system. One example of a wireless power transfer system is an
inductive power transfer system. In an inductive power transfer system, a power-receiving
electronic device includes or otherwise incorporates an inductive power-receiving element
configured to wirelessly receive power and/or charge one or more internal batteries. Similarly, a
charging device (i.e., power transmitting component) includes or otherwise incorporates an
                                                  44

1002035081
inductive power-transmitting element configured to wirelessly transmit power to the power
receiving electronic device.
[0184]     FIG. 24 is a block diagram of inductive power receiving system 2400 according to an
embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in FIG. 24, system 2400 is an inductive power
receiving system that can be located within casing 2302 of watch 2301 (see FIG. 23) or within a
different type of electronic accessory that can be charged by wireless power transmitting
component 2330. When power receiving system 2400 is operatively coupled with an appropriate
inductive power transmitting component, such as wireless power transmitting component 2330,
battery 2402 within the device can be wirelessly charged. Battery 2402 is operably connected to
a receive coil 2404 via power conditioning circuitry 2406. Receive coil 2404 can be inductively
coupled to a transmit coil of a charging device to receive power wirelessly from the charging
device and pass the received power to battery 2402 within the electronic device via power
conditioning circuitry 2406. Power conditioning circuitry 2406 can be configured to convert the
alternating current received by the receive coil 2404 into direct current power for use by other
components of the device. A processing unit 2410 can direct the power, via one or more routing
circuits and under the execution of an appropriate program residing in a memory 2412, to
perform or coordinate one or more functions of the electronic device typically powered by
battery 2402.
[0185]     Now referring to FIG. 25, case 2300 is illustrated with a pair of earbuds 115 a, 1 15b
stored within a housing 2505 of the case and covered by a lid 2520. Case 2300 can charge
earbuds 115 a, 1 15b in the same manner as case 100 discussed above (i.e., either with a wired
connection or with a wireless power transfer system). Case 2300 can also, however, include an
inductive charging system 2525 positioned and configured to charge a different portable
electronic device positioned outside of case 2300 instead of within the case. Inductive charging
system 2525 can include a wireless power transmitting component to wirelessly charge an
auxiliary device such as watch 2301 (see FIG. 23). In some embodiments case 2500 can be
different from case 100 (see FIG. 1) and can be of any other configuration having one or more
cavities and a lid that covers the one or more cavities. In one example lid 2520 can be separable
from the case. Inductive charging system 2525 can include wireless charging circuitry within
                                                 45

1002035081
housing 2505 that enables case 2300 to wirelessly recharge a battery, for example, battery 2402
(see FIG. 24) of watch 2301.
[0186]     FIG. 26 is a block diagram of a wireless charging system 2600 according to an
embodiment of the disclosure. As shown in FIG. 26, wireless charging system 2600 includes an
inductive power transmitting component 2602. Inductive power transmitting component 2602
includes a power source 2604, which can be case battery 227 (see FIG. 2), operatively coupled to
a transmit coil 2606 to transmit power to a wearable device via electromagnetic induction or
magnetic resonance.
[0187]     Transmit coil 2606 can be an electromagnetic coil that produces a time-varying
electromagnetic flux to induce a current within an electromagnetic coil within an electronic
device (e.g., coil 2404 in FIG. 24). Transmit coil 2606 can transmit power at a selected
frequency or band of frequencies. In one example the transmit frequency is substantially fixed,
although this is not required. In another example, the transmit frequency can be adjusted to
improve power transfer efficiency for particular operational conditions. More particularly, a
high transmit frequency can be selected if more power is required by the accessory and a low
transmit frequency can be selected if less power is required by the accessory. In other examples,
transmit coil 2606 can produce a static electromagnetic field and can physically move, shift, or
otherwise change its position to produce a spatially-varying electromagnetic flux to induce a
current within the receive coil.
[0188]     When watch 2301 (see FIG. 23) is operatively coupled (e.g., disposed on or adjacent to)
case 2300, the wearable electronic device can receive charge to replenish the charge of its
rechargeable battery or to provide power to operating components associated with the electronic
device. To facilitate the transfer of electromagnetic energy, transmit coil 2606 can be positioned
within the housing of case 2300 (see FIG. 23) such that it aligns with receive coil 2404 (see FIG.
24) in watch 2301 along a mutual axis. If misaligned, the power transfer efficiency between
transmit coil 2606 and receive coil 2404 (see FIG. 24) can decrease as misalignment increases.
In some embodiments, one or more alignment features can be used to aid the alignment along a
mutual axis, including mechanical alignment features (e.g., recesses, ledges, detents) and
magnetic features (e.g., alignment magnet 2630), as discussed in more detail below.
                                                 46

1002035081
[0189]     As one example, alignment magnet 2630 can be included in case 2300 that
magnetically mates with an alignment magnet (not shown) of watch 2301 to facilitate proper
alignment of the case and the wearable electronic device. More specifically, alignment magnet
2630 attracts the mating alignment magnet in watch 2301 such that the wearable device is
laterally moved into a particular location and held firmly against an outer surface of the case.
Additionally, the top and bottom surfaces of case 2300 and watch 2301, respectively, can
cooperate to further facilitate alignment. For example, in one embodiment a bottom surface of
watch 2301 is convex and a top surface of case 2300 is concave, following the same curvature as
the bottom surface of the wearable device.
[0190]     In some embodiments, case 2300 (see FIG. 23) can also include one or more sensors to
determine whether watch 2301 is present and ready to receive transmitted power from the
charger. For example, watch 2301 can include an optical sensor, such as an infrared proximity
sensor. When watch 2301 is attached to case 2300, the infrared proximity sensor can produce a
signal used to determine the presence of the wearable device. Other methods or structures to
verify the presence of watch 2301 can include a mass sensor, a mechanical interlock, switch,
button or the like, a Hall-effect sensor, or other electronic sensor.
[0191]     Some embodiments can include a prioritized charging algorithm to preferentially use
the stored charge in case battery 227 (see FIG. 2) depending on what chargeable devices are
coupled to case 2300. For example charging system 2525 (see FIG. 25) can be programmed to
first recharge earbuds 115a, 115b, then charge watch 2301. In another example a user is able to
program the charging priority while in another example case 2300 can simply charge any device
that is coupled to it. In further examples case 2300 can be coupled to a power source through
connector 345 (see FIG. 3) and can charge one device, preferentially charge multiple devices or
simultaneously charge multiple devices.
[0192]     Some embodiments can have a wired interface for case 2300 charging battery 2402 (see
FIG. 24) and/or for exchanging data with watch 2301. The wired interface can be in addition to
or instead of a wireless interface. For example, in one embodiment case 2300 can include
contacts that are sized and positioned to physically and electrically couple to one or more
contacts on watch 2301. The contacts can include one or more power contacts as well as one or
                                                   47

1002035081
more data contacts, such as a pair of differential data contacts. In another embodiment connector
345 (see FIG. 3) of case can be used to charge watch 2301.
WIRELESSLY CHARGED CASE
[0193]     Now referring to FIG. 27, a simplified perspective view of case 2700 on a charging
station 2705 is illustrated. As shown in FIG. 27, case 2700 can be similar to other cases in this
disclosure, such as case 100 in FIG.1, and can be inductively charged by a charging station 2705.
Case 2700 can have a rechargeable battery that can be inductively recharged with a wireless
charging system similar to that illustrated and described above with reference to FIGS. 23
through 26. More specifically, all of the features described above with regard to inductively
charged watch 2301 can be employed in inductively charged case 2700.
[0194]     Wireless charging station 2705 can include wireless charging circuitry within housing
2710 that enables case 2700 to wirelessly recharge an internal battery. Wireless charging station
2705 can include an inductive power transmitting coil 2715, that is similar to wireless power
transmitting component 2602 described above in FIG. 26. Inductive power transmitting coil
2715 is capable of transmitting power to case 2700 via electromagnetic induction or magnetic
resonance. When case 2700 is operatively coupled (e.g., disposed on or adjacent to) charging
station 2705, the case can receive charge to replenish the charge of its rechargeable battery or to
provide power to operating components associated with the case.
[0195]     To facilitate the transfer of electromagnetic energy, transmit coil 2715 can be
positioned within the housing of charging station 2705 such that it aligns with one or more
receive coils 2720 in case 2700 along a mutual axis. If misaligned, the power transfer efficiency
between transmit coil 2715 and receive coil 2720 can decrease as misalignment increases. In
some embodiments, one or more alignment features can be used to aid the alignment along a
mutual axis, including mechanical alignment features (e.g., recesses, ledges, detents) and
magnetic features (e.g., alignment magnet), as discussed herein. In further embodiments case
2700 can include more than one receive coil and can detect which receive coil is better aligned
and selectively only receive charge from that particular coil. In various embodiments case 2700
can use one or more planar receive coils 2720, however in other embodiments other receive coil
designs can be used.

WATERPROOF RECEPTACLE CONNECTOR
[0196]     FIGS. 28 and 29 illustrate a liquid-tight electrical connector 2800. As shown in FIG.
28, electrical connector 2800 can have mounting flanges and sealed features to make it resistant
or impervious to liquid penetration. Electrical connector 2800 can be used to couple power and
data to a case, similar to connector 345 in FIG. 3. In some embodiments connector 2800 can, for
example, be any non-proprietary interface such as a USB connector or can be any proprietary
interface such as the Lightning connector used by Apple Incorporated of Cupertino, CA. In
various embodiments connector 2800 can be liquid-tight, as discussed in more detail below.
[0197]     Metallic bracket 2805 is formed around an exterior portion of connector 2800 and has
one or more mounting holes 2810 for securing the connector to a circuit board or a chassis.
Connector 2800 has a receiving face 2815 that has a front opening (not shown in FIG. 28, but
shown in FIG. 3 for connector 345) for receiving a plug portion of a mating connector. An
interconnection face 2820 contains a plurality of metallic pins 2825 that each connect to an
internal electrical contact as described in more detail below. One or more ground pins 2826 can
also extend out of interconnection face 2820. Metallic pins 2825 and ground pins 2826 can be
sealed by an overmolded portion 2830 so they are liquid-tight. Metallic bracket 2805 can be two
pieces and welded together as described below. Metallic bracket 2805 can also have one or more
deformable fingers 2835 that can be used to secure the components of connector 2800 together.
[0198]     As shown in FIG. 29 connector 2800 includes a contact plate 2980 coupled to a housing
2905 with a gasket to make the connector liquid-tight. Housing 2905 is made from an
electrically insulative polymer that extends between receiving face 2815 and a rear face 2910.
Housing 2905 defines a cavity 2915 that communicates with a front opening in receiving face
2815 to receive a plug portion of a mating plug connector. A spacer 2920 is formed from a
plastic material and has a plurality of retention features 2925 that are each configured to each
receive an electrical contact from a set of electrical contacts 2930 that can be stitched into it.
Each electrical contact in the set of electrical contacts 2930, can include an elongated beam
portion 2935 positioned between a contact tip 2940 and an anchor portion 2945. Each contact tip
2940 is positioned within cavity 2915 so that it can be electrically coupled to a corresponding
plug connector contact during a mating event.
                                                   49

1002035081
[0199]     Beam portion 2935 allows tip 2940 of each contact to flex slightly downward during a
mating event and biases the tip to keep physical and electrical contact with a contact in the plug
connector that aligns with the particular receptacle contact. Anchor portion 2945 can be a
substantially flat plate with one or more cutouts that fits within a slot 2950 of housing 2905 to
secure or anchor the contacts in place. Set of electrical contacts 2930 can further include
electrical leads 2955 that extend out of interconnection face 2820 (see FIG. 28) of connector
assembly 2800 that can couple the receptacle connector to a printed circuit board or similar
substrate. Each contact in the set of contacts 2930 can also have an alignment portion 2960
adjacent anchor portion 2945 to align the contact structures within slots 2950 of housing 2905.
In some particular embodiments, set of electrical contacts 2930 includes eight contacts spaced
apart from each other along a single row.
[0200]     A ground latch 2965 can be formed from a conductive metal and inserted through
ground slots 2970 in spacer 2920. The ground latch can include first and second spring arms
extending along opposing sides of the set of contacts 2930. The first and second spring arms can
latch to retention features of a corresponding plug connector to assist in retaining the plug
connector within the receptacle connector 2800 after a mating event. In other embodiments
ground latch 2965 can be insert mold within spacer 2920. Spacer 2920, with set of contacts 2930
and ground latch 2965, can then be overmolded with dielectric overmold portion 2975.
Overmold portion 2975 covers a portion of spacer 2920 and the anchor portion of each contact in
the set of contacts 2930 forming a liquid-tight seal to leads 2955 and ground latch 2965 and
creating an integrated contact plate 2980. A gasket 2985 can be disposed against rear face 2910
of housing 2905 and contact plate 2980 can then be pressed against the gasket to form a liquid
tight assembly. Metallic bracket 2805 can include a top bracket 2990a laser welded to a bottom
bracket 2990b. Bracket fingers 2835 can be formed to hold contact plate 2980 against housing
2905 such that connector 2800 is liquid-tight. That is, if liquid were to enter receiving opening
of connector (see connector 345 in FIG. 3) the liquid would not be able to pass through the
connector and enter case 100.
WIRELESS EARBUDS
[0201]     Now referring to FIGS. 30-46, non-occluding earbuds 3000a, 3000b and methods for
making the same are described and illustrated. As shown in FIGS. 30 and 31 earbuds 3000a,
                                                 50

1002035081
3000b can be similar to earbuds 115a, 115b illustrated in FIG. 1, however earbuds 3000a, 3000b
can include various other features including in ear sensing and acoustic features as described in
more detail below.
[0202]     FIGS. 30 and 31 show front and rear perspective views, respectively, of a non
occluding left earbud 3000a (FIG. 30) and a non-occluding right earbud 3000b (FIG. 31).
Generally, non-occluding earbuds are designed not to form an airtight seal between the ear (or
ear canal) and the outer surface of the earbud. By way of contrast, occluding earbuds are
generally designed to fit inside of the user's ear canal and form a substantially airtight seal. Each
earbud 3000a, 3000b can include an external housing 3005 having an ear portion 3010 coupled
to a stem portion 3015. Housing 3005 can have an asymmetric shape amenable to in-the-ear
retention, but does not form an airtight seal with the user's ear or ear canal. The absence of an
airtight seal can benefit from volumes within the earbud being specifically tuned (e.g., by
specifically shaping the volumes and/or adding material to the volumes) to achieve a desired
frequency response. Ear portion 3010 can include a directional sound port 3020 offset with
respect to a center axis of the ear bud. Directional sound port 3020 can be designed to direct
sound waves from an internal driver (e.g., part of an earbud speaker, not shown in FIGS. 30 and
31) directly into a user's ear canal.
[0203]     In addition, secondary apertures in the earbud can be employed in housing 3005 to
achieve desired sound performance. For example, one or more secondary apertures can serve as
a controlled leak port to expose an acoustic pressure within the earbud to the external,
surrounding environment. In this aspect, the secondary apertures can be calibrated to modify an
acoustic response of the earbud. In this embodiment earbuds 3000a, 3000b each include a front
leak port 3025 and a multiport 3030 formed in ear portion 3010. Multiport 3030 can include
both a rear vent 3035 and a bass port 3040, that will be described in more detail below. In
addition, earbuds according to embodiments of this disclosure can be constructed to have a
seamless finish even though two or more parts are joined together to form part of the earbud.
[0204]     Ear portion 3010 of earbuds 3000a, 3000b can also include one or more "in the ear"
sensors to assist each earbud 3000a, 3000b in determining whether or not the earbud is in a
user's ear. In one embodiment an optical tragus sensor 3045 is configured to sense the presence
or absence of a user's tragus, and an optical concha sensor 3050 is configured to sense the
                                                   51

1002035081
presence or absence of a user's concha. Tragus and concha sensors 3045, 3050, respectively, can
use any type of optical sensor including, but not limited to an LED or vertical cavity surface
emitting laser (VCSEL) device. Further embodiments can include one or more capacitive sensors
and/or accelerometers to detect the presence of a user's ear and/or earbud orientation, as
described in more detail below. In the ear detection can be useful for features such as, but not
limited to, determining which earbud 3000a, 3000b to use as a microphone when a user desires
to accept a call and when a user stops using one earbud and starts using the other earbud.
[0205]     A distal end 3055 of stem portion 3015 of each earbud 3000a, 3000b can include an
electrical connector 3060 that is formed to make contact with a corresponding connector (e.g., a
receptacle connector) of a charging station and/or earbud charging case, such as one of the
connector structures described in FIGS. 4A-8C. In one particular embodiment, each connector
3060 can include first and second contacts spaced apart from each other in an oppositional and
symmetrical relationship, such as partially annular earbud contacts 610 and 615 shown in FIG.
6B. Each of the first and second contacts can include an outer perimeter that is flush with an
exterior surface of the stem portion and include an arcuate or other curved surface that creates a
strong wiping action during a contact mating event. Electrical connector 3060 can be used to
recharge an internal battery within each earbud 3000a, 3000b and in some cases can also be used
to transfer data to and from each earbud. Distal end 3055 can also include a bottom microphone
port 3065 (e.g., microphone aperture 635 illustrated in FIG. 6B) that works in conjunction with a
top microphone port 3070 to receive a user's voice and/or perform noise cancellation.
[0206]     FIGS. 32 and 33 illustrate partial cross sections of earbuds 3000a, 3000b. As shown in
FIG. 32, earbuds 3000a, 3000b include a driver 3205, an acoustic insert 3220, a flexible circuit
3225, an antenna 3330, a rechargeable battery 3335 and an electrical connector 3060. Driver
3205 is located within ear portion 3010 and defines a front acoustic volume 3210 in front of the
driver and a rear acoustic volume 3215 behind the driver. Driver 3205 can include an
electromagnetic voice coil, a driver magnet and a speaker diaphragm (not shown in FIG. 32).
Acoustic insert 3220 is positioned behind driver 3205 and adhered to housing 3005, as described
in more detail below. Ear portion 3010 further includes a folded up portion of a flexible circuit
3225 that can contain one or more sensors, controllers and myriad other circuits for operating
earbud 3000a,b. Flexible circuit 3225 can include portions that are flexible as well as portions
                                                  52

1002035081
that are not flexible, such as multilayer epoxy and glass composite circuit boards and can further
couple the myriad electronic systems of earbud 3000a, 3000b together, as described in more
detail below.
[0207]      Stem portion 3015 of earbud 3000a, 3000b can include an antenna 3330, a rechargeable
battery 3335 and electrical connector 3060. A portion of flexible circuit 3225 can extend down
and electrically connect to electrical connector 3060.
[0208]     As shown in FIG. 33, earbuds 3000a, 3000b include several internal sensors. In FIG.
33 some internal components of earbud 3000a, 3000b have been removed for clarity. Ear
portion 3010 can contain a tragus sensor 3045, a concha optical sensor 3050 and an
accelerometer 3315 that can work together to determine whether earbud 3000a, 3000b is in a
user's ear. Flexible circuit 3225 (see FIG. 32) can be used to electrically couple all these devices
together.
FOLDABLE, FLEXIBLE CIRCUIT
[0209]      FIGS. 34 and 35 illustrate simplified views of flexible circuit 3225. As shown in FIG.
34, flexible circuit 3225 is shown in a flat pattern. FIG. 35 shows flexible circuit 3225 folded up
as it is installed in earbud 3000a, 3000b as shown in FIG. 32. Now referring simultaneously to
FIGS. 34 and 35 the various portions of flexible circuit 3225 are described. A concha portion
3405 can be used to attach to and communicate with optical concha sensor 3050 (see FIG. 33).
Towards this purpose, concha portion 3405 can include one or more electrical terminals that can
be bonded to contacts of optical concha sensor 3050.
[0210]      Processor portion 3410 can include one or more central processing units, controllers
and passives. Processor portion 3410 can be a rigid portion of flexible circuit 3225 and can
include multiple stacked routing layers. In one embodiment processor portion can have 4, 6, 8 or
10 routing layers.
[0211]     An accelerometer portion 3415 can include one or more accelerometers to assist in
detecting a position and/or orientation of the earbud, to assist in acting as a microphone that may
be used to mitigate wind noise and to function as a user input device recognizing a tap or
touching sequence on the earbud housing. A top microphone portion 3420 can be used to attach
to and communicate with a top microphone through one or more electrical terminals. A tragus
                                                   53

1002035081
sensor portion 3430 can be used to attach to and communicate with optical tragus sensor 3045
(see FIG. 33) through one or more 3430 formed within portion, and a bottom microphone
portion 3435 can be used to attach to and communicate with a bottom microphone through one
or more terminals formed within portion 3435.
[0212]     Each of the flexible portions 3440 can be sufficiently flexible to fold up flexible circuit
3225 as illustrated in FIG. 35. Further, each of the flexible portions 3440 can include one or
more electrical traces that route electrical signals between different components of flexible
circuit 3225. For example, flexible portion 3440 between concha portion 3405 and processor
portion 3410 can include one or more electrical traces that run between the concha portion
terminals and the processor. Similarly, flexible portion 3440 between bottom microphone
portion 3435 can include one or more electrical traces that run between the bottom microphone
terminals and the processor.
EARBUD CONNECTORS
[0213]     FIGS. 36-41 illustrate several embodiments of earbud connectors that can be used in
the distal end of a stem portion of each earbud such as connector 3060 in FIG. 30. As shown in
FIG. 36, connector 3600 can be affixed to a distal end 3055 of an earbud 3000a, 3000b and be
used to couple charging and data signals to the earbuds. Connector 3600 can be mated with
receptacle connectors that can be disposed in a case or docking station such as the receptacle
connectors disclosed in FIGS. 4A-8C.
[0214]     Connector 3600 is illustrated in FIG. 36 in a partially assembled state before it is
attached to a distal end 3055 of a stem portion 3015 of earbud 3000a, 3000b. In this embodiment
connector 3600 includes an inner circular metallic contact 3610 and an outer circular metallic
contact 3615 with a dielectric ring 3620 separating the two contacts. In various embodiments
inner circular contact 3610 can have an aperture 3613 within it that can be used for both a
receptacle connector contact surface and an aperture for a microphone. In some embodiments
inner and outer circular contacts 3610, 3615, can be separately manufactured components and
can be made from a metal or alloy that can have one or more layers of plating, as described in
more detail below. In various embodiments inner and outer circular contacts 3610, 3615, can be
made from a copper or copper-based alloy such as, but not limited to C5212 phosphor bronze. In
some embodiments inner and outer circular contacts 3610, 3615, can be individually machined,
                                                   54

1002035081
cast or metal injection molded. In further embodiments they can be made from an electrically
conductive plastic or made from an insulative plastic that is plated with one or more metals or
alloys.
[0215]     As shown in FIG. 37, connector 3600 includes inner and outer circular contacts 3610,
3615, respectively that can be manufactured as separate components. In one example inner and
outer circular contacts 3610, 3615, include one or more ridges 3625 to enable increased retention
force to dielectric ring 3620. To electrically couple inner and outer circular contacts 3610, 3615,
to earbuds 3000a, 3000b the contacts can each include coupling tabs. More specifically inner
circular contact 3610 can have a first coupling tab 3630 for attaching to a portion of flexible
circuit 3225 (see FIGS. 34-36). In some embodiments first coupling tab 3630 is soldered to a
metallized pad 3635 (see FIG. 36) on flexible circuit 3225, however in other embodiments it can
be attached with a conductive epoxy or other method. Outer circular contact 3615 can have a
second coupling tab 3640 for attaching to a portion of flexible circuit 3225 similar to the
aforementioned process.
[0216]     As described above, outer circular contact 3615 can have an arcuate cross-section to
facilitate wiping of a mating contact to provide a reliable interconnect with a receptacle
connector. Inner circular contact 3610 can also have an arcuate or sloped cross-section to
promote contact wiping with a receptacle connector. In some embodiments inner and outer
circular contacts 3610, 3615, can be plated with one or more metals that can prevent oxidation of
the contact surface for reduced interconnect resistance and in further embodiments the plating
can be used to provide an aesthetically appealing appearance, as described in more detail below.
[0217]     In various embodiments inner and outer circular contacts 3610, 3615, can be plated first
with a layer of nickel followed by a final layer of gold. In some embodiments inner and outer
circular contacts 3610, 3615, can be plated with a first layer of copper between 3 and 5 microns
thick, followed by a layer of gold between 0.5 and 0.7 microns thick, followed by a layer of gold
between 0.1 and 0.2 microns thick, followed by a layer of palladium between 0.5 and 0.8
microns thick, followed by a layer of gold between 0.1 and 0.2 microns thick, followed by a
binary alloy layer including a first element and a second element, between 0.7 and 1.0 microns
thick.
                                                 55

1002035081
[0218]     In some embodiments inner and outer circular contacts 3610, 3615, can be plated with a
first layer of copper between 3 and 4.5 microns thick, followed by a layer of gold between 0.5
and 0.9 microns thick, followed by a layer of palladium between 0.5 and 0.8 microns thick,
followed by a layer of gold between 0.1 and 0.2 microns thick, followed by a binary alloy layer
including a first element and a second element, between 0.65 and 1.0 microns thick.
[0219]     In these and other embodiments of the present invention, the first element of the binary
alloy layer may be an element in a first group consisting of platinum, palladium, iridium,
osmium and rhodium. In these and other embodiments of the present invention, the first element
may be rhodium.
[0220]     In these and other embodiments of the present invention, the second element of the
binary alloy layer may be an element in a second group consisting of platinum, palladium,
iridium, osmium, and ruthenium. In these and other embodiments of the present invention, the
second element may be ruthenium.
[0221]     In these and other embodiments of the present invention, the first element may
comprise approximately 85 weight percent of the binary alloy while the second element may
comprise approximately 15 weight percent of the binary alloy. In these and other embodiments
of the present invention, the first element may comprise approximately 90 weight percent of the
binary alloy while the second element may comprise approximately 10 weight percent of the
binary alloy. In these and other embodiments of the present invention, the first element may
comprise approximately 95 weight percent of the binary alloy while the second element may
comprise approximately 5 weight percent of the binary alloy. In these and other embodiments of
the present invention, the first element may comprise approximately 99 weight percent of the
binary alloy while the second element may comprise approximately 1 weight percent of the
binary alloy. In these and other embodiments of the present invention, the first element may
comprise more than or approximately 99.5 weight percent of the binary alloy while the second
element may comprise less than or approximately 0.5 weight percent of the binary alloy.
[0222]     In some embodiments a combination of rhodium and ruthenium for the binary alloy can
be used to prevent oxidation of the contact surface while providing an aesthetically appealing
gray or silver appearance. Other combinations and compositions of plating are within the scope
of this disclosure. In yet further embodiments first and second coupling tabs 3630, 3640 can be
                                                 56

1002035081
masked before the final layer of the binary alloy, leaving them with a gold surface for improved
solderability.
[0223]     After inner and outer circular contacts 3610, 3615 are plated they can be insert molded
to form a connector 3600 as shown in FIG. 38. A dielectric ring 3620 can be molded in-between
and around portions of inner and outer circular contacts 3610, 3615, and can be used to form one
or more attachment tabs 3655 that assist connector 3600 being attached to earbud 3000a, 3000b
as illustrated in FIG. 36.
[0224]     Now referring to FIGS. 39 and 40 perspective views of connector 3900 are illustrated.
As shown in FIGS. 39 and 40, connector 3900 is similar to connector 3600 illustrated in FIG. 36,
however connector 3900 includes two semicircular contacts instead of circular inner and an outer
contacts. An end view of connector 3900 is similar to the end view of connector 605 illustrated
in FIG. 6B. Connector 3900 includes a first semicircular contact 3910 and a second semicircular
contact 3915 with a dielectric layer 3920 separating the two contacts. First and second
semicircular contacts 3910, 3915, respectively, can be spaced in an oppositional and symmetrical
relationship with each other. In various embodiments first and second semicircular contacts
3910, 3915, respectively, can form an aperture 3913 between them that can be used for both a
receptacle connector contact surface and an aperture for a microphone. First and second
semicircular contacts 3910, 3915, respectively, can be manufactured and plated using the same
processes described above with regard to connector 3600.
[0225]     To electrically couple first and second semicircular contacts 3910, 3915, respectively,
to earbud 3000a, 3000b they can each include coupling tabs similar to connector 3600. More
specifically first semicircular contact 3910 can have a first coupling tab 3930 for attaching to a
portion of flexible circuit 3225 (see FIGS. 34-36). Second semicircular contact 3915 can have a
second coupling tab 3940 for attaching to a portion of flexible circuit 3225 similar to the
aforementioned process.
[0226]     After first and second semicircular contacts 3910, 3915, respectively, are plated they
can be insert molded to form a connector 3900 as shown in FIG. 40. A dielectric layer 3920 can
be molded in-between and around portions of first and second semicircular contacts 3910, 3915,
respectively, and can be used to form one or more attachment tabs 3955 that assist connector
3900 being attached to earbud 3000a,b as illustrated in FIG. 36.

CAPACITIVE SENSOR INSERT
[0227]     FIG. 41 illustrates a simplified perspective view of earbud 4100. As shown in FIG. 41,
earbud 4100 includes a housing 4105 and a capacitive sensor insert 4110 that can sense a user's
touch on exterior surface 4115 of the housing. Capacitive sensor insert 4110 has sensor circuitry
4120 that can create one or more capacitive sensors, as explained in more detail below. For
example, sensor circuitry 4120 can create a first capacitive sensor in region 4125 on exterior
surface 4115 of housing 4105 that can be used to detect the touch of a user's ear for in the ear
sensing and can create a second capacitive sensor in region 4130 that can be used to detect the
touch of a user's finger to answer a call or to perform any other function.
[0228]     FIG. 42 illustrates a simplified cross-section of earbud housing 4104. As shown in
FIG. 42, housing 4105 includes a capacitive sensor insert 4110 positioned within a cavity 4205
defined by the housing. Cavity can also house one or more other components of the earbuds
3000a,b. Earbud housing 4105 has at least one touch sensitive region 4125, 4130 at exterior
surface 4115 of the housing that is formed by capacitive sensor insert 4110. Housing 4105 has
an interior surface 4210 within cavity 4205, opposite exterior surface 4115. Capacitive sensor
insert 4110 has a first surface 4215 with metalized sensor circuitry 4120 (see FIG. 41) that is
positioned adjacent interior surface 4210 of housing 4105. Capacitive sensor insert 4110 has a
second surface 4220 that is opposite first surface 4215.
[0229]     FIGS. 43 and 44 illustrate simplified plan views of capacitive sensor inserts 4300,
4400, respectively. As shown in FIGS. 43 and 44, different types of circuitry can be used to
form the capacitive sensors, for example in FIG. 43 self-capacitance circuitry can be used and in
FIG. 44 mutual-capacitance sensor circuitry can be used.
[0230]     Now referring to FIG. 43, a plan view of sensor insert 4300 is illustrated. As shown in
FIG. 43, sensor insert 4300 has self-capacitance sensor circuitry 4305 that senses the touch of a
user (e.g., the user's ear and/or finger) on exterior surface 4115 (see FIG. 42) of housing 4105.
The user's touch loads the self-capacitance circuitry and/or increases the parasitic capacitance to
ground which is interpreted by the sensor insert 4300 and communicated to the earbud processor.
Sensor circuitry 4305 can have one or more interconnect regions 4310, for example solder pads
or plated through holes, that allow it to be coupled to an earbud processor with one or more
conductors.
                                                   58

1002035081
[0231]     In one embodiment sensor insert 4300 can be formed from a plastic that includes
metallic particulates. A laser can then be used to laser activate regions 4315 on first surface
4320 of sensor insert 4300, that correspond to the desired location of sensor circuity 4305. The
laser activated regions can then be metallized in a plating bath. In one example metal circuitry
can be plated on to the activated regions forming sensor circuitry 4305. This process may be
known in the art as laser direct structuring. Other methods can be used for form sensor insert
4300 without departing from this disclosure. For example in another embodiment a flexible
circuit can be adhered to first surface 4320 of sensor insert and used as the sensor circuitry. In
another example first surface 4320 can be entirely plated and can be etched using a photo
imageable ink.
[0232]     In further embodiments sensor insert 4300 can have one or more acoustic apertures
4325 that allow sound to pass through and can be aligned with a sound port of the earbuds. In
some embodiments insert 4300 can be formed in a hemispherical or other shape to closely match
a shape of the external earbud housing. Additionally, in some embodiments, sensor circuitry
4305 can fully surround or partially surround the acoustic apertures.
[0233]     Now referring to FIG. 44, a plan view of sensor insert 4400 is illustrated. As shown in
FIG. 44, sensor insert 4400 has mutual-capacitance sensor circuitry 4405 that senses the touch of
a user (e.g., the user's ear and/or finger) on exterior surface 4115 (see FIG. 42) of housing 4105.
The user's touch alters the mutual coupling between row and column electrodes 4410, which are
scanned sequentially and communicated to the earbud processor. Sensor circuitry 4405 is
formed on first surface 4407 of sensor insert 4400 and can have one or more interconnect regions
4415, for example solder pads or plated through holes, that allow it to be coupled to earbud
processor with one or more conductors.
[0234]     As described above with regard to sensor insert 4300 in FIG. 43, sensor insert 4400 can
be manufactured in the same way and can have similar features and functions. Additionally, in
some embodiments sensor insert 4400 can include one or more acoustic apertures 4425 that
allow sound to pass through sensor circuitry 4305 and at least some of sensor circuitry 4405 can
fully surround or partially surround the acoustic apertures. Additionally, in some embodiments
sensor insert 4400 can be formed in a hemispherical or other shape to closely match a shape of
the external earbud housing.

1002035081
ACOUSTIC INSERT
[0235]     FIG. 45A illustrates a simplified rear perspective view of earbud 3000a. As shown in
FIG. 45A, earbud 3000a includes an acoustic insert 4505 (shown in dashed lines within housing
3005 and in solid lines outside of the housing) that can be used to provide venting for driver
(e.g., speaker) in earbud 3000a. More specifically, acoustic insert 4505 can be used to assist in
forming a bass port 3040 and a rear vent 3035, that combine into a multiport 3030. In some
embodiments, certain features of acoustic insert 4505 can be useful for forming acoustic vents in
a relatively small and confined area such as an earbud housing.
[0236]     Earbud 3000a can have multiple acoustic apertures, some of which are shown in FIG.
30. In addition to bass port 3040, rear vent 3035 and multiport 3030, each earbud can also have
a directional sound port 3020 and a front leak port 3025. These apertures can provide venting for
the driver, sound for the user, and can help tune the frequency response of earbud 3000a. More
specifically, each aperture is not just a random opening, but instead can be intentionally formed
for a particular purpose, namely to change the frequency response of ear bud 3000a in a way that
helps to tune the frequency response and/or provide a consistent bass response amongst the same
user and across users. The acoustic apertures can each also include various meshes (e.g., a
directional sound port mesh, front leak mesh, back vent mesh, bass port mesh, and a multiport
mesh) that cover or fit into a corresponding acoustic aperture of earbud 3000a.
[0237]     FIG. 45B illustrates a simplified side view of earbud 3000a with acoustic insert 4505.
As shown in FIG. 45B, acoustic insert 4505 and driver 4570 are disposed within housing 3005
(illustrated in dashed lines). Now referring simultaneously to FIGS. 45A and 45B the function
of acoustic insert 4505 is described in more detail. Driver 4570 can be positioned within cavity
4510 of housing 3005, forming a front volume 4515 in front of the driver and a back volume
4520 behind the driver. Driver 4570 can be positioned such that front volume 4515 is
acoustically isolated from a back volume 4520. Front and back volumes 4515, 4520, respectively
can be formed within cavity 4510 at least partially by housing 3005 and sized and shaped to
achieve a desired frequency response of the earbud.
[0238]     In some embodiments, portions of acoustic insert 4505 are formed to closely match the
contours of an interior surface 4525 of housing 3005. More specifically, raised regions 4530 of
acoustic insert 4505 can be formed to fit securely against interior surface 4525 such that they can
                                                   60

1002035081
be bonded to interior surface 4525 forming a bass port channel 4527 and a multiport chamber
4507 that are acoustically sealed. That is, bass port channel 4527 can be formed by first, second
and third walls 4535, 4540, 4545, respectively of bass port recess 4550 and a fourth wall formed
by interior surface 4525 of housing 3005. Similarly, raised regions 4530 can be sealed to interior
surface 4525 forming multiport chamber 4507 that is acoustically sealed.
[0239]     Bass port channel 4527 can have an entrance aperture 4555 that communicates with
back volume 4520. Bass port channel 4527 can be routed from entrance aperture 4555 to an exit
aperture 4560 that is formed within multiport chamber 4507 that can be vented to the ambient.
Rear vent 3035 can also be routed to multiport chamber 4507, providing a vent from back
volume 4520 through rear vent aperture 4565 in acoustic insert 4505 to multiport chamber 4507.
The size and shape of bass port channel 4527 and rear vent aperture 4565 can be formed for a
particular purpose, namely to change the frequency response of ear bud 3000a in a way that
helps to tune the frequency response and/or provide a consistent bass response amongst the same
user and across users.
[0240]     Housing 3005 can serve as a housing for the remaining components of the earbud
assembly and can be formed in any suitable manner and can be made from any suitable material.
For example, in one embodiment housing 3005 is made from a molded plastic. Similarly,
acoustic insert 4505 can be made from any suitable material including a molded plastic.
[0241]     Myriad methods can be used to bond raised regions 4530 of acoustic insert to interior
surface 4525 of housing 3005. In one embodiment housing 3005 can be made from an ABS
plastic that is substantially transparent, or at least semitransparent to the wavelength of a laser
(FIG. 46, step 4605). Acoustic insert 4505 can be made from a plastic that is opaque or at least
mostly opaque to the same laser (FIG. 46, step 4610). Acoustic insert 4505 can be placed within
cavity 4510 of housing 3005 such that raised regions 4530 are firmly against interior surface
4525 (FIG. 46, step 4615). A laser beam from the laser can then be directed through housing
3005 such that it impinges raised regions 4530, melting at least a portion of the raised regions
and bonding them to interior surface 4525 of housing 3005 (FIG. 46, step 4620).
[0242]     In some embodiments, to enable the laser to be directed through housing 3005, housing
3005 can use a relatively low amount of pigment, a pigment that is transparent to the laser, or
other features to allow the laser to be transmitted through the housing with enough energy to
                                                    61

1002035081
melt at least a portion of raised regions 4530. Acoustic insert 4505 can be made from a plastic
that contains an absorptive dopant, such as carbon, so it absorbs the laser energy. In one
embodiment a laser system that is similar to a laser direct structuring laser can be used to
perform the laser bonding operation. In other embodiments raised regions 4530 can be bonded to
interior surface 4525 with other methods such as, but not limited to, a pressure sensitive
adhesive, a heat activated film or a laser activated adhesive.
WIRELESS PAIRING
[0243]     FIGS. 47-49 illustrate a wireless pairing system 4700 that includes a pair of wireless
headphones 4710 (e.g., a pair of wireless earbuds) that can be wirelessly paired to a host device
4715 (e.g., a computer, a smartphone, a tablet computer, a smart watch, or the like), with the
pairing initiated by an intermediate device 4705 (e.g., a case for the headphones). Intermediate
device 4705 can instruct wireless headphones 4710 to enter a pairing sequence with host device
4715 in response to a user input. The user input can be a user-initiated event, such as opening
earbud case lid 4720 or depressing an input button 4725. In some embodiments headphones
4710 can receive the pairing instruction via a wired connection between intermediate device
4705 and wireless headphones 4710 (e.g., through mated electrical contacts in a case for a pair of
wireless earbuds and the earbuds as described above). In other embodiments, intermediate
device 4705 can include a wireless radio that communicates the instruction to the wireless radio
within wireless headphones 4710. Upon receiving the pairing instruction, headphones 4710 can
initiate a pairing sequence to host device 4715 via a wireless communication protocol (e.g., via
Bluetooth@) that supports bidirectional data transfer.
[0244]     In some cases, headphones 4710 are a pair of wireless earbuds and only one earbud in
the pair (i.e., a primary earbud) is paired with the companion host device 4715. In such cases,
the primary earbud communicatively couples with the other earbud (a secondary earbud) so that
audio data received from host device 4715 by the primary wireless earbud can be shared with the
communicatively coupled secondary wireless earbud.
[0245]     In some embodiments, headphones 4710 do not include a user input mechanism, such
as a button that can be pressed for a user to initiate pairing between the headphones and host
device 4715, and wireless pairing between intermediate device 4705 and host device 4715 can
only be initiated via intermediate device 4705 (e.g., in response to user-input by either opening
                                                   62

4715.
[0246]     FIG. 48 illustrates a wireless pairing system 4800 according to an embodiment of the
present disclosure that includes intermediate device 4705, headphones 4710 and host device
4715 shown in FIG. 47. While FIG. 48 illustrates simplified block diagrams of each of
intermediate device 4705, wireless headphones 4710 and host device 4715, it is understood each
of the illustrated devices can include functions and features in addition to those illustrated in
FIG. 48. For example, while not shown in FIG. 48, each of intermediate device 4705, wireless
headphones 4710 and host device 4715 can include a battery, such as a rechargeable battery, that
provides power to the various components of each device.
[0247]     In some embodiments, host device 4715 can be an electronic device or portable media
player, such as an iPod TM media player manufactured and sold by Apple Inc., assignee of the
present application. In general, a media player can be any device capable of storing and playing
media assets including, but not limited to, audio, video, and/or still images. Alternatively, host
device 4715 can be a mobile phone (e. g., using conventional cellular communication
technology), a personal digital assistant (PDA), or a multifunctional device that incorporates a
combination of media player, mobile phone, and/ or PDA capabilities, such as an iPhone        TM
mobile device produced and sold by Apple, Inc. Host device 4715 can also be a general-purpose
computer, such as a handheld computer, laptop computer, desktop computer, or the like.
[0248]     Host device 4715 includes a processor 4820, a memory 4825, a user interface 4830, a
first wireless transceiver 4835 (e.g., a Bluetooth transceiver), a second wireless transceiver 4840
(e.g., a cellular transceiver) and a wired input/output 4845. Processor 4820, which can be
implemented as one or more integrated circuits, can control the operation of host device 4715.
For example, in response to user input signals provided by a user through user interface 4830,
processor 4820 can initiate programs to search, list or play media assets stored in memory 4825.
In communication with cellular transceiver 4840, processor 4820 can control placing and
receiving of telephone calls. Second transceiver 4840 can also be used to communicate data with
a network, including network storage 4815. First transceiver 4835 can be used to support short
range wireless communication (e.g., Bluetooth communication) between host device 4715 and
various accessory devices, including headphones 4710. Memory 4825 can store any
                                                   63

1002035081
information, including Bluetooth pairing information as described in more detail below. Wired
input/output 4845 can be any wired connection, such as a USB protocol or a proprietary
protocol, such as that used by the Apple Lightning      connector.
[0249]     Wireless headphones 4710 can be traditional headphones that are worn over a user's
head, headsets (a combination of a headphone and a microphone), earbuds (very small
headphones that are designed to be fitted directly in a user's ear) or any other portable listening
device. In some embodiments wireless headphones 4710 include a processor 4850, a wired
input/output 4855, a memory 4860 and a wireless transceiver 4865 (e.g., a Bluetooth
transceiver).
[0250]     Processor 4850, which can be implemented as one or more integrated circuits, can
control the operation of headphones 4710. Wired input/output 4855 can be any wired connection
between intermediate device 4705 and wireless headphones 4710 including a proprietary
interconnection. In one example wired input/output 4855 is an electrical connector, such as
connector 347 (see FIG. 3) or any of the connectors illustrated in FIGS. 4A-8C, that provides a
direct electrical connection between wireless headphones 4710 and intermediate device 4705
when the headphones are mated with the intermediate device (e.g., stored in a case). Wired
input/output 4855 can be used for charging wireless headphones 4710 and/or communicating
data with intermediate device 4705. In one example, wired input/output 4855 of headphones
4710 can be used to receive a signal from wired input/output 4875 of intermediate device 4705 to
initiate a pairing sequence of the headphones, as described in more detail below.
[0251]     Wireless transceiver 4865 can be used to support short range wireless communication
(e.g., Bluetooth communication) between headphones 4710 and various host devices, including
host device 4715. In one embodiment, intermediate device 4705 may also be equipped with a
wireless transceiver (not shown; e.g., a Bluetooth transceiver) that can wirelessly communicate
with wireless transceiver 4865. Wireless transceiver 4865 enables headphones 4710 to
communicate wirelessly with host device 4715 once a channel for wireless communication has
been established between the two. For example, headphones 4710 and host device 4715 may
each be provided with Bluetooth@ technology, including appropriate short-range transceiver
units. In some embodiments, it may be possible to establish a Bluetooth* pairing between host
device 4715 and headphones 4710 using conventional techniques, such as manual entry of a
                                                 64

1002035081
passcode (or PIN code) associated with headphones 4710 into host device 4715. In other
embodiments, Bluetooth* pairings can be established automatically as described below.
[0252]     Memory 4860 can store firmware for operating headphones 4710 as well as data for
coupling with other wireless ear buds and for pairing headphones 4710 with companion host
devices. For example, memory 4860 can store a connection history for companion host devices
such as host device 4715, with which headphones 4710 have previously paired. The connection
history can include data for automatically pairing headphones 4710 with the companion host
device without having to configure a connection between the headphones and the companion
host device (e.g., enter a password, exchange shared secrets, etc.). For example, the connection
history can include one or more link keys for connecting to a wireless network (e.g., Bluetooth
link keys). Memory 4860 can also store a MAC address that uniquely identifies headphones
4710 as well as store a paired partner MAC address of another headphone that has previously
coupled with the wireless ear bud 165. For example, in one embodiment headphones 4710 are
wireless earbuds and memory 4860 can store the MAC address of a paired partner earbud.
[0253]     In another example once headphones 4710 are paired with host device 4715, the host
device can save related pairing information from headphones 4710 to a network storage system
4815 such as cloud storage. In one embodiment the related pairing information stored in
network storage 4815 can then be used by other host devices to be pre-paired with wireless
headphones 4710. As an illustrative example, in one embodiment wireless headphones are
initially paired with an iPhone. The iPhone communicates the pairing information to the user's
iTunes or iCloud account that is saved on a remote network separate from host device 4715 (e.g.,
in the iCloud). The wireless headphones will then be listed on the user's iTunes or iCloud
account as an authorized wireless device for the account. For example, the user's iCloud account
may include a first list of host devices (one or more smart phones, one or more tablet computers
and one or more laptop computers) including host device 4715 that are automatically authorized,
for example based on the previous authorization and/or authentication of the devices to the
iCloud account, to be paired with one or more wireless headphones that have been added to the
account (including wireless headphones 4710). The user can then go to their iPad which can be
automatically paired to the headphones without having to initiate a separate pairing sequence
                                                  65

1002035081
between headphones 4710 and the iPad based on the list of approved pairing in the user's iCloud
account. Multiple host devices can be pre-authorized and automatically paired using this feature.
[0254]     In some embodiments, intermediate device 4705 can be a case for headphones 4710, a
docking station, or another type of accessory or electronic device. In some embodiments
intermediate device 4705 includes a processor 4870, a wired input/output 4875, and a user input
device 4880 and a memory 4885.
[0255]     Processor 4870, which can be implemented as one or more integrated circuits, can
control the operation of intermediate device 4705 by executing computer instructions stored in a
computer-readable memory or medium, such as memory 4885. For example, instructions stored
within memory 4885 can cause processor 4870 to, in response to user input signals provided by
user input device 4880, send an instruction to headphones 4710 (e.g., via wired I/O interface
4875 or by a wireless channel between intermediate device 4705 and wireless headphones 4710)
to enter a pairing sequence with a host device. Wired input/output 4875 can be any wired
connection between intermediate device 4705 and wireless headphones 4710 including a
proprietary interconnection. In one example wired input/output 4855 is a portion of an electrical
connector 347 (see FIG. 3) between pair of earbuds 115a, 115b and case 100 and can be any
connector illustrated in FIGS. 4A-8C. Wired input/output 4855 can be used for charging and/or
data. In various embodiments wired input/output 4855 can be used to transmit a signal to
headphones 4710 to initiate a pairing sequence, as described in more detail below.
[0256]     User input device 4880 can be any device operable by a user. In one embodiment user
input device 4880 is a lid sensor such as lid sensor 220 (see FIG. 2) that detects an opening or a
closing of a lid of intermediate device 4705. In one example an opening event is detected and
processor 4870 sends a signal through wired input/output 4875 of intermediate device to wired
input/output 4855 of headphones to processor 4850 of headphones 4710 to initiate a pairing
sequence and/or to turn on Bluetooth transceiver 4865. In another example, wireless headphones
4710 have never been paired before and headphones 4710 enter a pairing sequence. In a further
example headphones 4710 have been paired before and headphones 4710 activate Bluetooth
transceiver 4865 but do not initiate a pairing sequence. In one embodiment intermediate device
4705 may include one or more indicator lights to notify a user that it has sent a pairing signal to
headphones 4710.
                                                 66

1002035081
[0257]     FIG. 49 describes a method 4900 in which an intermediate device (e.g., intermediate
device 4705) initiates wireless pairing between a host device (e.g., host device 4715) and a pair
of wireless headphones (e.g., wireless headphones 4710). The method set forth in FIG. 49 can
be carried out by, for example, a processor within the intermediate device executing computer
instructions stored within a computer-readable memory (e.g., processor 4870 executing
instructions stored in computer-readable memory 4885). In step 4905 the intermediate device
receives a user input. In some embodiments the intermediate device is a case for a pair of
headphones or a pair of earbuds. In various embodiments the user input can be opening a lid of
the case, depressing a button on the case or doing anything else to the case that the case registers
as a user input indicative of a desire to initiate the pairing sequence. In one particular example,
when a user opens a lid of the case, a lid sensor sends a signal to processor 4870 notifying the
processor that the lid has been opened.
[0258]     In step 4910, in response to receiving the user input, the intermediate device determines
if the headphones are connected to the intermediate device. For example, in some embodiments
the intermediate device is an earbud case and the pair of wireless headphones is a pair of wireless
earbuds that fit within earbud receiving cavities of the case. The earbud case can include one or
more earbud detectors as described above that can generate a signal indicating whether and can
determine whether the earbuds are stored within the case as described above and provide a signal
to the processor indicating whether the earbuds are stored within the case. As one particular
example, an earbud case can determine if earbuds are stored within the case based on whether
one or more electrical contacts on the earbuds are electrically connected to one or more electrical
contacts within the case. In another embodiment the intermediate device is a docking station that
couples to the headphones with a mating connector. If some embodiments, if the headphones are
not connected to intermediate device there is no action taken by the intermediate device (step
4912), while if the headphones are connected to the intermediate device the method proceeds to
step 4915. In other embodiments, step 4910 is optional and the intermediate device proceeds
with step 4915 regardless. In such embodiments, however, if the headphones are not
communicatively coupled to the intermediate device, the headphones will not receive the
instruction generated in step 4915 and thus the end result of method 4900 in such cases will be
"no action taken" (step 4912).
                                                    67

1002035081
[0259]     In step 4915, in response to the intermediate device determining that the headphones
are connected to the intermediate device, the intermediate device transmits an "initiate pairing"
instruction or signal to the headphones. In one embodiment the intermediate device transmits the
"initiate pairing" signal through a charging connection between the headphones and the
intermediate device. In another embodiment the intermediate device can send the signal
wirelessly to the headphones. In one example different user inputs result in the intermediate
device transmitting different "initiate pairing" signals to the headphones that are distinguishable
by the headphones. As one example where the intermediate device is a case for a pair of
earbuds, the case can transmit an instruction to the earbuds to automatically pair with a known
and previously paired host when the lid opened. If, the input button is depressed, either before or
after the lid is opened, the case can transmit an instruction to the earbuds to enter a discovery
mode instead of the automatic pairing mode. The discovery mode then enables the earbuds to be
selectively paired by a user to a different host device using a standard pairing sequence. In some
embodiments, as described above, step 4910 is optional and intermediate device transmits an
"initiate pairing" request signal to the headphones without attempting to determine if the
headphones are connected, but if the headphones are not connected, the signal will not be
received.
[0260]     In step 4920 the headphones receive the "initiate pairing" signal from the intermediate
device through an electrical connector, or through a wireless connection.
[0261]     In step 4925, in response to receiving the "initiate pairing" signal, the headphones
determine if a pairing sequence should be initiated. In one embodiment the headphones examine
a pairing memory within the headphones and determine if this is a first pairing or a subsequent
pairing of the headphones. If it is a first pairing the headphone processor can determine what
type of user input was received to determine if pairing should be initiated. For example, for a
first pairing (e.g., the pairing memory of the headphones is empty) if a user opened the lid,
pairing can be initiated, but if a user pushed a button pairing is not initiated. However, if this is a
subsequent pairing (e.g., the pairing memory of the headphones has at least one registry), if a
user opens the lid pairing is not initiated but if a user pushed a button then pairing is initiated.
These are only examples and other logic sequences are within the scope of this disclosure.
                                                    68

1002035081
[0262]     In a further example the headphones will only pair to a host device within a
predetermined proximity of the headphones. In one example the headphones will only pair to a
host electronic device within 10 meters, while in another embodiment it must be within 5 meters
and in a further embodiment within 3 meters and in yet another embodiment within 1 meter.
The maximum proximity pairing distance between the headphones and host device can be set at
either the headphones or at the host device.
[0263]     In some embodiments, the distance can be controlled by the headphones by the strength
of the wireless signal sent from the headphones to the host device. For example, the headphones
can broadcast a pairing signal that is at a predetermined reduced power level to insure that the
electronic device is within a desired proximity. In one embodiment the headphones may
broadcast a pairing signal that is 80% or less of its normal broadcasting power (i.e., its normal
signal strength). In another embodiment the pairing signal may be 50% or less of the normal
signal strength and in a further embodiment it may be 25% or less of the normal signal strength.
[0264]     In some embodiments, the distance can be controlled by the host electronic device
based on the strength of the signal received from the headphones. For example, in some
embodiments the host electronic device will only accept the wireless pairing request from the
first device if the strength of the wireless signal transmitting the pairing request is above a
predetermined threshold that is higher than a minimum signal strength required for normal
wireless communication between the first and second devices. In one embodiment the
predetermined threshold is 200% higher than the normal minimum signal strength required for
wireless communication between the headphones and host device. In another embodiment the
predetermined threshold is 150% higher than the normal minimum signal strength and in still
further embodiments it can be 100% or 50% higher than the normal minimum signal strength.
[0265]     Regardless of the approach taken, if the host electronic device is not sufficiently
proximate the headphones, the headphones will not accept (or will not receive) the pairing
request and no further action to consummate the pairing is taken (step 4927). However if the
required conditions are met, the method proceeds to step 4930.
[0266]     In step 4930, in response to the headphones determining that a pairing sequence should
be initiated (or should continue), the headphones transmit a wireless pairing signal using a
wireless protocol common between the headphones and host device. In some embodiments this
                                                   69

1002035081
may be a standardized recurring Bluetooth signal that can stop after a predetermined period of
time if there is no answer. In other embodiments, other known wireless protocols can be used.
[0267]     In step 4935, in response to receiving the pairing signal, the host device authenticates
and pairs the headphones. In one example the host device provides the user a prompt asking if
pairing should be performed before pairing the headphones. If the user accepts, the host device
sends data to the headphones and authentication of the headphones is performed.
[0268]     In some instances, prior to initiating a wireless pairing sequence between a pair of
wireless headphones and a host device, a case for a pair of wireless earbuds according to the
present disclosure can automatically turn ON the wireless radio of the earbuds when a user opens
the lid that encloses the earbuds within the case. FIG. 50 illustrates a method 5000 in which an
earbud case (e.g., intermediate device 4705) turns ON the wireless radio of a pair of earbuds
(e.g., wireless headphones 4710) stored within the case according to some embodiments of the
disclosure. As shown in FIG. 50, method 5000 can start when intermediate device 4705 detects
that lid 4720 is moved from a closed position to an open position (step 5005).
[0269]     If the earbuds are not in the case, then no action is taken (step 5020). If wireless
headphones 4710 are within the case (step 5010), the case can generate and send an instruction to
the pair of earbuds that causes the earbuds to turn their wireless radio on. In some embodiments
the instruction can be sent over one or more electrical contacts positioned within the receiving
cavity as described above. Once the earbuds turn their wireless radio on, the buds can be further
instructed to initiate a pairing sequence with a host device. In some embodiments, a single user
interaction with the case (e.g., opening lid 4720 or depressing button 4725) can generate
instructions that are sent to the earbuds to both turn on the earbud wireless radio and initiate a
pairing sequence as described with respect to FIG. 49. In some embodiments a single instruction
from intermediate device 4705 can initiate both actions and in other embodiments the case can
send multiple instructions in response to the single event.
[0270]     In other embodiments, the closure of lid 4720 can automatically turn OFF the wireless
radio in the earbuds as described with respect to FIG. 51, which illustrates a method 5100
according to some embodiments of the disclosure. As shown in FIG. 51, method 5100 can start
when intermediate device 4705 detects that lid 4720 is moved from an open position to a closed
position (step 5105). If the earbuds are not in the case, then no action is taken (step 5120). If
                                                   70

1002035081
wireless headphones 4710 are within the case (step 5110), the case can generate and send an
instruction to the pair of earbuds that causes the earbuds to turn OFF their wireless radio thus
saving charge of the batteries within the earbuds.
[0271]     While the various embodiments and examples described above were primarily focused
on earbuds and a case for storing such earbuds, embodiments of the disclosure are not limited to
such and the techniques of the disclosure described above are equally applicable to headphones
and other listening devices and cases for such. For example, in one embodiment, case 100
described in FIG. 1 can be a case for a pair of headphones instead of a pair of earbuds. In such
an embodiment, cavities 1 10a, 1 Ob can be sized and shaped to hold left and right earpads of the
headphones along with portions of a band connecting the two earpads. In other embodiments, a
single cavity can be included in the case to hold the earpads and some or all of the connecting
headband. Similarly, in other embodiments, case 100 can be sized and shaped to hold a portable
speaker or other type of listening device.
[0272]     For simplicity, various internal components, such as circuitry, bus, memory, storage
devices and other components of pair of earbuds 115a, 115b, case 100 (see FIG. 1) and wearable
electronic device 2301(see FIG. 23) are sometimes not shown in the figures. Also, it is noted
that some embodiments have been described as a process that is depicted as a flow diagram or
block diagram. Although each diagram may describe the process as a sequential series of
operations, many of the operations can be performed in parallel or concurrently. In addition, the
order of the operations may be rearranged. A process may have additional steps not included in
the figures.
[0273]     In the foregoing specification, embodiments of the disclosure have been described with
reference to numerous specific details that may vary from implementation to implementation.
The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a
restrictive sense. The sole and exclusive indicator of the scope of the disclosure, and what is
intended by the applicants to be the scope of the disclosure, is the literal and equivalent scope of
the set of claims that issue from this application, in the specific form in which such claims issue,
including any subsequent correction. The specific details of particular embodiments may be
combined in any suitable manner without departing from the spirit and scope of embodiments of
the disclosure. Additionally, spatially relative terms, such as "bottom" or "top" and the like may
                                                  71

1002035081
be used to describe an element and/or feature's relationship to another element(s) and/or
feature(s) as, for example, illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially
relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use and/or
operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the
figures is turned over, elements described as a "bottom" surface may then be oriented "above"
other elements or features. The device may be otherwise oriented (e.g., rotated 90 degrees or at
other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.
[0274]     The following list of embodiments and examples are set forth to provide additional
support and details indicative of the scope and breadth of various embodiments of the present
invention. For convenience and ease of reference, the embodiments and examples are listed
under different headings. It is to be understood that various features listed under one particular
heading can be included in or used with embodiments listed under a different heading.
EARBUD CASE WITH CHARGING SYSTEM
[0275]     In some embodiments a case for transporting and charging a portable listening device
that includes a rechargeable battery and a power contact is provided. The portable listening
device case can include a housing configured to receive the listening device; a lid attached to the
housing and operable between a closed position where the lid conceals the listening device
within the case and an open position where the lid is displaced from the housing such that a user
can remove the listening device from the case; a detector configured to generate a detect signal
when the listening device is placed in the housing; and charging circuitry configured to initiate
charging of the rechargeable battery in response to receiving the detect signal.
[0276]     In some embodiments a case for a pair of earbuds includes a housing having one or
more cavities configured to receive the pair of earbuds; a lid attached to the housing and operable
between a closed position where the lid is aligned over the one or more cavities and an open
position where the lid is displaced from the one or more cavities; and a charging system. The
charging system can include a case battery; an earbud detector configured to detect when an
earbud is placed in the one or more cavities; and charging circuitry configured to initiate
charging of the earbud when the earbud detector detects that the earbud is inserted into the one or
more cavities. The one or more cavities can include a first cavity configured to receive a first
                                                   72

1002035081
earbud in the pair of earbuds and a second cavity sized and shaped to receive a second earbud in
the pair of earbuds. The earbud detector can include a first earbud sensor configured to detect
when the first earbud is placed in first cavity and a second earbud sensor configured to detect
when the second earbud is placed in the second cavity. In some instances, each of the first and
second earbud sensors can detect insertion of their respective earbud by detecting a magnetic
field generated by the earbud and the charging circuitry can be configured to initiate charging of
the first earbud when the first earbud sensor detects the first earbud within the first cavity and
initiate charging of the second earbud when the second earbud sensor detects the second earbud

which the lid covers the receiving opening; and a plurality of magnetic elements disposed within
the housing and the lid, the plurality of magnetic elements configured to create an over center
position for the lid such that the lid resists rotating from the open position to the closed position

magnetic elements is a magnet and the other magnetic element is a magnetic material. The over
center position can be created by combination of repulsive forces between the first and the
second magnetic elements, attractive forces between the second and third magnetic elements and
a distance of the first, the second, the third and the fourth magnetic elements from the pivotable
joint.

to the closed position until the lid is moved past the over center position where the lid is impelled
to the closed position. In some examples the plurality of magnetic elements can include a first
pair of magnetic elements oriented such that they repel each other and are located proximate a
pivotable joint connecting the housing to the lid, with a first magnetic element of the first pair
disposed within the case and a second magnetic element of the first pair disposed within the lid.
In some examples the plurality of magnetic elements can include a second pair of magnetic
elements oriented such that they attract each other and are located opposite the pivotable joint,
