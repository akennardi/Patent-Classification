                                           DESCRIPTION
[0026] Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numerals designate the same or
corresponding parts throughout the several views, FIGs. 1 and 2 are perspective views from right
and left sides, respectively (from the position of the operator), of one embodiment of a
demolition shear attachment 10. The shear attachment 10 has a main body 12 with a forward end
14 and a rearward end 16. The rearward end 16 is adapted to be operably mounted to the boom
or stick 18 (FIG. 3A) of an excavator such as by a swivel attachment 19 or other suitable
mounting attachment as recocognized and understood by those of skill in the art. At the forward
end 14 of the main body 12 is a movable upper jaw 40 and a fixed lower 42 (discussed in detail
later).
[0027] FIGs. 3A-3C show the shear attachment 10 mounted to the boom or stick of an excavator
18 of an excavator, and positioned in a typical operating position, and illustrating the movement
of the upper jaw 40 closing with respect to the lower jaw 42 over an object 11 to be sheared. The
object 11 to be sheared may be any structural member, such as a steel I-beam or channel, steel
plate, pipe or some other material, such as scrap metal, sheet metal or any other object or
material for which a demolition shear is suited for handling or processing.
[0028] Referring to FIGs. 1-4, the main body 12 is typically constructed of steel side plates 20,
22, a top plate 24 and a bottom plate 26 which together define a substantially enclosed area
within which a hydraulic actuator 30 (FIGs. 3A-3C) and other hydraulic components of the shear
attachment 10 are substantially enclosed and protected. The hydraulic actuator 30 is pivotally
secured at a rearward end within the main body 12 by an actuator pivot pin 32 extending through

                                                 7
the side plates 20, 22, internal gussets (not shown) and the cylinder rod clevis 34. The forward
end of the hydraulic actuator 30 is pivotally attached to the movable upper jaw 40 by a cylinder
pin 36 extending through the cylinder body clevis 38 and cylinder pin bore 39 (see also FIG. 17)
in a rearward lobe of the upper jaw 40. Thus, it should also be appreciated, that as the hydraulic
actuator 30 extends and retracts as illustrated in FIGs. 3A-3C, the upper jaw 40 rotates about the
longitudinal axis of the jaw pivot shaft assembly 60 (discussed below) to open and close the
upper jaw 40 with respect to the lower jaw 42. An access opening with an access cover 25
(FIG. 2) may be provided in the top plate to gain access to the interior of the body 12 for
installation, maintenance, servicing and repair of the hydraulic actuator and other components of
the hydraulic system.
 [0029] As best illustrated in FIGs. 4, 8 and 9, jaw bosses 44, 46 on each side of the forward end
 14 of the main body 12 include hub bores 48, 50. A jaw pivot shaft assembly 60 received
within the hub bores 48, 50 and through a pivot shaft bore 54 (see FIG. 17) pivotally supports
the upper jaw 40.
 [0030] The jaw pivot shaft assembly 60 comprises flanged bushings 56, 58 fitted within the hub
bores 48, 50. A main shaft 62 is press-fit into the pivot shaft bore 54 for rotation with the upper
jaw 40. The main shaft 62 includes a central bore 64 which receives a tie rod 66 having
threaded ends 68. End caps 70, 72 are secured to the flanged bushings 56, 58 by threaded
connectors extending through aligned holes in the flange bushings 56, 58 and are threadably
received by aligned internally threaded holes in the hubs 44, 46. Tie rod nuts 74 threadably
receive the threaded ends 68 of the tie rods 66. The tie rod nuts 74 are secured to the end caps
70, 72 by threaded connectors threadably received into internally threaded aligned holes in the
flange bushings 56, 58. It should be appreciated that the tie rod 66 and tie rod nuts 74 laterally
restrain the hubs 48, 50 against lateral forces exerted on the jaws during the shearing operation.
 [0031] As best viewed in FIGs. 4 and 8, lateral jaw stabilizing puck assemblies 80, such as
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 7,216,575, may be provided along with corresponding wear plates
or wear surfaces 82 (FIG. 17) on the adjacent side or sides of the upper jaw 40 to resist lateral
movement of the upper jaw 40 during the shearing operation until the upper jaw enters the slot
96 of the lower jaw 42 (discussed below).

                                                   8
[0032] Referring to FIGs. 5-11, the lower jaw 42 includes forwardly extending, laterally spaced
and substantially parallel jaw beams 90, 92 and a cross-beam 94 extending transversely between
the forward ends of the laterally spaced jaw beams 90, 92. The laterally spaced jaw beams 90,
92 and the cross beam 94 together define a slot 96 into which the upper jaw 40 is received during
the shearing process (see FIGs. 3C and FIG. 4). As discussed in more detail below, the
forwardly extending jaw beam 90 is adapted to receive shear blade inserts and guide blade
inserts and is hereinafter referred to as the blade-side jaw beam 90. The other forwardly
extending jaw beam 92 serves to provide structural rigidity to the lower jaw and also serves to
laterally restrain and guide the upper jaw into the slot 96 during the shearing process and is
hereinafter referred to as the guide-side jaw beam 92.
[0033] As best viewed in FIG. 10, the inner side of the blade-side jaw beam 90 includes a shear
blade seat 100 which is adapted to receive a set of hardened steel shear blade inserts 110 (FIGs. 7
and 8). An embodiment of the shear blade inserts 110 is illustrated in FIG. 12. The shear blade
inserts 110 each have generally planar vertical wear surfaces 114, 116 and generally planar
horizontal wear surfaces 118, 120. The intersection of the vertical and horizontal wear surfaces
define four shearing edges 122. The shear blade inserts 110 have parallel sloping end surfaces
124, 126 creating a parallelogram configuration so that when the shear blade inserts 110 are
positioned and oriented in the shear blade seat 100 the adjacent end surfaces bear against each
another in a downward apex (see FIGs. 7 and 8). It should be appreciated, that because the shear
blade inserts 110 are in the shape of identical parallelepiped, they may be rotated and oriented
with respect to one another within the shear blade seat 100 so that all four shearing edges 122
may be used as the shearing edges wear during use. The planar vertical wear surfaces 114, 116
include counterbore holes 130 for receiving threaded connectors 132 (preferably socket headed
cap screws) to removably attach the shear blade inserts 110 within the shear blade seat 100. The
counterbore holes 130 permit the heads of the threaded connectors 132 to be seated within the
counterbore. The threaded ends of the threaded connectors 132 extend through the counterbore
holes 130 and through aligned holes 134 (FIG. 10) in the shear blade seat 100 and are secured by
nuts 136 (FIGs. 5 and 9), received within counterbore holes 138 on the outer side of the blade
side jaw beam 90.
[0034] As best viewed in FIG. 10, the inner side of the blade-side jaw beam 90 also includes a

                                                 9
guide blade seat 200 which is adapted to receive a hardened steel guide blade insert 210 (best
viewed in FIG. 8). An embodiment of the guide blade insert 210 is illustrated in FIG. 13. The
guide blade insert 210 has generally planar vertical wear surfaces 214, 216 and generally planar
horizontal wear surfaces 218, 220. The intersections of the vertical and horizontal wear surfaces
define four shearing edges 222. The guide blade insert 210 has parallel sloping end surfaces 224,
226 creating a parallelogram configurations. The sloping end surfaces 224, 226 of the guide
blade insert 210 are complimentary to the sloping end surfaces 124, 126 of the shear blade
inserts 110 so that when the guide blade insert 210 is positioned and oriented in the guide blade
seat 200 one of its end surfaces 224, 226 will bear against one of the end surfaces 124, 126 of the
adjacently positioned shear blade insert 110 (as best illustrated in FIG. 8). It should be
appreciated, that because the guide blade insert 210 is in the shape of a parallelepiped, it may be
rotated and oriented within the guide blade seat 200 (and switched with the guide-side guide
blade seat 300 discussed below) so that all four shearing edges 222 may be used as the shearing
edges wear during use. The vertical wear surfaces 214, 216 include tapped internally threaded
holes 230 for receiving threaded connectors 232 (e.g., bolts) to removably attach the guide blade
insert 210 within the guide blade seat 200. The threaded ends of the threaded connectors 232
extend through aligned counterbore holes 234 (FIGs. 5 and 9) on the outer side of the blade-side
beam 90 and are threadably received by the tapped internally threaded holes 230 in the guide
blade insert 210.
[0035] As best viewed in FIGs. 9 and 11, the guide-side beam 92 also includes a guide-blade
seat 300 (FIG. 11) which is adapted to receive the same guide blade insert 210 as received in the
blade-side guide blade seat 200 so that the guide blade inserts 210 are interchangeable between
the guide-side guide blade seat 300 and the blade-side guide blade seat 200. Accordingly, the
guide blade insert 210 is retained and secured in the guide-side guide blade seat 300 in
substantially the same manner as the blade-side guide blade seat 200 in that the same threaded
connectors 232 (e.g., bolts) extend through aligned counterbore holes 334 (FIGs. 7, 8, 10) on the
outer side of the guide-side jaw beam 92 and are threadably received by the tapped holes 230 in
the guide blade insert 210.
[0036] As best viewed in FIGs. 9 and 11, the cross-beam 94 includes a cross-blade seat 400
(FIG. 11) which is adapted to receive a hardened steel cross-blade insert 410 (FIG. 9). An

                                                10
embodiment of the cross-blade insert 410 is illustrated in FIG. 14. The cross-blade insert 410
has a generally planar front wear surface 414, generally planar top and bottom wear surfaces
418, 420, generally planar end surfaces 424, 426 and a back side 428. The back side 428
includes four equally radially spaced internally threaded holes 430. The back side 428 is also
keyed with a projection 432 which seats within a recess 435 (FIG. 11) in the cross-blade seat
400. The intersection of the front vertical wear surface 414 with the top and bottom wear
surfaces 418, 420 and end surfaces 424, 426 define four cutting edges 422. The cross-blade
insert 410 is preferably square with four radially spaced holes 430 so that it may be rotated 90
degrees four times within the cross-blade seat 400 so that all four cutting edges 422 may be used
as the shearing edges wear during use. The cross-blade insert 410 is secured within the cross
blade seat 400 by threaded connectors 434 (such as bolts) extending through counterbore holes
436 (FIGs. 5 and 7) in the cross-beam 94. The ends of the threaded connectors 434 are received
within the aligned internally threaded holes 430 in the back side surface 428 of cross-blade
insert 410.
[0037] The upper jaw 40 has a blade-side and a guide-side which correspond to the adjacent
blade-side jaw beam 90 and guide-side beam 92 of the lower jaw 42. The blade-side of the
upper jaw 40 includes a shear blade seat 500 (FIG. 6) which is adapted to receive the same shear
blade inserts 110 (FIG. 5) as used in the shear blade seat 100 of the lower jaw 42 so that the
shear blade inserts 110 are interchangeable between the upper and lower jaws, thereby reducing
the number of different blade configurations needed for the shear attachment 10. However, in
the upper jaw, the shear blade inserts 110 are oriented in an upward apex as opposed to the
downward apex in the lower jaw (compare FIGs. 5 and 7) . The shear blade inserts 110 are
secured in the upper jaw in substantially the same manner as the lower jaw. The threaded ends
of the threaded connectors 132 extend through the counterbore holes 130 and through aligned
holes 534 in the upper shear blade seat 500 and are secured by nuts 136 received within
counterbores 538 (FIG. 7) on the guide-side of the upper jaw 40.
[0038] Referring to FIGs. 6, 10 and 17, the forward most end of the upper jaw 40 or nose 601
includes a nose seat 600 adapted to receive a hardened steel piercing tip insert 610 (FIGs. 5, 7,
17) to protect the parent material of the upper jaw nose from wear during use. The nose seat
600 includes a blade-side nose seat 602 (FIGs. 6 and 17), a guide-side nose seat 604 (FIG. 10),
and a front nose seat 606 (FIGs. 6, 10, 17) which results in a narrowed nose portion 608. The
forward-most nose tip 609 of the nose seat 600 is preferably radiused to minimize stress

                                                11
concentrations on the nose portion 608, both during the manufacturing process and during use.
The piercing tip insert 610 is comprised of two halves 620, 622 which are substantially mirror
images of each other except for the connector holes in each half (discussed later). The half
which extends over the blade-side of the nose is hereinafter referred to as the blade-side half
620, and the half which extends over the guide-side of the nose is hereinafter referred to as the
guide-side half 622.
[0039] FIG. 15 shows various views of an embodiment of the blade-side half 620. FIG. 16
shows similar views of an embodiment of the guide-side half 622. Each of the piercing tip
halves 620, 622 includes an outer sidewall 630 having a substantially planar vertical wear
surface 632 and a substantially planar vertical inner bearing surface 634. Each half 620, 622
also includes a laterally inward projecting front wall 636 having an outer curved wear surface
638 and an inner bearing surface 640. Each piercing tip half 620, 622 also includes a laterally
inward projecting bottom leg 642 having a bottom planar wear surface 644 and an upper leg
bearing surface 646. Each of the piercing tip halves 620, 622 further includes an end bearing
surface 648 and an ear 650 having upper ear bearing surface 651 and a lower ear bearing surface
653. The ear 650 may have a radiused periphery to reduce stress concentrations. The lower ear
bearing surface 653 extends rearwardly of the end bearing surface 648, the purpose of which is
discussed later in connection with FIGs. 22 and 23. The intersection of the planar vertical wear
surface 632 and the bottom planar wear surface 644 defines a shearing edge 652. The
intersection of the curved wear surface 638 of the front wall 636 and the bottom planar wear
surface 644 defines a front piercing edge 654 (the front piercing edge may be chamfered).
[0040] As best viewed in FIGs. 6, 10 and 17, the nose seats 602, 604, 606 define peripheral
bearing edge surfaces 656 which complimentarily receive the outer peripheries of the piercing
tip halves 620, 622. It should be appreciated that the inner surface 640 of the laterally inward
projecting front wall 636 and the upper surface 646 of the laterally inward projecting bottom leg
642 of each piercing tip half 620, 622 is approximately half the width of the narrowed nose
portion 608 so that when the piercing tip halves 620, 622 are mounted in the nose seat 600, the
inner bearing surfaces 634 of the sidewalls 630 and the upper leg bearing surfaces 646 of the
bottom legs 642 of the piercing tip halves 620, 622 bear against the respective bearing surfaces
of the blade-side nose seat 602, the guide-side nose seat 604 and the front nose seat 606.

                                                 12
Additionally, the upper ear bearing surface 651 and the lower ear bearing surface 653 of the tip
halves 620, 622 bear against peripheral bearing edge surfaces 656 of the nose seat 600. On the
blade-side of the nose 601, one of the sloping ends 124, 126 (depending on orientation) of the
upper shear blade insert 110 abuts and bears against the back end bearing surface 648 of the
blade-side half 620. As such, the blade-side piercing tip half 620 is rotationally restrained from
outward rotation (as discussed later) by both the blade insert 110 and the peripheral bearing edge
surfaces 656 which mateably receive of the upper ear bearing surface 651 and the lower ear
bearing surface 653 of the blade-side nose seat. The guide-side piercing tip half 622 is
rotationally restrained from movement by the peripheral bearing edge surfaces 656 which
mateably receive of the upper ear bearing surface 651 and the lower ear bearing surface 653 of
the guide-side nose seat 604.
[0041] It should be appreciated that when the two piercing tip halves 620, 622 are mounted in
the nose seat 600, the narrowed nose portion 608 is completely surrounded by the hardened steel
piercing tip insert 610 thereby protecting the parent material of the nose 601 from wear during
use.
[0042] In addition to being rotationally restrained by the peripheral bearing edge surfaces 656,
the two piercing tip halves 620, 622 are secured to the narrowed nose tip 608 with threaded
connectors 670. In a preferred embodiment, the threaded connectors are socket headed cap
screws. The two halves 620, 622 include aligned holes 660 through their respective outer
sidewalls 632. Corresponding aligned holes 664 are provided through the narrowed nose tip 608.
Concentric counterbores 668 are provided over the holes 660 in the outer wall 632 of the blade
side half 620. The aligned holes 660 in the outer wall 632 of the guide-side half 622 are tapped
with internal threads. The counterbores 668 permit the heads of the threaded connectors 670 to
be seated within the counterbores 668. The threaded ends of the threaded connectors 670 extend
through the holes 660 in blade-side half 620 and through the aligned holes 664 in the narrow
nose tip 608 and are threadably received by the internally threaded aligned holes 660 of the
guide-side tip half 622. Obviously, the counterbores 668 and the internal threaded holes 660 in
the two tip halves 620, 622 could be reversed if desired. Alternatively, counterbores 668 could
be provided in outer walls 632 of both tip halves 620, 622 for receiving the heads of the threaded
connectors 670 and to receive a nut (not shown) on the opposing tip half rather than tapping the

                                                   13
holes 660 of one of the halves. As discussed in more detail later in connection with FIGs. 18 and
22, the holes 660, 664 are aligned along an arc concentric with the front edge of the piercing tip
610 (i.e., the outer curved wear surface 638) to ensure a more uniform loading across the
threaded connectors 670.
[0043] It should be appreciated that when mounted to the upper jaw 40, the planar vertical wear
surfaces 114, 116 (depending on orientation) of the shear blade inserts 110 are substantially co
planar with the vertical wear surface 632 of the blade-side tip half 620 and the shearing edges
122, 652 of the shear blade inserts 110 and piercing tip insert 610 are substantially aligned.
Similarly, on the lower jaw 42, the planar vertical wear surfaces 114, 116 (depending on
orientation) of the shear blade inserts 110 are substantially coplanar with the vertical wear
surface 214 of the blade-side guide blade insert 210 and their respective shearing edges 122, 222
are substantially aligned. It should also be appreciated that the substantially coplanar vertical
wear surfaces 114, 116, 632 and shearing edges 122, 652 of the upper shear blade inserts and
piercing tip insert 610 are slightly laterally, inwardly offset from the shearing edges 122, 232 of
the shear blade inserts 110 and blade-side guide blade insert 210 of the lower jaw (preferably
between a range of about 0.01 inches and 0.05 inches), to permit the upper shearing edges to pass
by the shearing edges of the lower jaw as the upper jaw moves through its range of motion and
into the slot 96 of the lower jaw 42. Likewise, the shearing edge 652 of the guide-side piercing
tip half 622 is laterally inwardly offset from the shearing edge 222 of the guide-side guide blade
insert 210 preferably between a range of about 0.01 inches and 0.05 inches. Accordingly, the
width of the piercing tip insert 610 is less than the width between the opposing shearing edges
222 of the blade-side and guide-side guide blades 210 (preferably between a range of about 0.02
and 0.1 inches), such that the piercing tip insert 610 can pass between the lower dual guide
blades 210 as the upper jaw closes into the slot 96 of the lower jaw 42. Shims may be inserted
between the various inserts 110, 210, 610 and their respective seats 100, 200, 300, 500, 600 to
maintain the close tolerances between the respective shearing edges.
[0044] FIGs. 18-22 are enlarged side elevation views of the jaws 40, 42 to better illustrate the
relationship of the blade inserts 110, 210 and piercing tip insert 610 cross-blade insert 410 during
movement of the upper jaw -- i.e., from the fully open position (FIG. 18), to the fully closed
position (FIG. 21) in which the upper jaw reaches full depth into the slot 96 of the lower jaw 42.

                                                   14
FIG. 19, shows the upper jaw partially closed wherein the front piercing edge 654 of the piercing
tip insert 610 is perpendicular or normal to the ground surface. FIG. 20, shows the upper jaw in
a position where the front piercing edge 654 intersects the lower jaw 42.
[0045] A nose wear shoe 700 is secured (such as by welding) to the nose 601 of the upper jaw 40
above the piercing tip insert 610 to protect the parent material of the upper jaw from wear during
use. As the nose wear shoe 700 wears down, it may be removed and replaced with another wear
shoe 700. The wear shoe 700 may be fabricated from the same material as the parent material or
it may be fabricated from hardened steel. Referring to FIG. 20, the nose wear shoe preferably
extends along the nose a sufficient distance to ensure that the parent material of the nose is
protected to at least the full depth of entry of the upper jaw 40 into the lower jaw 42. In an
alternative embodiment, the piercing tip insert 610 may be extended along the nose 601 to the
full dept of entry of the upper jaw into the lower jaw. In such an embodiment, the nose seat 600
would likewise be extended and additional holes 660 may be necessary to adequately restrain the
longer piercing tip insert 610 to the narrowed nose 608.
[0046] It should be appreciated that the parent material of the nose 601 above the piercing tip
insert 610 is more susceptible to wear than the hardened steel piercing tip insert 610.
Accordingly, without a wear shoe 700, the nose 601 could wear down to the point that the upper
edge of the piercing tip insert 610 projects above the nose. If the upper edge of the piercing tip
insert 610 projects outwardly from the nose 601, the projection could potentially snag on
material caught in the jaws as the upper jaw re-opens or is retracted from the lower jaw. If
sufficient retract force is exerted on the upper jaw, the piercing tip insert could be pulled away
from the nose by the snagged material, shearing the threaded connectors in the process or
breaking the piercing tip insert. Accordingly, as hereinafter described, the nose 601 of the upper
jaw is configured to minimize the risk of snagging, even when a wear shoe 700 is not mounted to
the nose 601 or where the wear shoe itself is worn down such that the parent material of the nose
is no longer protected by the wear shoe.
[0047] FIGs. 18 and 21 illustrate a preferred configuration of the nose 601 to avoid or minimize
occurrences of snagging. The phantom line designated by reference numeral 800 identifies the
arc created by the forward most front piercing tip edge 654 of the piercing tip insert 610 as the

                                                  15
upper jaw moves through its range of motion. The arc 800 has a radius RI to the center axis of
the jaw pivot shaft 60. The outermost periphery of the nose 601 from the forward piercing edge
654 of the piercing tip 610 to the end of the nose wear shoe 700 or to the point on the nose which
corresponds to the maximum depth that the nose 601 penetrates the lower jaw is configured to
transitions away from the front piercing tip edge arc 800 in a substantially smooth nose arc 802.
The nose arc 802 has a radius R2 which is less than the radius RI, such that radial distances from
the central axis of the jaw pivot shaft 60 to points along the nose 601 or nose arc 802 continually
decrease relative to the front piercing tip edge arc 800. Stated another way, the distance between
the piercing tip front edge arc 800 and the nose arc 802 continually increases along the nose 601
or nose arc 802 from the piercing tip front edge 654. This configuration allows the nose 601 to
only make contact at the piercing tip front edge 654, thereby avoiding or reducing the likelihood
of the nose 601 scraping along objects being pierced by the piercing tip 610, thereby minimizing
wear along the nose. Additionally, because the nose increasingly transitions away from the
piercing tip edge arc 800, it reduces the likelihood of snagging of material caught in the jaws
even if the parent material of the nose becomes worn down to where the upper edge of the
piercing tip insert 610 projects outwardly from the worn parent material of the nose.
[0048] Furthermore, the piercing tip seat 600 and piercing tip insert 610 are configured to ensure
retention of the piercing tip if a projecting edge of the piercing tip becomes snagged or if the
upper jaw becomes jammed by material trapped in the jaws. For example, in FIG. 22 the hatched
area 900 is intended to represent trapped or lodged material caught between the wear surfaces of
the piercing tip insert 610 and the guide shear blade inserts 210 causing the upper jaw to become
jammed within the slot 96 of the lower jaw 42 such that the upper jaw 40 cannot retract or re
open. The retract force F of the upper jaw 40 (exerted by the hydraulic actuator 30 pulling on
the upper jaw) attempts to pull the piercing tip insert 610 in the direction perpendicular to the
radial line 806 extending from the center axis of the jaw pivot shaft 60 to the midpoint of the
trapped material 900. It should therefore be appreciated that any bearing surface which is less
than 90 degrees to the radial line 806, will resist the retract force F. Accordingly, the rearwardly
projecting ears 650 of the piercing tip insert 610 ensure that a bearing surface is provided to
resist the retract force F.
[0049] Referring to FIG. 22, the lower ear bearing surface 653 is at an angle less than 90 degrees

                                                  16
to the radial line 806 and therefore provides a bearing surface designated by arrows R against
which the peripheral bearing edge surfaces 656 of the nose seat 600 engage to resist the retract
force F. Similarly, the inner bearing surface 640 of the front wall 636 bears against the nose seat
606 as designated by arrows R to resist the retract force F. Thus, the resistance or reactionary
forces R will reduce the shearing forces being exerted on the connectors 670 by the retract force
F, thereby preventing or minimizing the piercing tip insert 610 from being pulled off the nose or
otherwise fracturing.
[0050] Furthermore, because the holes 660 in the piercing tip insert 610 are aligned along an arc
804 having a radius R3 which is less than the radius R2 but which is concentric with the nose arc
802, a more uniform load is applied across all of the connectors 670 thereby further reducing the
shearing stresses exerted on any one connector or causing stress concentrations which could
shear the connectors or cause the piercing tip insert to fracture.
[0051] FIG. 23 illustrates another example wherein the hatched area 902 is intended to represent
material trapped between the piercing tip insert 610 and the cross-blade insert 410. In this
example, the retract force F again pulls the piercing tip in the direction perpendicular to the
radial line from 806 extending from the center axis of the jaw pivot shaft 60 to the center point
the trapped material, which, in this example, is assumed to be at the piercing tip front edge 654.
The retract force F will cause the piercing tip insert 610 to attempt to roll outwardly or away
from the nose 601 as indicated by arrow 810. However, the upper ear bearing surface 651
engages with the peripheral bearing edge surfaces 656 of the nose seat 600 as designated by
reactionary forces R to resist the outward rotation of the piercing tip insert 610 thereby reducing
shearing forces on the connectors 670 and preventing or reducing stress fracturing of the piercing
tip insert 610.
[0052] FIG. 24 illustrates an example of the retract force F acting on the upper edge of the
piercing tip insert 610 in the unlikely event that the nose 601 is worn down to create a ridge upon
which material could snag as described above. Such an occurrence is unlikely in view of the
configuration of the nose 601 having a continually increasing distance between the nose arc 802
and the piercing tip front edge arc 800 for the reasons explained above, but nevertheless, if the
nose is worn down to create a ridge on which material could snag, the upper ear bearing surface

                                                   17
651 would engage against the peripheral bearing edge surfaces 656 of the nose seat 600 as
indicated by reaction forces R to resist the retract force F attempting to roll the piercing tip edge
outwardly as indicated by arrow 810 thereby reducing shearing forces on the connectors 670 and
preventing or reducing stress fracturing of the piercing tip insert 610.
