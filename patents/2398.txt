                                              ABSTRACT
        Block chain-based multifactor personal identity verification may be provided. Verification
addresses may be established on a block chain by: associating identifiers with individuals having
previously veri-fied personal identities, assigning verification addresses on a block chain to the
individuals, and recording identifiers and biometric data associated with the individuals at
corresponding verification addresses. Block chain-based multifactor personal identity verification
using the verification ad-dresses may be performed by: receiving one or more identifiers in
connection with one or more requests to verify an identity of one or more indi-viduals, extracting the
biometric data associated with the one or more indi-viduals from the corresponding verification
addresses, and verifying the identity of the one or more individuals upon receiving matching
biometric data and private keys.

SUMMARY
(02)    One aspect of the disclosure relates to a system for providing block chain
based multifactor personal identity verification. The system may include one or more
hardware processors configured by machine-readable instructions to establish
verification addresses on a block chain and/or perform block chain-based multifactor
personal identity verification using the verification addresses. Establishing
verification addresses on the block chain may include associating identifiers with
individuals having previously verified personal identities, a first identifier being
associated a first individual, the first individual having a previously verified personal
identity; assigning verification addresses on a block chain to the individuals, a given
verification address including a public key and a private key, a first verification
address being assigned to the first individual, the first verification address including a
first public key and a first private key; and recording identifiers and biometric data
associated with the individuals at corresponding verification addresses, the first
identifier and first biometric data associated with the first individual being recorded at
the first verification address. Performing block chain-based multifactor personal
identity verification using the verification addresses may include receiving one or

                                               2
more identifiers in connection with one or more requests to verify an identity of one

verification address; and verifying the identity of the one or more individuals upon
receiving matching biometric data and private keys, the personal identity of the first
individual being verified upon receipt of (1) biometric data matching the first biometric
data and (2) a private key matching the first private key.
(03)    Another aspect of the disclosure relates to a method for establishing
verification addresses on a block chain in order to provide block chain-based
multifactor personal identity verification. The method may be performed by one or

key; and recording identifiers and biometric data associated with the individuals at
corresponding verification addresses, the first identifier and first biometric data
associated with the first individual being recorded at the first verification address.
The identity of the one or more individuals may be verifiable upon receiving matching

                                              3
biometric data and private keys, such that the personal identity of the first individual
is verifiable upon receipt of (1) biometric data matching the first biometric data and
(2) a private key matching the first private key.
(04)     Yet another aspect of the disclosure relates to a method for perform block
chain-based multifactor personal identity verification using verification addresses.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
(09)    FIG. 1 illustrates a system 100 for providing block chain-based multifactor
personal identity verification, in accordance with one or more implementations. In
some implementations, system 100 may include one or more servers 102. The
server(s) 102 may be configured to communicate with one or more computing
platforms 104 according to a client/server architecture, a peer-to-peer architecture,

                                           5
and/or other architectures. The users may access system 100 via computing
platform(s) 104.
(10)    The server(s) 102 may be configured to execute machine-readable
instructions 106. The machine-readable instructions 106 may include one or more of
an individual identifier component 108, a verification address assignment component
110, an address recordation component 112, a user interface component 114, a
verification request component 116, an information extraction component 118, an
identity verification component 120, and/or other machine-readable instruction
components.
(11)    The machine-readable instructions 106 may be executable to establish
verification addresses on a block chain. Generally speaking, a block chain is a
transaction database shared by some or all nodes participating in system 100. Such
participation may be based on the Bitcoin protocol, Ethereum protocol, and/or other
protocols related to digital currencies and/or block chains. A full copy of the block
chain contains every transaction ever executed in an associated digital currency. In
addition to transactions, other information may be contained by the block chain, such
as described further herein.
(12)    The block chain may be based on several blocks. A block may include a
record that contains and confirms one or more waiting transactions. Periodically
(e.g., roughly every one minute), a new block including transactions and/or other
information may be appended to the block chain. In some implementations, a given
block in the block chain contains a hash of the previous block. This may have the
effect of creating a chain of blocks from a genesis block (i.e., the first block in the

                                             6
block chain) to a current block. The given block may be guaranteed to come
chronologically after a previous block because the previous block's hash would
otherwise not be known. The given block may be computationally impractical to
modify once it is included in the block chain because every block after it would also
have to be regenerated.
(13)    A given verification address may include a specific location on the block chain
where certain information is stored. In some implementations, an individual
verification address may be referred to as an "AtenVerify Address." Verification
addresses are further described below in connection with verification address
assignment component 110.
(14)    The individual identifier component 108 may be configured to associated
identifiers with individuals having previously verified personal identities. For
example, a first identifier may be associated a first individual. The first individual
may have a previously verified personal identity. Generally speaking, an identifier
may include one or more of a number, an alphanumeric code, a username, and/or
other information that can be linked to an individual. In some implementations, an
individual identifier may be referred to as an "Aten ID."
(15)    In accordance with some implementations, an individual having a previously
verified personal identity may have obtained the previously verified personal identity
through a variety of approaches. For example, in some implementations the
individual may be required to provide evidence of the individual's identity. Such
evidence may include one or more of providing a copy of a government issued
identification (e.g., passport and/or driver's license), providing a copy of mail

                                              7
received by the individual (e.g., a utility bill), evidence provided by a third party,
and/or other evidence on an individual's identity. The evidence may be provided to
an entity associated with server(s) 102.
(16)     The verification address assignment component 110 may be configured to
assign verification addresses on a block chain to the individuals. A given verification
address may include a public key and a private key. By way of example, a first
verification address may be assigned to the first individual. The first verification
address may include a first public key and a first private key.
(17)     Generally speaking, a public and private key-pair may be used for encryption
and decryption according to one or more public key algorithms. By way of non
limiting example, a key pair may be used for digital signatures. Such a key pair may
include a private key for signing and a public key for verification. The public key may
be widely distributed, while the private key is kept secret (e.g., known only to its
proprietor). The keys may be related mathematically, but calculating the private key
from the public key is unfeasible.
(18)     In some implementations, verification address assignment component 110
may be configured such that private keys may be stored within computing platform(s)
104. For example, the first private key may be stored within a computing platform
104 and/or other locations associated with the first individual. In accordance with
some implementation, a private key may be stored in one or more of a "verify.dat"
file, a SIM card, and/or other locations.

                                              8
(19)     In some implementations, verification address assignment component 110
may be configured such that multiple verification addresses may be assigned to
separate individuals. For example, in addition to the first verification address, a
second verification address may be assigned to the first individual. One or more
additional verification addresses may be assigned to the first individual, in
accordance with one or more implementations.
(20)     The address recordation component 112 may be configured to record
identifiers and biometric data associated with the individuals at corresponding
verification addresses. For example, the first identifier and first biometric data
associated with the first individual may be recorded at the first verification address.
Recording information at a given verification address may include recording a hash
or other encrypted representation of the information. In some implementations,
different biometric data may be recorded at multiple verification addresses assigned
to a single given individual. For example, in addition to the first identifier and the first
biometric data associated with the first individual being recorded at the first
verification address, the first identifier and second biometric data associated with the
first individual may be recorded at a second verification address.
(21)     Generally speaking, biometric data may include metrics related to human
characteristics. Biometric identifiers are distinctive, measurable characteristics that
can be used to label and describe individuals. Biometric identifiers are typically
include physiological characteristics, but may also include behavioral characteristics
and/or other characteristics. Physiological characteristics may be related to the
shape of an individual's body. Examples of physiological characteristics used as

 3
                                           9
biometric data may include one or more of fingerprint, palm veins, face recognition,
DNA, palm print, hand geometry, iris recognition, retina, odor or scent, and/or other
physiological characteristics. Behavioral characteristics may be related to a pattern
of behavior of an individual. Examples of behavioral characteristics used as
biometric data may include one or more of typing rhythm, gait, voice, and/or other
behavioral characteristics.
(22)    The biometric data may include one or more of an image or other visual
representation of a physiological characteristic, a recording of a behavioral
characteristic, a template of a physiological characteristic and/or behavioral
characteristic, and/or other biometric data. A template may include a synthesis of
relevant features extracted from the source. A template may include one or more of
a vector describing features of a physiological characteristic and/or behavioral
characteristic, a numerical representation of a physiological characteristic and/or
behavioral characteristic, an image with particular properties, and/or other
information.
(23)    Biometric data may be received via computing platforms 104 associated with
the individuals. For example, biometric data associated with a first individual may be
received via a first computing platform 104 associated with the first individual. The
first computing platform 104 may include an input device (not depicted) configured to
capture and/or record a physiological characteristic and/or behavioral characteristic
of the first individual. Examples of such an input device may include one or more of
a camera and/or other imaging device, a fingerprint scanner, a microphone, an
accelerometer, and/or other input devices.

                                            10
(24)    The user interface component 114 may be configured to provide an interface
for presentation to individuals via associated computing platforms 104. The interface
may include a graphical user interface presented via individual computing platforms
 104. According to some implementations, the interface may be configured to allow a
given individual to add or delete verification addresses assigned to the given
individual so long as at least one verification address is assigned to the given
individual.
(25)    In some implementations, user interface component 114 may be configured to
access and/or manage one or more user profiles and/or user information associated
with users of system 100. The one or more user profiles and/or user information
may include information stored by server(s) 102, one or more of the computing
platform(s) 104, and/or other storage locations. The user profiles may include, for
example, information identifying users (e.g., a username or handle, a number, an
identifier, and/or other identifying information), security login information (e.g., a login
code or password), system account information, subscription information, digital
currency account information (e.g., related to currency held in credit for a user),
relationship information (e.g., information related to relationships between users in
system 100), system usage information, demographic information associated with
users, interaction history among users in the system 100, information stated by
users, purchase information of users, browsing history of users, a computing
platform identification associated with a user, a phone number associated with a
user, and/or other information related to users.

                                            11
(26)    The machine-readable instructions 106 may be executable to perform block
chain-based multifactor personal identity verification using the verification addresses.
(27)    The verification request component 116 may be configured to receive one or
more identifiers in connection with one or more requests to verify an identity of one
or more individuals. For example, the first identifier may be received in connection
with a request to verify an identity of the first individual. Requests for identity
verification may be provided in connection with and/or related to financial
transactions, information exchanges, and/or other interactions. Requests may be
received from other individuals and/or other third parties.
(28)    The information extraction component 118 may be configured to extract the
biometric data associated with the one or more individuals from the corresponding
verification addresses. For example, the first biometric data associated with the first
individual may be extracted from the first verification address. Extracting information
(e.g., biometric data) from a verification address may include decrypting information.
(29)    According to some implementations, information extraction component 118
may be configured such that, responsive to receiving the request to verify the identity
of the first individual, a prompt may be provided to the first individual for biometric
data matching the first biometric data and a private key matching the first private key.
The prompt may be conveyed via a computing platform 104 associated with the first
individual. The prompt may be conveyed via a graphical user interface and/or other
user interface provided by the computing platform 104 associated with the first
individual. The prompt may include an indication that is one or more of visual,
audible, haptic, and/or other indications.

                                            12
(30)     In some implementations, information extraction component 118 may be
configured such that, responsive to receiving the request to verify the identity of the
first individual, a prompt may be provided to a computing platform 104 associated
with the first individual. The prompt may cause the computing platform 104 to
automatically provide, to server(s) 102, biometric data matching the first biometric
data and/or a private key matching the first private key.
(31)     The identity verification component 120 may be configured to verify the
identity of the one or more individuals upon, or in response to, receiving matching
biometric data and private keys. For example, the personal identity of the first
individual may be verified upon receipt of (1) biometric data matching the first
biometric data and (2) a private key matching the first private key. Verifying the
personal identity of the first individual may include comparing stored information with
newly received information.
(32)     According to some implementations, identity verification component 120 may
be configured such that the personal identity of the first individual may be verified
upon receipt of (1) biometric data matching the first biometric data or the second
biometric data and (2) a private key matching the first private key. Such
implementations may provide so-called "M-of-N" signatures for identity verification
where some subset of a larger set of identifying information is required.
(33)     In some implementations, identity verification component 120 may be
configured such that the biometric data matching the first biometric data and the
private key matching the first private key may be used to sign the verification of the
personal identity of the first individual.

                                            13
(34)    A cryptographic signature is a mathematical mechanism that allows someone
to prove ownership. In the case of Bitcoin, a Bitcoin wallet and its private key(s) are
linked by some mathematical magic. When your Bitcoin software signs a transaction
with the appropriate private key, the whole network can see that the signature
matches the bitcoins being spent. However, there is no way for the world to guess
your private key to steal your hard-earned bitcoins.
(35)    In some implementations, at least one dedicated node performs the signing of
the verification of the personal identity of the first individual. A given dedicated node
may include one or more of the server(s) 102. The given dedicated node may be a
public node or a private node configured for creating new blocks and/or for signing
verification.
(36)    In some implementations, server(s) 102, computing platform(s) 104, and/or
external resources 122 may be operatively linked via one or more electronic
communication links. For example, such electronic communication links may be
established, at least in part, via a network such as the Internet and/or other
networks. It will be appreciated that this is not intended to be limiting, and that the
scope of this disclosure includes implementations in which server(s) 102, computing
platform(s) 104, and/or external resources 122 may be operatively linked via some
other communication media.
(37)    A given computing platform 104 may include one or more processors
configured to execute machine-readable instructions. The machine-readable
instructions may be configured to enable an expert or user associated with the given
computing platform 104 to interface with system 100 and/or external resources 122,

                                            14
and/or provide other functionality attributed herein to computing platform(s) 104. By
way of non-limiting example, the given computing platform 104 may include one or
more of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a tablet
computing platform, a NetBook, a Smartphone, a gaming console, and/or other
computing platforms.
(38)    External resources 122 may include sources of information, hosts and/or
providers of virtual environments outside of system 100, external entities
participating with system 100, and/or other resources. In some implementations,
some or all of the functionality attributed herein to external resources 100 may be
provided by resources included in system 100.
(39)    Server(s) 102 may include electronic storage 124, one or more processors
126, and/or other components. Server(s) 102 may include communication lines, or
ports to enable the exchange of information with a network and/or other computing
platforms. Illustration of server(s) 102 in FIG. 1 is not intended to be limiting.
Server(s) 102 may include a plurality of hardware, software, and/or firmware
components operating together to provide the functionality attributed herein to
server(s) 102. For example, server(s) 102 may be implemented by a cloud of
computing platforms operating together as server(s) 102.
(40)    Electronic storage 124 may comprise non-transitory storage media that
electronically stores information. The electronic storage media of electronic storage
124 may include one or both of system storage that is provided integrally (i.e.,
substantially non-removable) with server(s) 102 and/or removable storage that is
removably connectable to server(s) 102 via, for example, a port (e.g., a USB port, a

 3
                                              15
firewire port, etc.) or a drive (e.g., a disk drive, etc.). Electronic storage 124 may
include one or more of optically readable storage media (e.g., optical disks, etc.),
magnetically readable storage media (e.g., magnetic tape, magnetic hard drive,
floppy drive, etc.), electrical charge-based storage media (e.g., EEPROM, RAM,
etc.), solid-state storage media (e.g., flash drive, etc.), and/or other electronically
readable storage media. Electronic storage 124 may include one or more virtual
storage resources (e.g., cloud storage, a virtual private network, and/or other virtual
storage resources). Electronic storage 124 may store software algorithms,
information determined by processor(s) 126, information received from server(s)
102, information received from computing platform(s) 104, and/or other information
that enables server(s) 102 to function as described herein.
(41)    Processor(s) 126 may be configured to provide information processing
capabilities in server(s) 102. As such, processor(s) 126 may include one or more of
a digital processor, an analog processor, a digital circuit designed to process
information, an analog circuit designed to process information, a state machine,
and/or other mechanisms for electronically processing information. Although
processor(s) 126 is shown in FIG. 1 as a single entity, this is for illustrative purposes
only. In some implementations, processor(s) 126 may include a plurality of
processing units. These processing units may be physically located within the same
device, or processor(s) 126 may represent processing functionality of a plurality of
devices operating in coordination. The processor(s) 126 may be configured to
execute machine-readable instruction components 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118,
120, and/or other machine-readable instruction components. Processor(s) 126 may

                                            16
be configured to execute machine-readable instruction components 108, 110, 112,
114, 116, 118, 120, and/or other machine-readable instruction components by
software; hardware; firmware; some combination of software, hardware, and/or
firmware; and/or other mechanisms for configuring processing capabilities on
processor(s) 126. As used herein, the term "machine-readable instruction
component" may refer to any component or set of components that perform the
functionality attributed to the machine-readable instruction component. This may
include one or more physical processors during execution of processor readable
instructions, the processor readable instructions, circuitry, hardware, storage media,
or any other components.
(42)     It should be appreciated that although machine-readable instruction
components 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, and 120 are illustrated in FIG. 1 as being
implemented within a single processing unit, in implementations in which
processor(s) 126 includes multiple processing units, one or more of machine
readable instruction components 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, and/or 120 may be
implemented remotely from the other machine-readable instruction components.
The description of the functionality provided by the different machine-readable
instruction components 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, and/or 120 described below is
for illustrative purposes, and is not intended to be limiting, as any of machine
readable instruction components 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, and/or 120 may
provide more or less functionality than is described. For example, one or more of
machine-readable instruction components 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, and/or 120
may be eliminated, and some or all of its functionality may be provided by other ones

                                             17
of machine-readable instruction components 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, and/or
120. As another example, processor(s) 126 may be configured to execute one or
more additional machine-readable instruction components that may perform some or
all of the functionality attributed below to one of machine-readable instruction
components 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, and/or 120.
(43)     FIG. 2 illustrates a method 200 for establishing verification addresses on a
block chain in order to provide block chain-based multifactor personal identity
verification, in accordance with one or more implementations. The operations of
method 200 presented below are intended to be illustrative. In some

                                             18
(45)     At an operation 202, identifiers may be associated with individuals having
previously verified personal identities. A first identifier may be associated a first
individual. The first individual may have a previously verified personal identity.
Operation 202 may be performed by one or more hardware processors configured to
execute a machine-readable instruction component that is the same as or similar to
individual identifier component 108 (as described in connection with FIG. 1), in
accordance with one or more implementations.
(46)     At an operation 204, verification addresses on a block chain may be assigned
to the individuals. A given verification address may include a public key and a

more implementations. The operations of method 300 presented below are intended
to be illustrative. In some implementations, method 300 may be accomplished with
one or more additional operations not described, and/or without one or more of the
operations discussed. Additionally, the order in which the operations of method 300
are illustrated in FIG. 3 and described below is not intended to be limiting.
(49)    In some implementations, method 300 may be implemented in one or more
processing devices (e.g., a digital processor, an analog processor, a digital circuit
designed to process information, an analog circuit designed to process information, a
state machine, and/or other mechanisms for electronically processing information).
The one or more processing devices may include one or more devices executing
some or all of the operations of method 300 in response to instructions stored
electronically on an electronic storage medium. The one or more processing devices
may include one or more devices configured through hardware, firmware, and/or
software to be specifically designed for execution of one or more of the operations of
method 300.
(50)    At an operation 302, one or more identifiers may be received in connection
with one or more requests to verify an identity of one or more individuals. A first

                                             20
identifier may be received in connection with a request to verify an identity of a first
individual. Operation 302 may be performed by one or more hardware processors
configured to execute a machine-readable instruction component that is the same as
or similar to verification request component 116 (as described in connection with
FIG. 1), in accordance with one or more implementations.
(51)    At an operation 304, biometric data associated with the one or more
individuals may be extracted from corresponding verification addresses on a block
chain. A given verification address may include a public key and a private key. First
biometric data associated with the first individual may extracted from a first
verification address assigned to the first individual. The first verification address may
include a first public key and a first private key. Operation 304 may be performed by
one or more hardware processors configured to execute a machine-readable
instruction component that is the same as or similar to information extraction
component 118 (as described in connection with FIG. 1), in accordance with one or
more implementations.
(52)    At an operation 306, the identity of the one or more individuals may be verified
upon, or in response to, receiving matching biometric data and private keys. The
personal identity of the first individual may be verified upon, or in response to, receipt
of (1) biometric data matching the first biometric data and (2) a private key matching
the first private key. Operation 306 may be performed by one or more hardware
processors configured to execute a machine-readable instruction component that is
the same as or similar to identity verification component 120 (as described in
connection with FIG. 1), in accordance with one or more implementations.

                                            21
(53)   Exemplary implementations may facilitate storing personal data on the block
chain. The personal data may be stored on the block chain in an encrypted way. A
person may be identified at the block chain level with one or more of a private key, a
finger print, a finger print hash, an eye retina, an eye retina hash, and/or other
unique information. The data stored may include or relate to one or more of a
passport, an identification card, extracted passport information, a driver's license,
extracted driver's license information, finger print, eye retina, and/or other
information. According to some implementations, if some of the data is changed, a
new record may be created for that person in the block chain. That is, all changes
are added as new records. The old record will always be stored on the block chain.
Generally speaking, all records on the block chain are stored forever and cannot be
removed. More than one copy of the block chain will exist to ensure the records are
not manipulated.
(54)   Exemplary implementations may facilitate access to personal data. There
may be multiple access levels for the personal data in the block chain. Access
controls may be grated on public/private key pairs levels. Examples of access levels
may include one or more of Super Admin (full access to block chain), Authorities
country level (full read-only access), Authorities-state/local level (limited read-only
access), Police and other services including Emergency (access to certain personal
data by Finger Print/Eye retina of that person only), Participating Merchants (limited
access), and/or other access levels.
(55)   Exemplary implementations may facilitate verification check. There may be
multiple levels for how it is possible to check verification. For example, some

                                            22
 implementations may ensure a person has a record at "Company" but no personal
data is provided. Some implementations may ensure a person has a record at
Company and get very basic personal information such as Full Name, DOB, Gender,
and/or other basic information. Some implementations may ensure a person has a
record at Company and get all personal data.
(56)     Although the present technology has been described in detail for the purpose
of illustration based on what is currently considered to be the most practical and
preferred implementations, it is to be understood that such detail is solely for that
purpose and that the technology is not limited to the disclosed implementations, but,
on the contrary, is intended to cover modifications and equivalent arrangements that
are within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. For example, it is to be
understood that the present technology contemplates that, to the extent possible,
one or more features of any implementation can be combined with one or more
features of any other implementation.
