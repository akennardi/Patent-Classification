                                   A CABLE SUSPENSION
                       REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
  This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/760,616, titled "A
  CABLE SUSPENSION" and filed on February 4, 2013, which is incorporated herein by
 reference.
                                    TECHNICAL FIELD
 [0001] A cable suspension is disclosed to facilitate supporting cables from poles and
 towers.
                                        BACKGROUND
 [0002] Suspension fittings of various configurations are known for supporting cables on
 and between poles and towers. Respective fittings are suspended from corresponding
 poles. A cable is supported by running continuously through each fitting and from fitting
 to fitting. A length of cable between adjacent suspension fittings (e.g. poles) is known as
 "a span."
 [0003] A function of a suspension fitting is to mitigate the deleterious effects of static
 and dynamic loads on a supported cable. Cables are subjected to static loads arising from
 the effects of gravity and differentials in span lengths and/or misalignment of spans on
opposite sides of the suspension. Dynamic loads may arise from the effects of wind,
vibration, for example, from road traffic, and from animals such as birds, and in
particular flocks of birds landing and alighting from suspended cables, or possums
walking along the cables. These loads may cause the cable to move in a plane transverse
or parallel to its length. Loads in the transverse plane may be termed as "swing" loads
(and produce swing motion), while loads in the parallel plane may be termed as "sway"
loads (and produce sway motion).
                                          SUMMARY
[0004] This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified
form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not
intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is
it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

  [0005] The motion arising from static and dynamic loads may cause localized bending of
  the cable immediately adjacent to the opposite sides of the fitting. Ideally this angle
  should be the same on each side and thus produce a zero deviation angle. The deviation
  angle is the difference in bend angle on each side of the fitting. However, in practice,
 previous fittings, particularly when subjected to sway loads, are unable to produce a non
 zero deviation angle.
 [0006] In broad terms in a first aspect there is disclosed a cable suspension which allows
 a cable to be pivoted about a pivot axis that passes through a thickness of a cable. The
 general idea here is to increase a bend radius of the cable entering and exiting the cable
 suspension, e.g. reducing the degree of bend by a cable entering and exiting the cable
 support.
 [0007] In the context of the present specification "cable" is intended to include but is not
 limited to insulated electrical cables, non-insulated electrical cables (also known in the art
 as "conductors'), shielded cables, non-electrical signal cables such as but not limited to
 optical cables, or assemblies thereof. The insulated or non-insulated electrical cables can
 include cables made from a single or multiple strands, and in the latter case, may be
 twisted or bundled together. Due to their physical characteristic, optical fibers are less
robust than electrical cables and generally require greater protection or isolation from
mechanical strain. It is not an essential requirement that the cable be used or indeed be
capable of carrying electrical and/or optical power or signals. The cable may be in the
form of a cable used to support a mechanical load, such as, for example, mechanical
support cables on suspension bridges or from which electrical cables are suspended for
electrified rail systems.
[0008] The disclosed cable suspension may be more particularly arranged so that the
pivot axis passes through or closely adjacent to a center line of a cable received in or
supported by the cable suspension.
[0009] In broad terms the cable suspension has a body configured to receive or seat a
cable, and a bracket that is pivotally coupled to the body about the pivot axis. The
bracket may be arranged to couple to a support, such as a pole or tower, at a location
disposed above the pivot axis. This enables the cable suspension to be suspended, for
example, from a hook that may be attached to a pole or tower. The bracket may be
provided with a coupling mechanism to facilitate the coupling of the bracket to the
support. The coupling can be arranged to enable the bracket and thus the body to move
                                               2

 in a swing plane that lies parallel to the pivot axis. The coupling mechanism may also
 enable the bracket and thus the body to move in a sway plan that lies transverse to the
 pivot axis.
 [0010] 'Ihe ability for the bracket to move in the swing plane and/or the sway plane
 provides the cabled suspension with multiple degrees of freedom of movement to assist
 in mitigating stress, strain, and fatigue in a cable.
 [0011] In a first aspect there is disclosed a cable suspension comprising: a body
 configured to receive a cable and a bracket pivotally coupled to the body about a pivot
 axis and arranged to couple to a support at a location above the pivot axis. The pivot axis
 is orientated to pass through a thickness of a cable received in the body.
 [0012] In an embodiment the pivot axis is orientated to intersect with or lie closely
 adjacent to a center line of a cable received in the body.
 [0013] In an embodiment the bracket is arranged to couple to the support in a manner to
enable the body to move in a swing plane that lies parallel to the pivot axis.
 [0014] In the same or an alternate embodiment the bracket is arranged to couple to the
support in a manner to enable the body to move in a sway plane that lies transverse to the
pivot axis.
 [0015] In an embodiment the pivot axis lies in a transverse center plane of the body.
[0016] In an embodiment the cable suspension comprises a damping system operatively
coupled between the body and the bracket and arranged to dampen motion about the
pivot axis.
[0017] In an embodiment the damping system comprises at least one elastomeric member
interposed between the body and the bracket.
[0018] In an embodiment the body comprises a plurality of demountable parts configured
to encircle, and couple together about, an outer circumferential surface of a cable.
[0019] In an embodiment the bracket comprises a first coupling part. The first coupling
part may comprise a loop structure such as but not limited to an annulus or ring arranged
to facilitate articulated coupling of the body to the support. The articulated coupling
enables the movement in the sway plane and swing plane. Moreover a second coupling
part may be provided that is configured for engagement with the first coupling part. The
second coupling part may be attached or attachable to the support. The second coupling
part may comprise a hook. The hook may be attached or attachable to the support. The
first and second coupling parts together may be considered as forming a mounting
                                                 3

  interface that enables an articulated coupling of the body with the support at a location
  above the pivot axis.
  [0020] In an embodiment the bracket forms first part of a mounting interface that enables
 an articulated coupling with a support. In this embodiment the mounting interface also
 comprises a second part that is either attached to the support or is attachable to the
 support, wherein the first and second parts are configured to be mutually engaged to
 facilitate articulation of the cable suspension on the support. In an example the first part
 comprises a closed loop structure and the second part comprises a hook. The closed loop
 structure may be in the form of an annulus or a ring at one end of the bracket.
 [0021] In an embodiment the bracket comprises two arms between which the body is
 located and wherein the pivot axis passes through the arms.
 [0022] In an embodiment the bracket comprises a cradle that extends across an underside
 of the body and wherein the pivot axis passes through the cradle.
 [0023] In a second aspect there is disclosed a cable suspension comprising: a body
 configured to receive a cable; a bracket pivotally coupled to the body about a pivot axis;
 and a mounting interface that enables an articulated coupling of the body with the support
 at a location above the pivot axis. The pivot axis is orientated to pass through a thickness
of a cable received in the body.
 [0024] In an embodiment the mounting interface comprises a first coupling part and a
second coupling part, the first coupling part being a part of or otherwise attached to the
bracket and the second coupling part being attached to or attachable to the support
wherein the first and second coupling parts are configured to be mutually engaged.
[0025] In an example the first coupling part comprises a loop structure and the second
coupling part comprises a hook. The loop structure may be in the form of an annulus or a
ring at one end of the bracket.

aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in
which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel
features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description

                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
  [0057] The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings,
  wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout.
  In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are
  set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It
  may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these
 specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram
 form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.
 [0058] Figures Ia - 2b depict an embodiment of the cable suspension 10. The cable
 suspension 10 comprises a body 12 configured to receive a cable 14 and a bracket 16 that
 is pivotally coupled to the body 12 about a pivot axis 18 and is further arranged to couple
 to a support at a location above the pivot axis 18. The pivot axis 18 is orientated to pass
 through a thickness of the cable 14 received in the body 12. As will be explained in
 greater detail below, this embodiment of the cable suspension 10 is able to maintain a
 portion of the cable 14 within the body 12 in a substantially horizontal plane under
 various static and dynamic load conditions that are expected or reasonably foreseeable
 and maintain a large bending radius of the cable 14 on opposite sides of the body 12
 thereby limiting and/or decreasing the degree of bend in the cable 14.
 [0059] In Figures la - 2b, the cable suspension 10 is depicted in a substantially balanced
or equilibrium load condition. In this condition the net of the static and dynamic loads
and forces acting on the cable suspension 10 and received cable 14 are such that the
bracket 16 hangs substantially like a plumb line so that a longitudinal center line C1 of
the bracket 16 lies in a vertical plane and is perpendicular to the horizontal plane.
Further, a center line C2 of a portion of the cable 14 received in the body 12 is held in a
horizontal plane. Indeed, embodiments of the cable suspension 10 function in the manner
to maintain the center line of the portion of the cable 14 within the body 12 in a
horizontal plane in majority of foreseeable static and dynamic load conditions. As a
result a bending radius of the cable 14 as it enters and exits the body 12 is enhanced
and/or increased (e.g. the degree of bend of the cable 14 adjacent to the opposite ends of
the body 12 is limited and/or decreased).
                                               7

   [00601 In the present described embodiments the support comprises a pole or tower
   and/or support (see Figure 7). The coupling of the suspension 10 to the support is via a
   first coupling part 29. The first coupling part 29 is formed as a part of, or is otherwise
  attached to, the bracket 16. The coupling of the suspension 10 via the first coupling part
  29 enables an articulated coupling of the suspension 10 to the support in a sway plane and
  a swing plane. These planes will be described shortly. The first coupling part 29 engages
  a complimentary second coupling part 21. The second coupling part 21 is attached, or
  otherwise attachable, to the support. The parts 29 and 21 are configured to be mutually
  engaged to facilitate articulation of the cable suspension 10 on the support.
  [0061] The coupling part 29 is in the form of a loop structure of the bracket 16 and is
 exemplified in the Figures as an annulus (or ring or washer) 30. The second coupling
 part 21 is exemplified in the Figures as a hook 22 having a straight shank 24 and a
 contiguous arcuate hook portion 26. The hook 22 is attached so that the shank 24 extends
 perpendicular to the pole and in a substantially horizontal plane. Together the coupling
 parts 29 and 21 may be considered as constituting a mounting interface 31 that facilitates
 articulation of the body 12 and thus cable suspension 10 on the support. As explained
 below this articulation is manifested by a sway motion of the suspension 10 in a plane
 parallel to the general direction of the cable 14, and a swing motion of the suspension in a
 general direction transverse to the direction of the cable.
 [0062] Looking at the components of the cable suspension 10 in greater detail and with
particular reference to Figures 2a and 2b, it will be seen that in this embodiment the
bracket 16 comprises a cradle 32 attached to the coupling part 29/ annulus 30. The
annulus 30 has a central through-hole 34 defined by an inner circumferential surface 36.
The cradle 32 is formed with a ledge 38 to which an outer circumferential surface 40 of
the annulus 30 is attached. This attachment may for example be achieved by welding.
Alternately, the annulus 30 and cradle 32 may be integrally formed. Depending from the
ledge 38 is a generally U-shaped portion 42 of the cradle 32. The U-shaped portion 42
comprises a pair of parallel lugs or arms 44 which are spaced and attached to each other
by an integrally formed bridge 46. Mutually aligned threaded holes 48 are formed in the
lugs 44. A center line of the holes 48 coincides with the pivot axis 18. Strengthening
fillets or webs 50 and 52 are provided on an outside of the bracket 16 to assist in resisting
distortion or other bending of the bracket 16.
                                                8

  [0063] The body 12 comprises a plurality of demountable parts including a first shell 54a
  and a second shell 54b (hereinafter referred to in general as "shells 54"). The shells 54
  are configured to encircle and couple together about an outer circumferential surface of
  the cable 14. Conceptually the shells 54 may be viewed as being formed by splitting the
  body 12 in a horizontal plane. The shell 54a is formed with a longitudinally extending
  channel 58 that seats the cable 14. The channel 58 includes a central or intermediate
 portion 60 and contiguous opposite end portions 62. A center line 60L of the portion 60
 is straight. However a center line 62L of the end portion 62 is curved with increasing
 radius in a direction away from the central portion 60 to the distal ends of the body 12.
 The curvature of the center line 62L and corresponding end portions 62 may comprise a
 single fixed radius or a plurality of progressively increasing radii that form a substantially
 smooth curve.
 [0064] A central passage 64 is created in the body 12 when the shells 54 are coupled
 together. The passage 64 has an ovoid like shape in cross section. The shape of the
 passage 64 (and thus the channel 58) is dependent upon the shape and configuration of
 the cable 14 to be received and otherwise supported by the suspension 10. Thus this will
 vary for embodiments of the cable suspension required to support cables of different
 cross sectional shape, such as a circular.
 [0065] A pair of walls extends from opposite sides of the central portion 60. In an
 embodiment the walls are formed as an integral portion of the shell 54a. The walls are
provided with respective blind holes 68 that are in alignment with each other and the axis
 18. The holes 68 are formed with a conical toe.
 [0066] The walls are also formed with planar top surfaces 70. A single threaded blind
hole 72 is formed in each of the walls 70 from its top surface 72. In this embodiment the
holes 72 are diametrically opposed to each other.
[0067] The shell 54b has a central portion 76 and contiguous and opposite end portions
78. A channel 80 is formed along the central and end portions 76 and 78 which faces the
channel 58. The channel 80 has a shape and configuration that is symmetric to that of
channel 58 about a horizontal plane containing the pivot axis 18. A connection plate 82
is formed on an outer surface of the central portion 76 and is configured to overlie and
engage the walls. Further, the plate 82 is formed with diagonally opposed holes 84 that
align with the holes 72. Mechanical fasteners 86 are passed through the holes 84 and
engage the holes 72 via threads to effectively clamp the shells 54a and 54b together.
                                               9

  Cable 14 is received in the body 12 by undoing the fasteners 86 so that the shells 54 can
  be separated, and subsequently placing the shells 54 about a length wise portion of the
  cable 14 and then clamping or otherwise coupling the shells 54 together by use of the
  fasteners 86.
  [00681 The body 12 is attached to the bracket 16 by pivot screws 88. As illustrated most
 clearly in Figure 2b, each pivot screw 88 is formed with a hexagonal head 90, a shank 92,
 and a conical end 94. A portion of the shank 88 immediately adjacent the head is formed
 with a screw thread to engage the thread on a respective hole 48. However the remainder
 of the length of the shank 92 to the end 94 is smooth. This forms a bearing surface for
 the body 12 to pivot on.
 [00691 When assembling the cable suspension 10, the body 12 is placed within the
 bracket 16 and in between the lugs 44 so that the holes 48 are in alignment with the holes
 68. Pivot screws 88 are now screwed into holes 48 from the outside of the lugs 44, and
 the unthreaded part of each shank 92 extends into corresponding blind holes 68 of the
 walls. The extent of penetration of the screws 88 into the holes 68 is limited by the
abutment of the conical surfaces 94 with corresponding conical surfaces in the blind
holes 68. Specifically, the cable suspension 10 is arranged so that when the screws 88 are
fully screwed into the holes 48 the head 90 does not clamp the bracket 16 against the
body 12. Rather sufficient spacing is provided to enable the body 12 to pivot on the
bearing surfaces formed by the shanks 92 and about the pivot axis 18. As will be
recognized the pivot axis 18 corresponds with the central axis of the bolts 88, holes 68
and holes 48.
[0070] Optionally, a damping system 95 may be incorporated in the cable suspension 10.
The damping system 95 is operatively coupled between the body 12 and the bracket 16 to
dampen motion about the pivot axis 18. In the present embodiment, the damping system
95 comprises elastomeric members in the form of washers 97 located between the walls
and the lugs 44 and through which respective pivot screws 88 pass.
[00711 It should be understood that while the pivot axis 18 extends or otherwise passes
through a thickness of the cable 14 received within the body 12, there is no physical pivot
axle, pin, or other member that passes through the thickness of the cable 14. In a
configuration the pivot axis 18 passes through or intersects with a center line of the cable
14.
                                              10

   [0072] With particular reference to Figures la - ic, it will be appreciated that the bracket
   16 is provided with a plurality of degrees of freedom of movement. In particular, the
  bracket 16 due to the engagement of the annulus 30 to the hook 22 can swing in a plane
  that lies parallel to the pivot axis, and can move in a sway plane that lies transverse to the
  pivot axis 18. This motion comes about due to the configuration of the annulus 30 which
  is in the form of an annulus that is engaged by the hook 22. With particular reference to
  Figure la the bracket 16 can sway from side to side in the sway plane that coincides with
  the plane of Figure la and is perpendicular to the pivot axis 18. This motion can be
  considered as equivalent to the annulus 30 pivoting in the plane of Figure 1a about the
 hook 22 in clockwise or anticlockwise directions indicated by arrows C and AC.
  [0073] Figure lb illustrates the freedom of movement of the bracket 16 and thus the
 cable suspension 10 in the swing plane. The swing plane lies parallel to the pivot axis 18
 and coincides with the plane of Figure lb. Movement of the bracket 16 and thus body 12
 in the swing plane coincides with the annulus 30 riding forwards or backwards along the
 curve of the hook 26. This may occur for example in response to wind loading from a
 breeze predominantly from the left hand side or the right hand side of Figure lb.
 [00741 It should also be understood that motion of the bracket 16 and body 12 in the
 swing and sway planes is not mutually exclusive. Rather, such motions may and will
 often occur simultaneously. Further, due to the pivot coupling of the bracket 16 to the
body 12 about the pivot axis 18, the body 12 and thus the section of cable 14 received
within the body 12 will be maintained in a substantially horizontal plane irrespective of
the degree of swing or sway.
[0075] The range of motion of the cable suspension 10 that is available due to the
structural and functional features is specifically illustrated in Figures 3a - 6c.
[0076] Figures 3a - 3c illustrate the cable suspension 10 when the bracket 16 is swayed
in an anticlockwise direction AC in the sway plane. This may arise due to for example an
unbalanced static load on opposite sides of the suspension 10 owing to different span
lengths 14r and 141 on the right and left sides respectively of the body 12. For example
the length of the span 14r may be 100m whereas the length of the span 141 may be 60m.
Provided there are no other dynamic or static forces acting and that the spans 141 and 14r
lie in the substantially the same vertical plane, then the suspension 10 will move in the
sway plane with the bracket 16 pivoting in the anticlockwise direction about the hook 22.
                                                11

  The body 12, and thus the portion of a cable supported therein, is maintained in a
  substantially horizontal plane due to pivoting of the body 12 about the pivot axis 18.
  [0077] Figures 4a - 4c depict a similar situation to that of Figures 3a - 3c but where the
  static load is unbalanced so as to be greater on the left hand side of the body 12 rather
  than the right hand side. This may be brought about for example by the span 141 being of
  greater length than the span 14r. Now the bracket 16 and thus the body 12 are pivoted in
  the clockwise direction C in the sway plane about the hook 22. The body 12 is
  maintained in a substantially horizontal plane in relation of the pivot axis 18. It is
  assumed that the cable 14 received by the suspension 10 is also received by adjacent
  suspensions 10 which are hung at the same vertical height on adjacent posts as the
 suspension 10 in question as illustrated for example in Figure 7.
  [0078] Figures 5a - 5c illustrate the effects of a plurality of dynamic and/or static forces
 on a cable 14 supported by the suspension 10. Here the net effect of the forces has the
 effect of causing both a swing and a sway of the bracket 16 and thus the body 12 and a
 consequential pivoting of body 12 about the pivot axis 18. In particular in these Figures,
 it will be seen that the bracket 16 undergoes a combined motion of swaying in a
 clockwise direction about the hook 22 while also swinging upwardly (e.g. riding up a
 forward portion of the hook 22). This motion may occur for example by action of the
 span length 141 being longer than the span length 14r and one or both of the action of a
 wind blowing from left to right with reference to Figure 5b, and due to a non-zero angle
 of deviation between mutually adjacent poles from which the suspensions 10 are
 supported.
 [0079] Figures 6a-6c illustrate the effect of a similar set of forces as in Figures 5a-5c
 with the difference being a predominate static load being applied to the span 141 rather
than 14r.
 [0080] Figure 7 depicts a cable 14 suspended on three adjacent posts 28a, 28b, and 28c
by cable suspension 10a, 10b and 10c. The suspensions 10a, 10b, and 10c are identical to
the suspension 10 described in Figures la - 2c. The poles 28a, 28b, and 28c lie in the
same line and each of the hooks 22a, 22b, and 22c are mounted at the same height on
their respective poles. In this example the spacing between poles 28a and 28b is 60
meters while the spacing between poles 28b and 28c is 100 meters. It is also assumed
that cable span 141 on the left hand side of cable suspension 10a is 60 meters while the
length of the span 14r on the right hand side of cable suspension 10c is less than 100
                                                12

   meters. Thus there is a static load imbalance on opposite sides of the cable suspension
   10b. In particular there is a greater static load on the right hand side of cable suspension
   10b than the left hand side. As a consequence the bracket 16 of cable suspension 10b
   sways in the anticlockwise direction about the corresponding hook 22b.
   [0081] Figures 8a - 10b depict a second embodiment of a cable suspension. In the
  second embodiment the cable suspension is denoted by the reference number 100.
  Features of the cable suspension 100 that have the same or similar structure or function as
  features in the cable suspension 10 are denoted by reference numbers which have been
  incremented by 100 with respect to the reference numbers used for the cable suspension
  10. For example, the cable suspension 100 comprises a body 112 configured to receive a
  cable, and a bracket 116 pivotally coupled to the body 112 about a pivot axis. The
  bracket 116 is also arranged to couple to a support in the form of a hook (not shown) at a
 location above the pivot axis. The pivot axis is orientated to pass through a thickness of
 and most perfectly through a center of a cable received in the body 112.
 [0082] The differences between the cable suspensions 10 and 100 lay in the specific
 configuration of the bracket 116 and the body 112.
 [0083] The bracket 116 is formed with a U-shaped portion 142 however in this
 embodiment the U-shaped portion 142 extends over the top and down the sides of the
 body 116 rather than lying beneath and in effect cradling the body as in the cable
 suspension 10. The U-shaped portion 142 has a bridge 146 that extends above and across
 the body 112 and to which the annulus 130 is attached. Depending from and formed
 integrally with one side of the bridge 146 is a lug or arm 144a. A second lug or arm 144b
 is pivotally coupled to the bridge 146 and extends down an opposite side of the body 112.
Lug 144b is hinged on a hinge pin 145 so that it can be selectively disconnected from a
pivot screw 188b. A strengthening web 150 extends along a side of the lug 144a opposite
the body 112 and to the annulus 130.
[0084] As seen in Figures 10a and 10b the body 112 comprises a plurality of
demountable parts including a first shell 154a and second shell 154b. The shell 154a is
formed with a relatively deep channel 158 while the shell 154b is formed with a
relatively shallow channel 180 which faces the channel 158. The difference in the
relative depth of the channels 158 and 180 arises from the manner in which the pivot
coupling of the bracket 116 to the body 112 is formed. In particular pivot screws 188a
and 188b are orientated so that their respective heads 190 are disposed on the inside of
                                                 13

   and engage complimentary shaped recesses 191 in the shell 154a. The shell 154a has
   thickened wall portions 166 located centrally along the length of the channel 158 and on
   opposite sides thereof. Each wall 166 is formed with a hole 168 through which the shank
   192 of screw 188 extends. The channel 158 may be formed with a central portion and
   contiguous opposite end portions of similar configuration to that of central portion 60 and
  end portion 62. Thus the central portion may be formed with a straight center line, while
  the end portions may be forced with center lines that curve or bend away from axial
  center line of a passage 164 of the body 112. The curving of the end portions may take
  the same fonn as the curving of the portions 62.
  [0085] Upper surfaces of the walls 166 form abutment surfaces for the shell 154b. In
  addition, threaded blind holes 172 extend into the walls 166 from the top surface.
  [00861 The shell 154b is formed with four through holes 173 that pass from an upper side
  to an underside of the shell 154b. The holes 173 are located at corners of an imaginary
 rectangle and two of the diagonally opposed holes 173 are arranged to align with the
 holes 172.
  [0087] To assemble the cable suspension 100 the pivot screws 188a and 188b are
 inserted into the holes 168 from the inside of a channel 158. Thus the heads 190 seat in
 complimentary shaped recesses 191. The shanks 192 extend from the holes 168. A cable
 can then be placed in the channel 158. Thereafter, the shell 154b is placed over the shell
 154a and mechanical fasteners such as screws (not shown) pass through two of the holes
 173 that align with and engage in threads in the threaded blind holes 172. Next, either
 the lug 114b can be pivotally connected to the bridge 146 by a pivot pin, or alternately
 the lug 144a can be passed onto the shank 192 of the pivot screw 188a. In either case, a
nut or other engagement mechanism can be attached to the portion of the shank 192
extending from the lug 144a to pivotally connect the lug 144a to the pivot screw 188a.
Next, the lug 144b is engaged onto the shank 192 of the pivot screw 188b. In this
embodiment it is seen that the shank 192 is formed with a through-hole 193. This hole
may receive a split pin or other mechanical stop that presents the lug 144b from sliding
off the shank 192.
[00881 The pivot axis is an axis that is coincident with the center of the holes 168, shanks
192, and holes 148. Pivot axis passes through a center line of a cable received in the
body 112. The geometric relationship between the pivot axis, a cable passing through the
body 112, and the bracket 16 and in particular the annulus 130 is the same as in the cable
                                              14

  suspension 10. Thus the range of motion and function of the cable suspension 100 is
  exactly the same as that of the cable suspension 10.
  [0089] While a number of specific embodiments of the cable suspension have been
  described it should be appreciated that the cable suspension may be embodied in many
  other forms. For example, the bodies 12 and 112 are depicted as being formed from two
  main demountable components namely shells 54a and 54b or shells 154a and 154b.
  However the bodies 12 may be made from a larger number of parts that are assembled
  together. It a further variation is possible to form the passage 64 with a circular cross
  section and fit inserts within the passage 64 that are configured to form a channel of a
  shape appropriate for the cable 14. The spacing between suspensions 10 and associated
 span lengths described in relation to Figure 7 are exemplary only and not intended to
 indicate performance limits of embodiments of the suspension. Also in the described
 embodiments the first coupling part 29 is exemplified by an annulus while the second
 coupling part 21 is exemplified by a hook 22. However these coupling parts can take
 other forms that enable mutual engagement and facilitate an articulated coupling to the
 support. For example one or both of the first and second coupling parts may be in the
 form of a carabiner clip or snap hook that can be selectively opened and closed.

 some or all of the operations are described should not be construed as to imply that these
operations are necessarily order dependent. Alternative ordering will be appreciated by
one skilled in the art having the benefit of this description. Further, it will be understood
that not all operations are necessarily present in each embodiment provided herein.
[0091] Moreover, "exemplary" is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance,
