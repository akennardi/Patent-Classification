SPINAL CORD STIMULATION WITH INTERFERENTIAL CURRENT
[0001] The present application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No.
<removed-apn>, filed 2 August 2016, the contents of which are hereby incorporated in its entirety.
The present disclosure generally related to spinal cord stimulation and, more particularly, is
related to an apparatus and method for the electrical stimulation of the spinal cord using an
interferential current pattern for treating chronic pain conditions.
                                           BACKGROUND
[0002] Electrical stimulation of the posterior spinal cord, spinal cord stimulation (SCS), has
developed into an effective therapeutic tool for treating chronic pain conditions. However, very
little is known about the sites of activation or the neural mechanisms evoked by SCS that relieve
pain and promote changes in the function of somatic and visceral structures.
[0003] Spinal Cord Stimulation is most commonly used for patients with chronic intractable pain
syndromes. It has also been useful for treating movement disorders and is occasionally used
following head injuries. However, one complication with SCS is that of accommodation or
habituation to the stimulation signal. Companies that manufacture spinal stimulation devices
have developed complex stimulation programs and devoted chapters on techniques to reduce the
problem of accommodation during SCS (Alfano S, Darwin J, Picullel B: Spinal Cord
Stimulation, Patient Management Guidelines for Clinicians, Medtronic, Inc.). Accommodation
is when the body habituates or becomes accustomed to an activity or signal and then starts to
ignore or 'tune it out'. By varying the signal or keeping the focal point of the signal moving,
accommodation can be minimized.
[0004] Dorsal Column Stimulation (DCS) or SCS using an electrical current pattern has shown
to be a cost benefit in treating chronic pain disorders in patients (Dorsal column stimulation: cost
to benefit analysis; Acta Neurochir Suppl (Wien) 52(): 121-3, 1991).
[0005] SCS stimulates the dorsal column in a somewhat superficial manner as pointed out by
Holsheimer (Holsheimer J: Which Neuronal Elements are activated Directly by Spinal Cord
Stimulation, Neuromodulation, Volume 5, Number 1: 25-31, 2002). The electrodes are normally
attached to the dura matter in

the epidural space, and most of the current distribution remains in the cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) and does not project deeply into the dorsal column.
[0006]          Thus, traditional SCS stimulation has limited application because of the
spread of the stimulating electrical field within the CSF as intensity of stimulation increases.
This is due to the highly conductive nature of the CSF as compared to the less conductive
nature of the spinal cord tissue itself. Thus, traditional SCS stimulation is "amplitude
limited" to a relatively narrow surface area of the spinal cord.            Frequently, patient
satisfaction with electrical stimulation is compromised by the recruitment of adjacent
neuronal structures that, when activated, can create discomfort, motor contractions, and
outright pain. The efficacy of the therapy is thus limited.
[0007]          Thus, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the industry to address
the aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies with regard to accommodation or
habituation to the spinal cord stimulation signal when used in the treatment of
chronic pain syndromes.
                                          SUMMARY
[0008]          Within examples, using interferential stimulation with implantable leads
to decrease the problem of accommodation might prove to be advantageous.
Providing an interferential component to the electrode array of the SCS allows the
crossing of the two signals or overlap of two signals, and the resultant additive
effect of the beat frequency produces deeper penetration of the signal and a higher
resultant amplitude at the stimulation site. The interferential current would recruit
larger numbers of dorsal column fibers and provide greater levels of pain relief and
benefit to intractable pain patients.
[0009]          Within examples, a method for spinal cord stimulation treatment using
electrical stimulation of a spinal cord id described. The method comprises positioning a
first pair of implantable electrodes to a dura matter in an epidural space proximate to a
subject's spinal cord at predetermined locations, positioning a second pair of implantable
electrodes to the dura matter in the epidural space proximate to the subject's spinal cord at
predetermined locations, and transmitting signals of first and second frequencies through
the first and second pairs of implantable electrodes respectively, so that the signals of the
first and second frequencies interfere with each other to produce at least one beat signal
                                               -2-

proximate to the subject's spinal cord. The at least one beat signal has a frequency within a
range of more than 250 Hz to about 15,000 Hz.
[0010]          Within other examples, an electrical stimulator for spinal cord treatment is
described. The stimulator comprises an interferential current generator that generates an
interferential output including first and second signals having different first and second
frequencies, and at least two pairs of implantable electrodes having first and second ends.
The first ends are connected to the interferential current generator and the second ends are
configured to be implanted to a dura matter in an epidural space at predetermined locations
proximate to a subject's spinal cord. Each of the at least two pairs of implantable electrodes
carries one of the first and second signals such that the first and second frequencies interfere
with each other to produce at least one beat signal proximate to the subject's spinal cord,
and the at least one beat signal has a frequency within a range of more than 250 Hz to about
 15,000 Hz.

that the words "example," "exemplary," and "illustrative" are used herein to mean "serving
as an example, instance, or illustration."    Any embodiment or feature described herein as

                                               -5 -

[0037]          Embodiments of the present disclosure provide an apparatus and method
for the treatment of chronic pain syndromes using electrical stimulation of the
spinal cord.    Within examples, an electrical stimulator is provided for the treatment of
intractable pain syndromes that includes implantable electrodes implanted to a dura mater
proximate to a subject's spinal cord, and interferential stimulation is used to produce a beat
frequency signal such that a majority of the beat frequency signal is directionally distributed
and controlled to avoid stimulating adjacent and/or inappropriate neuronal targets within the
spinal canal, thereby creating a far more efficacious neuro-stimulation field in the treatment
of pain.    In other examples, a majority of the beat frequency signal is directionally
distributed and controlled to avoid remaining in and shunting through the cerebrospinal
fluid proximate to the subject's spinal cord.
[0038]          An effective area of stimulation is controlled by the quantity of electrodes,
positioning of the electrodes and electrode cross or interference pattern orientation. Thus,
the beat frequency signal can be directionally controlled.
[0039]          Within examples, the apparatus utilizes an interferential current that has a
base medium frequency alternating current between about 500Hz and about 20KHz.
An interferential current is set up between two circuits that are arranged in a cross
pattern or in a parallel pattern on the subject's targeted area of stimulation. Where
the circuits superimpose in a cross-pattern, the resultant beat frequency will be the
difference between the frequencies of the two circuits and the amplitude will be
additive and greater than either circuit alone.         The range of the beat frequency is
generate d to b e between arange ofmore than250Hz to about 15,000 Hz. Multiple
levels of stimulation can be treated depending upon the electrode placement, pairing
and modulation pattern selected.        The range of output would be from about 0 volts to
about 11 volts per circuit depending on the patient's needs and the pulse width is
commonly       set at 210 microseconds          but it   could range     from about     10-600
microseconds.       The amplitude can be modulated in the respective circuits to
increase the area of targeted stimulation.           This type of current (interferential)
provides improved directional control, decreased accommodation or habituation
and increased depth of penetration in comparison to other standard implantable
stimulation systems and their accompanying surgical leads.            The amplitudes of the
outputs in the respective circuits may be modulated to increase the area of targeted
stimulation. Interferential current allows improved directional control and depth of
                                              -6-

penetration in comparison to other stimulation techniques. Thus, by generating the beat
frequency     signal, the resultant additive signal is directionally      controlled to avoid
cerebrospinal fluid proximate to the subject's spinal cord.
[0040]           Within examples, to target specific areas of the spinal cord using modulation
of the circuit outputs and the resultant beat frequency signal would be directionally
controlled and/or depths of penetration are controlled.
[0041]           Within examples, using an electrical stimulator that includes electrodes
implanted upon the dura mater with interferential currents produces a beat frequency signal
that has deeper penetration than that possible using traditional SCS stimulation, and a
majority of the beat frequency signal can be more precisely controlled in terms of direction
and depth of tissue penetration proximate to the subject's spinal cord. Thus, interferential
current may recruit larger numbers of dorsal column fibers and potentially provide greater
levels of pain relief and benefit to intractable pain patients.         Further, providing an
interferential component to the electrode array of the SCS allows the crossing of the two
signals such that the resultant additive effect of the beat frequency produces deeper
penetration of the signal and a higher resultant amplitude at the stimulation site because
only sub-threshold signals, of minimal biological consequence, remain in or shunt through
the CSF. Because most of the current in conventional SCS remains in the CSF, it does not
project deeply into the dorsal column. In contrast, providing an interferential component
allows deeper penetration of the signal. Thus, the signal does not remain in the CSF.
[0042]           Briefly described, in architecture, an example apparatus may include
digital signal processors (DSPs) for improving the accuracy and reliability of
digital signals. Digital signal processing works by standardizing or clarifying the
output of a digital signal. In this embodiment, the digital signal processor is used to
shape multiple pulsatile waveforms to approximate the output of a sine-wave
generator.     In other examples, the digital signal processor can be replaced with a
field programmable gate array (FPGA). An FPGA is an integrated circuit that can
be programmed in the field after it is manufactured and therefore allows users to
adjust the circuit output as the needs change. Both the DSP and the FPGA process
a digital signal into a pseudo-sine-wave current waveform from the digital pulses
generated by a pulse generator.         The pseudo-sine-wave current waveform can be
transmitted through implantable quadripolar leads               with eight    electrodes at a
targeted area creating a pair of interferential currents.
                                              -7-

[0043]          Figure 1 shows a stimulator 100 for the electrical stimulation of the
spinal cord utilizing an interferential current 110 that has a base medium frequency
alternating current within the range of about 500Hz-20KHz.
[0044]          By the term "about" and/or the term "substantially" it is meant that the
recited characteristic, parameter, or value need not be achieved exactly, but that deviations
or variations, including for example, tolerances, measurement error, measurement accuracy
limitations and other factors known to skill in the art, may occur in amounts that do not
preclude the effect the characteristic was intended to provide.
[0045]          The interferential current 110 is set up between two circuits 118, 120
that are arranged in a cross-pattern.        A first pair of implantable electrodes 108a-b
are positioned on a subject's spinal column 112, preferably the dorsal column, at one set
of diagonal corners of a targeted area.          A second pair of implantable electrodes
 108c-d is then positioned at the other set of diagonal corners of the targeted area.
The electrodes 108 are attached to the dura matter in the epidural space                   at
predetermined locations proximate to the spinal cord. A digital signal processor
 102 is connected to the first and second pairs of surface electrodes 108a-b and 108c
d. When a signal generating source 104 is connected to the digital signal processor
 102, a sine-wave- like waveform signal output 106 is created.           The digital signal
processor 102 improves the accuracy and reliability of digital signals.          The digital
signal processor 102 processes multiple pulses 116 from the signal generating source
 104 to approximate a sine-wave (pseudo-sine-wave or sine-wave-like).              Thus, that
type of current recruits larger numbers of dorsal column fibers and provides greater
levels of pain relief In some examples, as a result of recruiting larger numbers of dorsal
column fibers by using interferential current and by generating a beat frequency signal, the
patients could potentially experience greater levels of pain relief
[0046]          The digital signal processor 102 generates individual pulses 106 of
differing widths and resultant amplitudes. In some examples, the pulse width is set at
210 microseconds, but can range from 50-600 microseconds. When those differing
pulses 106 are driven into a transformer (not shown), the pseudo-sine-wave is
produced. A pulse generator 104 is connected to the digital signal processor 102 and
supplies the pulsed digital signal output 116 to the digital signal processor 102. The
digital signal 106 processed by the digital signal processor 102 creates the first circuit
 118 and t h e second     circuit 120 at the first and second pairs of surface electrodes
                                               -8-

 108a-b and 108c-d, respectively. Within examples, a range of output of the electrical
circuits 118, 120 is about 0-11 volts per circuit, depending on the patient's needs
for pain treatment.      Where the first and second circuits 118,          120 superimpose
(cross),   the resultant beat      frequency (which may          be between      1 and     250
beats/second) will be the difference between the frequencies of the two circuits, and
the amplitude will be additive and greater than either circuit alone.          Within other
examples, the resultant beat frequency signal may have a frequency within a
range of more than 250 Hz to about 15,000 Hz.
[0047]          The signal generating source 104 may be an interferential current generator
that generates an interferential output including first and second signals having different
first and second frequencies. First ends of the implantable electrodes 108a and 108d are
connected to the interferential current generator 104 and second ends 108b and 08c are
configured to be implanted to a dura matter in an epidural space at predetermined locations
proximate to a subject's spinal cord. The two pairs of implantable electrodes 108a-b and
 108c-d carry one of the first and second signals such that the first and second frequencies
interfere with each other to produce at least one beat signal proximate to the subject's spinal
cord.
[0048]          A field-programmable gate array (not shown) can also be used to
shape multiple pulsatile waveforms to approximate the output of a sine-wave
generator instead of or in addition to the digital signal processor 102 described above.
The FPGA is an integrated circuit that can be programmed in the field after it is
manufactured and allows its user to adjust the circuit output as desired. Thus, in an
alternative embodiment, the digital signal processor may be replaced with the FPGA.
Whereas DSP processors typically have               eight  dedicated multipliers at their
disposal, an FPGA device can offer 224 dedicated multipliers plus additional
logic element-based multipliers as needed. That allows for complex digital signal
processing applications       such as   finite impulse response filters, forward error
correction, modulation-demodulation, encryption and applications.
[0049]          Figure 2 illustrates an example perspective view of an interferential
current pattern indicating the current intensity level and area of beat frequency
formation, according to an example embodiment.                The first pair of implantable
electrodes 108a-b are shown positioned on the subject's spinal column at one set of
diagonal corners of a targeted area 200, and the second pair                 of implantable
                                              -9-

electrodes 108c-d are then positioned at the other set of diagonal corners of the
targeted area 200.       Where the first and second circuits superimpose (cross), the
resultant beat frequency will be the difference between the frequencies of the two
circuits, and the amplitude will be additive and greater than either circuit alone in the
target area 200.
[0050]           As shown in Figure 2, the first pair of implantable electrodes 108a-b and the
second pair of implantable electrodes 108c-d are positioned in a crossing configuration such
that a first circuit created between the first pair of implantable electrodes crosses a second
circuit created between the second pair of implantable electrodes.
[0051]           Within examples, altering the targeted area 200 of the subject's spinal cord
can be performed by modulating amplitudes of the signals, as shown in Figure 2. Thus,
multiple target areas of the spinal cord can be treated depending upon the quantity
and placement of the first and second pairs of electrodes, and by modulating the
amplitudes of the outputs of the first and second circuits.
[0052]           Figure 3 is a perspective view          illustrating the effective area     of
stimulation resulting from         the crossing of separate        circuits, according to an
example embodiment. Electrode pairs 308a-b and 308c-d are shown in a crossing
pattern creating first and second circuits 318 and 320.             Modulating outputs of the
first and second circuits 318 and 320 increases the area of the targeted stimulation.
The depth of modulation can vary from 0 to 100% and depends on the direction of
the currents established by the first and second circuits 318 and 320. It has been
shown that when         the first and second circuits 318 and 320 intersect at 900, the
maximum resultant amplitude and the deepest level of modulation is half-way
between the two circuits (450 diagonally) as shown at the intersection 310. Hence, the
target area of stimulation can be augmented by modulation of the amplitudes of the
outputs of the two circuits.
[0053]           Figure 4 is a perspective view illustrating another example configuration of
the implantable electrodes. In this example, the first pair of implantable electrodes 308a-b
and the second pair of implantable electrodes 308c-d are positioned in a parallel
configuration such that a first circuit 318 created between the first pair of implantable
electrodes 308a-b is parallel to a second circuit 320 created between the second pair of
implantable electrodes 308c-d.
                                              - 10 -

[0054]          Beat frequency signals can be generated when the circuits are in a parallel
configuration as shown in Figure 4, and there is an alignment of the generated fields. In a
band 310 where both fields align, there is a more focusable beat field that produces a
controllable peak of amplitude within the modulation envelope. The area of overlap and
concentration in the parallel electrode configuration can be maximized by biasing the
electrodes so as to achieve aligned fields in the region of concentration (target). Biasing
may be performed such that an anode and cathode of one pair of implantable electrodes are
aligned vertically (longitudinal) and an anode and cathode of the other pair of implantable
electrodes are aligned vertically (longitudinal) proximal to each other to form an area of
overlap, and agreement with the beat frequency in between the two channels (circuits), as
shown in Figure 4.
[0055]          In addition, biasing the first pair of implantable electrodes 308a-b and the
second pair of implantable electrodes 308c-d may be performed to cause the first field and
the second field 318 and 320 to be unaligned for an untargeted region of concentration.
Thus, in areas other than proximal to the target region, the beat frequency signal will be
minimal and ineffective.
[0056]            A horizontal distance between the two channels may be about between 1
mm and 5 mm, for example. Additionally, the first pair of implantable electrodes 308a-b
may be positioned at a longitudinal (edge to edge) separation distance of about 2 mm to 10
mm, and the second pair of implantable electrodes 308c-d may be positioned at a
longitudinal (edge to edge) separation distance of about 2 mm to 10 mm, for example.
[0057]          Figure 5 illustrates an example implantable electrode arrangement. Figure 5
illustrates two interferential currents 406 with sine-wave-like waveforms that are
produced by two implantable quadripolar leads 409. Each quadripolar lead 409
includes four electrodes 408 for a total of eight. The two quadripolar leads 409 allow
a greater target treatment stimulation area of the spinal cord.         However, electrical
stimulators of the present disclosure may also apply to the use of two bipolar or
octapolar lead systems, and other suitable devices.               The electrodes could be
activated in various combinations and patterns, and not just as shown in the
drawings.
[0058]           Thus, in Figure 5, leads 409 are shown to include four electrodes each,
although any number of electrodes may be included such as six, eight, ten, ... , or up to
thirty or thirty-two, for example. Pairs of implantable electrodes are created between the
electrodes on the leads 409. Pairs may be created between electrodes on the same lead (so
                                              - 11 -

as to create a parallel configuration), or between electrodes on different leads, as shown in
Figure 5 to create a crossing configuration.
[0059]           Separating the electrode pairs may cause a difference in their field strength
toward the lateral extremes. Figure 6 illustrates a field strength view of a simulation of a
3D model of the electrical stimulator in a parallel configuration. Figure 6 shows strength of
a total field as though the electrodes/circuits had the same frequency, and so no
interferential field is generated. As seen, strength of the field is maximum in a center area
500, however, the field spreads laterally along a target area and is not well confined.
[0060]           Figure 7 illustrates another field strength view of a simulation of a 3D model
of the electrical stimulator in a parallel configuration.        In Figure 7, the simulation is
performed with different frequencies provided to the electrodes/circuits to generate an
interferential current. Thus, in Figure 7, strength of the interferential field is shown in a
center area 502. The parallel bias produces a central region where the two fields are equal
and aligned to form a focused modulation beat frequency envelope on a target area.
[0061]           Figure 8 illustrates an example field strength view across the spinal column
as though the electrodes were biased with a single frequency. In Figure 8, electrodes 602
and 608 are implanted to a dura matter 606, and provide penetration to a pyramid tract 608
of the spinal column. Similar to the simulation shown in Figure 6, a field provided by the
electrodes 602 and 604 in Figure 8 is not well directed and a maximum strength of the field
is not well confined to a target area 610. In Figures 6 and 8, darker field lines indicate a
stronger field.
[0062]           Figure 9 illustrates another example field strength view across the spinal
column as though the electrodes were biased with multiple frequencies.            Similar to the
simulation shown in Figure 7, a field provided by the electrodes 602 and 604 in Figure 9
includes an interferential field. A parallel bias produces a central region 612 where the two
fields are about equal and aligned to provide a concentrated field at the target area.
[0063]           A rostrocaudal field component in the models shown in Figures 8-9 is the z
component, Ez. A total field for non-interferential bias (e.g., Figure 8) is given by a vector
sum of the carrier fields. In a static solution, and maintaining phase between the two fields,
Ez is a magnitude Elz+E2zl. In Figure 9, the interferential field is strongest where the two
carrier fields are aligned, and if the two components are equal, the modulation envelope is
 100%. If the two components are unequal, the modulation envelope is given by twice the
                                                - 12 -

magnitude of the lesser component.           Thus, Ez is (2 x min(|Elz|, E2zl)), taking the
magnitude individually because the phase relation changes over time.
[0064]           Electrodes are placed and biased so as to produce alignment and equal
strength for the component fields at a target area of a desired strong interferential signal. In
addition, electrodes are placed such that either the fields are unaligned (e.g., perpendicular),
or one of the components is weak at other areas for undesired interferential fields (e.g.,
untargeted areas). Either condition of unalignment or a weak component produces a weak
interferential field.
[0065]           Figures 10-12 illustrate further example field strength views across the spinal
column as though the electrodes were biased with multiple frequencies and with variations
in the electrode spacing. In Figures 10-12, an interferential field is generated and directed
to target areas 614, 616, and 618. Horizontal separation of the electrodes 602 and 604 can
affect a depth and spreading of penetration.          For example, Figure 10 illustrates the
electrodes at about 1.5 mm separation, Figure 11 illustrates the electrodes 602 and 604 at
about 2.3 mm separation and Figure 12 illustrates the electrodes 602 and 604 at about 3.9
mm separation. The variance of the shape of the field appears optimized at a spacing of
about 2.3 mm, however, selective depth of penetration can be achieved using spacing from
about 1 mm to about 5 mm, for example.
[0066]           Figure 13 shows a flowchart of an example method for spinal cord
stimulation treatment using electrical stimulation of a spinal cord, according to an
example embodiment.        The method shown in Figure 13 presents an embodiment of a
method that, for example, could be used by the stimulator shown in Figure 1, for example,
and may be performed by components of the stimulator in Figure 1. In some instances,
components of the stimulator may be configured to perform the functions such that the
components are actually configured and structured (with hardware and/or software) to
enable such performance.      In other examples, components of the devices and/or systems
may be arranged to be adapted to, capable of, or suited for performing the functions, such as
when operated in a specific manner. The method may include one or more operations,
functions, or actions as illustrated by one or more of blocks 702-706. Although the blocks
are illustrated in a sequential order, these blocks may also be performed in parallel, and/or
in a different order than those described herein. Also, the various blocks may be combined
into fewer blocks, divided into additional blocks, and/or removed based upon the desired
implementation.

[0067]          It should be understood that for this and other processes and methods
disclosed herein,     flowcharts   show functionality     and operation     of one possible
implementation of present embodiments. Alternative implementations are included within
the scope of the example embodiments of the present disclosure in which functions may be
executed out of order from that shown or discussed, including substantially concurrent or in
reverse order, depending on the functionality involved, as would be understood by those
reasonably skilled in the art.
[0068]          At block 702, the method includes positioning a first pair of implantable
electrodes to a dura matter in an epidural space proximate to a subject's spinal cord at
predetermined locations. At block 704, the method includes positioning a second pair of
implantable electrodes to the dura matter in the epidural space proximate to the subject's
spinal cord at predetermined locations.
[0069]          As described, the first pair of implantable electrodes and the second pair of
implantable electrodes may be positioned in a crossing configuration such that a first circuit
created between the first pair of implantable electrodes crosses a second circuit created
between the second pair of implantable electrodes. In another example, the first pair of
implantable electrodes and the second pair of implantable electrodes may be positioned in a
parallel configuration such that a first circuit created between the first pair of implantable
electrodes is parallel to a second circuit created between the second pair of implantable
electrodes. In these examples, the first circuit and the second circuit generate a first field
and a second field, and the first pair of implantable electrodes and the second pair of
implantable electrodes are positioned such that the first field and the second field overlap to
produce the at least one beat signal.
[0070]          At block 706, the method includes transmitting signals of first and second
frequencies through the first and second pairs of implantable electrodes respectively, so that
the signals of the first and second frequencies interfere with each other to produce at least
one beat signal proximate to the subject's spinal cord. The at least one beat signal has a
frequency within a range of more than 250 Hz to about 15,000 Hz.
[0071]          Within examples, the method includes transmitting signals of first
frequencies of about 20,000 Hz through the first pair of implantable electrodes, transmitting
signals of second frequencies of about 10,000 Hz through the second pair of implantable
electrodes, and the signals of the first and second frequencies interfere with each other to
                                             - 14 -

produce the at least one beat signal proximate to the subject's spinal cord of about 10,000
Hz.
[0072]          In other examples, the method includes transmitting signals of first
frequencies of about 20,000 Hz through the first pair of implantable electrodes, transmitting
signals of second frequencies of about 5,000 Hz through the second pair of implantable
electrodes, and the signals of the first and second frequencies interfere with each other to
produce the at least one beat signal proximate to the subject's spinal cord of about 15,000
Hz.
[0073]          Frequencies of signals may be transmitted through the first and second pair
of implantable electrodes within ranges of about 0 to about 20,000 Hz, or any ranges than
can result in a beat signal having a frequency in a range of more than 250 Hz to about
 15,000 Hz. The beat signal frequency results from interference of the two signals from the
first and second pair of implantable electrodes (e.g., for a frequency of 2,000 Hz at the first
pair of implantable electrodes creating a first field interfering with a second field generated
by the second pair of implantable electrodes due to a frequency of 12,000 Hz results in a
beat signal frequency of about 10k Hz).
[0074]          Based on combinations of the first and second frequencies, the beat signal
may be in a range of more than 250 Hz to about 15,000 Hz. Other examples of the beat
signal include a signal in a range of frequency between about 3,000 Hz to about 15,000 Hz,
a range of frequency between about 5,000 Hz to about 15,000 Hz, a range of frequency
between about 10,000 Hz to about 15,000 Hz, a range of frequency between about 12,000
Hz to about 15,000 Hz, a range of frequency of more than 250 Hz to about 10,000 Hz, a
range of frequency between about 3,000 Hz to about 5,000 Hz, a range of frequency
between about 3,000 Hz to about 10,000 Hz, a range of frequency between about 3,000 Hz
to about 12,000 Hz, a range of frequency between about 5,000 Hz to about 10,000 Hz, a
range of frequency between about 7,000 Hz to about 10,000 Hz, a range of frequency
between about 7,000 Hz to about 12,000 Hz, a range of frequency between about 12,000 Hz
to about 15,000 Hz, or any other ranges between 250 Hz to about 20,000 Hz.
[0075]          Example ranges of frequencies for the beat signal frequency may span a few
hundred Hz, a few thousand Hz, or a few tens of thousands of Hz.
[0076]          A range of the beat signal frequency may be in a lower range, such as more
than 250 Hz to about 3,000 Hz, or within a middle range such as between about 3,000 Hz to
about 7,000 Hz, or a high range such as between about 7,000 Hz to about 15,000 Hz. Any
                                             - 15 -

range or overlapping ranges between more than 250 Hz to about 15,000 Hz may be
generated for the beat signal frequency.
[0077]          Within examples, forming a beat signal at a frequency at ranges described
herein allows the signal to reach deeper into the dorsal column, and enables the signal to
affect the membrane potential on other deeper structures of the spinal cord. Nociceptive
information is transmitted from the spinal cord to the thalamus via five major ascending
pathways      including     the       spinothalamic,    spinoreticular,   spinomesencephalic,
cerviocothalamic and spinohypothalamic tracts. Figure 14A illustrates an example of the
spinothalamic, spinoreticular, spinomesencephalic tracts, Figure 14B illustrates an example
of the    cerviocothalamic     tract,   and   Figure  14C   illustrates an   example   of the
spinohypothalamic tract.     Using examples herein, the beat signal may be directionally
controlled deep into the subject's tissue proximate to one or more of these ascending
pathways, and avoiding the at least one beat signal remaining in and shunting through
cerebrospinal fluid proximate the subject's dorsal column.
[0078]          Some standard spinal cord stimulation for pain uses low frequencies of 40 to
 100 Hz for beat signals, and focuses on maximizing stimulation of the dorsal column.
Other systems use medium frequency stimulation and do not generate action potentials, but
rather produce "non-paresthesia" stimulation of the spinal cord. In other words, the patient
does not feel any buzzing or stimulation in the areas of pain. The onset of action takes very
long, and usually takes effect from 12 to 16 hours after is initiated. Because the patient
does not feel the stimulation and action potentials are not being generated, the logical
mechanism of action may be that this medium frequency output is affecting the membrane
potential of the outer areas of the cord and potentially decreasing hyperactivity of the
neurons which would be perceived as less pain.
[0079]          Within examples herein, the signals of first and second frequencies may be
transmitted through the first and second pairs of implantable electrodes respectively, so that
the signals of the first and second frequencies interfere with each other to produce at least
one beat signal proximate to the subject's spinal cord and produce a paresthesia-type beat
signal, such that a subject may feel the signal.      In this way, the subject can help with
placement of the electrodes and stimulation of a target area is properly performed.
[0080]          Additionally, as described above, electrodes can be placed to a dura matter in
an epidural space proximate the subject's spinal cord to produce at least one beat signal
proximate to the subject's spinal cord, and avoiding the at least one beat signal remaining in
and shunting through cerebrospinal fluid proximate the subject's dorsal column through
                                               - 16 -

directional control. Spacing of the electrodes further enables directional control of the beat
signal.
[0081]          The    five  major     ascending    pathways    including  the  spinothalamic,
spinoreticular, spinomesencephalic, cerviocothalamic and spinohypothalamic tracts are not
the main targets of older standard SCS because they cannot generate fields deep enough in
the tissue without causing undesirable side effects and shunting of the stimulation.
[0082]          Example interferential SCS stimulation described herein with a beat
frequency of more than 250 Hz to about 15k Hz (e.g., such as in the range of 10 kHz to 15
kHz) is able to generate higher amplitude envelopes of current that can be directed to other
areas of the cord and have effects on the ascending tracts that may not be able to be
accomplished with standard SCS stimulation because the standard SCS cannot generate
such effective beat frequencies and direct the higher amplitude envelopes. The higher beat
frequencies (250 Hz to 15 kHz) would have the added benefit of overcoming capacitive
resistance of interfaces between different tissue types and tissue membranes and allow
passage of sub-threshold and threshold current to deeper layers of the spinal cord.
[0083]          Figure 15 illustrates an example diagram for capacitive resistance of tissue.
Separate tissue may be conceptually considered as having an interface between the tissue as
shown. In Figure 15, U is an applied voltage, and Up is a potential difference. The potential
difference, Up, is counter to the applied voltage, U, and develops a counter-voltage that is
conceptually considered a reactance or capacitive resistance, X. A marked drop of the
reactance of tissue interfaces at increased frequency is shown in the following formula:
                                                   1
                                            X        C
where X is capacitive resistance (reactance), f is frequency of the current, and C is
polarization capacitance of the tissue.
[0084]          For a 100 Hz alternating current, and C of 10-6, the reactance X is about 1600
ohms. For a 10k Hz alternating current, the reactance X is about 16 ohms.
[0085]          An interferential system of SCS that generates a higher beat frequency from
250 Hz to 15 kHz could penetrate deeper by generating a beat of 10 kHz to 15 kHz at a sub
threshold level for causing action potentials, and is sufficient to affect membrane potentials
of other deeper structures of the cord including the five major ascending pathways directly
rather than through dorsal column stimulation.          Affecting these tracts and other deep
structures of the cord can provide normalizing properties and potentially sooth hyperactivity
                                              - 17 -

in the tracts providing positive regulation of multiple symptoms other than pain such as
cardiovascular, neuroendocirine, respiratory and emotional functions.
[0086]          The electrical stimulator described herein may be fully implanted into a
subject, or portions of the electrical stimulator may be implanted and portions remain
exterior of the subject. As an example, the electrodes may be implantable, as described, and
the interferential current generator and power source can be external and coupled to the
implanted electrodes through wires.      In other examples, coupling may occur through a
wireless link (e.g., radio frequency (RF) link) from the current generator to the electrodes,
such that the electrodes are implanted and the current generator is not implanted. The RF
carrier frequency can be in the MVUlz, GHz or THz range and will induce a current in an
implanted receiver that is linked or connected to the implantable electrodes. The RF carrier
frequency can range from about 1 IMz through about 20 THz.
[0087]          In still other examples, the interferential current generator is implantable in
the subject (and a power source connected to the interferential current generator may be
implanted as well), and the electrodes are further implanted.         The interferential current
generator may be implanted near or in the brachial plexus, or near or underneath the     1 2 th rib
bone, for example.
[0088]          Within examples, using the stimulator 100 in Figure 1 for spinal cord
stimulation (SCS) provides deep stimulation for effective pain relief. Effective pain relief
can be achieved by activating one of the ascending pathways including the spinothalamic,
spinoreticular, spinomesencephalic, cerviocothalamic        and spinohypothalamic tracts, as
described above. In addition, activation of the Gracile nucleus and Pyramid tract in the
spinal cord may provide effective relief. Figure 16 illustrates the Gracile nucleus and
Pyramid tract as ascending and descending tracts in the dorsal column of the spinal cord,
according to an example embodiment.         The spinal cord is encased in a thick membrane
called the dura mater, and inside a layer of the dura mater is cerebrospinal fluid, as shown in
Figure 16.
[0089]          The cerebrospinal fluid is conductive, and stimulation that spreads through
the fluid can cause pain if the current density becomes too high near the dorsal root ganglia
that lie along a vertebral column by the spine.      It is desired to provide deep stimulation
through the dura mater of the spinal cord for activating the Gracile nucleus and Pyramid and
other portions of the Dorsal Column using low levels of stimulation so as to avoid spreading
of stimulation through the cerebrospinal fluid.
                                              - 18 -

[0090]          Using an interferential current SCS, stimulation may be provided deep
through the dura mater with low current levels, thus lowering the threshold of activation of
the Gracile nucleus and Pyramid.         With spinal cord stimulation, if current is simply
increased, the effect may be to spread stimulation through the cerebrospinal fluid, resulting
in stimulation of the dorsal root ganglia, which causes chest and thoracic pain. Using an
interferential current SCS method to directionally control stimulation, low levels of
stimulation can be provided, and deep penetration through the dura mater can be achieved
without spreading of the stimulation and resulting side effects.
[0091]          Experiments using the interferential current SCS method were performed in
the Neuronano Lund Research Center University in Sweden by Marcus Granmo and Jens
Schouenborg.     The results demonstrate that using the interferential electrical stimulator, a
beat frequency is obtained that provides deep and localized stimulation.
[0092]          The Experimental setup included adult rats (Sprague-Dawley,           200-230
grams) that were anesthetized with isoflurane gas (1.8% in a mixture of 60/40 % NO 2 and
oxygen), as described, for example, in Kalliomaki, J., Granmo, M., Schouenborg, J. Pain.
2003 Jul;104(1-2):195-200. Figures 3-4, described above, illustrate the setup of two pairs
of stimulation electrodes (bipolar stimulation, 4 electrodes in total) that were placed
epidurally (to a dura mater in an epidural space) on the spinal cord in two configurations: (i)
a crossed configuration (Figure 3) and (ii) a parallel configuration (Figure 4). Recording
microelectrodes were inserted in the Gracile nucleus and the Pyramid in the brainstem. The
recording electrodes do not provide stimulation to the Gracile nucleus and the Pyramid
tract. Simultaneous recordings from the Gacile nucleus and the Pyramid in the brainstem
render comparison of the effect of stimulation.       The Gracile nucleus receives ascending
sensory information from dorsal column tracts that run relatively superficial in the dorsal
part of the spinal cord. The pyramid, as part of the corticospinal tract, conveys descending
motor commands from the brain to the spinal cord. In the rat spinal cord, the pyramidal
tract is located deep in the dorsal column, i.e. deeper than the dorsal column of the spinal
cord activating the Gracile nucleus. By spinal cord stimulation, activation of the pyramid
tract fibers antidromically evoked volleys in this relatively deep tract that were recorded,
thus giving information about depth of penetration of the stimulation.             After each
experiment, the animals were perfused with formalin and the caudal brain stem was
sectioned to verify the electrode position in the brainstem.
                                              - 19 -

[0093]          Experiments were performed using two types of stimulation paradigms, each
of which was applied to both electrode pairs that were placed epidurally in the two
configurations shown in Figures 3-4. Figure 17A illustrates a first stimulation using sinus
waves of about 500 ts width (corresponding to 2000 Hz waves) applied at a frequency of
about 100 Hz (e.g., pulsed sine waves of 500 ts width applied at a rate of 100 pulses per
second corresponding to 2000 Hz waves) for a conventional stimulation.
[0094]          Figure 17B illustrates a second stimulation using sinus waves of about 500
 ts (corresponding to 2000 Hz) applied to one set of electrode pairs, and sinus waves of
about 476 ts (corresponding to 2100 Hz) applied to the other set of electrode pairs to create
an interference pattern.   The sinus waves were applied at about 100 and about 105 Hz,
respectively (e.g., pulsed sine waves of 500 ts width applied at a rate of 100 pulses per
second corresponding to 2000 Hz waves, and pulsed sine waves of 476 ts width applied at
a rate of 105 pulses per second corresponding to 2100 Hz waves).             A resulting beat
frequency signal of 100 Hz was produced proximate to the subject's spinal cord.
[0095]          During the experiments, measurements were performed of SCS evoked
activity in the Gracilis nucleus and for antidromic evoked volleys in the Pyramid using the
recording microelectrodes. Figure 18 illustrates example placement of electrodes along the
pyramid tract. Stimulation intensity was increased or decreased in increments as shown in
Table 1 below.

single recording experiments. Latency of the Pyramid tract responses which were used in
the analysis (16-19 m/s) were consistent with those observed in the literature (See, e.g.,
                                              -20-

5; 508(2):34 1-4; and Chapman and Yeomans Neuroscience 1994, 59(3):699-711).
[0098]           The Experiments showed that thresholds for activation of both the Gracile
nucleus and the Pyramid were significantly lower when using 100 + 105 Hz interferential
current stimulation than using conventional 100 + 100 Hz stimulation in either the parallel
or crossed configuration.
[0099]          Figures 19A-C illustrate comparisons of threshold data after 100+100 Hz
versus 100+105 Hz stimulation using a crossed electrode configuration.           Results after
Wilcoxon signed rank significance test is shown. N equals the number of animals used,
e.g., 15. Figures 20A-C illustrate comparisons of threshold data after 100+100 Hz versus
 100+105 Hz stimulation using a parallel electrode configuration.      Results after Wilcoxon
signed rank significance test is shown. N equals the number of animals used, e.g., 10.
[00100]         As seen in Figures 19 and 20, for Pyramid activation, conventional
stimulation (left side of bar graphs) required about 1200 mV (in the parallel and cross
configuration); by comparison, interferential stimulation (right side of bar graphs) required
only about 700 mV in the cross configuration or about 600 mV in the parallel configuration.
For Gracile activation, conventional stimulation required about 375 mV in the cross
configuration or about 275 mV in the parallel configuration; by comparison, interferential
stimulation required only about 290 mV in the cross configuration or about 225 mV in the
parallel configuration.
[00101]          To yield a better understanding of the efficacy of the stimulation, a ratio of
the threshold for Pyramid tract activation versus the threshold for Gracile nucleus activation
was graphed. The lower the ratio, the more efficient stimulation to the deep Pyramidal tract
in relation to the Gracile nucleus tract (which is more superficial).    The graphs illustrate
ratios of about 4 using the conventional stimulation as compared to only about 2 using the
interferential stimulation. Thus, interferential stimulation achieves better penetration to the
deeper Pyramidal tract than conventional stimulation.
[00102]          The experimental results demonstrate that interference stimulation with 100
+ 105 Hz (2000 Hz + 2100 Hz) is more effective than 100 + 100 Hz conventional
stimulation in activating the pathways studied, both from a threshold and depth-penetration
perspective. This indicates that the formation of an interference pattern or beat frequency
provided a lower threshold and better penetration.
                                              -21-

[00103]         Applying stimulation using conventional surface electrodes does not enable
deep penetration of the pyramid tract. Electricity follows a path of least resistance, and
applying stimulation on the surface of the skin using surface electrodes does not allow for
stimulation through the vertebrae. Bone is an insulator and has a conductivity of 0.06 s/m,
while skin has a conductivity of 0.436 s/m. To achieve stimulation levels of the pyramid
tract as seen in the experiments using surface stimulation, stimulation would need to be
applied at a voltage level so high that it would result in tissue damage and pain.
[00104]         Table 2 below summarizes the results of the experiments.           It shows the
approximate voltage levels required to activate the Gracile nucleus and the Pyramid tract in
the spinal    cord using an interferential       implantable electrode configuration       and a
conventional implantable electrode configuration.             The results of the experiments
demonstrate that the activation thresholds in the Gracile nucleus and the Pyramid tract in the
dorsal column are significantly lower when using 100 + 105 Hz interferential current
stimulation than when using conventional 100 + 100 Hz stimulation. Furthermore, the same
kind of results were obtained regardless of whether the conventional stimulation was
performed in the parallel or crossed configuration.           More specifically, the activation
thresholds for the deep Pyramid tract were reduced by about 50% using the interferential
current stimulation in either the parallel or crossed configuration. Moreover, the activation
threshold for the Gracile nucleus was reduced by about 20% using interferential current
stimulation in either the parallel or cross configuration.

[00105]         As shown in Table 2, the interferential implantable electrode configuration
achieves activation of the Gracile nucleus and Pyramid in the spinal cord at much lower
voltage levels than are required with a conventional implantable electrode configuration,
thereby providing effective pain relief while minimizing the risk of stimulation of the dorsal
root ganglia, which could lead to chest and thoracic pain.
[00106]         Table 2 also includes estimates for approximate voltages levels that would be
required using an interferential surface electrode configuration.      For example, using the
experimental results, it can be calculated that to achieve stimulation of the Gracile nucleus
and the Pyramid in the spinal cord using an interferential surface electrode configuration,
voltage levels would be required that are much greater than 1200 mV, and are more on the
order of 100's of volts, for example. In any event, the voltage levels are so high that they
are physiologically unsafe.      In any event, it is not true that with any application of
interferential therapy, electrodes can simply be implanted, and the therapy can be scaled
down so that intensity values of the current would be within acceptable levels (that do not
cause pain) while still providing effective therapy to the patient. In contrast, implantable
stimulators are generally used when other physical therapy options have been unsuccessful.
[00107]         Thus, neuronal tracts that lie beneath the surface of the Dorsal Columns (i.e.,
>0.5 mm) can be successfully stimulated using an interferential pattern of electrical fields.
The interferential capability allows for more precise neurostimulation of the adjacent Dorsal
root Entry Zone at one level, with complementary stimulation of the corresponding
neuronal tracts deep within the Dorsal Columns at a different level (depending on the
ultimate lead design).    Other applications include highly precise neurostimulation of the
nerve roots and the Dorsal Root Ganglia themselves, all from an intraspinal, epidural
location.    This ability for control of neuronal stimulation from a three-dimensional
perspective is potentially of considerable importance in advancing the clinical capabilities
of neurostimulation within the spinal canal, and beyond.
