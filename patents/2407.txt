   Field of the Invention
   The present invention relates to a gaming controller, a
 5 gaming device and method of gaming.
   Related Application
   This application is a divisional application of Australian
   application no.  <removed-apn>, which in turn, is a divisional
10 of 2013205990, which in turn is a divisional of
   2010201112, which in turn, is a divisional of 2009901229,
   the disclosure of all of which is incorporated herein by
   reference. Most of the disclosure of these applications is
   also included herein, however, reference may be made to
15 the specifications of application nos. <removed-apn>,
   2013205990,  2010201112 and 2009901229 as filed to gain
   further understanding of the invention claimed herein.
   Background of the Invention
20 Many venues employ controllers for awarding prizes to one
   or more of a plurality of gaming devices participating in
   a linked event.   For example, in a linked event where
   jackpot prizes are awarded, a portion of turnover on each
   gaming device will typically be forwarded to a    jackpot
25 controller as a contribution.    That  is, part of each wager
   goes towards the jackpot.    The technique can be extended
   to a so called wide area jackpot where gaming devices     from
   a number of different venues contribute to a single
   jackpot pool.
30
   While such techniques provide an opportunity for players
   to win large jackpot prizes, the need exists for
                                                             10417577_1

                                2
   alternative gaming systems in order to maintain or
   increase player enjoyment.
   Summary of the Invention
 5 In a first aspect there is provided a method of awarding a
   jackpot, the method comprising the step of:
        determining whether a jackpot trigger, which is
   configured to occur based on a monetary turnover value
   associated with a gaming device, has occurred within a
10 predefined period of time; and
        causing the jackpot trigger to occur irrespective of
   the monetary turnover value associated with the gaming
   device if it is determined that the jackpot trigger has
   not occurred within the predefined period of time.
15
   In an embodiment, the method further comprises initiating
   a jackpot event in response to the jackpot trigger
   occurring.   A prize may be awarded in the jackpot event
   in response to an award criterion being met.  It will be
20 understood that the term "jackpot event" is used herein to
   describe any form of special event and should not be seen
   as being limited only to events where a jackpot prize is
   awarded from a jackpot prize pool.  For example, a jackpot
   event may comprise initiating a linked game or bonus round
25 whereby players compete for the opportunity to win some
   form of prize or award.
   In an embodiment the method comprises the further step of
   varying the predefined time period for subsequent
30 triggers.

   determination as to whether the current period is a peak
   or non-peak time period based on a jackpot contribution
   rate for gaming devices participating in the jackpot.
10 In an embodiment a probability of the jackpot trigger
   occurring before the predefined time period has elapsed is
   dependent on either an amount or rate of contributions
   made by one or more of the gaming devices toward a prize
   pool from which a jackpot prize is awarded.
15
   In an embodiment the method comprises the further step of

   of the participating game devices a probability of being
20 awarded the prize is dependent on the number of tickets
   allocated thereto.
   In an embodiment the probability is further dependent on a
   total number of tickets allocated.
25
   In an embodiment the allocation criteria specifies a
   number or rate of tickets to allocate to individual gaming
   devices of the participating gaming devices, based on
   contributions made towards the jackpot prize pool.   In an
30 alternative embodiment the tickets are allocated to the
   participating gaming devices in a random fashion.
   In an embodiment the jackpot is triggered when a
   predefined total number of tickets have been allocated.
35 In another embodiment, the jackpot is ordinarily triggered
   when a predefined jackpot prize pool amount has been
   reached.
                                                          10417577_1

   to initiate a jackpot event in response to the jackpot
   trigger occurring.  The controller may further comprise an
   award module arranged to award a prize in response to an
   award criterion being met in the jackpot event.
25
   In an embodiment the predefined time period varies for
   subsequent jackpot events.
   In an embodiment the predefined time period varies
30 dependent, at least in part, on whether a current time
   period is a peak or non-peak time period.
   In an embodiment a determination is made by the controller
   as to whether the current period is a peak or non-peak
35 time period based on a jackpot contribution rate for
   gaming devices participating in the jackpot.

   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings there is shown a jackpot
 5 controller 111 comprising a configuration module 623
   operable to determine whether a jackpot trigger, which is
   configured to occur based on a monetary turnover value
   associated with a gaming device, has occurred within a
   predefined period of time.  A trigger module 622
10 implemented by the jackpot controller 111 is arranged to
   cause the jackpot trigger to occur irrespective of the
   monetary turnover value associated with the gaming device
   if it is determined that the jackpot trigger has not
   occurred within the predefined period of time. In response
15 to determining the jackpot trigger, the trigger module 622
   may initiate a jackpot event in which a jackpot prize is
   eligible to be awarded.
   General System Configuration
20
   In the gaming system configuration 100A, a jackpot
   controller 110 is in data communication with a plurality
   of gaming devices 120 over a network 130.  The jackpot
   controller 110 is operable to trigger and co-ordinate play
25 of jackpot events during which players of the gaming
   devices 120 are provided with an opportunity to win
   jackpot prizes.  In the embodiment described herein, it
   will be understood that a jackpot event could simply be
   the instantaneous awarding of a jackpot prize, or
30 alternatively could be the triggering of a game (e.g. a
   bonus or co-operative game, etc.) in which the jackpot
   prize is eligible to be awarded.
                                                          10417577_1

                                 9
   Gaming Devices
 5 Within the detailed description, the term gaming device is
   used to refer to any device used by a player to a play a
   game of chance and specifically includes stand alone
   gaming machines and interactive video terminals which
   implement games in a client/server architecture.
10
   A gaming device in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a cabinet 12 having a display 14 on which is
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
15 by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine 10,  in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
20 chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.  A player marketing module 50  (see Figure 5)
   comprising a reading device may also be provided for the
25 purpose of reading a player tracking device, for example
   as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking device
   may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any other
   portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device.
30
   A top box 26 may carry static artwork 28, including for
   example pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game 16.   Further
                                                           10417577_1

                                 10
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the cabinet 12.   A  coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
 5
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.  Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
10 display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.   The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14,   or of a different
   type.
15
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine 300 which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
20 The gaming machine 300 includes a game controller 301
   having a processor 302.   Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 302 are   stored in a memory 303,
   which is in data communication with the processor 302.
   Typically, the gaming machine 300 will include both
25 volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 303.
   The gaming machine 300 has hardware meters 304     for
30 purposes including ensuring regulatory compliance and
   monitoring player credit, an input/output    (I/O)  interface
   305 for communicating with peripheral devices of the
   gaming machine 300.  The input/output interface 305 and/or
                                                             10417577_1

                                 11
   the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
   their own memory for storing associated instructions and
   data for use with the input/output interface or the
   peripheral devices.  A random number generator module 313
 5 generates random numbers  for use by the processor 302.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the
   reference to random numbers includes pseudo-random
   numbers.
10 In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 320
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 301 comprise one or more displays  306, buttons
   and/or a touch screen 307,  a card and/or ticket reader
   308, a printer 309, a bill acceptor and/or coin input
15 mechanism 310 and a coin output mechanism 311.   Additional
   hardware may be included as part of the gaming machine
   300, or hardware may be omitted as required for the
   specific implementation.
20 In addition, the gaming machine 300 may include a
   communications interface,  for example a network card 312.
   The network card 312 may, for example,  send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
25 data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 303.   The memory 303 includes
30 RAM 303A, EPROM 303B and a mass storage device 303C.    The
   RAM 303A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 302 and related data.    The
   EPROM 303B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
                                                           10417577_1

                                 12
   some system or game related code.   The mass  storage
   device 303C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 302 using protected code  from the EPROM 303B
 5 or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 300 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 306,307,308,309,310,311 to be
10 provided remotely from the game controller 301.
   A gaming machine as indicated above may also take the form
   of a client/server architecture where a portion of the
   game is executed on the client and a portion of the game
15 is executed on the server.   In such embodiments, the
   client typically takes the form of an interactive video
   terminal which has a similar outward appearance to the
   gaming machine described above.   A person skilled in the
   art will appreciate that the type of gaming machine that
20 is employed is not important to the present invention.
   A further possible gaming system configuration is shown in
   Figure 5.   From Figure 5 it is seen that a plurality of
   gaming machines 10 each implement a player marketing
25 module PMM 50 which is connected to the electronic gaming
   machine via a serial connection 510.   Each PMM 50 is
   additionally connected by an Ethernet connection 520 to a
   ethernet hub 530.
30 Utilising the PMMs 50,  it is possible for the gaming
   machines 10 to communicate with one another over the
   Ethernet  520.  In the embodiment, an ethernet compatible
   protocol allows broadcast communications   (e.g. to a
                                                           10417577_1

                                 13
   broadcast address) as well as address communications to be
   made between one of the gaming machines and another of the
   gaming machines.
 5 Thus, according to the Figure 5 configuration, one of the
   gaming machines 10 is a capable of acting as a server
   providing networked game play and/or jackpot
   functionality.   In the specific embodiment illustrated in
   Figure 5, gaming machine 10a is designated as a master
10 (i.e. the server) whereas the remaining gaming machines
   10b to 1On are designated as slaves  (i.e. the clients).
   Further Detail of the Controller
15 As described in preceding paragraphs, embodiments of the
   present invention relate to a system, controller and
   method for triggering jackpots. More specifically,
   embodiments relate to a system for forcibly triggering a
   jackpot event when the jackpot event has not ordinarily
20 been triggered within a predefined time period.
   To carry out such functionality, the gaming system
   comprises a controller 111, as shown in more detail in
   Figure 6.  According to the described embodiment, the
25 controller 111 is incorporated into the jackpot
   controller 110 of the gaming system 100   (see Figure 1).
   For simplicity, only those modules needed to carry out
   embodiments of the invention are illustrated in Figure 6.
30 The controller 111 includes a processor 62 which is
   arranged to carry out the functions associated with
   triggering jackpot events and awarding jackpot prizes.      It
   will be apparent that the processor 62 implements a number
                                                           10417577_1

                                  14
   of modules, namely a trigger module 622,     configuration
   module 623, timer module 624,    ticket management module
   626, random number generator    (RNG) 628,  award module 632
   and display controller module 634,    based on program code
 5 stored in memory 64.
   In more detail, and with reference to Figure 7, the timer
   module 624 is programmed to effectively operate as a
   countdown timer which automatically counts down from a
10 specified time after triggering of a previous jackpot
   event and triggers  jackpot events during that time period
   in response to an ordinary trigger     (e.g. mystery trigger)
   occurring. See steps 702 to 708 and 712.     If the specified
   time period has elapsed   (i.e. the counter has   reached time
15 zero) without a trigger occurring, the timer module 624
   sends an alert signal to the trigger module 622 causing
   the trigger module 622 to forcibly trigger the next
   jackpot event  (as described in more detail in subsequent
   paragraphs).  See steps  710 to 712.     Alternatively, the
20 trigger module 622 may poll the timer module periodically
   to establish whether the predefined time period has
   elapsed.
   The timer module 624 may be programmable     such that the
25 predefined time can be modified by a gaming operator, or
   automatically modified, depending on a set of timer
   rules 642 programmed into memory 64.      In an embodiment,
   the timer rules  642 cause the predefined time to be
   adjusted dependent on a current time period.      For example,
30 during "off-peak" periods, the predefined time period may
   be shortened so as to provide players with an increased
   opportunity to be awarded a   jackpot prize than would
                                                              10417577_1

                                 15
   ordinarily be the case  (e.g. where the triggering rules
   are ordinarily based on turnover).
   In an embodiment, the timer rules   642 may dictate that the
 5 predefined time is slightly varied for each countdown so
   that players are unable to calculate the exact time at
   which the next jackpot event must be triggered.    For
   example, the timer module 624 may be programmed to include
   a variance of plus or minus 20 minutes to the predefined
10 time.  The actual variance   (within a particular tolerance)
   selected for each countdown event may be randomly
   determined utilising the RNG 628.    In an alternative
   embodiment, the variance may follow a pathways selection
   technique whereby, for each subsequent countdown, a set
15 variance will be applied according to a pre-programmed
   selection.
   As described above, the trigger module 622 is operable to
   trigger the jackpot event in one of two ways.    Firstly,
20 the trigger module 622 may be "forced" to trigger the
   jackpot event in response to determining that the
   predefined time period has elapsed, as discussed above.
   Alternatively, the trigger module 622 may trigger the
   jackpot event in accordance with an "ordinary" triggering
25 technique which dictates that the jackpot event be
   triggered before the predefined time period has elapsed.
   In accordance with the embodiment illustrated herein, the
   ordinary jackpot event trigger is dependent, at least in
30 part, on a predefined monetary turnover value associated
   with a gaming machine.   More  specifically, the event is
   ordinarily triggered when a predetermined number of
   "virtual tickets" have been allocated to participating
                                                            10417577_1

                                 16
   gaming machines, as described in more detail below.    It
   will readily be understood, however, that the jackpot
   event could ordinarily be triggered in any number of
   different ways.   For example, the triggering technique
 5 could be based on a mystery-type technique whereby a
   jackpot event is triggered upon determining that a total
   value of contributions made by participating gaming
   machines toward a jackpot prize pool   (from which the
   jackpot prize is awarded) has surpassed a randomly
10 determined value. In an alternative embodiment, the
   jackpot prizes may be awarded in a feature game which is
   triggered using the Hyperlink TM trigger system, as
   described in published Australian patent No. 754689, the
   contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
15
   An example game play methodology is illustrated in
   Figure 8.
   In an initial step 802, a predefined number of virtual
20 tickets are generated by the ticket management module 626,
   in accordance with a ticket issuing program 644 stored in
   the memory 64.   The predefined number of tickets generated
   may, for example, correspond to the number of
   participating gaming machines.    At step 804, the countdown
25 timer 624 is started.
   Steps 806 and 808 involve determining whether both the
   predefined time period has elapsed and whether all tickets
   have been allocated.   If a positive determination is made
30 at either of steps 806 or 808, the jackpot event is
   triggered (see explanation of step 812 below).    If a
   negative determination is made, tickets are allocated to
   individual gaming machines as per the ticket allocation
   criteria  (step 810). In the illustrated embodiment, ticket
35 allocation is triggered by receipt at the ticket
                                                           10417577_1

                                  17
   management module 626 of a communication from a gaming
   machine indicating that a gaming machine has reached a
   specific turnover threshold.
 5 In the illustrated example, the jackpot event triggered at
   step 812 involves drawing a predefined number of virtual
   tickets from the same set of tickets generated at
   step 802.   At step 814, the award module 632 awards prizes
   to players of gaming machines that have been allocated
10 corresponding tickets.    If the award module 632 determines
   that the drawn tickets do not correspond with any
   allocated tickets   (e.g. where the jackpot prize event was
   forcibly triggered before all generated tickets have been
   allocated),  then no prizes are awarded and the process
15 returns to step 802.    In an embodiment, the predefined
   number of drawn tickets may depend on the number of gaming
   machines being played, the current jackpot prize pool
   value, the required return to player    (RTP), or some other
   suitable parameter.
20
   It will be appreciated that other awarding techniques may
   equally apply at step 814.    For example, there may only be
   one major prize on offer and the probability of a gaming
   machine being awarded the major prize is dependent on the
25 number of tickets allocated to that machine.     Another
   example may involve randomly awarding prizes to machines
   that have been allocated tickets.
   In accordance with the above embodiment, even during "off
30 peak" times where the probability of ordinarily triggering
   a jackpot prize is reduced, players are    still provided
   with an opportunity to win   jackpot prizes by virtue of the
   forced time-based trigger.
35 While the above embodiment was described in relation to a
   gaming system which includes a plurality of gaming
   machines and a ticket management module in networked
                                                             10417577_1

                                 18
   relationship to the gaming machines, it will be understood
   that other arrangements are possible.   For example, the,
   or each, gaming machine may include a ticket management
   module or some aspects of the ticket allocation system so
 5 that game implementation including allocation of tickets
   and determining whether an allocated ticket corresponds to
   a winning outcome, occurs at the gaming machine.
   In one embodiment, instead of allocating virtual tickets,
10 actual physical tickets may be printed at the gaming
   machines.
   In one embodiment, the physical tickets may themselves
   provide an indication to players as to whether an award
15 has been received, for example in the form of scratch
   cards.   In this way, drawing tickets to determine one or
   more winning tickets is not necessary.
   It will be understood that in alternative embodiments,
20 objects other than tickets may be allocated to the gaming
   machines.   For example, instead of allocating tickets, the
   gaming machines may be awarded card hands.   Each player's
   hand can then be played against the other in the jackpot
   event to win a prize.
25
   It will be appreciated that the prize awarded by the award
   module 632 may be other than a monetary award.   For
   example the prize may be a bonus award such as, for
   example, the issuing of free games, credits, or the like.
30
   In the above described embodiments, the controller 111 was
   implemented by the jackpot controller 110 of the gaming
   system.   However, it will readily be understood that the
   controller 111 could equally be implemented as a stand
35 alone device, or incorporated into other suitable system
   modules.   For example, if the Figure 5 system architecture
                                                           10417577_1

                                 19
   were utilised for game play, the controller 111 could be
   incorporated into one or more of the individual gaming
   machine player marketing modules 50.
 5 The person skilled in the art will appreciate that the
   method of the embodiment could be implemented in program
   code.  The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a computer readable medium, such as a
   disk or memory  (for example, that could replace part of
10 the memory 103) or as a data signal (for example, by
   downloading it from a server).   The program code could be
   executed by more than one processing unit.   For example,
   partly by the server module and partly by the client (and
   accordingly spread between a number of different
15 locations).
   It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that
   numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to
   the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without
20 departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as
   broadly described.   The present embodiments are,
   therefore, to be considered in all respects as
   illustrative and not restrictive.
