The present invention provides livestock animals and methods to create recipient animals for
spermatogonial stem cell transplantation through modulation of the NANOS gene. In one
embodiment genome editing issued to create animals with insertions or deletions (indels) that
inactivate or otherwise modulate NANOS gene activity so that resulting males lack functional
germ cells yet retain functional somatic cells, and females are fertile. These males can then be
transplanted with donor spermatogonial stem cells and used for breeding.

   TITLE:                       NANOS KNOCK-OUT THAT ABLATES GERMLINE CELLS
   CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
                   This is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2015289799, the entire
 5 content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
                   The present invention relates to a genetically edited non-human livestock animal. The
   methods of the present invention provide for modified NANOS genes in animals so that males
10 lack germline cells while females are fertile. The resultant male animals are then available for
   spermatogonial stem cell transplantation and use in breeding programs.
   BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
                   Genetic gain in livestock can be described as the improvement in production
15 characteristics within a population from generation-to-generation as a result of selective
   breeding. Exploiting this principle is an important aspect for food animal production to
   enhance growth efficiency, animal health, and product quality for the consumer while also
   reducing environmental impact. In livestock production, the majority of genetic gain is made
   via selective breeding of desirable sires. Thus, expanding the availability of sperm from
20 individual sires can greatly impact food animal production on a global scale. Artificial
   insemination (AI) methodology has been exploited in commercial livestock production to
   improve production characteristics worldwide. Despite advances, expansive use of elite boars
   and bulls for Al in the livestock breeding industry has been hampered due to limitations in the
   absolute number of sperm that can be collected from an individual. For boars, ejaculates are
25 collected 1-2 times a week and a single ejaculate yields ~20 Al doses.                   Each sow is
   inseminated 2-3 times during a given estrous cycle. Thus, less than 20 sows can be bred each
   week with sperm from a desirable sire. Thus, novel approaches for expanding the output and
   availability of gametes from desirable sires and preserving the germline are of significant
   need.
30                 Spermatogenesis produces millions of sperm daily and the foundation for such vast
   numbers is provided by the actions of the undifferentiated spermatogonial population that
                                                           1

   WO 2016/011029                                                               PCT/US2015/040379
    contains spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). One of the unique properties of SSCs is their
    ability to colonize the testis of a recipient animal and regenerate spermatogenesis following
    transplantation. SSC transplantation methodology has been developed for rodent models
    and adaptation of this approach to pigs would provide an effective breeding tool for
 5  expanding and preserving the germline and genetic merit of individual sires. Critical
    aspects for applying SSC transplantation methodology are: 1) production of recipient
    animals that lack an endogenous germline, but possess intact support cell populations (i.e.
    Sertoli and Leydig cells); 2) expansion of the relatively rare donor SSCs in vitro to
    generate optimal numbers for successful transplantation into several recipient males; and 3)
10  injection of SSCs into recipient testis.
             The efficiency of donor SSC colonization is influenced by the environment of
    recipient testes. Elimination of endogenous germ cells is critical for accessibility of donor
    SSCs to engraft within seminiferous tubules of recipient testes. In addition,
    spermatogenesis is regulated by intimate interaction between germ cells and testis support
15  cell populations including Sertoli and Leydig cells. Thus, health of somatic cells at the
    time of transplantation impacts the success of donor SSC colonization. For rodents,
    treating adult males with chemotoxic drugs, notably the alkylating agent busulfan and
    localized testicular irradiation have each been used to effectively prepare recipients for
    SSC transplantation. While both treatments result in depletion of endogenous germ cells
20  and donor SSCs are able to engraft, the function of somatic support cells is often
    negatively impacted and some endogenous germ cells always remain leading to
    regeneration of a mix of donor and endogenous spermatogenesis. In mice, the greatest
    success of SSC transplantation involves the use of recipients that are sterile due to
    inactivation of genes required for germ cell survival at the earliest stages of
25  spermatogenesis. Partial ablation of spermatogenesis in which the spermatogonial
    population persists is not effective for preparing recipients. In such a case, chemotoxic
    drugs must still be used to eliminate the persisting spermatogonia thereby opening niches
    for donor SSCs to engraft. Males in which survival of primordial germ cells (PGCs),
    gonocytes, or SSCs is compromised provide an ideal recipient.
30           For pigs and other large domestic animals, treatment with chemotoxic drugs to
    prepare recipient males is not feasible due to the requirement of high dosage of drugs for
    complete elimination of germ cells. These treatments often produce unintended
                                                     2

   WO 2016/011029                                                                PCT/US2015/040379
    consequences of toxicity on bone marrow stem cells and other tissue-specific stem cells.
    Additionally, feces and urine would need to be collected as a bio-hazardous waste. Local
    testicular irradiation is a potential alternative that overcomes the limitations of chemotoxic
    drug treatment, however the dose of irradiation needs to be precisely controlled and the
 5  procedure inflicts damage on the supporting cells, including Leydig cells thereby
    negatively affecting generation of donor-derived spermatogenesis. Ideal recipients are
    males lacking an endogenous germline due to a genetic deficiency that leaves the somatic
    support cell population functionally intact.
            As can be seen, there is a need in the art for animals where the male has no germ
10  cells but retains functional somatic cells and is thus eligible for SSC transplantation, while
    ideally females are fertile.
    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
             The present invention provides animals and methods for spermatogonial stem cell
15  transplantation by creating recipient animals that have modulated NANOS expression.
    The animals have inactivated or otherwise modulated NANOS gene activity resulting in
    males which lack functional germ cells yet retain functional somatic cells, and females
    which are fertile. These animals can be created using any of a number of protocols such as
    knock-out technology or gene-editing.
20           Thus an embodiment of the invention is a genetically edited or modified livestock
    animal comprising a genome with inactivation of a NANOS gene selective for germline
    cell function.
            Yet another embodiment of the invention is a process of making a livestock animal
    comprising introducing to a livestock animal cell or livestock embryo, an agent that
25  specifically binds to a chromosomal target site of the cell and causes a double-stranded
    DNA break or otherwise inactivates a NANOS gene therein using gene editing methods
    such as the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) /Cas
    system, Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs), Zinc Finger
    Nucleases (ZFN), or recombinase fusion proteins.
30          Yet another embodiment of the invention is a process of producing a male sperm
    donor for livestock breeding with a desired spermatogonial stem cell genetic component
    comprising; collecting donor SSCs from a desired male donor, proliferating SSCs in vitro,
                                                      3

   WO 2016/011029                                                                PCT/US2015/040379
    and thereafter transplanting donor SSCs to a NANOS2 -/- male so that spermatogenic
    colonies are generated and persist for a long period of time with the donor germline cells.
            Yet another embodiment of the invention includes the production of livestock
    animals comprising natural mating and/or artificial insemination of female livestock with
 5  donor sperm from the recipient NANAOS2 -/- male.
            Also described herein is the use of one or more particular NANOS loci in tandem
    with a polypeptide capable of effecting cleavage and/or integration of specific nucleic acid
    sequences within the NANOS loci. Examples of the use of NANOS loci in tandem with a
    polypeptide capable of effecting cleavage and/or integration of the NANOS loci include a
10  polypeptide selected from the group consisting of zinc finger proteins, meganucleases,
    TAL domains, TALENs, RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas recombinases, leucine zippers, and
    others known to those in the art. Particular examples include a chimeric ("fusion") protein
    comprising a site-specific DNA binding domain polypeptide and cleavage domain
    polypeptide (e.g., a nuclease), such as a ZFN protein comprising a zinc-finger polypeptide
15  and a FokI nuclease polypeptide. In certain aspects, described herein are polypeptides
    comprising a DNA-binding domain that specifically binds to a NANOS gene. In some
    embodiments such a polypeptide may also comprise a nuclease (cleavage) domain or half
    domain (e.g., a ZFN, a recombinase, a transposase, or a homing endonuclease, including a
    homing endonuclease with a modified DNA-binding domain, TAL domains, TALENs,
20  RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas), and/or a ligase domain, such that the polypeptide may induce
    a targeted double-stranded break, and/or facilitate recombination of a nucleic acid of
    interest at the site of the break. In particular embodiments, a DNA-binding domain that
    targets a NANOS locus may be a DNA-cleaving functional domain. The foregoing
    polypeptides may be used in some embodiments to introduce an exogenous nucleic acid
25  into the genome of a host organism (e.g., an animal species) at one or more NANOS loci.
    In certain embodiments, the DNA-binding domains comprise a zinc finger protein with one
    or more zinc fingers (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or more zinc fingers), which is engineered
    (non-naturally occurring) to bind to any sequence within a NANOS gene. Any of the zinc
    finger proteins described herein may bind to a target site within the coding sequence of the
30  target gene or within adjacent sequences (e.g., promoter or other expression elements). In
    certain embodiments, the zinc finger protein binds to a target site in a NANOS gene, for
    example, approximately 20 bases in exon 1.

    DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES
 5           Figure 1 is a composite of a multiple sequence alignment of porcine genomes to
    identify potential single nucleotide polymorphisms within the porcine NANOS2 gene
    (denoted by red dots) that could be used informatively in the design of genome editing
    reagents.
             Figure 2 shows the results of digested PCR products on agarose gel to identify
10  NHEJ events. Genomic DNA was prepared from PK15 cells transfected with plasmids
    encoding TALEN pairs A, B or C then amplified with PCR primers oSL9 and oSL10.
    Mismatches were identified by digestion with the enzyme Cell.
             Figures 3A, 3B and 3C show the sequence of guide RNA binding sequence (SEQ
    ID NO: 15 and SEQ ID NO: 16). Figure 3C shows the construct with the guides, the human
15  U6 promoter, sgRNA binding sequence and terminator sequence. U6 promoter sequence
    (SEQ ID NO: 18), target sequence (SEQ ID NO:19), gRNA scaffold (SEQ ID NO: 20)
    terminal sequence (SEQ ID NO: 21).
             Figure 4 shows the digested PCR products on agarose gel of Porcine CRISPR/Cas9
    acting on DNA from PK15 cells. Three plasmids encoding the sgRNA sequence, a CAG
20  driven Cas9 and a CMV-driven eGFP respectively were co-transfected into PK15 cells.
    PCR was carried out on resultant genomic DNA with primers oSL9 and oSL 10. Digested
    PCR products were resolved on a 2% TAE agarose gel. While both guide sequences
    resulted in cutting and NHEJ formation at the target site (indicated by the presence of Cell
    digestion products, red arrows), surprisingly it was discovered that the sgRNA sequence in
25  reverse orientation with respect to the coding sequence was substantially more efficient
    than its sense counterpart.
             Figure 5A is a map of the pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458) plasmid. Figure 5B
    shows the sequence annotations pX458 partial sequence (SEQ ID NO:22); hU6 sequence
    (SEQ ID NO:23), gRNA sequence (SEQ ID NO:24), terminal sequence (SEQ ID NO:25).

             Figures 6A and 6B is a gel of PCR products from genomic DNA post transfection
    and showed substantial differences in the efficiencies with which sgRNAs were able to

25          Figure 15 shows the genotypes of NANOS2 null male and female piglets generated
    by SCNT. In the figure, the 20 nucleotide guide sequence targeting NANOS2 (SEQ ID
    NO: 162) is highlighted in green and underlined followed by the 3 nt PAM motif
    (highlighted in blue). In the male knockouts, both alleles have 7 nt deletions in the
    NANOS2 ORF causing disruption of NANOS2 gene. In the female, one allele has 1nt

   WO 2016/011029                                                              PCT/US2015/040379
             By "amplified" is meant the construction of multiple copies of a nucleic acid
    sequence or multiple copies complementary to the nucleic acid sequence using at least one
    of the nucleic acid sequences as a template. Amplification systems include the polymerase
    chain reaction (PCR) system, ligase chain reaction (LCR) system, nucleic acid sequence
 5  based amplification (NASBA, Cangene, Mississauga, Ontario), Q-Beta Replicase systems,
    transcription-based amplification system (TAS), and strand displacement amplification
    (SDA). See, e. g., Diagnostic Molecular Microbiology: Principles and Applications, D. H.
    Persing et al., Ed., American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C. (1993). The
    product of amplification is termed an amplicon.
10           The term "conservatively modified variants" applies to both amino acid and nucleic
    acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, "conservatively modified
    variants" refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or conservatively modified
    variants of the amino acid sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a
    large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For
15  instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus,
    at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any
    of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such
    nucleic acid variations are "silent variations" and represent one species of conservatively
    modified variation. Every nucleic acid sequence herein that encodes a polypeptide also, by
20  reference to the genetic code, describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid.
             One of ordinary skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG,
    which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine; and UGG, which is ordinarily the only
    codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule.
    Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide of the
25  present invention is implicit in each described polypeptide sequence and is within the
    scope of the present invention.
            As to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual
    substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein
    sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino
30  acids in the encoded sequence is a "conservatively modified variant" where the alteration
    results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Thus,
                                                   10

   WO 2016/011029                                                                PCT/US2015/040379
    any number of amino acid residues selected from the group of integers consisting of from 1
    to 15 can be so altered. Thus, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 10 alterations can be made.
             Conservatively modified variants typically provide similar biological activity as the
    unmodified polypeptide sequence from which they are derived. For example, substrate
 5  specificity, enzyme activity, or ligand/receptor binding is generally at least 30%, 40%,
    50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the native protein for its native substrate. Conservative
    substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art.
             The following six groups each contain amino acids that are conservative
    substitutions for one another: [1] Alanine (A), Serine (S), Threonine (T); [2] Aspartic acid
10  (D), Glutamic acid (E); [3] Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); [4] Arginine (R), Lysine (K);
    [5] Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); and [6] Phenylalanine (F),
    Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W). See also, Creighton (1984) Proteins W. H. Freeman and
    Company.
             By "encoding" or "encoded", with respect to a specified nucleic acid, is meant
15  comprising the information for translation into the specified protein. A nucleic acid
    encoding a protein may comprise intervening sequences (e.g., introns) within translated
    regions of the nucleic acid, or may lack such intervening non-translated sequences (e.g., as
    in cDNA). The information by which a protein is encoded is specified by the use of
    codons. Typically, the amino acid sequence is encoded by the nucleic acid using the
20  "universal" genetic code. When the nucleic acid is prepared or altered synthetically,
    advantage can be taken of known codon preferences of the intended host where the nucleic
    acid is to be expressed.
             As used herein "full-length sequence" in reference to a specified polynucleotide or
    its encoded protein means having the entire amino acid sequence of a native
25  (nonsynthetic), endogenous, biologically active form of the specified protein. Methods to
    determine whether a sequence is full-length are well known in the art including such
    exemplary techniques as northern or western blots, primer extension, SI protection, and
    ribonuclease protection. Comparison to known full-length homologous (orthologous
    and/or paralogous) sequences can also be used to identify full-length sequences of the
30  present invention. Additionally, consensus sequences typically present at the 5' and 3'
    untranslated regions of mRNA aid in the identification of a polynucleotide as full-length.
    For example, the consensus sequence ANNNNAUGG, where the underlined codon
                                                  11

   WO 2016/011029                                                               PCT/US2015/040379
    represents the N-terminal methionine, aids in determining whether the polynucleotide has a
    complete 5' end. Consensus sequences at the 3' end, such as polyadenylation sequences,
    aid in determining whether the polynucleotide has a complete 3' end.
             As used herein, "heterologous" in reference to a nucleic acid is a nucleic acid that
 5  originates from a foreign species, or, if from the same species, is substantially modified
    from its native form in composition and/or genomic locus by deliberate human
    intervention. For example, a promoter operably linked to a heterologous structural gene is
    from a species different from that from which the structural gene was derived, or, if from
    the same species, one or both are substantially modified from their original form. A
10  heterologous protein may originate from a foreign species or, if from the same species, is
    substantially modified from its original form by deliberate human intervention.
             By "host cell" is meant a cell which contains a vector and supports the replication
    and/or expression of the vector. Host cells may be prokaryotic cells such as E. coli, or
    eukaryotic cells such as yeast, insect, amphibian, or mammalian cells.
15           The term "hybridization complex" includes reference to a duplex nucleic acid
    structure formed by two single-stranded nucleic acid sequences selectively hybridized with
    each other.
             The term "introduced" in the context of inserting a nucleic acid into a cell is
    equivalent to "transfection" or "transformation" or "transduction," and includes reference to
20  the incorporation of a nucleic acid into a eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell where the nucleic
    acid may be incorporated into the genome of the cell (e. g., chromosome, plasmid, plastid
    or mitochondrial DNA), converted into an autonomous replicon, or transiently expressed
    (e.g., transfected mRNA).
             The term "isolated" refers to material, such as a nucleic acid or a protein, which is:
25  (1) substantially or essentially free from components that normally accompany or interact
    with it as found in its naturally occurring environment-the isolated material optionally
    comprises material not found with the material in its natural environment; or (2) if the
    material is in its natural environment, the material has been synthetically altered by
    deliberate human intervention to a composition and/or placed at a location in the cell (e.g.,
30  genome or subcellular organelle) not native that material. The alteration to yield the
    synthetic material can be performed on the material within, or removed from its natural
    state. For example, a naturally occurring nucleic acid becomes an isolated nucleic acid if it
                                                    12

   WO 2016/011029                                                               PCT/US2015/040379
    is altered, or if it is transcribed from DNA which has been altered, by means of human
    intervention performed within the cell from which it originates. See, e.g., Compounds and
    Methods for Site Directed Mutagenesis in Eukaryotic Cells, Kmiec, U. S. Patent No.
    5,565,350; In Vivo Homologous Sequence Targeting in Eukaryotic Cells; Zarling et al.,
 5  PCT/US93/03868. Likewise, a naturally occurring nucleic acid (e.g., a promoter) becomes
    isolated if it is introduced by non-naturally occurring means to a locus of the genome not
    native to that nucleic acid. Nucleic acids which are "isolated" as defined herein, are also
    referred to as "heterologous" nucleic acids.
             As used herein, "localized within the chromosomal region defined by and
10  including" with respect to particular markers includes reference to a contiguous length of a
    chromosome delimited by and including the stated markers.
             As used herein, "marker" includes reference to a locus on a chromosome that serves
    to identify a unique position on the chromosome. A "polymorphic marker" includes
    reference to a marker which appears in multiple forms (alleles) such that different forms of
15  the marker, when they are present in a homologous pair, allow transmission of each of the
    chromosomes of that pair to be followed. A genotype may be defined by use of one or a
    plurality of markers.
             As used herein, "mutation" includes reference to alterations in the nucleotide
    sequence of a polynucleotide, such as for example a gene or coding DNA sequence (CDS),
20  compared to the wild-type sequence. The term includes, without limitation, substitutions,
    insertions, frameshifts, deletions, inversions, translocations, duplications, splice-donor site
    mutations, point-mutations or the like.
             As used herein, "nucleic acid" includes reference to a deoxyribonucleotide or
    ribonucleotide polymer in either single-or double-stranded form, and unless otherwise
25  limited, encompasses conservatively modified variants and known analogues having the
    essential nature of natural nucleotides in that they hybridize to single-stranded nucleic
    acids in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides (e. g., peptide nucleic acids).
             By "nucleic acid library" is meant a collection of isolated DNA or RNA molecules
    which comprise and substantially represent the entire transcribed fraction of a genome of a
30  specified organism. Construction of exemplary nucleic acid libraries, such as genomic and
    cDNA libraries, is taught in standard molecular biology references such as Berger and
    Kimmel, Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques, Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 152,

    Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1994).
 5           As used herein "operably linked" includes reference to a functional linkage between
    a promoter and a second sequence, wherein the promoter sequence initiates and mediates
    transcription of the DNA sequence corresponding to the second sequence. Generally,
    operably linked means that the nucleic acid sequences being linked are contiguous and,
    where necessary join two protein coding regions, contiguously and in the same reading
10  frame.
             As used herein, "polynucleotide" includes reference to a deoxyribopolynucleotide,
    ribopolynucleotide, or conservatively modified variants; the term may also refer to analogs
    thereof that have the essential nature of a natural ribonucleotide in that they hybridize,
    under stringent hybridization conditions, to substantially the same nucleotide sequence as
15  naturally occurring nucleotides and/or allow translation into the same amino acid(s) as the
    naturally occurring nucleotide(s). A polynucleotide can be full-length or a subsequence of
    a native or heterologous structural or regulatory gene. Unless otherwise indicated, the term
    includes reference to the specified sequence as well as the complementary sequence
    thereof. Thus, DNAs or RNAs with backbones modified for stability or for other reasons
20  are "polynucleotides" as that term is intended herein. Moreover, DNAs or RNAs
    comprising unusual bases, such as inosine, or modified bases, such as tritylated bases, to
    name just two examples, are polynucleotides as the term is used herein. It will be
    appreciated that a great variety of modifications have been made to DNA and RNA that
    serve many useful purposes known to those of skill in the art.
25           The term polynucleotide as it is employed herein embraces such chemically,
    enzymatically or metabolically modified forms of polynucleotides, as well as the chemical
    forms of DNA and RNA characteristic of viruses and cells, including among other things,
    simple and complex cells.
             The terms "polypeptide", "peptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably herein to
30  refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms also may apply to conservatively
    modified variants and to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is
    an artificial chemical analogue of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well
                                                   14

   WO 2016/011029                                                                PCT/US2015/040379
    as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers. The essential nature of such analogues of
    naturally occurring amino acids is that, when incorporated into a protein, the protein is
    specifically reactive to antibodies elicited to the same protein but consisting entirely of
    naturally occurring amino acids. The terms "polypeptide", "peptide" and "protein" are also
 5  inclusive of modifications including, but not limited to, glycosylation, lipid attachment,
    sulfation, gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, hydroxylation and ADP
    ribosylation. It will be appreciated, as is well known and as noted above, that polypeptides
    are not always entirely linear. For instance, polypeptides may be branched as a result of
    ubiquitization, and they may be circular, with or without branching, generally as a result of
10  posttranslation events, including natural processing event and events brought about by
    human manipulation which do not occur naturally. Circular, branched and branched
    circular polypeptides may be synthesized by non-translation natural process and by entirely
    synthetic methods, as well. Further, this invention contemplates the use of both the
    methionine-containing and the methionine-less amino terminal variants of the protein of
15  the invention.
             As used herein "promoter" includes reference to a region of DNA upstream from
    the start of transcription and involved in recognition and binding of RNA polymerase and
    other proteins to initiate transcription. Examples of promoters under developmental
    control include promoters that preferentially initiate transcription in certain tissues, such as
20  testes, ovaries, or placenta. Such promoters are referred to as "tissue preferred". Promoters
    which initiate transcription only in certain tissue are referred to as "tissue specific". A "cell
    type" specific promoter primarily drives expression in certain cell types in one or more
    organs, for example, germ cells in testes or ovaries. An "inducible" or "repressible"
    promoter is a promoter which is under environmental control. Examples of environmental
25  conditions that may affect transcription by inducible promoters include stress, and
    temperature. Tissue specific, tissue preferred, cell type specific and inducible promoters
    constitute the class of "non-constitutive" promoters. A "constitutive" promoter is a
    promoter which is active under most environmental conditions.
             As used herein "recombinant" includes reference to a cell or vector, that has been
30  modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or that the cell is derived from
    a cell so modified. Thus, for example, recombinant cells express genes that are not found
    in identical form within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or express native
                                                    15

   WO 2016/011029                                                              PCT/US2015/040379
    genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed, under-expressed or not expressed at all as a
    result of deliberate human intervention. The term "recombinant" as used herein does not
    encompass the alteration of the cell or vector by naturally occurring events (e.g.,
    spontaneous mutation, natural transformation/transduction/transposition) such as those
 5  occurring without deliberate human intervention.
            As used herein, a "recombinant expression cassette" is a nucleic acid construct,
    generated recombinantly or synthetically, with a series of specified nucleic acid elements
    which permit transcription of a particular nucleic acid in a host cell. The recombinant
    expression cassette can be incorporated into a plasmid, chromosome, mitochondrial DNA,
10  plastid DNA, virus, or nucleic acid fragment. Typically, the recombinant expression
    cassette portion of an expression vector includes, among other sequences, a nucleic acid to
    be transcribed, and a promoter.
            The terms "residue" or "amino acid residue" or "amino acid" are used
    interchangeably herein to refer to an amino acid that is incorporated into a protein,
15  polypeptide, or peptide (collectively "protein"). The amino acid may be a naturally
    occurring amino acid and, unless otherwise limited, may encompass non-natural analogs of
    natural amino acids that can function in a similar manner as naturally occurring amino
    acids.
            The term "selectively hybridizes" includes reference to hybridization, under
20  stringent hybridization conditions, of a nucleic acid sequence to another nucleic acid
    sequence or other biologics. When utilizing a hybridization-based detection system, a
    nucleic acid probe is chosen that is complementary to a reference nucleic acid sequence,
    and then by selection of appropriate conditions the probe and the reference sequence
    selectively hybridize, or bind, to each other to form a duplex molecule.
25          The term "stringent conditions" or "stringent hybridization conditions" includes
    reference to conditions under which a probe will hybridize to its target sequence to a
    detectably greater degree than to other sequences (e.g., at least 2-fold over background).
    Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different
    circumstances. By controlling the stringency of the hybridization and/or washing
30  conditions, target sequences can be identified which are 100% complementary to the probe
    (homologous probing).
                                                   16

   WO 2016/011029                                                              PCT/US2015/040379
            Alternatively, stringency conditions can be adjusted to allow some mismatching in
    sequences so that lower degrees of similarity are detected (heterologous probing).
    Generally, a probe is less than about 1000 nucleotides in length, optionally less than 500
    nucleotides in length.
 5          Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less
    than about 1.5 M Na ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M Na ion concentration (or other salts)
    at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 300 C for short probes (e. g., 10 to 50
    nucleotides) and at least about 60' C for long probes (e.g., greater than 50 nucleotides).
    Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as
10  formamide. Specificity is typically the function of post-hybridization washes, the critical
    factors being the ionic strength and temperature of the final wash solution. For DNA
    /DNA hybrids, the thermal melting point (Tm) can be approximated from the equation of
    Meinkoth and Wahl, Anal. Biochem., 138: 267-284 (1984): Tm [0C]          = 81.5 + 16.6 (log
    M) + 0.41(% GC)-0.61 (% form)-500/L; where M is the molarity of monovalent cations, %
15  GC is the percentage of guanosine and cytosine nucleotides in the DNA, % form is the
    percentage of formamide in the hybridization solution, and L is the length of the hybrid in
    base pairs. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50%
    of a complementary target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. Tm is
    reduced by about 10 C for each 1% of mismatching; thus, Tm, hybridization and/or wash
20  conditions can be adjusted to hybridize to sequences of the desired identity. For example,
    if sequences with > 90% identity are sought, the Tm can be decreased 100 C. Generally,
    stringent conditions are selected to be about 50 C lower than the Tm for the specific
    sequence and its complement at a defined ionic strength and pH. However, severely
    stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 1 to 40 C lower than the Tm;
25  moderately stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 6 to 100 C lower
    than the Tm; low stringency conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 11 to 200
    C lower than the Tm. Using the equation, hybridization and wash compositions, and
    desired Tm, those of ordinary skill will understand that variations in the stringency of
    hybridization and/or wash solutions are inherently described. An extensive guide to the
30  hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tij ssen, Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry
    and Molecular Biology--Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes, Part I, Chapter 2

             As used herein, "transgenic animal, cell or tissue" includes reference to an animal
    which includes within its genome a heterologous polynucleotide. Generally, the
 5  heterologous polynucleotide is stably integrated within the genome such that the
    polynucleotide is passed on to successive generations. The heterologous polynucleotide
    may be integrated into the genome alone or as part of a recombinant expression cassette.
    "Transgenic" is used herein to include any cell, cell line, tissue, or organ, the genotype of
    which has been altered by the presence of heterologous nucleic acid including those
10  transgenics initially so altered as well as those created by sexual crosses or asexual
    propagation from the initial transgenic. The term "transgenic" as used herein does not
    encompass the alteration of the genome (chromosomal or extra-chromosomal) by
    conventional breeding methods or by naturally occurring events such as random cross
    fertilization, non-recombinant viral infection, non-recombinant bacterial transformation,
15  non-recombinant transposition, or spontaneous mutation.
             As used herein, "vector" includes reference to a nucleic acid used in transfection of
    a host cell and into which can be inserted a polynucleotide. Vectors are often replicons.
    Expression vectors permit transcription of a nucleic acid inserted therein.
             The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between a
20  polynucleotide/polypeptide of the present invention with a reference
    polynucleotide/polypeptide: (a)"reference sequence", (b)"comparison window", (c)
    "sequence identity", and (d)"percentage of sequence identity".
             (a) As used herein, "reference sequence" is a defined sequence used as a basis for
    sequence comparison with a polynucleotide/polypeptide of the present invention. A
25  reference sequence may be a subset or the entirety of a specified sequence; for example, as
    a segment of a full-length cDNA or gene sequence, or the complete cDNA or gene
    sequence.
             (b) As used herein, "comparison window" includes reference to a contiguous and
    specified segment of a polynucleotide/polypeptide sequence, wherein the
30  polynucleotide/polypeptide sequence may be compared to a reference sequence and
    wherein the portion of the polynucleotide/polypeptide sequence in the comparison window
    may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) compared to the reference sequence (which
                                                    18

    does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences.
    Generally, the comparison window is at least 20 contiguous nucleotides/amino acids
    residues in length, and optionally can be 30, 40, 50, 100, or longer. Those of skill in the art
    understand that to avoid a high similarity to a reference sequence due to inclusion of gaps
 5  in the polynucleotide/polypeptide sequence, a gap penalty is typically introduced and is
    subtracted from the number of matches.
            Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well-known in the art.
    Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by the local homology
    algorithm of Smith and Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2: 482(1981); by the homology
10  alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443 (1970); by the
    search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85: 2444
    (1988); and by computerized implementations of these algorithms, including, but not
    limited to: CLUSTAL in the PC/Gene program by Intelligenetics, Mountain View,
    California; GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST, FASTA, and TFASTA, and related programs in the
15  GCG Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Version 10 (available from Accelrys Inc.,
    9685 Scranton Road, San Diego, California, USA). The CLUSTAL program is well
    described by Higgins and Sharp, Gene 73: 237-244 (1988); Higgins and Sharp, CABIOS 5:
    151-153 (1989); Corpet, et al., Nucleic Acids Research 16: 10881-90 (1988); Huang, et
    al., Computer Applications in the Biosciences 8 : 155-65 (1992), and Pearson, et al.,
20  Methods in Molecular Biology 24: 307-331 (1994).
            The BLAST family of programs that can be used for database similarity searches
    includes: BLASTN for nucleotide query sequences against nucleotide database sequences;
    BLASTX for nucleotide query sequences against protein database sequences; BLASTP for
    protein query sequences against protein database sequences; TBLASTN for protein query
25  sequences against nucleotide database sequences; and TBLASTX for nucleotide query
    sequences against nucleotide database sequences. See, Current Protocols in Molecular
    Biology, Chapter 19, Ausubel, et al., Eds., Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New
    York (1995); Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 215: 403-410 (1990); and, Altschul et al.,
    Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402 (1997). Software for performing BLAST analyses is
30  publicly available, for example through the National Center for Biotechnology Information
    (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This algorithm has been thoroughly described in a number of
    publications. See, e.g., Altschul SF et al., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new

    available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21097/pdf/chl6.pdf. The BLASTP
 5  program for amino acid sequences has also been thoroughly described (see Henikoff &
    Henikoff (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915).
             In addition to calculating percent sequence identity, the BLAST algorithm also
    performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin &
    Altschul, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 5873-5877 (1993)).      A number of low
10  complexity filter programs can be employed to reduce such low-complexity alignments.
    For example, the SEG (Wooten and Federhen, Comput. Chem., 17: 149-163 (1993)) and
    XNU (Claverie and States, Comput. Chem., 17: 191-201 (1993)) low-complexity filters
    can be employed alone or in combination.
             Unless otherwise stated, nucleotide and protein identity/similarity values provided
15  herein are calculated using GAP (GCG Version 10) under default values. GAP (Global
    Alignment Program) can also be used to compare a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the
    present invention with a reference sequence. GAP uses the algorithm of Needleman and
    Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453,1970) to find the alignment of two complete sequences
    that maximizes the number of matches and minimizes the number of gaps. GAP represents
20  one member of the family of best alignments. There may be many members of this family,
    but no other member has a better quality. GAP displays four figures of merit for
    alignments: Quality, Ratio, Identity, and Similarity. The Quality is the metric maximized in
    order to align the sequences. Ratio is the quality divided by the number of bases in the
    shorter segment. Percent Identity is the percent of the symbols that actually match. Percent
25  Similarity is the percent of the symbols that are similar. Symbols that are across from gaps
    are ignored. A similarity is scored when the scoring matrix value for a pair of symbols is
    greater than or equal to 0.50, the similarity threshold. The scoring matrix used in Version
     10 of the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package is BLOSUM62 (see Henikoff & Henikoff
    (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 10915).
30           Multiple alignment of the sequences can be performed using the CLUSTAL method
    of alignment (Higgins and Sharp (1989) CABIOS. 5: 151-153) with the default parameters
    (GAPPENALTY=10, GAP LENGTH PENALTY=10). Default parameters for pairwise
                                                    20

    alignments using the CLUSTAL method include KTUPLE 1, GAP PENALTY=3,
    WINDOW=5 and DIAGONALS SAVED=5.
             (c) As used herein, "sequence identity" or "identity" in the context of two nucleic
    acid or polypeptide sequences includes reference to the residues in the two sequences
 5  which are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified
    comparison window. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins
    it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative
    amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid
    residues with similar chemical properties (e.g. charge or hydrophobicity) and therefore do
10  not change the functional properties of the molecule. Where sequences differ in
    conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to
    correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences which differ by such
    conservative substitutions are said to have "sequence similarity" or "similarity". Means
    for making this adjustment are well-known to those of skill in the art. Typically this
15  involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby
    increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino
    acid is given a score of l and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a
    conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative
    substitutions may be calculated according to the algorithm of Meyers and Miller, Computer
20  Applic. Biol. Sci., 4: 11-17 (1988), for example as implemented in the program PC/GENE
    (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, California, USA).
             (d) As used herein, "percentage of sequence identity" means the value determined
    by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the
    portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions
25  or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise
    additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is
    calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base
    or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions,
    dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window
30  of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence
    identity.

            As used herein, "gene editing," "gene edited" "genetically edited" and "gene editing
    effectors" refer to the use of naturally occurring or artificially engineered nucleases, also
    referred to as "molecular scissors." The nucleases create specific double-stranded break
    (DSBs) at desired locations in the genome, which in some cases harnesses the cell's
 5  endogenous mechanisms to repair the induced break by natural processes of homologous
    recombination (HR) and/or nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). Gene editing effectors
    include Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases
    (TALENs), the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CAS9
    (CRISPR/Cas9) system, and meganuclease re-engineered as homing endonucleases. The

    The terms "genetic manipulation" and "genetically manipulated" include gene editing
    techniques, as well as and/or in addition to other techniques and processes that alter or
    modify the nucleotide sequence of a gene or gene, or modify or alter the expression of a
15  gene or genes.

    antibiotics, and certain temperature or salt levels.
             The term "Early stage embryo" means any embryo at embryonic stages between
    fertilized ovum and blastocyst. Typically, eight cell stage and morula stage embryos are
 5  referred to as early stage embryos.
             "Embryonic germ cells" or "EG cells"means primordial germ cell derived cells
    which have the potential to differentiate into all the cell types of body and are as amenable
    to genetic modification as Embryonic stem cells, to the extent that sometimes the
    distinction between EG cells and ES cells is ignored. "Developmental Biology", sixth

              "Embryonic stem cells" or "ES cells" means cultured cells derived from inner cell
    mass of early stage embryo, which are amenable to genetic modification and which retain

    and embryonic germ (EG) cells.
             The phrase "Genetically edited" means those animals or embryos or cells which
25  have a desired genetic modification such as a knock-out, knock-in, conditional, inducible,

             "Germ line cell" means any cell, at any stage of differentiation towards mature
10  gametes, including mature gametes.
             As used herein, the term "Knock-in" means replacement of an endogenous gene
    with a transgene or with same endogenous gene with some structural modifications, but
    retaining the transcriptional control of the endogenous gene.
             "Knock-out" means disruption of the structure or regulatory mechanism of a gene.
15  Knock-outs may be generated through homologous recombination of targeting vectors,
    replacement vectors or hit-and-run vectors or random insertion of a gene trap vector
    resulting into complete, partial or conditional loss of gene function. "Oogenesis" means the
    process of generation of mature eggs from the primordial germ cells in females.
             "Primordial germ cells" means those cells arising early in the embryonic

    that is able to bind to another molecule. A binding protein can bind to, for example, a DNA
    molecule (a DNA-binding protein), an RNA molecule (an RNA-binding protein) and/or a
    protein molecule (a protein-binding protein). In the case of a protein-binding protein, it can
30  bind to itself (to form homodimers, homotrimers, etc.) and/or it can bind to one or more
    molecules of a different protein or proteins. A binding protein can have more than one type
                                                   24

   WO 2016/011029                                                              PCT/US2015/040379
    of binding activity. For example, zinc finger proteins have DNA-binding, RNA-binding
    and protein-binding activity.
            A "zinc finger DNA binding protein" (or binding domain) is a protein, or a domain
    within a larger protein, that binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner through one or more
 5  zinc fingers, which are regions of amino acid sequence within the binding domain whose
    structure is stabilized through coordination of a zinc ion. The term zinc finger DNA
    binding protein is often abbreviated as zinc finger protein or ZFP.
            A "TALE DNA binding domain" or "TALE" is a polypeptide comprising one or
    more TALE repeat domains/units. The repeat domains are involved in binding of the
10  TALE to its cognate target DNA sequence. A single "repeat unit" (also referred to as a
    "repeat") is typically 33-35 amino acids in length and exhibits at least some sequence
    homology with other TALE repeat sequences within a naturally occurring TALE protein.
            Zinc finger and TALE binding domains can be "engineered" to bind to a
    predetermined nucleotide sequence, for example via engineering (altering one or more
15  amino acids) of the recognition helix region of naturally occurring zinc finger or TALE
    proteins. Therefore, engineered DNA binding proteins (zinc fingers or TALEs) are proteins
    that are non-naturally occurring. Non-limiting examples of methods for engineering DNA
    binding proteins are design and selection. A designed DNA binding protein is a protein not
    occurring in nature whose design/composition results principally from rational criteria.
20  Rational criteria for design include application of substitution rules and computerized
    algorithms for processing information in a database storing information of existing ZFP
    and/or TALE designs and binding data. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,140,081;
    6,453,242; and 6,534,261; see also WO 98/53058; WO 98/53059; WO 98/53060; WO
    02/016536 and WO 03/016496 and U.S. Publication No. 20110301073.
25          A "selected" zinc finger protein or TALE is a protein not found in nature whose
    production results primarily from an empirical process such as phage display, interaction
    trap or hybrid selection. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,538; U.S. Pat. No. 5,925,523; U.S.

            "Cleavage" refers to the breakage of the covalent backbone of a DNA molecule.
    Cleavage can be initiated by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, enzymatic

    or chemical hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond. Both single-stranded cleavage and
    double-stranded cleavage are possible, and double-stranded cleavage can occur as a result
    of two distinct single-stranded cleavage events. DNA cleavage can result in the production
    of either blunt ends or staggered ends. In certain embodiments, fusion polypeptides are
 5  used for targeted double-stranded DNA cleavage.
            A "cleavage half-domain" is a polypeptide sequence which, in conjunction with a
    second polypeptide (either identical or different) forms a complex having cleavage activity
    (preferably double-strand cleavage activity). The terms "first and second cleavage half
    domains;" "+ and - cleavage half-domains" and "right and left cleavage half-domains" are
10  used interchangeably to refer to pairs of cleavage half-domains that dimerize.
            An "engineered cleavage half-domain" is a cleavage half-domain that has been
    modified so as to form obligate heterodimers with another cleavage half-domain (e.g.,

            Means for repairing a double strand DNA break: As used herein, the term "means
    for repairing a double strand DNA break" is also intended to invoke the special claiming
 5  provisions authorized by Congress in 35 U.S.C. sctn. 112, sixth paragraph. Specifically, a
    "means for repairing a double strand DNA break" refers to a molecular structure that is
    capable of facilitating/catalyzing the joining of the ends of double-stranded DNA
    molecules, for example, by joining ends generated by cleaving a single double-stranded
    DNA molecule, or by joining one end generated by cleaving a single double-stranded DNA
10  molecule with the end of an exogenous double-stranded DNA molecule. Such structures
    include polypeptide domains comprised within many known ligase proteins, for example,
    Cre recombinase. In some examples, the same molecular structure may serve as both a
    means for generating a double strand DNA break and a means for repairing a double strand
    DNA break, where the same structure facilitates both the cleavage and repair of double
15  stranded DNA molecules (e.g., Hin recombinase).
            The induction of the site specific double stranded breaks in the genome induces the
    host cell DNA repair pathway which resolves the double stranded break through
    homology-directed repair (HDR) or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair. It is
    possible to have one or more ZFN cuts sites on the donor molecule (a single ZFN cut site
20  to linearize the entire donor molecule, 2 of the same ZFN sites to release a smaller donor
    DNA fragment or 2 different ZFN sites to release a fragment from the donor and a
    corresponding fragment from the host genomic DNA (DNA replacement).
            Thus, the donor polynucleotide can be DNA or RNA, single-stranded and/or
    double-stranded and can be introduced into a cell in linear or circular form. See, e.g., U.S.
25  Patent Publication Nos. 20100047805 and 20110207221. In certain, embodiments of the
    present invention may also include linear exogenous (donor) nucleic acid(s), compositions
    comprising these nucleic acids and methods of making and using these linear donor
    molecules. In certain embodiments, the linear donor molecule stably persists in the cell into
    which it is introduced. In other embodiments, the linear donor molecule is modified to
30  resist exonucleolytic cleavage, for example by placing one or more phosphorothioate
    phosphodiester bonds between one or more base pairs on the ends of the donor molecule.
    The linear exogenous nucleic acid may also include single stranded specific DNA.

             NANOS Gene Editing
             NANOS is an evolutionarily conserved family of RNA-binding proteins that are
    expressed specifically within the germ cells of both invertebrate and vertebrate animals.
 5  Ablation of NANOS and its orthologs results in the loss of germ cells in Drosophila,
    C.elegans, Zebra fish, Xenopus, and mouse. In humans, germ cell loss and infertility are
    associated with mutations in NANOS genes.
             In vertebrates, three NANOS genes have been identified, amongst which NANOS2
    and NANOS3 are expressed in PGCs. In mice, Nanos3 protein is first detectable in early
10  PGCs, persists throughout their migration to the genital ridge, and then ceases by
    embryonic day 15.5 in males or prior to E13.5 in female embryos. In contrast, expression
    of Nanos2 is restricted to the male gonad. Nanos2 mRNA is first detectable in germ cells
    that have colonized the male embryonic gonad at around E13.0 after the germ cells begin
    to interact with gonadal somatic cells. Although the expression transiently decreases at
15  later stages of embryogenesis, Nanos2 mRNA is detectable again in gonocytes during
    neonatal development.
             Ablation of Nanos3 in mice results in the complete loss of germ cells for both sexes
    due to apoptotic cell death around E8.0. Importantly, inactivation of Nanos2 in mice
    results in loss of germ cells in male embryos only around E15.5. Thus, the germline is
20  completely lacking at birth in male mice but testicular somatic support cell populations are
    functionally intact. Also, Nanos2 null males and females are viable and grow to normal
    maturity. Moreover, Nanos2 null females are of normal fertility. Applicants have
    demonstrated that NANOS2 is expressed specifically by PGCs in pig embryos.
             The NANOS family of genes is known and sequences encoding the same are
25  available through Genbank or other such sources. Sus Scrofa NANOSI nucleic acid and
    protein sequences are disclosed at XM_001928298 and herein as SEQ ID NOS: 5 and 6.
    NANOS2 is at XM_003127232.1 or as herein as SEQ ID NO: 1 and 2 and NANOS3 at
    XM_005661246 or SEQ ID NO:3 and 4 bovine NANOS genes are available at
    NM_001291904 and SEQ ID NO:9 and 10 (NANOS2); XM_005225796 SEQ ID NO: 11

             The present disclosure provides a genetically edited animal or animal cell
    comprising at least one edited chromosomal sequence encoding a NANOS protein or other

   WO 2016/011029                                                              PCT/US2015/040379
    protein associated with germ cell function or development. The edited chromosomal
    sequence may be (1) inactivated, (2) modified, or (3) comprise an integrated sequence. An
    inactivated chromosomal sequence is altered such that a NANOS protein function as it
    related to spermatogonial cell development is impaired, reduced or eliminated. Thus, a
 5  genetically edited animal comprising an inactivated chromosomal sequence may be termed
    a "knock out" or a "conditional knock out." Similarly, a genetically edited animal
    comprising an integrated sequence may be termed a "knock in" or a "conditional knock in."
    Furthermore, a genetically edited animal comprising a modified chromosomal sequence
    may comprise a targeted point mutation(s) or other modification such that an altered
10  protein product is produced. Briefly, the process comprises introducing into an embryo or
    cell at least one RNA molecule encoding a targeted zinc finger nuclease and, optionally, at
    least one accessory polynucleotide. The method further comprises incubating the embryo
    or cell to allow expression of the zinc finger nuclease, wherein a double-stranded break
    introduced into the targeted chromosomal sequence by the zinc finger nuclease is repaired
15  by an error-prone non-homologous end-joining DNA repair process or a homology
    directed DNA repair process. The method of editing chromosomal sequences encoding a
    protein associated with germline development using targeted zinc finger nuclease
    technology is rapid, precise, and highly efficient.
             In some embodiments of the present invention, at least one NANOS locus (e.g., a
20  NANOS2 locus) is used as a target site for the site-specific editing. This can include
    insertion of an exogenous nucleic acid (e.g., a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide
    sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest) or deletions of nucleic acids from the locus.
    In particular embodiments, insertions and/or deletions modified locus. For example,
    integration of the exogenous nucleic acid and/or deletion of part of the genomic nucleic
25  acid may modify the locus so as to produce a disrupted (i.e., inactivated) NANOS gene.
             In some embodiments the edited NANOS locus can comprise a nucleotide sequence

             Targeted Integration of a Nucleic Acid at a NANOS Locus
30           Site-specific integration of an exogenous nucleic acid at a NANOS locus may be
    accomplished by any technique known to those of skill in the art. In some embodiments,
    integration of an exogenous nucleic acid at a NANOS locus comprises contacting a cell

    WO 2016/011029                                                                PCT/US2015/040379
     (e.g., an isolated cell or a cell in a tissue or organism) with a nucleic acid molecule
     comprising the exogenous nucleic acid. In examples, such a nucleic acid molecule may
     comprise nucleotide sequences flanking the exogenous nucleic acid that facilitate
     homologous recombination between the nucleic acid molecule and at least one NANOS
  5  locus. In particular examples, the nucleotide sequences flanking the exogenous nucleic acid
     that facilitate homologous recombination may be complementary to endogenous
     nucleotides of the NANOS locus. In particular examples, the nucleotide sequences flanking
     the exogenous nucleic acid that facilitate homologous recombination may be
     complementary to previously integrated exogenous nucleotides. In some embodiments, a
10   plurality of exogenous nucleic acids may be integrated at one NANOS locus, such as in
     gene stacking.
              Integration of a nucleic acid at a NANOS locus may be facilitated (e.g., catalyzed)
     in some embodiments by endogenous cellular machinery of a host cell, such as, for
     example and without limitation, endogenous DNA and endogenous recombinase enzymes.
15   In some embodiments, integration of a nucleic acid at a NANOS locus may be facilitated
     by one or more factors (e.g., polypeptides) that are provided to a host cell. For example,
     nuclease(s), recombinase(s), and/or ligase polypeptides may be provided (either
     independently or as part of a chimeric polypeptide) by contacting the polypeptides with the
     host cell, or by expressing the polypeptides within the host cell. Accordingly, in some
20   examples, a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding at least one nuclease,
     recombinase, and/or ligase polypeptide may be introduced into the host cell, either
     concurrently or sequentially with a nucleic acid to be integrated site-specifically at a
     NANOS locus, wherein the at least one nuclease, recombinase, and/or ligase polypeptide is
     expressed from the nucleotide sequence in the host cell.
25
              DNA-Binding Polypeptides
              In some embodiments, site-specific integration may be accomplished by utilizing
     factors that are capable of recognizing and binding to particular nucleotide sequences, for
     example, in the genome of a host organism. For instance, many proteins comprise
30   polypeptide domains that are capable of recognizing and binding to DNA in a site-specific
     manner. A DNA sequence that is recognized by a DNA-binding polypeptide may be
     referred to as a "target" sequence. Polypeptide domains that are capable of recognizing and
                                                       31

   WO 2016/011029                                                               PCT/US2015/040379
    binding to DNA in a site-specific manner generally fold correctly and function
    independently to bind DNA in a site-specific manner, even when expressed in a
    polypeptide other than the protein from which the domain was originally isolated.
    Similarly, target sequences for recognition and binding by DNA-binding polypeptides are
 5  generally able to be recognized and bound by such polypeptides, even when present in
    large DNA structures (e.g., a chromosome), particularly when the site where the target
    sequence is located is one known to be accessible to soluble cellular proteins (e.g., a gene).
             While DNA-binding polypeptides identified from proteins that exist in nature
    typically bind to a discrete nucleotide sequence or motif (e.g., a consensus recognition
10  sequence), methods exist and are known in the art for modifying many such DNA-binding
    polypeptides to recognize a different nucleotide sequence or motif. DNA-binding
    polypeptides include, for example and without limitation: zinc finger DNA-binding
    domains; leucine zippers; UPA DNA-binding domains; GAL4; TAL; LexA; a Tet
    repressor; LacR; and a steroid hormone receptor.
15           In some examples, a DNA-binding polypeptide is a zinc finger. Individual zinc
    finger motifs can be designed to target and bind specifically to any of a large range of
    DNA sites. Canonical Cys2His2 (as well as non-canonical Cys3His) zinc finger
    polypeptides bind DNA by inserting an .alpha.-helix into the major groove of the target
    DNA double helix. Recognition of DNA by a zinc finger is modular; each finger contacts
20  primarily three consecutive base pairs in the target, and a few key residues in the
    polypeptide mediate recognition. By including multiple zinc finger DNA-binding domains
    in a targeting endonuclease, the DNA-binding specificity of the targeting endonuclease
    may be further increased (and hence the specificity of any gene regulatory effects
    conferred thereby may also be increased). See, e.g., Umov et al. (2005) Nature 435:646-51.
25  Thus, one or more zinc finger DNA-binding polypeptides may be engineered and utilized
    such that a targeting endonuclease introduced into a host cell interacts with a DNA
    sequence that is unique within the genome of the host cell.
             Preferably, the zinc finger protein is non-naturally occurring in that it is engineered
    to bind to a target site of choice. See, for example, See, for example, Beerli et al. (2002)

    are not limited to, rational design and various types of selection. Rational design includes,
    for example, using databases comprising triplet (or quadruplet) nucleotide sequences and
    individual zinc finger amino acid sequences, in which each triplet or quadruplet nucleotide
10  sequence is associated with one or more amino acid sequences of zinc fingers which bind
    the particular triplet or quadruplet sequence. See, for example, co-owned U.S. Pat. Nos.
    6,453,242 and 6,534,261, incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.
             Exemplary selection methods, including phage display and two-hybrid systems, are
    disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,789,538; 5,925,523; 6,007,988; 6,013,453; 6,410,248;

 5           In some examples, a DNA-binding polypeptide is a DNA-binding domain from
    GAL4. GAL4 is a modular transactivator in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but it also operates
    as a transactivator in many other organisms. See, e.g., Sadowski et al. (1988) Nature
    335:563-4. In this regulatory system, the expression of genes encoding enzymes of the
    galactose metabolic pathway in S. cerevisiae is stringently regulated by the available
10  carbon source. Johnston (1987) Microbiol. Rev. 51:458-76. Transcriptional control of these
    metabolic enzymes is mediated by the interaction between the positive regulatory protein,
    GAL4, and a 17 bp symmetrical DNA sequence to which GAL4 specifically binds (the
    UAS).
            Native GAL4 consists of 881 amino acid residues, with a molecular weight of 99
15  kDa. GAL4 comprises functionally autonomous domains, the combined activities of which
    account for activity of GAL4 in vivo. Ma and Ptashne (1987) Cell 48:847-53); Brent and
    Ptashne (1985) Cell 43(3 Pt 2):729-36. The N-terminal 65 amino acids of GAL4 comprise
    the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Keegan et al. (1986) Science 231:699-704; Johnston
    (1987) Nature 328:353-5. Sequence-specific binding requires the presence of a divalent
20  cation coordinated by 6 Cys residues present in the DNA binding domain. The coordinated
    cation-containing domain interacts with and recognizes a conserved CCG triplet at each
    end of the 17 bp UAS via direct contacts with the major groove of the DNA helix.
    Marmorstein et al. (1992) Nature 356:408-14. The DNA-binding function of the protein
    positions C-terminal transcriptional activating domains in the vicinity of the promoter,
25  such that the activating domains can direct transcription.
            Additional DNA-binding polypeptides that may be utilized in certain embodiments
    include, for example and without limitation, a binding sequence from a AVRBS3-inducible
    gene; a consensus binding sequence from a AVRBS3-inducible gene or synthetic binding
    sequence engineered therefrom (e.g., UPA DNA-binding domain); TAL; LexA (see, e.g.,
30  Brent & Ptashne (1985), supra); LacR (see, e.g., Labow et al. (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol.
     10:3343-56; Baim et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88(12):5072-6); a steroid
    hormone receptor (Ellliston et al. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265:11517-121); the Tet repressor

   WO 2016/011029                                                               PCT/US2015/040379
    (U.S. Pat. No. 6,271,341) and a mutated Tet repressor that binds to a tet operator sequence
    in the presence, but not the absence, of tetracycline (Tc); the DNA-binding domain of NF
    .kappa.B; and components of the regulatory system described in Wang et al. (1994) Proc.
    Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91(17):8180-4, which utilizes a fusion of GAL4, a hormone receptor,
 5  and VP16.
            In certain embodiments, the DNA-binding domain of one or more of the nucleases
    used in the methods and compositions described herein comprises a naturally occurring or
    engineered (non-naturally occurring) TAL effector DNA binding domain. See, e.g., U.S.
    Patent Publication No. 20110301073, incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.
10          In other embodiments, the nuclease comprises a CRISPR/Cas system. The CRISPR
    (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) locus, which encodes RNA
    components of the system, and the Cas (CRISPR-associated) locus, which encodes proteins
    (Jansen et al., 2002. Mol. Microbiol. 43: 1565-1575; Makarova et al., 2002. Nucleic Acids
    Res. 30: 482-496; Makarova et al., 2006. Biol. Direct 1: 7; Haft et al., 2005. PLoS Comput.
15  Biol. 1: e60) make up the gene sequences of the CRISPR/Cas nuclease system. CRISPR
    loci in microbial hosts contain a combination of Cas genes as well as non-coding RNA
    elements capable of programming the specificity of the CRISPR-mediated nucleic acid
    cleavage.
             The Type II CRISPR is one of the most well characterized systems and carries out
20  targeted DNA double-strand break in four sequential steps. First, two non-coding RNA, the
    pre-crRNA array and tracrRNA, are transcribed from the CRISPR locus. Second,
    tracrRNA hybridizes to the repeat regions of the pre-crRNA and mediates the processing of
    pre-crRNA into mature crRNAs containing individual spacer sequences. Third, the mature
    crRNA:tracrRNA complex directs Cas9 to the target DNA via Wastson-Crick base-pairing
25  between the spacer on the crRNA and the protospacer on the target DNA next to the
    protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), an additional requirement for target recognition.
    Finally, Cas9 mediates cleavage of target DNA to create a double-stranded break within
    the protospacer. Activity of the CRISPR/Cas system comprises of three steps: (i) insertion
    of alien DNA sequences into the CRISPR array to prevent future attacks, in a process
30  called 'adaptation', (ii) expression of the relevant proteins, as well as expression and
    processing of the array, followed by (iii) RNA-mediated interference with the foreign
    nucleic acid. Thus, in the bacterial cell, several Cas proteins are involved with the natural
                                                    35

   WO 2016/011029                                                              PCT/US2015/040379
    function of the CRISPR/Cas system and serve roles in functions such as insertion of the
    foreign DNA etc.
             In certain embodiments, Cas protein may be a "functional derivative" of a naturally
    occurring Cas protein. A "functional derivative" of a native sequence polypeptide is a
 5  compound having a qualitative biological property in common with a native sequence
    polypeptide. "Functional derivatives" include, but are not limited to, fragments of a native
    sequence and derivatives of a native sequence polypeptide and its fragments, provided that
    they have a biological activity in common with a corresponding native sequence
    polypeptide. A biological activity contemplated herein is the ability of the functional
10  derivative to hydrolyze a DNA substrate into fragments. The term "derivative"
    encompasses both amino acid sequence variants of polypeptide, covalent modifications,
    and fusions thereof. Suitable derivatives of a Cas polypeptide or a fragment thereof include
    but are not limited to mutants, fusions, covalent modifications of Cas protein or a fragment
    thereof. Cas protein, which includes Cas protein or a fragment thereof, as well as
15  derivatives of Cas protein or a fragment thereof, may be obtainable from a cell or
    synthesized chemically or by a combination of these two procedures. The cell may be a
    cell that naturally produces Cas protein, or a cell that naturally produces Cas protein and is
    genetically engineered to produce the endogenous Cas protein at a higher expression level
    or to produce a Cas protein from an exogenously introduced nucleic acid, which nucleic
20  acid encodes a Cas that is same or different from the endogenous Cas. In some case, the
    cell does not naturally produce Cas protein and is genetically engineered to produce a Cas
    protein.
             In particular embodiments, a DNA-binding polypeptide specifically recognizes and
    binds to a target nucleotide sequence comprised within a genomic nucleic acid of a host
25  organism. Any number of discrete instances of the target nucleotide sequence may be
    found in the host genome in some examples. The target nucleotide sequence may be rare
    within the genome of the organism (e.g., fewer than about 10, about 9, about 8, about 7,
    about 6, about 5, about 4, about 3, about 2, or about 1 copy(ies) of the target sequence may
    exist in the genome). For example, the target nucleotide sequence may be located at a
30  unique site within the genome of the organism. Target nucleotide sequences may be, for
    example and without limitation, randomly dispersed throughout the genome with respect to
    one another; located in different linkage groups in the genome; located in the same linkage
                                                   36

   WO 2016/011029                                                               PCT/US2015/040379
    group; located on different chromosomes; located on the same chromosome; located in the
    genome at sites that are expressed under similar conditions in the organism (e.g., under the
    control of the same, or substantially functionally identical, regulatory factors); and located
    closely to one another in the genome (e.g., target sequences may be comprised within
 5  nucleic acids integrated as concatemers at genomic loci).
             Targeting Endonucleases
             In particular embodiments, a DNA-binding polypeptide that specifically recognizes
    and binds to a target nucleotide sequence may be comprised within a chimeric polypeptide,
10  so as to confer specific binding to the target sequence upon the chimeric polypeptide. In
    examples, such a chimeric polypeptide may comprise, for example and without limitation,
    nuclease, recombinase, and/or ligase polypeptides, as these polypeptides are described
    above. Chimeric polypeptides comprising a DNA-binding polypeptide and a nuclease,
    recombinase, and/or ligase polypeptide may also comprise other functional polypeptide
15  motifs and/or domains, such as for example and without limitation: a spacer sequence
    positioned between the functional polypeptides in the chimeric protein; a leader peptide; a
    peptide that targets the fusion protein to an organelle (e.g., the nucleus); polypeptides that
    are cleaved by a cellular enzyme; peptide tags (e.g., Myc, His, etc.); and other amino acid
    sequences that do not interfere with the function of the chimeric polypeptide.
20           Functional polypeptides (e.g., DNA-binding polypeptides and nuclease
    polypeptides) in a chimeric polypeptide may be operatively linked. In some embodiments,
    functional polypeptides of a chimeric polypeptide may be operatively linked by their
    expression from a single polynucleotide encoding at least the functional polypeptides
    ligated to each other in-frame, so as to create a chimeric gene encoding a chimeric protein.
25  In alternative embodiments, the functional polypeptides of a chimeric polypeptide may be
    operatively linked by other means, such as by cross-linkage of independently expressed
    polypeptides.
             In some embodiments, a DNA-binding polypeptide, or guide RNA that specifically
    recognizes and binds to a target nucleotide sequence may be comprised within a natural
30  isolated protein (or mutant thereof), wherein the natural isolated protein or mutant thereof
    also comprises a nuclease polypeptide (and may also comprise a recombinase and/or ligase
                                                   37

   WO 2016/011029                                                             PCT/US2015/040379
    polypeptide). Examples of such isolated proteins include TALENs, recombinases (e.g.,
    Cre, Hin, Tre, and FLP recombinase), RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9, and meganucleases.
            As used herein, the term "targeting endonuclease" refers to natural or engineered
    isolated proteins and mutants thereof that comprise a DNA-binding polypeptide or guide
 5  RNA and a nuclease polypeptide, as well as to chimeric polypeptides comprising a DNA
    binding polypeptide or guide RNA and a nuclease. Any targeting endonuclease comprising
    a DNA-binding polypeptide or guide RNA that specifically recognizes and binds to a target
    nucleotide sequence comprised within a NANOS locus (e.g., either because the target
    sequence is comprised within the native sequence at the locus, or because the target
10  sequence has been introduced into the locus, for example, by recombination) may be
    utilized in certain embodiments.
            Some examples of chimeric polypeptides that may be useful in particular
    embodiments of the invention include, without limitation, combinations of the following
    polypeptides: zinc finger DNA-binding polypeptides; a FokI nuclease polypeptide; TALE
15  domains; leucine zippers; transcription factor DNA-binding motifs; and DNA recognition
    and/or cleavage domains isolated from, for example and without limitation, a TALEN, a
    recombinase (e.g., Cre, Hin, RecA, Tre, and FLP recombinases), RNA-guided
    CRISPR/Cas9, a meganuclease; and others known to those in the art. Particular examples
    include a chimeric protein comprising a site-specific DNA binding polypeptide and a
20  nuclease polypeptide. Chimeric polypeptides may be engineered by methods known to
    those of skill in the art to alter the recognition sequence of a DNA-binding polypeptide
    comprised within the chimeric polypeptide, so as to target the chimeric polypeptide to a
    particular nucleotide sequence of interest.
            In certain embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide comprises a DNA-binding
25  domain (e.g., zinc finger, TAL-effector domain, etc.) and a nuclease (cleavage) domain.
    The cleavage domain may be heterologous to the DNA-binding domain, for example a zinc
    finger DNA-binding domain and a cleavage domain from a nuclease or a TALEN DNA
    binding domain and a cleavage domain, or meganuclease DNA-binding domain and
    cleavage domain from a different nuclease. Heterologous cleavage domains can be
30  obtained from any endonuclease or exonuclease. Exemplary endonucleases from which a
    cleavage domain can be derived include, but are not limited to, restriction endonucleases
    and homing endonucleases. See, for example, 2002-2003 Catalogue, New England
                                                     38

   WO 2016/011029                                                              PCT/US2015/040379
    Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.; and Belfort et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3379-3388.
    Additional enzymes which cleave DNA are known (e.g., 51 Nuclease; mung bean
    nuclease; pancreatic DNase I; micrococcal nuclease; yeast HO endonuclease; see also Linn
    et al. (eds.) Nucleases, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1993). One or more of these
 5  enzymes (or functional fragments thereof) can be used as a source of cleavage domains and
    cleavage half-domains.
             Similarly, a cleavage half-domain can be derived from any nuclease or portion
    thereof, as set forth above, that requires dimerization for cleavage activity. In general, two
    fusion proteins are required for cleavage if the fusion proteins comprise cleavage half
10  domains. Alternatively, a single protein comprising two cleavage half-domains can be
    used. The two cleavage half-domains can be derived from the same endonuclease (or
    functional fragments thereof), or each cleavage half-domain can be derived from a
    different endonuclease (or functional fragments thereof). In addition, the target sites for the
    two fusion proteins are preferably disposed, with respect to each other, such that binding of
15  the two fusion proteins to their respective target sites places the cleavage half-domains in a
    spatial orientation to each other that allows the cleavage half-domains to form a functional
    cleavage domain, e.g., by dimerizing. Thus, in certain embodiments, the near edges of the
    target sites are separated by 5-8 nucleotides or by 15-18 nucleotides. However any integral
    number of nucleotides, or nucleotide pairs, can intervene between two target sites (e.g.,
20  from 2 to 50 nucleotide pairs or more). In general, the site of cleavage lies between the
    target sites.
             Restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes) are present in many species and are
    capable of sequence-specific binding to DNA (at a recognition site), and cleaving DNA at
    or near the site of binding, for example, such that one or more exogenous sequences
25  (donors/trangsenes) are integrated at or near the binding (target) sites. Certain restriction
    enzymes (e.g., Type IIS) cleave DNA at sites removed from the recognition site and have
    separable binding and cleavage domains. For example, the Type IIS enzyme Fok I
    catalyzes double-stranded cleavage of DNA, at 9 nucleotides from its recognition site on
    one strand and 13 nucleotides from its recognition site on the other. See, for example, U.S.
30  Pat. Nos. 5,356,802; 5,436,150 and 5,487,994; as well as Li et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad.
    Sci. USA 89:4275-4279; Li et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:2764-2768; Kim et
    al. (1994a) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:883-887; Kim et al. (1994b) J. Biol. Chem.

   WO 2016/011029                                                                PCT/US2015/040379
    269:31,978-31,982. Thus, in one embodiment, fusion proteins comprise the cleavage
    domain (or cleavage half-domain) from at least one Type IIS restriction enzyme and one or
    more zinc finger binding domains, which may or may not be engineered.
            An exemplary Type IIS restriction enzyme, whose cleavage domain is separable
 5  from the binding domain, is Fok I. This particular enzyme is active as a dimer. Bitinaite et
    al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95: 10,570-10,575. Accordingly, for the purposes of
    the present disclosure, the portion of the Fok I enzyme used in the disclosed fusion proteins
    is considered a cleavage half-domain. Thus, for targeted double-stranded cleavage and/or
    targeted replacement of cellular sequences using zinc finger-Fok I fusions, two fusion
10  proteins, each comprising a FokI cleavage half-domain, can be used to reconstitute a
    catalytically active cleavage domain. Alternatively, a single polypeptide molecule
    containing a DNA binding domain and two Fok I cleavage half-domains can also be used.
            A cleavage domain or cleavage half-domain can be any portion of a protein that
    retains cleavage activity, or that retains the ability to multimerize (e.g., dimerize) to form a
15  functional cleavage domain.
            Exemplary Type IIS restriction enzymes are described in U.S. Patent Publication
    No. 20070134796, incorporated herein in its entirety. Additional restriction enzymes also
    contain separable binding and cleavage domains, and these are contemplated by the present
    disclosure. See, for example, Roberts et al. (2003) Nucleic Acids Res. 31:418-420.
20          In certain embodiments, the cleavage domain comprises one or more engineered
    cleavage half-domain (also referred to as dimerization domain mutants) that minimize or
    prevent homodimerization, as described, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication Nos.
    20050064474; 20060188987 and 20080131962, the disclosures of all of which are
    incorporated by reference in their entireties herein.
25          Alternatively, nucleases may be assembled in vivo at the nucleic acid target site
    using so-called "split-enzyme" technology (see e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No.
    20090068164). Components of such split enzymes may be expressed either on separate
    expression constructs, or can be linked in one open reading frame where the individual
    components are separated, for example, by a self-cleaving 2A peptide or IRES sequence.
30  Components may be individual zinc finger binding domains or domains of a meganuclease
    nucleic acid binding domain.

    canonical zinc finger DNA binding domains (see co-owned US Patent publication
15  20080182332, incorporated by reference herein). The FokI restriction endonuclease must
    dimerize via the nuclease domain in order to cleave DNA and introduce a double-strand
    break. Consequently, ZFNs containing a nuclease domain from such an endonuclease also
    require dimerization of the nuclease domain in order to cleave target DNA. Mani et al.

    oriented DNA-binding sites. Id.
            In particular examples, a method for the site-specific integration of an exogenous
    nucleic acid into at least one NANOS locus of a host comprises introducing into a cell of
    the host a ZFN, wherein the ZFN recognizes and binds to a target nucleotide sequence,
25  wherein the target nucleotide sequence is comprised within at least one NANOS locus of
    the host. In certain examples, the target nucleotide sequence is not comprised within the
    genome of the host at any other position than the at least one NANOS locus. For example,
    a DNA-binding polypeptide of the ZFN may be engineered to recognize and bind to a
    target nucleotide sequence identified within the at least one NANOS locus (e.g., by
30  sequencing the NANOS locus). A method for the site-specific integration of an exogenous
    nucleic acid into at least one NANOS performance locus of a host that comprises
    introducing into a cell of the host a ZFN may also comprise introducing into the cell an

              Optional Exogenous Nucleic Acids for Integration at a NANOS Locus
             Embodiments of the invention may include one or more nucleic acids selected from
    the group consisting of: an exogenous nucleic acid for site-specific integration in at least
    one NANOS locus, for example and without limitation, an ORF; a nucleic acid comprising
10  a nucleotide sequence encoding a targeting endonuclease; and a vector comprising at least
    one of either or both of the foregoing. Thus, particular nucleic acids for use in some
    embodiments include nucleotide sequences encoding a polypeptide, structural nucleotide
    sequences, and/or DNA-binding polypeptide recognition and binding sites.
15           Optional Exogenous Nucleic Acid Molecules for Site-Specific Integration
            As noted above, insertion of an exogenous sequence (also called a "donor
    sequence" or "donor" or "transgene") is provided, for example for expression of a
    polypeptide, correction of a mutant gene or for increased expression of a wild-type gene. It
    will be readily apparent that the donor sequence is typically not identical to the genomic
20  sequence where it is placed. A donor sequence can contain a non-homologous sequence
    flanked by two regions of homology to allow for efficient HDR at the location of interest.
    Additionally, donor sequences can comprise a vector molecule containing sequences that
    are not homologous to the region of interest in cellular chromatin. A donor molecule can
    contain several, discontinuous regions of homology to cellular chromatin. For example, for
25  targeted insertion of sequences not normally present in a region of interest, said sequences
    can be present in a donor nucleic acid molecule and flanked by regions of homology to
    sequence in the region of interest.
             The donor polynucleotide can be DNA or RNA, single-stranded or double-stranded
    and can be introduced into a cell in linear or circular form. See e.g., U.S. Patent Publication
30  Nos. 20100047805, 20110281361, 20110207221 and U.S. application Ser. No. 13/889,162.
    If introduced in linear form, the ends of the donor sequence can be protected (e.g. from
    exonucleolytic degradation) by methods known to those of skill in the art. For example,
                                                   42

   WO 2016/011029                                                               PCT/US2015/040379
    one or more dideoxynucleotide residues are added to the 3' terminus of a linear molecule
    and/or self-complementary oligonucleotides are ligated to one or both ends. See, for
    example, Chang et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:4959-4963;Nehls et al. (1996)
    Science 272:886-889. Additional methods for protecting exogenous polynucleotides from
 5  degradation include, but are not limited to, addition of terminal amino group(s) and the use
    of modified internucleotide linkages such as, for example, phosphorothioates,
    phosphoramidates, and 0-methyl ribose or deoxyribose residues.
            A polynucleotide can be introduced into a cell as part of a vector molecule having
    additional sequences such as, for example, replication origins, promoters and genes
10  encoding antibiotic resistance. Moreover, donor polynucleotides can be introduced as
    naked nucleic acid, as nucleic acid complexed with an agent such as a liposome or
    poloxamer, or can be delivered by viruses (e.g., adenovirus, AAV, herpesvirus, retrovirus,
    lentivirus and integrase defective lentivirus (IDLV)).
             The donor is generally integrated so that its expression is driven by the endogenous
15  promoter at the integration site, namely the promoter that drives expression of the
    endogenous gene into which the donor is integrated (e.g., NANOS). However, it will be
    apparent that the donor may comprise a promoter and/or enhancer, for example a
    constitutive promoter or an inducible or tissue specific promoter.
             Furthermore, although not required for expression, exogenous sequences may also
20  include transcriptional or translational regulatory sequences, for example, promoters,
    enhancers, insulators, internal ribosome entry sites, sequences encoding 2A peptides and/or
    polyadenylation signals.
             Exogenous nucleic acids that may be integrated in a site-specific manner into at
    least one NANOS locus, so as to modify the NANOS locus, in embodiments include, for
25  example and without limitation, nucleic acids comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a
    polypeptide of interest; nucleic acids comprising an agronomic gene; nucleic acids
    comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an RNAi molecule; or nucleic acids that
    disrupt the NANOS gene.
             In some embodiments, an exogenous nucleic acid is integrated at a NANOS locus,
30  so as to modify the NANOS locus, wherein the nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide
    sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest, such that the nucleotide sequence is expressed
    in the host from the NANOS locus. In some examples, the polypeptide of interest (e.g., a
                                                   43

   WO 2016/011029                                                                PCT/US2015/040379
    foreign protein) is expressed from a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide of
    interest in commercial quantities. In such examples, the polypeptide of interest may be
    extracted from the host cell, tissue, or biomass.
 5          Nucleic Acid Molecules Comprising a Nucleotide Sequence Encoding a Targeting
             Endonuclease
             In some embodiments, a nucleotide sequence encoding a targeting endonuclease
    may be engineered by manipulation (e.g., ligation) of native nucleotide sequences
    encoding polypeptides comprised within the targeting endonuclease. For example, the
10  nucleotide sequence of a gene encoding a protein comprising a DNA-binding polypeptide
    may be inspected to identify the nucleotide sequence of the gene that corresponds to the
    DNA-binding polypeptide, and that nucleotide sequence may be used as an element of a
    nucleotide sequence encoding a targeting endonuclease comprising the DNA-binding
    polypeptide. Alternatively, the amino acid sequence of a targeting endonuclease may be
15  used to deduce a nucleotide sequence encoding the targeting endonuclease, for example,
    according to the degeneracy of the genetic code.
             In exemplary nucleic acid molecules comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a
    targeting endonuclease, the last codon of a first polynucleotide sequence encoding a
    nuclease polypeptide, and the first codon of a second polynucleotide sequence encoding a
20  DNA-binding polypeptide, may be separated by any number of nucleotide triplets, e.g.,
    without coding for an intron or a "STOP." Likewise, the last codon of a nucleotide
    sequence encoding a first polynucleotide sequence encoding a DNA-binding polypeptide,
    and the first codon of a second polynucleotide sequence encoding a nuclease polypeptide,
    may be separated by any number of nucleotide triplets. In these and further embodiments,
25  the last codon of the last (i.e., most 3' in the nucleic acid sequence) of a first polynucleotide
    sequence encoding a nuclease polypeptide, and a second polynucleotide sequence encoding
    a DNA-binding polypeptide, may be fused in phase-register with the first codon of a
    further polynucleotide coding sequence directly contiguous thereto, or separated therefrom
    by no more than a short peptide sequence, such as that encoded by a synthetic nucleotide
30  linker (e.g., a nucleotide linker that may have been used to achieve the fusion). Examples
    of such further polynucleotide sequences include, for example and without limitation, tags,
    targeting peptides, and enzymatic cleavage sites. Likewise, the first codon of the most 5'
                                                     44

   WO 2016/011029                                                               PCT/US2015/040379
    (in the nucleic acid sequence) of the first and second polynucleotide sequences may be
    fused in phase-register with the last codon of a further polynucleotide coding sequence
    directly contiguous thereto, or separated therefrom by no more than a short peptide
    sequence.
 5           A sequence separating polynucleotide sequences encoding functional polypeptides
    in a targeting endonuclease (e.g., a DNA-binding polypeptide and a nuclease polypeptide)
    may, for example, consist of any sequence, such that the amino acid sequence encoded is
    not likely to significantly alter the translation of the targeting endonuclease. Due to the
    autonomous nature of known nuclease polypeptides and known DNA-binding
10  polypeptides, intervening sequences will not in examples interfere with the respective
    functions of these structures.
             Other Knockout Methods
             Various other techniques known in the art can be used to inactivate genes to make
15  knock-out animals and/or to introduce nucleic acid constructs into animals to produce
    founder animals and to make animal lines, in which the knockout or nucleic acid construct
    is integrated into the genome. Such techniques include, without limitation, pronuclear
    microinjection (U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,191), retrovirus mediated gene transfer into germ lines
    (Van der Putten et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 6148-1652), gene targeting
20  into embryonic stem cells (Thompson et al. (1989) Cell 56, 313-321), electroporation of
    embryos (Lo (1983) Mol. Cell. Biol. 3, 1803-1814), sperm-mediated gene transfer
    (Lavitrano et al. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 14230-14235; Lavitrano et al.
    (2006) Reprod. Fert. Develop. 18, 19-23), and in vitro transformation of somatic cells, such
    as cumulus or mammary cells, or adult, fetal, or embryonic stem cells, followed by nuclear
25  transplantation (Wilmut et al. (1997) Nature 385, 810-813; and Wakayama et al. (1998)
    Nature 394, 369-374). Pronuclear microinjection, sperm mediated gene transfer, and
    somatic cell nuclear transfer are particularly useful techniques. An animal that is
    genomically modified is an animal wherein all of its cells have the genetic modification,
    including its germ line cells. When methods are used that produce an animal that is mosaic
30  in its genetic modification, the animals may be inbred and progeny that are genomically
    modified may be selected. Cloning, for instance, may be used to make a mosaic animal if
    its cells are modified at the blastocyst state, or genomic modification can take place when a
                                                     45

   WO 2016/011029                                                                PCT/US2015/040379
    single-cell is modified. Animals that are modified so they do not sexually mature can be
    homozygous or heterozygous for the modification, depending on the specific approach that
    is used. If a particular gene is inactivated by a knock out modification, homozygousity
    would normally be required. If a particular gene is inactivated by an RNA interference or
 5  dominant negative strategy, then heterozygosity is often adequate.
            Typically, in embryo/zygote microinjection, a nucleic acid construct or mRNA is
    introduced into a fertilized egg; 1 or 2 cell fertilized eggs are used as the pronuclei
    containing the genetic material from the sperm head and the egg are visible within the
    protoplasm. Pronuclear staged fertilized eggs can be obtained in vitro or in vivo (i.e.,
10  surgically recovered from the oviduct of donor animals). In vitro fertilized eggs can be
    produced as follows. For example, swine ovaries can be collected at an abattoir, and
    maintained at 22-28' C. during transport. Ovaries can be washed and isolated for follicular
    aspiration, and follicles ranging from 4-8 mm can be aspirated into 50 mL conical
    centrifuge tubes using 18 gauge needles and under vacuum. Follicular fluid and aspirated
15  oocytes can be rinsed through pre-filters with commercial TL-HEPES (Minitube, Verona,
    Wis.). Oocytes surrounded by a compact cumulus mass can be selected and placed into
    TCM-199 OOCYTE MATURATION MEDIUM (Minitube, Verona, Wis.) supplemented
    with 0.1 mg/mL cysteine, 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 10% porcine follicular fluid,
    50 .mu.M 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/ml cAMP, 10 IU/mL each of pregnant mare serum
20  gonadotropin (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for approximately 22
    hours in humidified air at 38.70 C. and 5% CO 2 . Subsequently, the oocytes can be moved
    to fresh TCM-199 maturation medium, which will not contain cAMP, PMSG or hCG and
    incubated for an additional 22 hours. Matured oocytes can be stripped of their cumulus
    cells by vortexing in 0.1% hyaluronidase for 1 minute.
25           For swine, mature oocytes can be fertilized in 500 pl Minitube PORCPRO IVF
    MEDIUM SYSTEM (Minitube, Verona, Wis.) in Minitube 5-well fertilization dishes. In
    preparation for in vitro fertilization (IVF), freshly-collected or frozen boar semen can be
    washed and resuspended in PORCPRO IVF Medium to 4x10x5 sperm. Sperm
    concentrations can be analyzed by computer assisted semen analysis (SPERMVISION,
30  Minitube, Verona, Wis.). Final in vitro insemination can be performed in a 10 .mu.l
    volume at a final concentration of approximately 40 motile sperm/oocyte, depending on
    boar. Incubate all fertilizing oocytes at 38.7'C. in 5.0% CO 2 atmosphere for 6 hours. Six

    hours post-insemination, presumptive zygotes can be washed twice in NCSU-23 and
     moved to 0.5 mL of the same medium. This system can produce 20-30% blastocysts
     routinely across most boars with a 10-30% polyspermic insemination rate.
              Linearized nucleic acid constructs or mRNA can be injected into one of the
 5  pronuclei or into the cytoplasm. Then the injected eggs can be transferred to a recipient
     female (e.g., into the oviducts of a recipient female) and allowed to develop in the recipient
     female to produce the transgenic animals. In particular, in vitro fertilized embryos can be
     centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 5 minutes to sediment lipids allowing visualization of the
    pronucleus. The embryos can be injected with using an Eppendorf FEMTOJET injector
10   and can be cultured until blastocyst formation. Rates of embryo cleavage and blastocyst
     formation and quality can be recorded.
              Embryos can be surgically transferred into uteri of asynchronous recipients.
     Typically, 100-200 (e.g., 150-200) embryos can be deposited into the ampulla-isthmus
    junction of the oviduct using a 5.5-inch TOMCAT@ catheter. After surgery, real-time
15  ultrasound examination of pregnancy can be performed.
              In somatic cell nuclear transfer, a transgenic cell (e.g., a transgenic pig cell or
    bovine cell) such as an embryonic blastomere, fetal fibroblast, adult ear fibroblast, or
     granulosa cell that includes a nucleic acid construct described above, can be introduced
     into an enucleated oocyte to establish a combined cell. Oocytes can be enucleated by
20  partial zona dissection near the polar body and then pressing out cytoplasm at the
     dissection area. Typically, an injection pipette with a sharp beveled tip is used to inject the
    transgenic cell into an enucleated oocyte arrested at meiosis 2. In some conventions,
     oocytes arrested at meiosis-2 are termed eggs. After producing a porcine or bovine embryo
     (e.g., by fusing and activating the oocyte), the embryo is transferred to the oviducts of a
25   recipient female, about 20 to 24 hours after activation. See, for example, Cibelli et al.
     (1998) Science 280, 1256-1258 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,548,741. For pigs, recipient females
     can be checked for pregnancy approximately 20-21 days after transfer of the embryos.
              Standard breeding techniques can be used to create animals that are homozygous
     for the exogenous nucleic acid from the initial heterozygous founder animals.
30   Homozygosity may not be required, however. Transgenic pigs described herein can be
    bred with other pigs of interest.

             In some embodiments, a nucleic acid of interest and a selectable marker can be
    provided on separate transposons and provided to either embryos or cells in unequal
    amount, where the amount of transposon containing the selectable marker far exceeds (5
     10 fold excess) the transposon containing the nucleic acid of interest. Transgenic cells or
 5  animals expressing the nucleic acid of interest can be isolated based on presence and
    expression of the selectable marker. Because the transposons will integrate into the genome
    in a precise and unlinked way (independent transposition events), the nucleic acid of
    interest and the selectable marker are not genetically linked and can easily be separated by
    genetic segregation through standard breeding. Thus, transgenic animals can be produced
10  that are not constrained to retain selectable markers in subsequent generations, an issue of
    some concern from a public safety perspective.
             Once transgenic animal have been generated, expression of an exogenous nucleic
    acid can be assessed using standard techniques. Initial screening can be accomplished by
    Southern blot analysis to determine whether or not integration of the construct has taken
15  place. For a description of Southern analysis, see sections 9.37-9.52 of Sambrook et al.,
     1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, second edition, Cold Spring Harbor
    Press, Plainview; N.Y. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques also can be used in the
    initial screening PCR refers to a procedure or technique in which target nucleic acids are
    amplified. Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or
20  beyond is employed to design oligonucleotide primers that are identical or similar in
    sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. PCR can be used to amplify
    specific sequences from DNA as well as RNA, including sequences from total genomic
    DNA or total cellular RNA. Primers typically are 14 to 40 nucleotides in length, but can
    range from 10 nucleotides to hundreds of nucleotides in length. PCR is described in, for
25  example PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual, ed. Dieffenbach and Dveksler, Cold Spring
    Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995. Nucleic acids also can be amplified by ligase chain
    reaction, strand displacement amplification, self-sustained sequence replication, or nucleic
    acid sequence-based amplified. See, for example, Lewis (1992) Genetic Engineering News
     12,1; Guatelli et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:1874; and Weiss (1991) Science
30  254:1292. At the blastocyst stage, embryos can be individually processed for analysis by
    PCR, Southern hybridization and splinkerette PCR (see, e.g., Dupuy et al. Proc Natl Acad
    Sci USA (2002) 99:4495).

             Expression of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide in the tissues of
    transgenic pigs can be assessed using techniques that include, for example, Northern blot
    analysis of tissue samples obtained from the animal, in situ hybridization analysis, Western
    analysis, immunoassays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and reverse
 5  transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR).
             Interfering RNAs
            A variety of interfering RNA (RNAi) systems are known. Double-stranded RNA
    (dsRNA) induces sequence-specific degradation of homologous gene transcripts. RNA
10  induced silencing complex (RISC) metabolizes dsRNA to small 21-23-nucleotide small
    interfering RNAs (siRNAs). RISC contains a double stranded RNAse (dsRNase, e.g.,
    Dicer) and ssRNase (e.g., Argonaut 2 or Ago2). RISC utilizes antisense strand as a guide to
    find a cleavable target. Both siRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) are known. A method of
    inactivating a gene in a genetically edited animal comprises inducing RNA interference
15  against a target gene and/or nucleic acid such that expression of the target gene and/or
    nucleic acid is reduced.
             For example the exogenous nucleic acid sequence can induce RNA interference
    against a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide. For example, double-stranded small
    interfering RNA (siRNA) or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) homologous to a target DNA can
20  be used to reduce expression of that DNA. Constructs for siRNA can be produced as
    described, for example, in Fire et al. (1998) Nature 391:806; Romano and Masino (1992)

25  produced as described by McIntyre and Fanning (2006) BMC Biotechnology 6:1. In
    general, shRNAs are transcribed as a single-stranded RNA molecule containing
    complementary regions, which can anneal and form short hairpins.
             The probability of finding a single, individual functional siRNA or miRNA directed
    to a specific gene is high. The predictability of a specific sequence of siRNA, for instance,
30  is about 50% but a number of interfering RNAs may be made with good confidence that at
    least one of them will be effective.

             Embodiments include an in vitro cell, an in vivo cell, and a genetically edited
    animal such as a livestock animal that express an RNAi directed against a neuroendocrine
    gene selective for sexual maturation. An embodiment is an RNAi directed against a gene in
    the group consisting of Gpr54, Kiss 1, and GnRH1. The RNAi may be, for instance,
 5  selected from the group consisting of siRNA, shRNA, dsRNA, RISC and miRNA.
             Inducible Systems
            An inducible system may be used to control expression of a sexual maturation
    gene. Various inducible systems are known that allow spatiotemporal control of expression
10  of a gene. Several have been proven to be functional in vivo in transgenic animals.
            An example of an inducible system is the tetracycline (tet)-on promoter system,
    which can be used to regulate transcription of the nucleic acid. In this system, a mutated
    Tet repressor (TetR) is fused to the activation domain of herpes simplex virus VP 16 trans
    activator protein to create a tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator (tTA), which is
15  regulated by tet or doxycycline (dox). In the absence of antibiotic, transcription is minimal,
    while in the presence of tet or dox, transcription is induced. Alternative inducible systems
    include the ecdysone or rapamycin systems. Ecdysone is an insect molting hormone whose
    production is controlled by a heterodimer of the ecdysone receptor and the product of the
    ultraspiracle gene (USP). Expression is induced by treatment with ecdysone or an analog
20  of ecdysone such as muristerone A. The agent that is administered to the animal to trigger
    the inducible system is referred to as an induction agent.
             The tetracycline-inducible system and the Cre/loxP recombinase system (either
    constitutive or inducible) are among the more commonly used inducible systems. The
    tetracycline-inducible system involves a tetracycline-controlled transactivator
25  (tTA)/reverse tTA (rtTA). A method to use these systems in vivo involves generating two
    lines of genetically edited animals. One animal line expresses the activator (tTA, rtTA, or
    Cre recombinase) under the control of a selected promoter. Another set of transgenic
    animals express the acceptor, in which the expression of the gene of interest (or the gene to
    be modified) is under the control of the target sequence for the tTA/rtTA transactivators (or
30  is flanked by loxP sequences). Mating the two strains of mice provides control of gene
    expression.
                                                   50

   WO 2016/011029                                                                PCT/US2015/040379
             The tetracycline-dependent regulatory systems (tet systems) rely on two
    components, i.e., a tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA or rtTA) and a tTA/rtTA
    dependent promoter that controls expression of a downstream cDNA, in a tetracycline
    dependent manner. In the absence of tetracycline or its derivatives (such as doxycycline),
 5  tTA binds to tetO sequences, allowing transcriptional activation of the tTA-dependent
    promoter. However, in the presence of doxycycline, tTA cannot interact with its target and
    transcription does not occur. The tet system that uses tTA is termed tet-OFF, because
    tetracycline or doxycycline allows transcriptional down-regulation. Administration of
    tetracycline or its derivatives allows temporal control of transgene expression in vivo. rtTA
10  is a variant of tTA that is not functional in the absence of doxycycline but requires the
    presence of the ligand for transactivation. This tet system is therefore termed tet-ON. The
    tet systems have been used in vivo for the inducible expression of several transgenes,
    encoding, e.g., reporter genes, oncogenes, or proteins involved in a signaling cascade.
             The Cre/lox system uses the Cre recombinase, which catalyzes site-specific
15  recombination by crossover between two distant Cre recognition sequences, i.e., loxP sites.
    A DNA sequence introduced between the two loxP sequences (termed foxed DNA) is
    excised by Cre-mediated recombination. Control of Cre expression in a transgenic animal,
    using either spatial control (with a tissue- or cell-specific promoter), or temporal control
    (with an inducible system), results in control of DNA excision between the two loxP sites.
20  One application is for conditional gene inactivation (conditional knockout). Another
    approach is for protein over-expression, wherein a foxed stop codon is inserted between
    the promoter sequence and the DNA of interest. Genetically edited animals do not express
    the transgene until Cre is expressed, leading to excision of the floxed stop codon. This
    system has been applied to tissue-specific oncogenesis and controlled antigene receptor
25  expression in B lymphocytes. Inducible Cre recombinases have also been developed. The
    inducible Cre recombinase is activated only by administration of an exogenous ligand. The
    inducible Cre recombinases are fusion proteins containing the original Cre recombinase
    and a specific ligand-binding domain. The functional activity of the Cre recombinase is
    dependent on an external ligand that is able to bind to this specific domain in the fusion
30  protein.
             Embodiments include an in vitro cell, an in vivo cell, and a genetically edited
    animal such as a livestock animal that comprise a neuroendocrine gene selective for sexual
                                                    51

   WO 2016/011029                                                              PCT/US2015/040379
    maturation that is under control of an inducible system. The genetic modification of an
    animal may be genomic or mosaic. An embodiment is a gene in the group consisting of
    Gpr54, Kiss 1, and GnRH1 that is under control of an inducible system. The inducible
    system may be, for instance, selected from the group consisting of Tet-On, Tet-Off, Cre
 5  lox, and Hifl alpha.
            Vectors and Nucleic Acids
            A variety of nucleic acids may be introduced into cells for knockout purposes, for
    inactivation of a gene, to obtain expression of a gene, or for other purposes. As used
10  herein, the term nucleic acid includes DNA, RNA, and nucleic acid analogs, and nucleic
    acids that are double-stranded or single-stranded (i.e., a sense or an antisense single
    strand). Nucleic acid analogs can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety, or
    phosphate backbone to improve, for example, stability, hybridization, or solubility of the
    nucleic acid. Modifications at the base moiety include deoxyuridine for deoxythymidine,
15  and 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine and 5-bromo-2'-doxycytidine for deoxycytidine.
    Modifications of the sugar moiety include modification of the 2' hydroxyl of the ribose
    sugar to form 2'-O-methyl or 2'-O-allyl sugars. The deoxyribose phosphate backbone can
    be modified to produce morpholino nucleic acids, in which each base moiety is linked to a
    six membered, morpholino ring, or peptide nucleic acids, in which the deoxyphosphate
20  backbone is replaced by a pseudopeptide backbone and the four bases are retained. See,
    Summerton and Weller (1997) Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 7(3):187; and Hyrup et
    al. (1996) Bioorgan. Med. Chem. 4:5. In addition, the deoxyphosphate backbone can be
    replaced with, for example, a phosphorothioate or phosphorodithioate backbone, a
    phosphoroamidite, or an alkyl phosphotriester backbone.
25          The target nucleic acid sequence can be operably linked to a regulatory region such
    as a promoter. Regulatory regions can be porcine regulatory regions or can be from other
    species. As used herein, operably linked refers to positioning of a regulatory region relative
    to a nucleic acid sequence in such a way as to permit or facilitate transcription of the target
    nucleic acid.
30          Any type of promoter can be operably linked to a target nucleic acid sequence.
    Examples of promoters include, without limitation, tissue-specific promoters, constitutive
    promoters, inducible promoters, and promoters responsive or unresponsive to a particular
                                                  52

   WO 2016/011029                                                              PCT/US2015/040379
    stimulus. Suitable tissue specific promoters can result in preferential expression of a
    nucleic acid transcript in beta cells and include, for example, the human insulin promoter.
    Other tissue specific promoters can result in preferential expression in, for example,
    hepatocytes or heart tissue and can include the albumin or alpha-myosin heavy chain
 5  promoters, respectively. In other embodiments, a promoter that facilitates the expression of
    a nucleic acid molecule without significant tissue or temporal-specificity can be used (i.e.,
    a constitutive promoter). For example, a beta-actin promoter such as the chicken beta-actin
    gene promoter, ubiquitin promoter, miniCAGs promoter, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
    dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter, or 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter can be
10  used, as well as viral promoters such as the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV
    TK) promoter, the SV40 promoter, or a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. In some
    embodiments, a fusion of the chicken beta actin gene promoter and the CMV enhancer is
    used as a promoter. See, for example, Xu et al. (2001) Hum. Gene Ther. 12:563; and
    Kiwaki et al. (1996) Hum. Gene Ther. 7:821.
15          Additional regulatory regions that may be useful in nucleic acid constructs, include,
    but are not limited to, polyadenylation sequences, translation control sequences (e.g., an
    internal ribosome entry segment, IRES), enhancers, inducible elements, or introns. Such
    regulatory regions may not be necessary, although they may increase expression by
    affecting transcription, stability of the mRNA, translational efficiency, or the like. Such
20  regulatory regions can be included in a nucleic acid construct as desired to obtain optimal
    expression of the nucleic acids in the cell(s). Sufficient expression, however, can
    sometimes be obtained without such additional elements.
            A nucleic acid construct may be used that encodes signal peptides or selectable
    markers. Signal peptides can be used such that an encoded polypeptide is directed to a
25  particular cellular location (e.g., the cell surface). Non-limiting examples of selectable
    markers include puromycin, ganciclovir, adenosine deaminase (ADA), aminoglycoside
    phosphotransferase (neo, G418, APH), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), hygromycin-B
    phosphtransferase, thymidine kinase (TK), and xanthin-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase
    (XGPRT). Such markers are useful for selecting stable transformants in culture. Other
30  selectable markers include fluorescent polypeptides, such as green fluorescent protein or
    yellow fluorescent protein.
                                                     53

   WO 2016/011029                                                                   PCT/US2015/040379
              In some embodiments, a sequence encoding a selectable marker can be flanked by
    recognition sequences for a recombinase such as, e.g., Cre or Flp. For example, the
    selectable marker can be flanked by loxP recognition sites (34-bp recognition sites
    recognized by the Cre recombinase) or FRT recognition sites such that the selectable
 5  marker can be excised from the construct. See, Orban, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (1992)
    89:6861, for a review of Cre/lox technology, and Brand and Dymecki, Dev. Cell (2004)
    6:7. A transposon containing a Cre- or Flp-activatable transgene interrupted by a selectable
    marker gene also can be used to obtain transgenic animals with conditional expression of a
    transgene. For example, a promoter driving expression of the marker/transgene can be
10  either ubiquitous or tissue-specific, which would result in the ubiquitous or tissue-specific
    expression of the marker in FO animals (e.g., pigs). Tissue specific activation of the
    transgene can be accomplished, for example, by crossing a pig that ubiquitously expresses
    a marker-interrupted transgene to a pig expressing Cre or Flp in a tissue-specific manner,
    or by crossing a pig that expresses a marker-interrupted transgene in a tissue-specific
15  manner to a pig that ubiquitously expresses Cre or Flp recombinase. Controlled expression
    of the transgene or controlled excision of the marker allows expression of the transgene.
             In some embodiments, the exogenous nucleic acid encodes a polypeptide. A nucleic
    acid sequence encoding a polypeptide can include a tag sequence that encodes a "tag"
    designed to facilitate subsequent manipulation of the encoded polypeptide (e.g., to
20  facilitate localization or detection). Tag sequences can be inserted in the nucleic acid
    sequence encoding the polypeptide such that the encoded tag is located at either the
    carboxyl or amino terminus of the polypeptide. Non-limiting examples of encoded tags
    include glutathione S-transferase (GST) and FLAG TMtag (Kodak, New Haven, Conn.).
             Nucleic acid constructs can be methylated using an SssI CpG methylase (New
25  England Biolabs, Ipswich, Mass.). In general, the nucleic acid construct can be incubated
    with S-adenosylmethionine and SssI CpG-methylase in buffer at 37.degree. C.
    Hypermethylation can be confirmed by incubating the construct with one unit of HinP II
    endonuclease for 1 hour at 370 C. and assaying by agarose gel electrophoresis.
             Nucleic acid constructs can be introduced into embryonic, fetal, or adult animal
30  cells of any type, including, for example, germ cells such as an oocyte or an egg, a
    progenitor cell, an adult or embryonic stem cell, a primordial germ cell, a kidney cell such
    as a PK-15 cell, an islet cell, a beta cell, a liver cell, or a fibroblast such as a dermal
                                                      54

   WO 2016/011029                                                              PCT/US2015/040379
    fibroblast, using a variety of techniques. Non-limiting examples of techniques include the
    use of transposon systems, recombinant viruses that can infect cells, or liposomes or other
    non-viral methods such as electroporation, microinjection, or calcium phosphate
    precipitation, that are capable of delivering nucleic acids to cells.
 5          In transposon systems, the transcriptional unit of a nucleic acid construct, i.e., the
    regulatory region operably linked to an exogenous nucleic acid sequence, is flanked by an
    inverted repeat of a transposon. Several transposon systems, including, for example,
    Sleeping Beauty (see, U.S. Pat. No. 6,613,752 and U.S. Publication No. 2005/0003542);
    Frog Prince (Miskey et al. (2003) Nucleic Acids Res. 31:6873); Tol2 (Kawakami (2007)
10  Genome Biology 8(Suppl. 1):S7; Minos (Pavlopoulos et al. (2007) Genome Biology
    8(Suppl.1):S2); Hsmarl (Miskey et al. (2007)) Mol Cell Biol. 27:4589); and Passport have
    been developed to introduce nucleic acids into cells, including mice, human, and pig cells.
    The Sleeping Beauty transposon is particularly useful. A transposase can be delivered as a
    protein, encoded on the same nucleic acid construct as the exogenous nucleic acid, can be
15  introduced on a separate nucleic acid construct, or provided as an mRNA (e.g., an in vitro
    transcribed and capped mRNA).
            Insulator elements also can be included in a nucleic acid construct to maintain
    expression of the exogenous nucleic acid and to inhibit the unwanted transcription of host
    genes. See, for example, U.S. Publication No. 2004/0203 158. Typically, an insulator
20  element flanks each side of the transcriptional unit and is internal to the inverted repeat of
    the transposon. Non-limiting examples of insulator elements include the matrix attachment
    region-(MAR) type insulator elements and border-type insulator elements. See, for
    example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,395,549, 5,731,178, 6,100,448, and 5,610,053, and U.S.
    Publication No. 2004/0203158.
25          Nucleic acids can be incorporated into vectors. A vector is a broad term that
    includes any specific DNA segment that is designed to move from a carrier into a target
    DNA. A vector may be referred to as an expression vector, or a vector system, which is a
    set of components needed to bring about DNA insertion into a genome or other targeted
    DNA sequence such as an episome, plasmid, or even virus/phage DNA segment. Vector
30  systems such as viral vectors (e.g., retroviruses, adeno-associated virus and integrating
    phage viruses), and non-viral vectors (e.g., transposons) used for gene delivery in animals
    have two basic components: 1) a vector comprised of DNA (or RNA that is reverse
                                                   55

    WO 2016/011029                                                               PCT/US2015/040379
     transcribed into a cDNA) and 2) a transposase, recombinase, or other integrase enzyme that
     recognizes both the vector and a DNA target sequence and inserts the vector into the target
     DNA sequence. Vectors most often contain one or more expression cassettes that comprise
     one or more expression control sequences, wherein an expression control sequence is a
  5  DNA sequence that controls and regulates the transcription and/or translation of another
     DNA sequence or mRNA, respectively.
               Many different types of vectors are known. For example, plasmids and viral
     vectors, e.g., retroviral vectors, are known. Mammalian expression plasmids typically have
     an origin of replication, a suitable promoter and optional enhancer, necessary ribosome
10   binding sites, a polyadenylation site, splice donor and acceptor sites, transcriptional
     termination sequences, and 5' flanking non-transcribed sequences. Examples of vectors
     include: plasmids (which may also be a carrier of another type of vector), adenovirus,
     adeno-associated virus (AAV), lentivirus (e.g., modified HIV-1, SIV or FIV), retrovirus
     (e.g., ASV, ALV or MoMLV), and transposons (e.g., Sleeping Beauty, P-elements, Tol-2,
15   Frog Prince, piggyBac).
              As used herein, the term nucleic acid refers to both RNA and DNA, including, for
     example, cDNA, genomic DNA, synthetic (e.g., chemically synthesized) DNA, as well as
     naturally occurring and chemically modified nucleic acids, e.g., synthetic bases or
     alternative backbones. A nucleic acid molecule can be double-stranded or single-stranded
20   (i.e., a sense or an antisense single strand). The term transgenic is used broadly herein and
     refers to a genetically edited organism or genetically engineered organism whose genetic
     material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. A knockout animal is thus
     transgenic regardless of whether or not exogenous genes or nucleic acids are expressed in
     the animal or its progeny.
25
               Founder Animals, Animal Lines, Traits, and Reproduction
               Founder animals may be produced by cloning and other methods described herein.
     The founders can be homozygous for a genetic modification, as in the case where a zygote
     or a primary cell undergoes a homozygous modification. Similarly, founders can also be
30   made that are heterozygous. In the case of NANOs knockouts, the founders are preferably
     heterozygous. The founders may be genomically modified, meaning that all of the cells in
     their genome have undergone modification. Founders can be mosaic for a modification, as
                                                     56

   WO 2016/011029                                                                  PCT/US2015/040379
    may happen when vectors are introduced into one of a plurality of cells in an embryo,
    typically at a blastocyst stage. Progeny of mosaic animals may be tested to identify
    progeny that are genomically modified. An animal line is established when a pool of
    animals has been created that can be reproduced sexually or by assisted reproductive
 5  techniques, with heterogeneous or homozygous progeny consistently expressing the
    modification.
              In livestock, many alleles are known to be linked to various traits such as
    production traits, type traits, workability traits, and other functional traits. Artisans are
    accustomed to monitoring and quantifying these traits, e.g., Visscher et al., Livestock
10  Production Science, 40 (1994) 123-137, U.S. Pat. No. 7,709,206, US 2001/0016315, US
    2011/0023140, and US 2005/0153317. An animal line may include a trait chosen from a
    trait in the group consisting of a production trait, a type trait, a workability trait, a fertility
    trait, a mothering trait, and a disease resistance trait. Further traits include expression of a
    recombinant gene product.
15           Animals with a desired trait or traits may be modified to prevent their sexual
    maturation. Since the animals are sterile until matured, it is possible to regulate sexual
    maturity as a means of controlling dissemination of the animals. Animals that have been
    bred or modified to have one or more traits can thus be provided to recipients with a
    reduced risk that the recipients will breed the animals and appropriate the value of the traits
20  to themselves. Embodiments of the invention include genetically modifying a genome of
    an animal with the modification comprising an inactivated sexual maturation gene, wherein
    the sexual maturation gene in a wild type animal expresses a factor selective for sexual
    maturation. Embodiments include treating the animal by administering a compound to
    remedy a deficiency caused by the loss of expression of the gene to induce sexual
25  maturation in the animal.
              Breeding of animals that require administration of a compound to induce sexual
    maturity may advantageously be accomplished at a treatment facility. The treatment
    facility can implement standardized protocols on well-controlled stock to efficiently
    produce consistent animals. The animal progeny may be distributed to a plurality of
30  locations to be raised. Farms and farmers (a term including a ranch and ranchers) may thus
    order a desired number of progeny with a specified range of ages and/or weights and/or
                                                    57

    WO 2016/011029                                                               PCT/US2015/040379
     traits and have them delivered at a desired time and/or location. The recipients, e.g.,
     farmers, may then raise the animals and deliver them to market as they desire.
              Embodiments include delivering (e.g., to one or more locations, to a plurality of
     farms) a genetically edited livestock animal having an inactivated neuroendocrine gene
  5  selective for sexual maturation. Embodiments include delivery of animals having an age of
     between about 1 day and about 180 days. The animal may have one or more traits (for

     Example 1
     Design, construction and testing of porcine NANOS2 TALEN reagents
     Porcine NANOS2 is located on chromosome 6, and constitutes a single exon encoding a
     protein of 138 amino acids. Multiple sequence alignment across independent pig sequences
25   was carried out to identify potential single nucleotide polymorphisms (denoted by red dots
     Figure 1), and where possible these were avoided during selection of TALEN binding sites.
     Potential sites for binding of porcine NANOS2 TALENs were identified close to the 5' end
     of the gene utilising the tool freely available at www.zifit.partners.org. Three TALEN pairs
     were constructed using the Golden Gate TALEN assembly protocol (Cermak et al, NAR
30   2011 39(12):e82). The right TALEN assembly was cloned into destination vector pCAG
     T7-TALEN (Sangamo)-Fokl-KKR-Destination and the left into pCAG-T7-TALEN

              Porcine kidney PK15 cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM (Life
     Technologies, #31966) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin
     and 100 ug/ml streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37 OC with 5 % CO 2 . One
     microgram of endotoxin-free maxiprep plasmid DNA encoding each half of TALEN pairs
15   A, B or C, together with 1 ug of a plasmid encoding a CMV-driven eGFP were co
     transfected into 6 x 105 PK15 cells using a Neon electroporator set at 2 pulses of 1400 mV
     for 20 ms each. Transfected cells were recovered in complete medium without antibiotic.
     Twenty four hours after transfection cells were transferred from 37 OC to a 30 OC incubator
     and maintained there for 48 hours. GFP +ve cells were isolated by fluorescence activated
20   cell sorting, expanded by culturing and genomic DNA prepared using the Qiagen Dneasy
     Blood and Tissue kit. PCR was carried out on genomic DNA using Accuprime High

    with which TALEN pairs were able to induce NHEJ events at their target sites. Low
    activity was noted for TALEN pair A (green arrow, Figure 2), activity was not detectable
    for TALEN pair B, and was best for TALEN pair C (red arrows, Figure 2).

    Design, construction and testing of porcine NANOS2 CRISPR reagents
            Potential small guide RNA target sites were initially identified based on the
    presence of protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM) within the coding sequence of the porcine
    NANOS2 gene (as determined by the presence of two consecutive guanine residues in
10  either sense or antisense orientation within said coding sequence). Sites thus identified that
    spanned a potential SNP (as denoted by red dots in Figure 1) were excluded from further
    analysis. Each of the remaining sites was analysed for potential off-target binding by using
    the BLAST algorithm (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to analyse the porcine genome for sequence
    matches. One sgRNA-binding site was selected that appeared to have high specificity for
15  the NANOS2 gene within the porcine genome. This 20 base pair sequence fortuitously had
    a PAM sequence in each orientation
    NANOS2 binding sites

    3' ggtcttagcagctettcccggtctcc 5'               (SEQ ID NO:87)
            The underlined sequence is the binding site for the porcine NANOS2 guide
    sequences in both sense and antisense orientation (SEQ ID NOs 86 and 87). On the sense
25  strand the PAM is denoted by the sequence agg 3' to the target site. On the antisense strand
    the PAM is denoted by the sequence tgg 3' to the target site.
            The forward and reverse versions of the identified guide RNA binding sequence
    were designed and ordered as gBlocks (IDT) with the human U6 promoter driving
    expression of the sgRNA binding sequence, a guide RNA scaffold (also referred to as the
30  Cas9 binding domain) and a terminator sequence (poly T) (Figures 3A and 3B). gBlock
    DNAs were cloned into a plasmid and endotoxin-free plasmid DNA prepared (Qiagen)
    (Figure 3C) . Three plasmids encoding the sgRNA sequence, a CAG-driven Cas9 and a
                                                  61

   WO 2016/011029                                                                PCT/US2015/040379
     CMV-driven eGFP respectively were co-transfected into 6 x 101 PK15 cells using a Neon
     electroporator set at 2 pulses of 1400 mV for 20 ms each. Transfected cells were recovered
     in complete medium without antibiotic. Three days post transfection GFP positive cells
     were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting, expanded by culturing and genomic
 5   DNA prepared using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit. PCR was carried out on
     this genomic DNA using Accuprime High Fidelity polymerase with PCR primers oSL9
     and oSL 10. Cell analysis was carried out on the PCR products as recommended by the
     manufacturer (Transgenomic). Digested PCR products were resolved on a 2% TAE
     agarose gel (Figure 4). While both guide sequences resulted in cutting and NHEJ formation
10   at the target site (indicated by the presence of Cell digestion products, red arrows, Figure
     4), surprisingly it was discovered that the sgRNA sequence in reverse orientation with
     respect to the coding sequence was substantially more efficient than its sense counterpart.
     Example 2
15   Design, construction and testing of bovine NANOS2 CRISPR reagents
              Potential target sites for sgRNAs were initially identified based on the presence of
     PAM sequences within either the coding sequence of the bovine NANOS2 gene or the
     sequence immediately flanking the coding sequence. Each potential site was analysed for
     potential off-target binding by using the BLAST algorithm (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to analyse
20   the bovine genome for sequence matches. Nine potential sgRNA-binding sites were
     selected (three 5' to the coding sequence, three within the coding sequence, and three 3' to
     the stop codon) that appeared to have high specificity for the NANOS2 gene within the
     bovine genome.
              For each identified sgRNA binding site, 2 guide sequences were designed; a 20-mer
25   binding sequence, and a 19-, 18- or 17-mer binding sequence. See Table 1 and Figure 12

    recommended by the manufacturer (NEB). Digested PCR products were resolved on a
     1.4% TAE agarose gel (Figure 6A and 6B). Surprisingly there were substantial differences
 5  discovered in the efficiencies with which sgRNAs were able to induce NHEJ formation at
    their target sites (indicated by the presence of T7 endonuclease digestion products, red
    arrows figure 6A and 6B).
             Guide sequences with the highest activity as determined by T7 endonuclease assay
    for NHEJ were combined in pairs, such that cleavage at both target sites within a cell has
10  the potential to cause a deletion of the intervening sequence. One microgram each of
    plasmids pSL32 + pSL38, pSL32 + pSL39, pSL32 + pSL42, pSL33 + pSL38, pSL33 +
    pSL39 or pSL33 + pSL42 was transfected into 6 x 101 BEF cells. Transfection, culturing
    and DNA preparation from BEF cells was as above. PCR was carried out on genomic
    DNA using Accuprime High Fidelity polymerase with PCR primers oSL86 and oSL87 and
15  products were resolved on a 1.4 % TAE agarose gel (Figure 7). All six plasmid
    combinations demonstrated that, in addition to the full length PCR product, transfected cell
    populations also harboured truncated NANOS2 gene fragments of a size specific to sgRNA
    sequence combination employed (red arrows, Figure 7).
             These truncated fragments were excised from the gel and DNA separated from the
20  agarose by centrifuging the gel slice in a Spin-X Centrifuge Tube Filter (Costar #8163).
    The purified products were cloned into a pCR 4-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA Cloning
    Kit For Sequencing (Invitrogen #45-0030) and transformed into XL-1 Blue Competent
    Cells (Agilent Technologies #200249). Transformed bacteria were plated onto LB agar
    plates containing 100 ug/ml ampicillin and cultured at 370 C overnight. Five colonies from
25  each plate were selected and expanded overnight in LB medium containing 50 ug/ml
    ampicillin. Plasmid was isolated using a PureYield Plasmid Miniprep System (Promega
    #A1223) and sent for sequencing (Edinburgh Genomics) using primer oSL86. Alignment
    of the sequences demonstrates that deletion within the targeted sequence had occurred in
    each case (Figure 8).     Precise end joining between the ends of the deleted fragments was
30  detected in at least one clone from each transfection, while other clones represented more
    imprecise events, indicating additional modification to the sequence occurred during the
                                                   65

    end-joining process. Clones sequenced from the pSL33 + pSL38 combination all showed
    identical, precise end joining events.
             This approach indicates that it is possible, and possibly desirable, to cause specific
    deletions in the target gene that result in loss or reduction of encoded protein expression or
 5  alteration of function of the resultant translated protein, as an additional strategy to the
    induction of NHEJ and consequent frame-shift mutations.

    and production of RNA. Briefly, sgRNA was transcribed using T7 in vitro transcription kit
    (Ambion). Likewise, the Cas9 plasmid was obtained from Addgene (Plasmid #42234;
15  Name: pMJ920), and the Cas9 mRNA was transcribed using T7 Megascript in vitro
    transcription kit (Figure 9A).
             Both Cas9 mRNA (100 ng/pl), and sgRNA targeting NANOS2 (50 ng/pl) were
    injected into 1-cell porcine zygotes using an Eppendorf Femtojet injector on a continuous
    flow setting. The injected embryos were allowed to progress to blastocyst stage (Figure
20  9C) for an additional 6 days, DNA collected, and PCR amplified around the target site. The
    presence of target gene deletions (as a consequence of NHEJ repair) was assessed by
    sequencing of the PCR amplicons. As shown in Figure 9D, successful targeting of the
    NANOS2 locus was demonstrated. The sequence surrounding the CRISPR target site in
    NANOS2 was amplified using gene specific primers, cloned into PCR2.1 vector
25  (Invitrogen), transformed into DH5a cells (NEB) and transformants selected based on
    Kanamycin resistance. The colonies were cultured overnight, miniprepped and the
    plasmids sequenced by Sanger sequencing. In Figure 9, "N" represents NANOS2 allele,
    first digit is the blastocyst number, and the second hyphenated number represents the
    bacterial clone containing the amplified NANOS2. In the figure, representative sequences
30  from clones are shown indicating deletions "-" around the predicted CRISPR cut site.
    Sequences from 8 different blastocysts showed successful deletion and disruption of the
    NANOS2 open reading frame, generating knockout alleles and are shown in Figure 9D.

             A second sgRNA sequence for NANOS2 was also selected.
    GAAGACACCGGAGGGCGTGGTGG (SEQ ID NO: 7). This target and the earlier target
    GAATCGTCGACAAGGGCCAGAGG (SEQ ID NO: 8 ), were co-injected together into
    one cell embryos and cultured to blastocyst DNA analysis of blastocysts demonstrated
 5  deletions and knockout of the NANOS2 alleles, see Figure 10.
    Use of Nickase pairs for gene targeting
             The Cas9 nuclease introduces double strand breaksinto DNA. By contrast, Cas9
    nickase only cuts (or nicks) one of the two strands of DNA. When designed against targets
10  in close proximity on opposite strands, paired nickases can introduce double strand breaks,
    and consequently can generate deletions with high precision. The advantage of using
    paired nickases vs nucleases is that even if the Cas9 nickase displays off-target binding,
    only one of the two strands will be nicked, which can be effectively repaired without
    causing unwanted modifications at the off targeting site. However, when used in
15  combination in close proximity, the nickases introduce targeted DNA cleavage. A pair of
    nickases was designed to target the porcine NANOS2 gene. However, the nickases were
    not effective in introducing mutations (Figure 11). A pair of single guide RNAs was
    designed to target on opposite strands. Both the sgRNAs are shown in the boxed section in
    Figure 11, with the reverse strand highlighted in yellow. PAM motifs of both sgRNAs are
20  highlighted in green. No modifications were identified around the target site.
    Generation of NANOS2-deficient pig models
             The candidate CRISPR sgRNAs and Cas9:GFP mRNA were injected into in vitro
    fertilized porcine embryos (Fig. 9C). Briefly, maturing oocytes from sows were purchased
25  from ART Inc. (Madison, WI) and shipped to the lab overnight in their commercial
    maturation medium #1. Twenty-four hours after being placed in the maturation medium #1
    (provided by ART), 50 to 75 cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were placed in 500 PIl of
    tissue culture medium 199 (TCM 199) containing 0.14% PVA, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth
    factor, 0.57 mM cysteine, 0.5 IU/ml porcine FSH, and 0.5 IU/ml ovine LH and cultured for
30  an additional 20 hours at 38.5'C and 5% CO 2 in air, 100% humidity. COCs were vortexed
    in 0.1% hyaluronidase in HEPES-buffered medium containing 0.01% PVA for 4 minutes
    to remove the cumulus cells following maturation. Groups of 30-35 mature, denuded
                                                   67

     oocytes were placed in 100 pl of a modified Tris-buffered medium (mTBM) and fertilized
     according to an established protocol using fresh extended boar semen. Briefly, 1-2 ml of
     extended semen was mixed with Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) containing
      1 mg/ml BSA to a final volume of 10 ml and centrifuged at 1000xg, 25'C for four minutes;
  5  spermatozoa were washed in DPBS a total of three times. After the final wash,
     spermatozoa were resuspended in mTBM medium and added to oocytes at a final
     concentration of 5x1 05 spermatozoa /ml, and co-incubated for 5 hours at 38.5'C and 5%
     CO2 . Five hours following fertilization, the presumptive zygotes were injected with Cas9
     mRNA and sgRNA targeting NANOS2 and the intact embryos surgically transferred into
10   the oviducts of synchronized female recipient animals by exposing the reproductive tract
     by midline incision. Animals were allowed to recover from surgery and housed at BARC
     USDA facility.
             Another alternative is to use in vivo fertilized 1-cell embryos for CRISPR mediated
     targeting of NANOS2 and generation of edited animals. Embryo donor animals are
15   synchronized for estrus and superovulated by first feeding with Regumate (Alterenogest)
     for 14-16 days, followed by subcutaneous injections of PG600 (5ml) on day 17 and 1000
     IU of hCG on day 20. Animals are bred thrice, once on standing estrus (day 20), and two
     more inseminations 8 hours apart on day 21. Animals are humanely slaughtered on day 22
     and the embryos harvested by flushing the oviduct. Embryos are injected with CRISPR
20   mRNA and surgically transferred into synchronized recipient (or surrogate) animals the
     same day as described above.

     Screening and Breeding of Animals
25
     Screening animals
             Liveborn animals following transfer of edited embryos will be genotyped as
     follows. Tissue samples (for example hair follicle, ear notches, tail clips, blood) will be
     taken and DNA extracted. The NANOS2 gene will be amplified using suitable primers
30   and sequenced. Animals will be characterized as non-edited, heterozygous edited or
     homozygous edited.
                                                    68

   WO 2016/011029                                                              PCT/US2015/040379
    Fertility of homozygous NANOS2 edited females
             Homozygous NANOS2 edited females will be monitored for puberty and the ability
    to ovulate fertile oocytes. Oocytes will be tested for the ability to produce blastocysts
    following in vitro fertilization. Example homozygous NANOS2 edited females will
 5  undergo hemiovariectomy and the ovary examined for normal oogenesis. The females will
    also be bred and the establishment of pregnancy monitored. Ultimately homozygous
    NANOS2 edited female fertility will be established by the production of live healthy
    offspring. We expect homozygous NANOS2 edited females to have normal fertility.
10  Testis structure and function of heterozygous and homozvgous NANOS2 edited males
    Testis growth and dimensions will be monitored in heterozygous and homozygous
    NANOS2 edited males. We expect heterozygous males to have normal testis growth and
    dimensions, whereas homozygous males are expected to show reduced testis growth and
    small testes at puberty due to a lack of germ cells. Example heterozygous and
15  homozygous NANOS2 edited males will undergo hemicastration and the testes examined
    cytologically. We expect heterozygous males to show normal testis structure with
    seminiferous tubules populated with Sertoli and germ cells, whereas homozygous males
    are expected to have a Sertoli cell-only morphology and the complete absence of
    germcells. Semen volume and composition will be examined following appropriate semen
20  collection (for example artificial vagina, gloved hand, electroejaculation). We expect
    heterozygous males to have normal semen volumes and sperm counts, whereas
    homozygous males are expected to show the complete absence of sperm cells.
    Transplantation of SSCs into the testes of homozygous NANOS2 edited males
25           SSCs will be harvested and propagated from appropriate donors, for example
    Duroc pigs, and SSCs injected into the rete testis of homozygous NANOS2 edited recipient
    males, for example Large White x Landrace crossbred pigs, at various ages. At puberty or
    at least three months after SSC transplantation, semen will be collected and examined for
    the presence of sperm cells. If sperm cells are present, we will determine sperm cell
30  concentration, morphology and motility. We will also determine that the sperm cells
    present are from the donor SSCs and not from the recipient, for example showing the
    presence of Duroc specific SNPs in the MClR gene for the pig example. We will
                                                  69

    determine the optimal recipient age of recipient pigs for maximum sperm cell production
    which should correlate with the efficiency of SSC colonization of the recipient testis.
    Breeding for the production of homozygous NANOS2 edited males as SSC recipients
 5          A supply of homozygous NANOS2 edited males can be produced by breeding
    homozygous NANOS2 edited females with heterozygous edited males. The cross will
    produce equal numbers of homozygous and heterozygous edited males and females.
    Homozygous edited males will be used as SSC recipients, homozygous females and
    heterozygous males will be used as replacement breeding animals to produce further
10  homozygous NANOS2 edited males as SSC recipients and heterozygous females will be
    culled.
    Example 5
    Generation of NANOS2 edited animals via Embryo injections
15          A candidate chimeric sgRNA targeting Exon-1 of porcine NANOS2 was designed
    based on the freely available software developed by Dr. Feng Zhang at MIT
    (crispr.mit.edu). The guide RNA used in the embryo injection studies is:
    GATCAGTCCCAACACCACCTGG (SEQ ID NO: 160). Both the CRISPR guide RNA
    sequence (SEQ ID NO: 160) and the CRISPR target sequence (SEQ ID NO: 161) within the
20  NANOS2 ORF (SEQ ID NOS:1 and 2) are shown in figure 13.
            The candidate CRISPR sgRNA alongside Cas9:GFP mRNA were in vitro
    transcribed using T7 mMessage Machine kit (Ambion), cleaned by Megaclear Kit
    (Ambion) and injected into in vivo fertilized porcine 1-cell embryos. A cohort of 12
    animals of 8-9 months of age were synchronized for estrus and used in the experiment.
25  Eight of the synchronized animals were bred to serve as embryo donors, whereas the
    remaining 4 animals were synchronized but not bred to serve as surrogates. Estrus was
    synchronized by feeding 5 ml of progesterone analog, Regumate (or Matrix) for 14 days.
    Twenty four hours (h) after last Regumate feeding, the animals were given a dose of
    PMSG (1200 IU, Sigma) subcutaneously, and the ovulation is induced 72 h later by
30  administration of HCG (1000 IU, Chorulon, Merck) subcutaneously. The donor animals
    (n=8) in standing heat were artificially inseminated with boar semen (provided by PIC
    Genetics). In vivo embryos from donor animals were recovered surgically 24 h after Al by
                                                  70

    retrograde flushing with sterile PVA TL-Hepes medium from the oviduct. The in vivo
    derived embryos were then injected with Cas9:GFP mRNA and sgRNA targeting
    NANOS2, and cultured in PZM3 medium 8 overnight. A day after microinjection, 30
    embryos were transferred surgically into the oviducts of each surrogate animal.
 5           For embryo transfers, donor and surrogate pigs were anesthetized by a mix of
    ketamine/ xylazine (6.6 mg/kg and 1-2 mg/kg IM) and placed on the back on a surgical
    table. Adequate depth of anesthesia was assessed by monitoring heart rate, temperature,
    full rhythmic respirations, constricted pupil, and reduced or absent palpebral reflex. The
    reproductive tract of anesthetized gilts were exposed via a midline abdominal incision.
10  Only the oviducts and tips of the uterus were exposed. In donors, embryos were retrograde
    flushed through the utero-tubal junction, and the embryos collected from ostium of
    oviduct. For embryo transfer into surrogates, a tom-cat catheter containing the embryos
    was placed through the infundibulum and the embryos deposited into the oviduct.
    Following three-layered closure of the incision using absorbable sutures (USP #3 body
15  wall, #3 fat, #1 sub-q), the animals were allowed to recover. Pregnancies were confirmed
    by lack of return to Estrus (21 days) and ultrasound at 28 days post embryo transfer. Our
    first embryo transfer trial has resulted in 3 out of 4 surrogate animals establishing
    pregnancy, and the birth of 18 edited piglets (Figure 14). All 18 piglets displayed either
    mono- or bi-allelic modifications for NANOS2, highlighting very high efficiencies of our
20  approach.
    Example 6
    Generation of NANOS2 edited animals via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)
             Porcine fetal fibroblasts (PFF) were established from fetuses recovered from D35
25  pregnant Duroc pigs. A candidate male and female PFF line were nucleofected with a
    CMV promoter driven Cas9:GFP plasmid (Addgene) and PCR fragment consisting of hU6
    promoter driven single-guide RNA targeting NANOS2 (SEQ ID NO: 162). One day after
    nucleofection, the nucleofected cells were sorted singly into each well of a 96-well plate.
    The cells were fed with irradiated fibroblast conditioned growth medium, and allowed to
30  form colonies. Following a week of culture, colonies begin to appear within the wells. The
    cells are clonally propagated, DNA extracted and screened for mutations using DNA
    sequencing. The cells are homozygous null for NANOS2 were cloned via somatic cell

    nuclear transfer to generate NANOS2 null male and female piglets. From these initial
    SCNT attempts, one surviving male, and three female piglets were generated, see figure
     15.

    Testicular phenotype of NANOS-2 editied animals
            At 3 months of age, the testes of two bi-allelic Nanos2 homozygous knockout
    piglets were biopsied and examined morphologically. Based on observations of cross
    sections from the biopsies using light microscopy (Fig. 16), the seminiferous cords are
10  intact and somatic support cells are present. Although some germ cells are still present in
    the homozygous knockout animals, the number appears to be severely reduced compared
    to what is typically observed in a wild-type animal at this age. Indeed, some of the cords
    in homozygous animals appear to be devoid of germ cells. Also, the nuclei of remaining
    germ cells in homozygous animals appeared to be picnotic which is indicative of apoptosis.
15  At 3 months of age, the seminiferous cords of wild-type pigs typically contain multiple
    layers of developing germ cells which is indicative of active spermatogenesis. None of the
    cords in Nanos2 knockout animal contain multiple layers of germ cells, strongly suggesting
    lack of an endogenous germline. Taken together, these observations suggest that the
    phenotype of Nanos2 loss-of-function is conserved in animals including loss of the male
20  germline during early development leading to a Sertoli-cell only phenotype. Studies with
    mice have demonstrated that males with this phenotype are excellent hosts for regeneration
    of a donor germline following transplantation of spermatogonia.
    Example 8
25  Transplantations with Nanos2 homozyogous knockout recipients
            At 4 months of age, two homozygous knockout piglets received transplantations of
    spermatogonia isolated from the testes of a 21 day old Duroc donor male piglet. Briefly,
    the donor cells were suspended in 1 ml volumes of injection media at 1.4 X 106 cells/ml
    and 600-900 ul of volume was infused into the seminiferous tubules via ultrasound guided
30  injection into the rete testis. One testis of each animal was transplanted with donor cells
    and the contralateral testis was left as a non-injected control.
