To the extent that any term recited in the claims at the end of this patent is referred to in this
patent in a manner consistent with a single meaning, that is done for sake of clarity only so as
to not confuse the reader, and it is not intended that such a claim term be limited, by
implication or otherwise, to that single meaning
[0022]           Referring now to FIG. 1, a front view of a track 10 for use in an electrified
equipment mounting system or similar track system is illustrated. While multiple tracks can
be used, only one track 10 will be described as multiple tracks of the same track system may
have the same or substantially the same features. Furthermore the size, shape, and/or
configuration of the track 10 can vary depending on the size of a surface for installation and
the equipment to be mounted to the track 10. The track 10 includes a backing plate 15 that
may have an elongated, rectangular shape (or any other suitable shape) and a plurality of
slots. In some embodiments, the plurality of slots may be three slots; a left slot 20, a center
slot 25, and a right slot 30 that are disposed along the backing plate, extend at any length
along the backing plate 15, and are adjacent to at least one of the plurality of slots. In other
words, the plurality of slots are substantially parallel to each other. Each slot 20, 25 and 30
may have a plurality of open regions 35 that are adjacent to a plurality of necked-down
regions 40. In some embodiments, the open regions 35 are symmetrical such that they are
spaced equidistant apart and are aligned in widthwise rows along the length of the backing
plate 15. As another example, the open regions 35 of one or more of the slots 20, 25 and 30
may not all be equidistant and/or may not be aligned in rows with the other open regions of
the other slots.

                                                 -6
[00231           The track 10 may have a plurality of electrical contacts 45 electrically coupled
to a power supply (not shown) and / or a data source or data sources (not shown). The
plurality of electrical contacts 45 may be substantially parallel to the plurality of slots and
may extend at any length along the backing plate 15. In some embodiments, the plurality of
electrical contacts may be electrically conductive strips or a plurality of pads 281 as shown in
FIG. 13. The plurality of electrical contacts 45 may all be electrically coupled to the power
source or they all may be electrically coupled to the data source or data sources.
Alternatively, the plurality of electrical contacts 45 may have a subset of electrical contacts
that are electrically coupled to a power source and a co-existing subset of electrical contacts
that are electrically coupled to a data source or data sources. Although the electrical contacts
45 are shown as substantially parallel to the plurality of slots 20, 25, and 30, it is understood
that other configurations are possible such as, for example, non-parallel orientations, plug
type contacts, etc.
[0024]           In FIG. 2, a side view of the track 10 is illustrated. The plurality of electrical
contacts 45 and the t-shape of the three slots (left slot 20, center slot 25, and the right slot 30)
are shown. In some embodiments, the plurality of electrical contacts 45 may be surface
mounted and not embedded as shown in FIG. 2. For example the plurality of electrical
contacts 45 may be extruded on or formed onto the track 10. The plurality of electrical
contacts 45 may have a cover 50 to insulate the plurality of electrical contacts 45. The cover
50 may be removably attached to the track 10. The cover 50 may be cut to insulate only that
portion of the plurality of electrical contacts 45 that are exposed to inadvertent contact. In
some embodiments, the track 10 may include a plurality of wire raceways 60 that are used to
manage and protect electrical conductors.
[0025]           FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the track 10 with the plurality of electrical
contacts 45. The plurality of wire raceways 60 may run the length of the track 10 or they
may be cut short or have cut-outs to allow at least one wire or an electrical conductor 175
(FIG. 9) to exit the wire raceway 60. In some embodiments, a plurality of raceway access
points 65 may be disposed in at least one of the plurality of slots to allow an electrical
conductor 175 to pass through the backing plate 15 and into one of the wire raceways 60. A
non-limited example is shown in FIG. 3 where raceway access points 65 are located in the

                                                 -7
center slot 25. For example, the raceway access points 65 may also be located in any of the
three slots to include the left slot 20 and/or the right slot 30.
[0026]           FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a mount 70 attached to a piece of equipment
75. The mount 70 has a mounting plate 80, a back surface 85, a front surface 90, and at least
one mounting stud 95. For example, the at least one mounting stud 95 may be four mounting
studs 95a, 95b, 95c, and 95d. The mount 70 may be operable to be removably connected
and/or attached to the track 10 as shown in FIG. 1 or a fixed position plate 250 (FIG. 13).
Each mounting stud 95a-d includes a respective stem portion 100a-d that extends outwardly
from the back surface 85 and a respective enlarged head portion 105a-d disposed at a distal
end of respective stem portions 100a-d. A release mechanism (not shown) with a locking pin
110, and at least one locking pin release may be used to prevent the mount 70 from moving
once secured to the track 10 or fixed position plate 250. For example, at least one locking pin
release may be a right locking pin release 115 and a left locking pin release 120. The locking
pin 110 may be disposed through the mounting plate 80, extending outwardly from the back
surface, and may be biased (e.g., by a spring, resilient material, or other biasing means)
outward towards an extended lock position for engaging the center slot 25 of the track 10 or
the corresponding locking pin opening (not shown, part of the fixed position plate). It should
be understood that the locking pin 110 may be located on the mount 70 to engage the right
slot 30 or the left slot 25 of the track 10. The locking pin 110 may be retracted using either
individually or in combination the right locking pin release 115 or the left locking pin release
120 which is operatively connected to the released mechanism (not shown). It should be
understood that both locking pin releases could be oriented in any direction in order to avoid
any obstructions, yet still allow the release of the mount 70 from the track 10 or the fixed
position plate. Furthermore, in some embodiments, two or more release levers may need to
be actuated in order to release the mounting plate 80 of the mount 70. Such an embodiment
may provide for additional security by preventing unwanted movement of the mounting plate
80 when one of the locking pin releases 115 or 120 is accidentally actuated. The front
surface 90 may have any device and/or piece of equipment 75 attached to it. In a non
limiting example, a plurality of equipment mounting locations 150 are shown around the
locking pin 110 and may be used to secure the piece of equipment 75 to the mount 70. The
plurality of equipment mounting locations 150 may be in any configuration to allow any
piece of equipment 75 to be secured to the mount 70.

                                                 -8
[00271           The mount 70 may have at least one electrical connector secured to the
mounting plate 80. In some embodiments, the electrical connector is at least one terminal
mount 140 disposed on the back surface 85. A plurality of electrical wipers 145 are coupled
to the terminal mount 140 and they may be electrically coupled to the piece of equipment 75
attached to the mount 70. In some embodiments, there are an equal amount of electrical
wipers 145 as electrical contacts 45 on the track 10. In another embodiment, the electrical
wipers may be pads that matedly couple with the pads of the plurality of electrical contacts 45
of the track 10.
[0028]           Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, the track 10 and the mount 70 provide an out-of-phase
configuration that is used to lock the mount 70 to the track 10. Referring to FIG. 5, when the
enlarged head portions 105a, 105b, 105c and 105d of the mounting studs 95a, 95b, 95c and 95d
of the mount 70 are inserted within the plurality of open regions 35a, 35b, 35c and 35d of the left
slot 20 and the right slot 30 respectively. The locking pin 110 is prevented from entering the
center slot 25 due to its alignment with the necked-down region 40e. In some embodiments,
placing the enlarged head portions 105a, 105b, 105c and 105d in the left slot 20 and the right slot
30 respectively, causes the locking pin 110 to retract from its outwardly biased, extended
position.
[0029]           Referring to FIG. 6, the stem portions 100 (not shown) of the mounting studs 95a,
95b, 95c and 95d are sized to slide through the necked-down region 40a, 40b, 40c, and 40d
respectively while the enlarged head portions 105a, 105b, 105c and 105d remain in the left slot
20 and the right slot 30 respectively. Movement of the mount 70 downwardly in the direction of
arrow 125 aligns the enlarged head portions 105a, 105b, 105c and 105d with necked-down
regions 40a, 40b, 40c, and 40d of the left slot 20 and the right slot 30 respectively and aligns the
locking pin 110 with the enlarged head opening 105e of the center slot 25. The width of the
locking pin 110 may be greater than the upper passageway 130 and the lower passageway 135
through the necked-down regions 40e and 40f adjacent the enlarged head opening 105e, which
prevents further movement of the mount 70 once the locking pin 110 passes through the enlarged
head opening 105e and into the center slot 25. In embodiments where the locking pin 110 is
biased toward its extended position, the locking pin 110 may snap into its extended position
automatically once the locking pin 110 is aligned with the enlarged head opening 105e. An
operator can retract the locking pin 110 out of the center slot 25 by actuating any of the locking

                                                     -9
pin releases 115 and/or 120 described above and again move the mount 70 along the track 10 to a
different elevation.
[0030]            While FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate a mount 70 being secured to the track 10 using four
mounting studs 95a, 95b, 95c and 95d and one locking pin 110, it should be appreciated that any
other number of mounting studs and locking pins may alternatively be employed. Such an
embodiment may allow for a secured connection under increased loads by providing more points
of contact between the mount 70 and the track 10. In another embodiment, the mount 70 may
incorporate eight mounting studs 95 evenly distributed about the mounting plate 80. In yet
another embodiment, any other number of mounting studs 95 may be disposed on the mounting
plate 80 that allows for a releasable connection with the track 10. The enlarged head portions
105 are sized to be received through the plurality of open regions 35 of the slots 20, 25 and 30
and may be captured behind necked-down regions 40, while the stem portions 100 are sized to
pass by the necked-down regions 40 of the slots 20, 25, and 30.
[0031]            FIG. 7 is a side view of the mount 70 and track 10 locked together as described in
FIGS. 5 and 6. The plurality of mounting studs 95 attached to the mount 70 are locked into the
three slots, 20, 25, and 30 of the track 10. A plurality of equipment fasteners 155 maybe used to
secure the piece of equipment 75 to the mounting plate 80 of the mount 70 via the plurality of
equipment mounting locations 150. The terminal mount 140 may be biased outwardly away
from the back surface 85. The biasing force ensures that the plurality of electrical wipers 145 are
electrically coupled to the plurality of electrical contacts 45. As shown, for example, the number
of electrical wipers 145 equals the number of electrical contacts 45. The plurality of electrical
wipers may have a subset of electrical wipers electrically coupled to a power source and a co-existing
subset of electrical wipers that are electrically coupled to a data source or data sources.
[0032]            FIG. 8 depicts the piece of equipment 75 attached to the track 10 using a
mount 70. The covers 50 are shown insulating the plurality of electrical contacts 45 (FIG. 1)
around the piece of equipment 75 resulting in only the plurality of electrical wipers 145 being
electrically coupled to the plurality of electrical contacts.
[0033]            FIG. 9 depicts a perspective view of an electrical adaptor 160. The electrical
adaptor 160 may be used to electrically couple the piece of equipment 75 (FIG. 4) to a power
source or a data source. A connector plate 165 serves as a base for the at least one mounting
stud 95 and a locking mechanism 180. The at least one mounting stud 95 may be secured to
the first side 161 of the connector plate 165. The locking mechanism 180 may be coupled to

                                                 -10
the second side 163 of the connector plate 165. The locking mechanism 180 has a handle 185
that is operatively coupled to an adaptor locking pin 205 (FIG. 11). The adaptor locking pin
205 may be disposed through the connector plate 165 and extends outwardly from the first
side 161. The locking mechanism 180 secures the electrical adaptor 160 to the track 10 or the
fixed position plate 250 (FIG. 11). The handle 185 is shown in the seated position in FIG. 9.
When the handle 185 is in the seated position, the adaptor locking pin 205 is in a locked
position or an extended position, i.e., the adaptor locking pin 205 extends outwardly from the
first side 161. When the handle 185 is moved to the unseated position, it moves the adaptor
locking pin 205 to an unlocked position or a retracted position, i.e., the adaptor locking pin
205 is flush with the first side 161. When the handle 185 is moved from the unseated to the
seated position, the adaptor locking pin 205 moves from the unlocked position (or retracted
position) to the locked position (or extended position). In alternative embodiments, the
handle 185 and/or the adaptor locking pin 205 may be biased to the seated position and/or the
locked position as set forth above using a biasing member, including but not limited to one or
more springs, resilient materials, combinations thereof, etc. As an example, the handle 185
may compress a spring to provide the biasing force needed to extend or retract the adaptor
locking pin. In other embodiments, the handle 185 may actuate a cam (not shown) that
extends or retracts the adaptor locking pin.
[0034]          The electrical conductor 175 electrically couples with a plurality of second
electrical terminals 170. The plurality of second electrical terminals 170 may be mounted on
the connector plate 165. In some embodiments, the plurality of second electrical terminals
may be located on a front face 190 of the electrical adaptor 160 in a second terminal housing
195. In some embodiments, the plurality of second electrical terminals 170 may protrude
from the front face 190 when the handle 185 is in the seated position and be recessed when
the handle 185 is in the unseated position.
[0035]           FIG. 10 illustrates the electrical adaptor 160 attached to the track 10 and
electrically coupled to the mount 70. The electrical connector may be a first terminal housing
200 coupled to the front surface 90 which includes a plurality of first electrical terminals (not
shown). The plurality of first electrical terminals and the plurality of second electrical
terminals 170 align and electrically couple when the electrical adaptor 160 is placed on the
track 10 and the handle 185 is in the seated position. For example, the first terminal housing

conductive rings or pads.
[0036]          FIG. 11 illustrates another embodiment of the electrical adaptor 160 where the
electrical conductor 175 uses the center slot 25 of the track 10 as shown in FIG. 1 as a
raceway to manage and secure the electrical conductor 175. The electrical conductor 175
protrudes from the first side 161 of the connector plate 165. It should be understood that the
electrical conductor 175 may protrude from the first side 161 in any location to allow the use
of any of the three slots 20, 25, or 30 as a raceway. There may also be more than one
electrical conductor 175 protruding from the first face 161. The adaptor locking pin 205 is
shown protruding from the first side 161 in the locked position or an extended position as
described in FIG. 9. The adaptor locking pin 205 serves a similar function to the locking pin
110 of the mount 70 as shown in FIG. 4. The electrical conductor 175 electrically couples
with the plurality of second electrical terminals 170.
[0037]          Referring now to FIG. 12, the electrical adaptor 160 with the electrical
conductor 175 using the center slot 25 as a raceway is shown. Comparing this figure to FIG.
10, the electrical conductor 175 is managed and secured with the center slot 25 or
alternatively the electrical conductor 175 may enter one of the plurality of raceway access
points 65 (FIG. 3) and use the plurality of wire raceways 60 to manage and secure the
electrical conductor 175. The plurality of first electrical terminals and the plurality of second
electrical terminals electrically couple a power source and / or data source to the piece of
equipment 75. When the electrical adaptor 160 is placed on the track 10 such that the first
terminal housing 200 and the second terminal housing 195 are aligned and the handle 185 is

                                                  -12
in the seated position, the plurality of first electrical terminals and the plurality of second
electrical terminals 170 align and electrically couple together. In some embodiments, the
plurality of first electrical terminals and the plurality of second electrical terminals may be a
set of male and female plugs or they may be a set of electrically conductive rings or pads.
[0038]           FIG. 13 is a perspective front view a fixed position plate 250, as an alternative to
the track 10. The fixed position plate 250 may be removably couple or attach to a mount 70 of
FIG. 4 or the electrical adaptor 160 of FIG. 9. The fixed position plate 250 may include any
suitable mounting structure or fastening device for securing it to a surface. Fastening devices
include but are not limited to screws, bolts, rivets, nails, adhesive, Velcro, weld, epoxy, or any
similar devices that mechanically joins or affixes two or more objects together. Mounting
structure includes but is not limited to a dove tail, hook and slot, tongue and groove, slideable
coupled members, pin and slot, or any similar devices. In this illustrative embodiment, the fixed
position plate 250 incorporates four mounting holes 255a-d, to secure the fixed position plate 250
to the surface. The fixed position plate 250 also includes slots in the form of keyhole slots 260,
265, 270, and 275, each with an enlarged head opening 280 and a necked-down portion 285. The
enlarged head opening 280 of the keyhole slots 260, 265, 270, and 275 are sized and arranged to
receive the enlarged head portions 105a, 105b, 105c, and 105d, of FIG. 4 therethrough and the
necked-down portions 285 are sized to allow the stem portions 100 of FIG. 4 to slide therein with
the enlarged head portions 105a, 105b, 105c, and 105d, captured within the necked-down
portions 285. A locking pin opening 290 may be provided that is sized to receive the locking pin
110 of FIG. 4 when the locking pin 110 is aligned with the locking pin opening 290.
[0039]           FIG. 14 depicts the track 10 with a plurality of target open regions 300 and non
target open regions 305. The left slot 20 and the right slot 30 may include the target open regions
300 to accommodate the mounting stud 95 of FIG. 4 or similar studs. In some embodiments, the
target open regions 300 allow the mount 70 with a piece of equipment attached to it to slideably
couple with the track 10 without the need for line of sight alignment of the mounting studs 95
with the open regions 35 of FIG. 1. The target open region 300 are larger in diameter and/or size
than the non-target open regions 305, which allows for more variability in the orientation of the
mount 70 to the track 10 and still enables the correct engagement between the track 10 and the
mount 70. The target open regions 300 would not change the alignment of the terminal mount
140 to the plurality of electrical contacts 45. In alternative embodiments (not shown), the track
10 may not include the non-target open regions 305. It may include only a certain number of the

                                                -13
target open regions 300 along tracks 20 and 30 and a neck down region running between the
certain number of target open regions 300.
[0040]          FIG. 15 depicts the track 10 with a plurality of lock holes 310. The center slot 25
as shown in FIG. 14 may be replaced with the plurality of lock holes 310 to allow the locking pin
110 of FIG. 4 to slideably couple an individual lock hole 310 to secure the mount 70 to the track
10. In some embodiments, the left slot 20 and the right slot 30 may have the plurality of target
open regions 300, and non-target open regions 305 but they are not required. The alignment of
the terminal mount 140 to the plurality of electrical contacts 45 would not change.
[0041]          FIG. 16 depicts the track 10 without a center slot 25 as shown in FIG. 14. The left
slot 20 and the right slot 30 may have the plurality of target regions 300 and the non-target open
regions 305 but they are not required. A flat surface 315 allows for the locking pin 110 of FIG. 4
to apply a biasing force to an even surface to create an interference fit between the mounting
studs 95 and the necked-down regions 40 of the left slot 20 and the right slot 30. The biasing
force exerts a force to separate the mount 70 from the track 10. The interference fit or friction fit,
is a fastening device that fastens two parts by friction after the parts are pushed together. The
alignment of the terminal mount 140 to the plurality of electrical contacts 45 would not change.
