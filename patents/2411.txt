                                  TECHNICAL FIELD
            This disclosure relates to systems for tracking consumer interactions
    with retail products on merchandising fixtures in real time.
15                                  BACKGROUND
            Consumer packaged goods (CPG) retailers and manufacturers are
    under continuous pressure to improve operational efficiencies, given intense
    competition, smaller profit margins and ever-increasing operational costs.
    Manufacturers and retailers work with a fixed amount of retail space and
20  seek to maximize the productivity of that space in order to maximize
    revenues while controlling costs. Retailers seek to maximize overall
    revenues through optimal placement of top-performing existing store
    keeping units (SKUs), proper placement of new SKUs and elimination of less
    productive SKUs. This usually places a high demand on available shelf
25  space and creates significant competition for shelf space in CPG retail
    stores. Both retailers and manufacturers commit significant data gathering
    and analysis to optimizing the productivity of that space.
            Currently, CPG manufacturers and retailers use various product
    tracking techniques, including collecting scanner data from the systems of
30  the retailers, and data consolidated by vendors such as Nielsen@ or
     Information Resources, Inc. (IRI@).    There are two limitations to using just
                                           -1-

 WO 2014/107457                                                    PCT/US2013/078509
     scanner data, namely, (1) aggregation and (2) time. In terms of aggregation,
     scanner data is usually available at store level or at a national chain level
     (e.g., Kroger@, and Safeway@).      In terms of time, data is typically available
     daily, weekly, or monthly. Because of these two limitations, testing of new
 5   products or merchandising arrangements must be done across a large
     number of stores and over a long period of time (e.g., weeks or months) to
     accurately detect the effect of the change. These limitations incur significant
     costs (e.g., typically testing of a new product or new merchandising
     arrangement requires 20+ stores over 2-3 months for any given "cell" in a
10  test) and limit the number of experimental cells that can be executed.
     Hence, many valuable experiments that could be conducted are precluded
     by cost considerations, slowing the overall learning process by retailers and
     manufacturers and resulting in inefficient use of space.
            Therefore, a need exists to address the problems noted above and
15   other problems previously experienced.
                                       SUMMARY

 WO 2014/107457                                                   PCT/US2013/078509
                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
              This disclosure relates to systems for tracking consumer interactions
     with retail products on merchandising fixtures in real time.
              Described herein are novel applications of infrared and other types of
 5    sensors to study consumer interactions that produce the following benefits:
     versatile to track interactions with a broad range of package types and
      merchandising configuration; detection of items that do not have significant
     weight (e.g. financial services leaflets, phone cards, etc...); produce
     consistent and reproducible readings; accurately detect real interactions and
10   avoid false positives induced by either people or store environment; do not
     require adulteration of product (for example as with RFID sensing); small
     form factor hardware allowing for rapid and discrete installation; high
     reliability and extended service life; and low cost equipment.
              Also, described herein is an example consumer tracking system
15   (CTS), such as an on-shelf tracking (OST) system, using reflected energy
     sensors to monitor shopper interactions with product in an inventory zone. In
     these arrangements the reflection of energy on a shopper's hand, arm, or
     product item may be detected. Direct contact with the sensor may not be
     required, promoting extended service life. While the description below refers
20   to infrared energy, it should be noted that any form of energy capable of
     being reflected and detected (for example ultrasonic) may be used.
             Also, the CTS can track consumer activity with respect to individual
     retail product units from a retail carton, while the retail carton may be
     positioned on an array of sensors mounted on or in close proximity to a retail
25   display shelf of a merchandising fixture. The CTS's various product sensors
     provide a way to determine when a consumer interacts with a retail product
     unit positioned on a retail shelf, a description of the interaction, and stores
     information about the interaction as an event in an event log for later
     retrieval and analysis. The retail product unit may be the smallest increment
30   of retail product offered by a retailer for purchase (e.g., a single pack of
     Wrigley@ Five Rain gum, 15 sticks). The retail carton, also referred to as a
     product container, may contain retail product units in a standard number and
     configuration (e.g., 10ct box of Wrigley@ Five Rain gum). Multiple retail
                                             -6-

 WO 2014/107457                                                     PCT/US2013/078509
      cartons containing the same product may be grouped together into an
      inventory zone. The merchandising fixture may display retail products to
      consumers in an appealing fashion. Example merchandising fixtures include
      a checkout shelf, a peg hook, an aisle shelf, and a temporary cardboard
 5   display.
              Infrared reflectance sensors may be used to monitor shopper
      interactions with products in an inventory zone. In these arrangements the
      reflection of infrared energy on the shoppers hand, arm, or product item may
     be detected. In these arrangements, there is no direct contact between the
10   sensor and either product of the shopper, thus promoting extended service
     life.
              The system can be better understood with reference to the following
     drawings and description. The elements in the figures are not necessarily to
     scale, emphasis instead being placed upon illustrating the principles of the
15   system.      In the figures, like-referenced numerals designate corresponding
     parts throughout the different views.
              Figure 1A illustrates detection of an object by a diffuse beam of
     infrared energy. A transmitter 101 creates a diffuse beam of infrared energy
     102, which illuminates any foreign object 103 entering the inventory zone. A
20   portion of the infrared energy is reflected as a reflected beam 104 which is
     then detected by a receiver 105. A suitable device may include the Vishay
     TCRT5000 reflective sensor which includes both a transmitter and detector.
     The distance of the object 103 from transmitter 101 may be estimated from
     the strength of the reflected signal, closer objects producing a stronger
25   reflection and vice versa.
              Figure 1B illustrates detection of an object by infrared triangulation. A
     transmitter 106 produces a narrow beam 107 at an angle 108 less than 90
     degrees. In the case of a nearby object 109 crossing the path of the beam,
     energy is reflected to a detection array 110, illuminating a portion of the
30   detection array 111. In the case of a more distant object 112, energy is
     reflected to a different portion of the detection array 113. The distance of the
     detected object from the transmitter can be accurately estimated by the
     position at which the detection array is illuminated. A suitable device for this
                                              -7-

 WO 2014/107457                                                    PCT/US2013/078509
     purpose may include the Sharp GP2D12OXJOOF, which includes both a
     transmitter and a detection array in a single device.
             In some     embodiments     reflectance sensors     may     be mounted
     immediately in front of the product so as to create a partial or full curtain.
 5           For example, Figure 2A shows sensors projecting a detection zone
     vertically. An array of sensors 201 may illuminate the area in front of and
     above a number of product inventory zones 202. When an object 203 enters
     the illuminated area, energy is reflected to the nearest of receivers 201,
     allowing identification of which item the shopper interacted with.           Either
10   reflectance or triangulation sensors may be used for this purpose.
             In some embodiments it may be desirable to have more than one
     sensor per inventory zone, for example, in situations with inventory zones
     broader than the operative range of one sensor, or to provide redundancy.
             Figure 2B shows two different arrangements where single sensors
15   204 may be assigned to inventory zones and also where multiple sensors
     205 may be assigned to each inventory zone.
     [018] Figure 2C shows an arrangement where sensors on moveable
     mounts 206 may be repositioned to align with the center of each inventory
     zone 207.
20           Figure 2D shows two possible arrangements for sensors. Sensors
     may be mounted at the bottom of the detection zone 208 offering the
     advantage of closest possible proximity to product and strongest signal
     changes. Alternatively sensors may be mounted at the top of the detection
     zone 209 having the advantage of discreteness, making sensors less prone
25   to dust collection and other fouling. Either arrangement 208 or 209 may be
     used individually or both arrangements may be used at the same time.
             Figure 2E shows an arrangement where sensors may be mounted on
     a flexible circuit strip. Reflectance sensors 210 may be mounted in fixed
     positions at regular intervals on a flexible strip 211. The strip may be a
30   millimeter or less in thickness offering the advantage of very low form factor.
     The strip may be backed with adhesive 212 to allow simple mounting onto a
     shelf. Each strip may have traces 213 of a conductive material transmitting
     power to the sensors and signals from the sensors to an electromagnetic
                                             -8-

 WO 2014/107457                                                    PCT/US2013/078509
      signal processor. Further each strip may be cut to length at any location 214
      between sensors to fit any desired shelf width. Such strips may be mounted
      in at least 2 different configurations:
              Figure 2F shows a flexible circuit strip mounted on top of a shelf lip. A
 5   flexible circuit strip 215 may be mounted on top of a shelf lip 216. The strip
     215 may be connected to an electromagnetic signal processor 217.
              Figure 2G shows a flexible circuit strip mounted below a shelf. A
     flexible circuit strip 218 may be mounted below a shelf 219. Sensors project
     a detection zone downwards so as to detect shopper activity on the shelf
10   immediately below shelf 220.
              Figure 2H shows a further arrangement where sensors may be
     mounted on a flexible circuit strip with their beams oriented parallel to the
     plane of the strip. Reflectance sensors 221 may be mounted in fixed
     positions at regular intervals on a flexible strip 222. Sensor legs may be bent
15   at an angle 223 so as to allow projection and detection of infra-red energy
     parallel to the plane of the strip. Sensors may be adhesive backed 224.
              Figure 21 shows a sensor strip in this arrangement 225 installed inside
     a shelf lip 226 between the shelf lip and product containers 227.
              In some embodiments, such as those illustrated by Figure 3, sensors
20   may be mounted on shelf dividers at an angle to the vertical, creating
     overlapping detection zones with two or more sensors covering a specific
     inventory zone. Reflectance sensors 301 may be mounted on shelf dividers
     302 so as to project and detect energy at an angle to the vertical. Shelf
     dividers 302 serve to separate inventory zones containing different products
25   303 and also secure the sensors 301 in a fixed position and angle relative to
     the product in order to ensure repeatable measurements. Since any pickup
     will occur in the field of view of at least two sensors, the exact location of a
     pickup may be pinpointed by comparing the relative strength of signals
     reflected to each sensor.
30            Alternatively, sensors may be mounted behind product to create a
     detection zone above the inventory zone as shown in Figure 4. Reflectance
     sensors 401 may be mounted above and behind a number of product
     inventory zones 402. This mounting position confers discreteness as
                                              -9-

     sensors are out of normal shopper field of view and also robustness as
     sensors are unlikely to be touched by shoppers.
             Figure 5A shows an arrangement where reflectance sensors are used
     to detect the removal of planar objects. One or more sensors 501 may be
 5   mounted at the opening of an inventory zone 502 containing planar objects
     503 such as magazines, leaflets, phone cards or any other planar item.
     Sensor 501 is oriented such that its beam 504 crosses the path of the stored
     objects 504. In Figure 5B, when one of the objects 505 is removed from
     inventory zone 502, the infrared beam is reflected 506, allowing detection of
10   activity.
             Figure 6A shows an arrangement where reflectance sensors are used
     to detect and the removal of planar objects from multiple banks of storage
     locations and also identify the storage location. One or more sensors 601
     may be mounted at the opening of several inventory zones 602, 603 and
15   604, positioned one in front of the other and containing different products
     605, 606 and 607. When any of these items are removed from their
     inventory zones, the item will traverse the infrared beam.
             In Figure 6B, the most distant item 605 from the sensor is being
     removed, producing a reflected beam 608. In Figure 6C, the closest item
20   607 to the sensor is being removed, producing a different reflected beam
     609. The intensity of the measured reflection 609 will be consistently greater
     than that of reflection 608, so allowing accurate identification of the storage
     location from which the item was removed.
             In some embodiments, sensors may be mounted laterally to a shelf to
25   measure the distance of a pickup from one side of shelf. This arrangement
     has the advantage of monitoring a relatively large number of facings with a
     small number of sensors and minimal wiring, thus simplifying the networking
     and processing electronics.
             For example, Figure 7A shows an arrangement where a single
30   triangulation sensor 701 is mounted at the side of a shelf 702 with the beam
     703 projecting across the front of a set of inventory zones 704. On entry of
     an object 705 such as a shopper's hand into an inventory zone, the sensor
     701 may identify the entry of the object and also measure the distance 706
                                           -10-

 WO 2014/107457                                                     PCT/US2013/078509
      of the object from the sensor. By processing the measured distance, the
      inventory zone from which product was handled may be identified.
             Figure 7B shows a further arrangement where triangulation sensors
      707 and 708 are used to produce two independent measurements 709 and
 5    710 of the point of an object 705 entering a set of inventory zones. By
      analyzing the distance readings 709 and 710, greater accuracy and/or
      redundancy can be achieved in identifying the position of object 705, as well
     as an estimate of the size of the object since opposite edges of object 705
     are measured.
10           In some embodiments, the sensors may be combined with an
     ambient lighting correction system to isolate the light being -reflected from
     infrared transmitters. Infrared detectors will typically respond to some portion
     of ambient lighting and this could create false positive events, for example,
     by passers by moving in front of unit. By taking readings alternating with
15   emitter subsequently on and off, it may be possible to correct for such
     events.
             In some embodiments, the sensors may be combined with a weight
     sensing system.
             For example, Figure 8 shows reflectance sensors 801 mounted at an
20   angle to the vertical on dividers 802. The same dividers also support weight
     sensors 803 which measure the weight of boxes of product 804 in real time.
     By combining these signals it is possible to further confirm the nature of
     shopper interactions, for example, whether items were picked up, put back,
     rearranged, restocked, and/or fully removed. The further use of weight data
25   also reduces possibility of false positives as noted above from ambient
     lighting. By adding the optical system to a weight based system it is possible
     to overcome sensitivity to vibrations inherent in weight sensing systems. The
     net result is a system suitable for high vibration environments and also with
     variations in ambient lighting.
30           In some embodiments, sensors may be installed to survey the area in
     front of a peg hook.
             For example, Figure 9A shows an item of product 901 suspended on
     a peg hook 902. Figure 9B shows a reflectance sensor 903 mounted above
                                           -11-

 WO 2014/107457                                                    PCT/US2013/078509
      and in front of the peg hook. Figure 9C shows item 901 being removed from
      peg hook 902 and reflecting the beam from sensor 903, so allowing
      detection of the item's removal.
             In some embodiments, sensors may be installed to measure removal
 5    of items such as bottles that may be typically stored in a cell array.
             For example, Figure 1OA shows an item 1001 stored in a cell array
      1002 In Figure 10B an infrared sensor 1003 may be installed within the cell
     array 1002 - when items are present the beam is reflected. Figure 10c
     shows item 1001 being removed from the cell array - as the bottom of item
10    is removed; the beam from sensor 1003 will no longer be reflected, allowing
     detection of the removal.
             In some embodiments, sensors may be installed to survey the area in
     front of items (for example, bottles) that may be mounted on a track where
     product items are pushed forward to the front of the shelf by gravity or by
15   spring loading.
             For example, in Figure 11A, a reflectance sensor 1101 is installed in
     front of a push-forward track 1102 on which items 1103, 1104 and 1105 are
     mounted. In Figure 11B, item 1103 is being removed from the track,
     breaking the beam of sensor 1101. As item 1103 is removed, items 1104,
20   1105 and any subsequent items are advanced on track 1102 either by
     gravity or spring loading.
             In Figure 11, shown is example alternative reflectance sensor 1106
     that is mounted in front of and above track 1102 so that its beam is normally
     clear. In Figure 11D, when an object 1103 is removed from the track, the
25   sensor beam is reflected allowing detection of the activity.
             In Figure 11E an alternative reflectance sensor 1107 is mounted
     inside track 1102 so that its beam is normally reflected. In Figure 11F when
     an object 1103 is removed from the track, the sensor beam is temporarily
     clear, producing a more distant reflection on object 1104, so allowing
30   detection of the activity. Note that this particular sensor positioning could
     also be achieved with the sensor positioned on the base of the track so as to
     reflect off the bottom of container 1103. This could also be achieved with a
     micro switch.
                                          -12-

 WO 2014/107457                                                PCT/US2013/078509
             In some embodiments, sensors may be installed to detect items that
     may be merchandised in drawers. In Figure 12A sensor 1201 may be
     installed inside a drawer 1202 housing multiple items of product 1203 and
     1204 and secured inside a merchandising unit 1205. When the drawer is
 5   closed, the beam is reflected. In Figure 12B, drawer 1202 has been opened
     to allow removal of product 1204. The reflection of the beam from sensor
     1204 is more distant and magnitude of reflection is reduced, allowing
     detection of the drawer opening. By measuring the reflection magnitude, the
     distance to which the drawer was opened may be computed, which in some
10   cases can be used to identify what position product was removed from the
     drawer.
             In some embodiments, infrared sensors may be installed to gather
     information on other shopper activities in store.
             For example, in the arrangement shown in Figure 13A reflectance
15   sensors 1301 and 1302 may be positioned such that their beams cross the
     path of a cash drawer 1303 on a cash register 1304. When the drawer is
     closed, the beams are not reflected. In Figure 13B case drawer 1303 is
     open, obscuring the beams of sensor 1301 and 1302 and allowing detection
     of a transaction event. Either sensor position 1302 and/or 1301 may be
20   used.
             In the arrangement shown in Figure 14A reflectance sensors 1401
     and 1402 may be positioned such that their beams cross the motion path of
     credit card reader 1401. In Figure 14B, credit cards 1404 and 1405 have
     been introduced into the credit card reader, obscuring the beams of sensors
25   1401 and 1402 and allowing detection of a transaction event.
             In the arrangement shown in Figure 15A reflectance sensor 1501 may
     be positioned such that its beam crosses the motion path of a paper strip
     1502 in a receipt printer 1503. In Figure 15B, when paper strip 1502
     advances, the sensor beam is reflected, allowing detection of a transaction
30   event. In Figure 15C, multiple sensors 1504 and 1503 are positioned with
     beams crossing the paper path. In the example shown, sufficient paper has
     advanced to obscure sensors 1504 and 1505 but not 1506. By comparing
     which sensors are obscured vs. not, it is possible to measure the amount of
                                           -13-

 WO 2014/107457                                                    PCT/US2013/078509
     paper removed which will give some indication of size of transaction.
