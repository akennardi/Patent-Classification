             Nifedipine drug intermediates o-nitrobenzaldehyde synthesis method
         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention relates to a method for preparing a pharmaceutical
 5 intermediate which belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates
   to nifedipine drug intermediates o-nitrobenzaldehyde synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         As pharmaceutical intermediates, o-nitrobenzaldehyde is mainly used in the
10 production of drugs nifedipine. Nifedipine is used to prevent and treat angina pectoris,
   especially angina pectoris caused by variant angina and coronary artery spasm. The
   respiratory function is not adversely affected, it is suitable for patients with angina
   pectoris with airway obstruction, the effect is better than    P receptor antagonist. It also
   used for all types of hypertension, refractory, it also have a good effect on severe high
15 blood pressure. Due to the ability of lowering postload, it also has a good effect on
   refractory congestive heart failure, it is suitable for long-term use. Nifedipine has a role
   in inhibiting Ca2+ influx, it can relaxs the vascular smooth muscle, dilates the coronary
   artery, increases the coronary blood flow, improves myocardial tolerance to ischemia,
   while expanding the surrounding arteries, reduces peripheral vascular resistance, so
20 that blood pressure declines. Small doses of expansion on coronary artery do not affect
   blood pressure, it is a better anti-angina drugs. For antihypertensive drugs, there is no
   water and sodium retention and edema and other adverse reactions caused by general
   vasodilator. Oral absorption is good, 10 minutes comes into effect, 1~2 hours reaches
   the maximum effect, thegunction can maintains for 6~7 hours. Sublingual effect is
25 faster than oral administration. Spray administration for 10 minutes comes to
   antihypertensive effect, the most significant effect appears after 1 hour, about 3 hours
   the blood pressure rise. Intravenous injection within 10 minutes can reduces blood
   pressure 21%-26%. O-nitrobenzaldehyde             as a pharmaceutical      intermediates of
   nifedipine, its synthesis method of great significance. However, most of the existing
30 synthetic methods are using the method that derived by nitration and oxidation

                                                   2
   o-nitrotoluene, it is complicated and the final yield is not very high. Therefore, it is
   necessary to propose a new synthetic method for further improving the quality and
   yield of the product and reducing the byproduct content, it has important economic
   significance.
