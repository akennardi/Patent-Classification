ELECTRICAL PLUG LOCK OUT DEVICE
Industrial electrical plug lock out device which is used for isolating motors and other electrical
devices/equipment. The canister provides engineered mechanical protection and secure mechanical
lock out, which provides an obvious indication that the device/equipment is isolated.
DESCRIPTION
Round cylinder which can be made from multiple materials such as plastic, aluminium, mild steel or
stainless steel. Contains a flat bar at the bottom of the cylinder, preventing the plug from falling
through, but allows debris and moisture to escape safely. Once plug has been fitted into the
cylinder, the pin at the top provides an engineered mechanical lock out (mechanical pin secured by
welded safety chain, so cannot be removed) which is fitted through the top of the device. Then a
personal lock is fitted to the pin, preventing the plug from being removed from the cannister until by
any person other than that who fitted their personal lock.
Can also be fabricated to include a weather lid/cover to prevent debris or washdown liquids from
entering pumps while in isolation.
Item can be made to suit all sized isolation plugs.

CLAIMS
This device ensures that accidental re-energisation is not possible and removes any doubt as to
whether the device is isolated or not.
This device has the potential to save lives, and reduce injury caused by incorrect isolations.
Eliminates the need for a licensed electrician to attend, disconnect, and reconnect. Potentially saving
companies hundreds of thousands of dollars in labour costs & contractor costs.
Ideally to be painted safety yellow, for easy identification on site. This will improve site safety
standards and greatly reduce the consumables that are used currently, for isolations. Current
practice is to tie off with plastic bags around the removed device.
