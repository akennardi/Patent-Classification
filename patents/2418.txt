             2015252983, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                                            FIELD
       [0002]               This present disclosure relates generally to implantable medical devices,
             and more specifically, to implantable devices for connecting tissue layers to
             create an anastomosis.
                                                     BACKGROUND
      [0003]                An anastomosis is a cross-connection between two tissue structures, such
             as blood vessels or intestines. For example, in the context of coronary artery
             bypass graft surgery, a graft vessel is anastomosed to a native coronary artery so
             that blood can flow through the graft vessel.
      [0004]                Anastomoses can be created in various manners including, but not limited
             to: end-to-end, end-to-side, and side-to-side anastomoses. Often, suturing is
             used to create such anastomoses.
                                                       SUMMARY

                                              DETAILED DESCRIPTION
       [00025]              Persons skilled in the art will readily appreciate that various aspects of the
             present disclosure can be realized by any number of methods and apparatus
             configured to perform the intended functions. It should also be noted that the
             accompanying drawing figures referred to herein are not necessarily drawn to
             scale, but may be exaggerated to illustrate various aspects of the present
             disclosure, and in that regard, the drawing figures should not be construed as
             limiting.
       [00026]              The present invention is directed to implantable devices for connecting
             tissue layers, for example, to circumvent a conduit or organ blockage, such as by
             creating a direct passage between tissue structures (e.g. connecting a
             gallbladder and a portion of a gastrointestinal tract) to create an anastomosis that
             facilitates material flow therebetween. The devices described herein may be
             endoscopically deployable or deliverable via a catheter and may include self
             expanding apposition mechanisms that facilitate a secure connection between
             the tissue structures (such a connection may also be referred to herein as a
             "shunt," "passageway," "shunt passageway," or "tunnel"). Such design features
             simplify implantation and reduce the likelihood of complications.             In some
             embodiments, the devices provided herein are configured to be removable after
             implantation. As one example, the device is implanted and remains in place until
             the gallbladder and/or its associated ducts are cleared of blockages, after which
             the device is removed. In another example, the device remains implanted until
             the body grows a tissue-anastomosis around the device, and then the device is
             removed. In other embodiments, tissue ingrowth into and/or around the device
             permanently implants the device, and the device is not removed. The devices
             described herein can provide alternative treatments for patients who are not
             suitable candidates for other types of treatments (e.g., gallbladder removal
             surgery) and/or to avoid known complications of other types of treatments (e.g.,
             external biliary drainage).
                                                             7
9790036_1 (GHMatters) P104123.AU.1

       [00027]              The present disclosure refers to anastomosis devices in an exemplary
             fashion. That is, it should be understood that the inventive concepts disclosed in
             this document can also be applied to other types of devices. For example, this
             disclosure also provides implantable devices that, in some embodiments, can be
             used for occluding tissue structures, organs, body conduits, blood vessels, the GI
             tract, and the like. For example, in some embodiments the devices provided
             herein can be used to occlude septal defects. In some embodiments, the
             devices provided herein can be used to occlude a patient's vasculature or GI
             tract. In some such embodiments, the device does not include a tunnel through
             the device. Rather, in some embodiments a covering material seals the device to
             inhibit, modulate, or substantially prevent material from flowing through the
             device.
      [00028]               Referring to FIG. 1, an exemplary anastomosis device 40 in accordance
             with some embodiments provided herein can be implanted in a patient to create a
             fluidic connection between two organs, spaces, tissue structures, conduits, and
             the like, and combinations thereof. For example, in the depicted implementation
             the anastomosis device 40 is connecting a gall bladder 10 (that defines an
             internal gall bladder space 12) with an intestine 20 (that defines an internal
             intestinal space 22). Hence, the anastomosis device 40 is acting as a fluidic
             shunt device between the internal gall bladder space 12 and the internal
             intestinal space 22. Such an implementation may provide a beneficial treatment
             to the patient when, for example, a flow blockage exists in the native anatomical
             conduits connecting the internal gall bladder space 12 and the internal intestinal
             space 22. For example, in some instances the patient may have one or more
             gallstones that cause a blockage of the patient's cystic duct 14 and/or common
             bile duct 16. In such a case, the anastomosis device 40 can provide a fluidic
             passageway such that bile from the gall bladder 10 can flow into the intestine 20.
             If not for the anastomosis device 40, when bile is blocked from flowing out of the
             gall bladder 10 cholecystitis (inflammation of the gall bladder 10) may result.

       [00029]              While the anastomosis devices provided herein can be used in some
             implementations to relieve or prevent cholecystitis as described above, it should
             be understood that the anastomosis devices provided herein can also be used in
             many other types of implementations within a patient. For example, the
             anastomosis devices provided herein can be used in conjunction with various
             body tissue structures and organs such as, but not limited to, stomachs, colons,
             small intestines, pancreases, blood vessels, bladders, kidneys, conduits, and the
             like.
       [00030]              In general, some embodiments of the anastomosis devices provided
             herein (of which anastomosis device 40 is one example), include a first tissue
             flange portion 42a, a second tissue flange portion 42b, and a barrel portion 44
             therebetween. The barrel portion 44 defines a lumen 46 that extends
             longitudinally from a first end of the anastomosis device 40 to a second end of
             the device 40. The lumen 46 acts as a connection (e.g., a shunt passageway)
             between the internal gall bladder space 12 and the internal intestinal space 22,
             such that the internal gall bladder space 12 is in fluid communication with the
             internal intestinal space 22 via the anastomosis device 40.
       [00031]              Referring to FIG. 2, an anastomosis device 300 is shown having a barrel
             portion 306 or central portion that can be interchangeable with any barrel portion
             described here, a first flange portion 302, and a second flange portion 304. In
             some embodiments, the framework of device 300 or any portion thereof can
             comprise elongate elements such as a spring wire (e.g., L605 steel or stainless
             steels), shape memory alloy wire (e.g., nitinol or nitinol alloys), super-elastic alloy
             wire (e.g., nitinol or nitinol alloys), other suitable types of wire, or combinations
             thereof. In the depicted embodiment of device 300, the framework is comprised
             of an elongate element that is formed by winding, for example. In some
             embodiments, different types of wires are used at different locations of the device
             300. Alternatively, device 300 or portions thereof can be formed from the same
                                                          9

             piece of precursor material that is cut to create the elongate element framework
             structure as desired. In some embodiments, device 300 can be formed from a
             combination of one or more wound wires and one or more cut material portions.
             In some embodiments, the device 300 or portions thereof may be constructed of
             polymeric materials. The device 300 is shown with the covering material 212, as
             described herein.
       [00032]              The first flange portion 302 and the second flange portion 304 are
             configured to engage one or more layers of tissue therebetween, and to provide
             apposition forces against the tissue surfaces. The apposition forces provided by
             the first and second flange portions 302 and 304 can facilitate attachment of the
             device 300 to the tissue and provide displacement resistance such that the
             device 300 can reliably remain positioned at a target site in a patient as desired.
       [00033]              The first flange portion 302 and the second flange portion 304 (also
             referred to herein as apposition portions, flanges, etc.) can each include one or
             more flange members 308 and 310 (also referred to herein as anchor members,
             apposition members, fins, etc.). The flange members 308 and 310 can have a
             variety of different configurations (e.g., lengths, widths, shapes, angles, etc.). In
             some embodiments two or more flange members have the same configurations.
             In some embodiments, each of the flange members has the same configuration.
       [00034]              The anastomosis device 300 can be configured in a collapsed low-profile
             delivery configuration in which the framework is diametrically compressed and
             longitudinally extended such that the flange members 308 and 310 extend
             substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the device 300. In the deployed or
             expanded configuration, the flange members 308 and 310 extend from the barrel
             portion 306. The device 300 may exhibit, for example, beneficial fatigue
             resistance and elastic properties. In some embodiments, the materials of the
             device 300 allow the anastomosis devices to be elastically crushed, folded,
             and/or collapsed into a low-profile configuration for containment within a lumen
                                                           10
9790036_1 (GHMatters) P104123.AU.1

             for transcatheter or endoscopic/thorascopic delivery, and to self-expand to an
             operative size and configuration once positioned at a desired target site within a
             body and deployed from the lumen.
       [00035]              In some embodiments, the length of the flange members 308 and 310 are
             different in relation to each other to provide both sufficient apposition forces at
             the base or hole where access is created and migration resistance forces. For
             example, flange member 308 shown is generally longer than flange member 310.
             This configuration facilitates a fast and sustainable apposition of tissue to form an
             anastomosis. In some embodiments, the flange members 308 and 310 of
             varying lengths are alternated, are staggered, or are nested along the
             circumferential axis. In some embodiments, the flange members 308 and 310
             within each flange portion 302 and/or 304 are uniform in length.
       [00036]              In some embodiments, the lengths of the flange members 308 and 310
             are selected based on the size of tissue structures into which the device 300 is to
             be implanted. For example, if a first body conduit generally includes a smaller
             geometry than the second body conduit, differing flange lengths can be
             advantageous. In this example, the flange portion entering the smaller body
             conduit includes the flanges having a shorter length, while the longer flanges
             remain in the larger body conduit. The shorter flange length provides an
             appropriate fit for the smaller body conduit thus ensuring sufficient contact
             necessary for an anastomosis device, while the longer flanges provide anti
             migratory forces that help to retain the device in place. In some embodiments,
             the short and long flanges are staggered, nested, or separated based on the
             flange portion.
       [00037]              The anastomosis device 300 (and other embodiments that share design
             features of the anastomosis device 300) can exhibit the following advantages.
             Having dissimilar lengths of flange members 308 and 310 can provide apposition
             at various target locations or zones. Having one or more such specific apposition
                                                       11
9790036_1 (GHMatters) P104123.AU.1

             zones may minimize or eliminate leakage of fluid or other contents that pass
             through the device lumen. Discrete flange members 308 and 310 designs that
             move independently of each other leads to better tissue/fin conformability with
             tissue topography. Better conformability can minimize tissue injury especially
             when used in a diseased tissue bed. The flexible discrete design of the flange
             members 308 and 310 can facilitate device 300 removal by folding the flange
             members 308 and 310 parallel to the lumen of the device 300. This flexibility of
             the flange members 308 and 310 design can reduce or minimize tissue injury
             during device removal. Multiple flange members 308 and 310 and short non
             overlapping sinusoidal struts on the barrel portion 306 make the device 300
             conformable. This conformability helps in easy tracking of the catheter through
             an endoscope working channel. While providing longitudinal conformability, the
             short sinusoidal pattern provides adequate radial strength to prevent radial
             compression of the device 300 by external tissue forces.
       [00038]              The anastomosis device 300 can be formed of one or more elongate
             members, such as wires in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the
             anastomosis device 300 can include multiple separate elongate members. For
             example, the anastomosis device 300 is illustrated in FIG. 2 as including
             elongate members 312, 314, 316, 318, and 320. The elongate members 312
             and 314 can form part of the first flange portion 302, with the elongate member
             312 forming the flange members 308 of the first flange portion 302 and the
             elongate member 314 forming the flange member 310 of the first flange portion
             302. The elongate member 316 can form part of a rigid frame of the barrel
             portion 306 or central portion. The elongate members 318 and 320 can form part
             of the second flange portion 304, with the elongate member 318 forming the
             flange members 308 of the second flange portion 304 and the elongate member
             320 forming the flange member 310 of the second flange portion 304. Each of
             the elongate members 312, 314, 316, 318, and 320 can be separate elongate
             members, connected by the covering material 212. The flange members 308
                                                       12

             and 310 can be attached to the covering material 212 to form hinge members
             322, allowing the flange members 308 and 310 to pivot with respect to the barrel
             portion 306 and pivot with respect to the elongate member 316. As the flange
             members 308 and 310 bend, the hinge members 322 also bend, rotating the
             hinge members 322 to create a pivoting action of the flange members 308 and
             310. Proximal ends of the elongate members 312, 314, 318, and 320 mount in
             the covering material 212 to form the hinge members 322 pivotably mounted in
             or on the covering material 212. In some embodiments, the anastomosis device
             300 can be formed with no rigid wire extending from the barrel portion 306
             through the hinge members 322 to the flange portions 302 and 304. In some
             embodiments, the hinge members 322 can be more flexible and less rigid than
             portions of the barrel portion 306 having one or more elongate members 316. In
             some embodiments, the hinge members 322 can be formed of the covering
             material 212 without wire material at all as part of the hinge members 322.
       [00039]              In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 300 can include five
             separate elongate members. For example, two elongate members can comprise
             the first flange portion 302, such as elongate members 312 and 314, two
             elongate members can comprise the second flange portion 304, such as
             elongate members 318 and 320, and one elongate member can comprise the
             barrel portion 306, such as elongate member 316. Using five separate elongate
             elements can allow for a relatively strong framework structure while also allowing
             for relative motion of the first and second flange portions 302 and 304 about the
             hinge members 322 as described herein.
       [00040]              In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 300 can include three
             separate elongate members. For example, one elongate member can comprise
             the first flange portion 302, such as elongate member 312, one elongate member
             can comprise the second flange portion 304, such as elongate member 318, and
             one elongate member can comprise the barrel portion 306. In some
                                                       13
9790036_1 (GHMatters) P104123.AU.1

             embodiments, the number of elongate members can be varied as suitable for the
             application.
       [00041]              In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 300 can include the
             elongate member 316 forming a rigid frame for the barrel portion 306. The first
             flange portion 302 can include a plurality of the flange members 310 having a
             first length and a plurality of the flange members 308 having a second length, the
             first length being less than the second length. A first hinge member 322 includes
             the covering material 212 and flexibly couples a first end of the barrel portion 306
             and the first flange portion 302. The second flange portion 302 can include a
             plurality of the flange members 310 and a plurality of the flange members 308. A
             second hinge member 322 includes the covering material 212 and flexibly
             couples a second end of the barrel portion 306 and the second flange portion
             304.
       [00042]              In some embodiments, forming the flange members 308 and 310 to have
             different lengths relative to each other can allow for the anastomosis device 300
             to have its strength tailored for a particular application. In some embodiments,
             length of the flange members 308 and/or 310 can be increased to distribute force
             over a greater area and apply less localized force. In some embodiments, length
             of the flange members 308 and/or 310 can be shortened to distribute force over a
             smaller area and apply greater localized force. In some embodiments, length of
             the flange members 308 can be increased to distribute force over a greater area
             and apply less localized force while length of the flange members 310 can be
             shortened to distribute force over a smaller area and apply greater localized
             force.
      [00043]               In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 300 can be substantially
             symmetric about a centerline axis. In some embodiments, the anastomosis
             device 300 need not be symmetric, but rather, length of specific flange members
             308 and/or 310 can be shortened and/or lengthened as appropriate for a given
                                                       14

             application to increase localized force at one location and decrease localized
             force at another location. This can be allow for anastomosis device 300 to be
             tailored for particular applications, such as an application with diseased tissue
             benefiting from a particular force distribution. In applications with diseased
             tissue, the anastomosis device 300 can be designed to apply reduced force in an
             area of that diseased tissue, such as by using elongated flange members 308. In
             some embodiments, the flange members 308 and 310 of the first flange portion
             302 can provide force at a different location on a layer of tissue than a location of
             an apposed force applied by the flange members 308 and 310 of the second
             flange portion 304.
       [00044]              In some embodiments, other variables relating to the flange members 308
             and 310 can be varied in addition to length in order to vary force distribution. For
             example, the wire diameter of one, some, or all of the flange members 308 and
             310 can be increased or decreased. As an additional example, the projection
             angle of one, some, or all of the flange members 308 and 310 can be increased
             or decreased. As an additional example, the number of one, some, or all of the
             flange members 308 and 310 can be increased or decreased. As an additional
             example, the material stiffness of one, some, or all of the flange members 308
             and 310 can be increased or decreased. One or more of these variables can be
             varied in one or more flange members 308 and 310 in addition to or instead of
             varying length so as to vary force distribution of the flange portions 302 and 304.
       [00045]              In some embodiments, the flange members 308 have a length of about 10
             to 15 millimeters. In some embodiments, the flange members 310 have a length
             of about 5 to 10 millimeters. In some embodiments, the barrel portion 306 has a
             barrel length of about 5 to 15 millimeters from its first end to its second end, and
             a barrel diameter of about 10 to 25 millimeters. In some embodiments, the
             elongate members 312, 314, 316, 318, and 320 can have diameters of between
                                                        15

             In some embodiments, dimensions can be varied as suitable for the application.
       [00046]              In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 300 can include the barrel
             portion 306 including a rigid frame having a first end and a second end. The first
             flange portion 302 can include a plurality of the flange members 308 having a
             first length and a plurality the flange members 310 having a second length. One
             of the hinge members 322 can include the cover material 212 and can flexibly
             couple the first end of the barrel portion 306 and the first flange portion 302. The
             second flange portion 304 can include a plurality of the flange members 308
             having a third length and a plurality of the flange members 310 having a fourth
             length. Another hinge member 322 can flexibly couple the second end of the
             barrel portion 306 and the second flange portion 304. The first length can be
             less than the second length. At least one of the first length and the second
             length can be different from at least one of the third length and the fourth length.
             In some embodiments, both of the first length and the second length can be
             different from at least one of the third length and the fourth length. In some
             embodiments, both of the first length and the second length can be different from
             both of the third length and the fourth length.
      [00047]               In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 300 includes the barrel
             portion 306 having a rigid framework and having a first end and a second end.
             The first flange portion 302 can include a plurality of the flange members 308
             having a first projecting angle and a plurality the flange members 310 having a
             second projecting angle. One of the hinge members 322 can include the cover
             material 212 and can flexibly couple the first end of the barrel portion 306 and the
             first flange portion 302. The second flange portion 304 can include a plurality of
             the flange members 308 having the first projecting angle and a plurality the
             flange members 310 having the second projecting angle. Another hinge member
             322 can flexibly couple the second end of the barrel portion 306 and the second

             flange portion 304.        In some embodiments, the first projecting angle is different
             than the second projecting angle. In some embodiments, the first projecting
             angle is equal to the second projecting angle.
       [00048]              In some embodiments, the flange members 308 and 310 can extend from
             the barrel portion 306 by an angle that is less than 90 degrees in a relaxed state.
             In some embodiments, the flange members 308 can extend from the barrel
             portion 306 by an angle of between about 10 degrees and about 90 degrees in a
             relaxed state. In some embodiments, the flange members 310 can extend from
             the barrel portion 306 by an angle of between about 5 degrees and about 80
             degrees in a relaxed state. In some embodiments, the flange members 308 can
             extend from the barrel portion 306 by an angle of about 30 degrees in a relaxed
             state. In some embodiments, the flange members 310 can extend from the
             barrel portion 306 by an angle of about 10 degrees in a relaxed state. In some
             embodiments, dimensions and geometries can be varied as suitable for the
             particular application.
      [00049]               In some embodiments, the covering material 212 can cover substantially
             all of the device 300, including all of the flange portions 302 and 304 as well as
             the barrel portion 306. In some embodiments, the covering material 212 can
             cover less than all of the device 300. In some embodiments, the covering
             material 212 can be formed by a single sheet of material covering the device
             300. In other embodiments, the covering material 212 can be formed by multiple
             separate sheets of material. For example, in some embodiments the covering
             material 212 can include a first sheet of material covering the flange members
             308 of the flange portion 302 and a second sheet of material covering the flange
             members 310 of the flange portion 302. In some embodiments, the second
             sheet of material does not cover the first flange members 308. In some
             embodiments, the covering material 212 can also have a third sheet of material
             covering the barrel portion 306, a fourth sheet of material covering the flange

             members 308 of the flange portion 304, and a fifth sheet of material covering the
             flange members 310 of the flange portion 304. This can enable a design with
             different covering materials 212 for each length of the flange members 308 and
             310 in a given one of the flange portions 302 or 304.
       [00050]              Suitable materials for the elongate elements of the devices provided
             herein include a variety of metallic materials including alloys exhibiting, shape
             memory, elastic and super-elastic characteristics. Shape memory refers to the
             ability of a material to revert to an originally memorized shape after plastic
             deformation by heating above a critical temperature. Elasticity is the ability of a
             material to deform under load and return to its original shape when the load is
             released. Most metals will deform elastically up to a small amount of strain.
             Super-elasticity refers to the ability of a material to deform under strain to much
             larger degree than typical elastic alloys, without having this deformation become
             permanent. For example, the super-elastic materials included in the frames of
             some anastomosis device embodiments provided herein are able to withstand a
             significant amount of bending and flexing and then return to the frame's original
             form without deformation. In some embodiments, suitable elastic materials
             include various stainless steels which have been physically, chemically, and
             otherwise treated to produce a high springiness, metal alloys such as cobalt
             chrome alloys (e.g., ELGILOYTM, MP35N, L605), platinum/tungsten alloys.
             Embodiments of shape memory and super-elastic alloys include the NiTi alloys,
             ternary shape memory alloys such as NiTiPt, NiTiCo, NiTiCr, or other shape
             memory alloys such as copper-based shape memory alloys. Additional materials
             could combine both shape memory and elastic alloys such as drawn filled tube
             where the outer layer is constructed of nitinol and the inner core is a radiopaque
             material such as platinum or tantalum. In this construct, the outer layer provides
             the super-elastic properties and the inner core remains elastic due to lower
             bending stresses.

       [00051]              In some embodiments, the elongate elements used to construct the
             devices provided herein can be treated in various ways to increase the
             radiopacity of the devices for enhanced radiographic visualization. In some
             embodiments, the devices are at least partially a drawn-filled type of NiTi
             containing a different material at the core, such as a material with enhanced
             radiopacity. In some embodiments, the devices include a radiopaque cladding or
             plating on at least portions of the first flange portion, the second flange portion,
             and the barrel portion. In some embodiments, one or more radiopaque markers
             are attached to the devices. In some embodiments, the elongate elements
             and/or other portions of the devices provided herein are also visible via
             ultrasound.
       [00052]              In some embodiments, the first flange portion 302, the second flange
             portion 304, and the barrel portion 306, can comprise a framework of
             interconnected elongate elements that is constructed by cutting a tube. In one
             such embodiment, a tube of metallic material (e.g., nitinol, stainless steel, cobalt,
             etc.) can be laser cut, and then the tube is expanded and shaped into the desired
             configuration. In some such embodiments, the metallic material is heat-set in the
             desired configuration so that the material receives a shape-memory whereby the
             material will naturally strive to attain the desired configuration. In some
             embodiments, shape memory materials such as nitinol may strive to attain the
             desired configuration when exposed to body temperature.
       [00053]              As described further below, a covering material 212 can be disposed on
             some portions or on all of the first flange portion 302, the second flange portion
             304, and/or the barrel portion 306. In some embodiments, portions of the first
             flange portion 302, the second flange portion 304, and/or the barrel portion 306
             can remain free of the covering material 212.
       [00054]              In some embodiments, the materials and configuration of the anastomosis
             device 300 (and the other anastomosis device embodiments provided herein)

             allow the devices to be elastically crushed, folded, and/or collapsed into a low
             profile delivery configuration for containment within a lumen for transcatheter or
             endoscopic/thorascopic delivery, and to self-expand to an operative size and
             configuration once positioned at a desired target site within a body and deployed
             from the lumen. For example, the anastomosis device 300 can be configured in
             a collapsed delivery configuration in which the plurality of struts 308 are radially
             compressed such that they are forced to extend substantially parallel to the axis
             of the barrel portion 306, and in which the diameter of the barrel portion 306 is
             also crushed to become smaller. Due to the use of such materials and structure,
             the device 300 may also exhibit, for example, beneficial fatigue resistance and
             elastic properties.
       [00055]              After deployment, the plurality of struts 308 extend from the barrel portion
             306 at a radial orientation and geometry to exert a desired level of apposition
             pressure on the tissue. In some embodiments, the plurality of struts 308 extend
             from the barrel portion 306 such that the nominal measure of the angle between
             the struts 308 and the longitudinal axis of the device 300 is about 1000, or about
             900, or about 800, or about 700, or about 600, or about 500, or about 400, or about
             300, or about 200, or about 100, and the like. In some embodiments, the plurality
             of struts 308 extend from the barrel portion 306 such that the nominal measure of
             the angle between the struts 308 and the longitudinal axis of the device 300 is in
             a range from about 80' to about 100', or about 70' to about 90', or about 60' to
             about 800, or about 50' to about 70", or about 40 to about 60', or about 30' to
             about 50', or about 20' to about 40', or about 10' to about 300.
       [00056]              The flange member 308 and 310 can comprise a variety of materials
             including, but not limited to, metallic shape memory materials and super-elastic
             alloys. Thus, the flange member 308 and 310 can be configured to self-expand
             to an expanded deployed configuration, e.g., including to a pre-determined angle.

       [00057]              The barrel portion 306 is shown in a deployed or expanded configuration.
             In some embodiments, the barrel portion 306, as described above, can comprise
             a variety of metallic shape memory materials and super-elastic alloys. Thus, the
             barrel portion 306 can be configured to self-expand to the deployed
             configuration. In some embodiments, the barrel portion 306 is balloon
             expandable to the deployed configuration, or supplemental expansion forces can
             be applied to a self-expandable device by balloon dilation. The diameter of the
             barrel portion 306 can be made in any size as desired in order to suit the
             intended use and/or delivery system of the anastomosis device 300. For
             example, in the low-profile delivery configuration the anastomosis device 300 can
             be disposed within a delivery sheath that has about a 15 Fr. (5 mm) outer
             diameter. However, in some embodiments, sheaths that are smaller or larger
             than 15 Fr. can be used. For example, sheaths that have outer diameters of 6
             Fr., 7 Fr., 8 Fr., 9 Fr., 10 Fr., 11 Fr., 12 Fr., 13 Fr., 14 Fr., 16 Fr., 17 Fr., 18 Fr., 19
             Fr., 20 Fr., and larger than 20 Fr., can be used in some embodiments. When the
             anastomosis device 300 is configured in its expanded deployed configuration as
             shown, the diameter of the barrel portion 306 increases to a deployed diameter.
             In some implementations, the deployed outer diameter of the barrel portion 306
             is configured to at least partially anchor the device 300 via an interference fit with
             the tissue aperture in which the barrel portion 306 resides. However, in some
             implementations the deployed outer diameter of the barrel portion 306 is slightly
             less than the diameter of the tissue aperture in which the barrel portion 306
             resides, and the flange portions 302 and 304 compress the tissue to provide the
             migration resistance. In some embodiments, the fully expanded diameter of the
             barrel portion 306 is about 30 mm, or about 25 mm, or about 20 mm, or about 15
             mm, or about 12 mm, or about 10 mm, or about 8 mm, or about 6 mm, or about 4
             mm, and the like. In some embodiments, the fully expanded diameter of the
             barrel portion 306 is in a range between about 20 mm to about 30 mm, or about
             15 mm to about 25 mm, or about 10 mm to about 20 mm, or about 5 mm to about
             15 mm, or about 4 mm to about 8 mm, and the like.

       [00058]              The anastomosis device 300 also includes the covering material 212. In
             some embodiments, the covering material 212 is disposed on at least some
             portions (or on all) of the first flange portion 302, the second flange portion 304,
             and the barrel portion 306. In some embodiments, some portions of the first
             flange portion 302, the second flange portion 304, and/or the barrel portion 306
             are not covered by the covering material 212.
      [00059]               In some embodiments, the covering material 212 is generally fluid
             impermeable. That is, in some embodiments the covering material 212 may be
             made of a material that inhibits or reduces passage of blood, bile and/or other
             bodily fluids and materials through the covering material 212 itself. In some
             embodiments, the covering material 212 has a material composition and
             configuration that inhibits or prevents tissue ingrowth and/or endothelialization or
             epithelialization into the covering material 212. Some such embodiments that
             are configured to inhibit or prevent tissue ingrowth and/or endothelialization can
             be more readily removed from the patient at a future date if so desired. In some
             embodiments, the covering material 212, or portions thereof, has a microporous
             structure that provides a tissue ingrowth scaffold for durable sealing and/or
             supplemental anchoring strength of the anastomosis device 300.
      [00060]               In some embodiments, the covering material 212 comprises a
             fluoropolymer, such as an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) polymer or
             polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) polymer. In some embodiments, the covering
             material 212 comprises a polyester, a silicone, a urethane, another biocompatible
             polymer, polyethylene terephthalate (e.g., Dacron@), bioabsorbable materials,
             copolymers, or combinations and subcombinations thereof. In some
             embodiments, the covering material 212 comprises a bioabsorbable web. In
             some embodiments, the bioabsorbable material can also provide an anti
             migration feature by promoting attachment between the device 300 and tissue
             until the bioabsorbable material is absorbed.

       [00061]              In some embodiments, the covering material 212 (or portions thereof) is
             modified by one or more chemical or physical processes that enhance one or
             more properties of the material 212. For example, in some embodiments, a
             hydrophilic coating may be applied to the covering material 212 to improve the
             wettability and echo translucency of the material 212. In some embodiments, the
             covering material 212, or portions thereof, may be modified with chemical
             moieties that facilitate one or more of endothelial cell attachment, endothelial cell
             migration, endothelial cell proliferation, and resistance to or promotion of
             thrombosis. In some embodiments, the covering material 212, or portions
             thereof, may be modified to resist biofouling. In some embodiments, the
             covering material 212, or portions thereof, may be modified with one or more
             covalently attached drug substances (e.g., heparin, antibiotics, and the like) or
             impregnated with the one or more drug substances. The drug substances can
             be released in situ to promote healing, reduce tissue inflammation, reduce or
             inhibit infections, and to promote various other therapeutic treatments and
             outcomes. In some embodiments, the drug substance is a corticosteroid, a
             human growth factor, an anti-mitotic agent, an antithrombotic agent, a stem cell
             material, or dexamethasone sodium phosphate, to name some embodiments. In
             some embodiments, a pharmacological agent may be delivered separately from
             the covering material 212 to the target site to promote tissue healing or tissue
             growth.
      [00062]               Coatings and treatments may be applied to the covering material 212
             before or after the covering material 212 is joined or disposed on the framework
             of the anastomosis device 300. Additionally, one or both sides of the covering
             material 212, or portions thereof, may be coated. In some embodiments, certain
             coatings and/or treatments are applied to the covering material(s) 212 located on
             some portions of the anastomosis device 300, and other coatings and/or
             treatments are applied to the material(s) 212 located on other portions of the
             anastomosis device 300. In some embodiments, a combination of multiple
                                                       23

             coatings and/or treatments are applied to the covering material 212, or portions
             thereof. In some embodiments, certain portions of the covering material 212 are
             left uncoated and/or untreated. In some embodiments, the device 300 is fully or
             partially coated to facilitate or frustrate a biological reaction, such as, but not
             limited to, endothelial cell attachment, endothelial cell migration, endothelial cell
             proliferation, and resistance to or promotion of thrombosis.
       [00063]              In some embodiments, a first portion of the covering material 212 is
             formed of a first material and a second portion of the covering material 212 is
             formed of a second material that is different than the first material. In some
             embodiments, the covering material 212 is comprised of multiple layers of
             materials, which may be the same or different materials. In some embodiments,
             portions of the covering material 212 have one or more radiopaque markers
             attached thereto to enhance in vivo radiographic visualization of the anastomosis
             device 300, or one or more echogenic areas to enhance ultrasonic visibility.
      [00064]               In some embodiments, one or more portions of the covering material 212
             are attached to the framework of the device 300, such as the barrel portion 306
             and/or the flange portions 302 and 304. The attachment can be accomplished by
             a variety of techniques such as, but not limited to, stitching the covering material

             (FEP) or other suitable adhesive) to facilitate attachment of the covering material
             212 to the framework. Such adhesives may be applied to the framework using
             contact coating, powder coating, dip coating, spray coating, or any other
             appropriate means.
       [00066]              FIGS. 3 and 4A are perspective views of another exemplary anastomosis
             device 400 in accordance with some embodiments. The anastomosis device 400
             is shown having a first flange portion 402, a second flange portion 404, a barrel
             portion 406, and covering material 212. The first flange portion 402 and the
             second flange portion 404 (also referred to herein as flange portions, flanges,
             etc.) can each include one or more flange members 408 and 410 (also referred
             to herein as anchor members, apposition members, fins, etc.). The flange
             members 408 and 410 can have different configurations (e.g., lengths, widths,
             shapes, angles, etc.). The covering material 212 can form hinge members 422,
             allowing the flange members 408 and 410 to pivot with respect to the barrel
             portion 406. In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 400 can have
             features and functionality similar to that described with respect to anastomosis
             device 300 and other anastomosis devices described herein.
       [00067]              In some embodiments, such as shown in FIG. 4A, one or more of the
             flange members 408 can include radiopaque markers 424 at distal regions
             thereof. In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 400 can include
             radiopaque markers 424 on some but not all flange members of the anastomosis
             device. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the anastomosis device 400
             includes radiopaque markers 424 at distal regions of the flange members 408 but
             not at the distal ends of any of the flange members 406. In some embodiments,

       [00068]              FIG. 4B is an exploded view of the anastomosis device 400 with the
             covering material 212 removed. The anastomosis device can include elongate
             members 412, 414, 416, 418, and 420. In the illustrated embodiment, the
             anastomosis device 400 includes five separate elongate members. The elongate
             member 412 defines the flange members 408 of the first flange portion 402. The
             elongate member 414 defines the flange members 410 of the first flange portion
             402. The elongate member 416 defines a rigid frame of the barrel portion 406.
             The elongate member 418 defines the flange members 408 of the second flange
             portion 404. The elongate member 420 defines the flange members 410 of the
             second flange portion 404. Two elongate members 412 and 414 support the first
             flange portion 402, two elongate members 418 and 420 support the second
             flange portion 404, and one elongate member 416 supports the barrel portion
             406. Thus, the separate elongate members 412, 414, 416, 418, and 420 can
             combine with the covering material 212 to form the anastomosis device 400. The
             elongate members 412, 414, 416, 418, and 420 can combine such that the
             flange members 408 alternate with the flange members 410. Hinges for the
             flange members 408 can align with the flange members 410 and hinges for the
             flange members 410 can align with the flange members 408. Accordingly, each
             of the flange members 408 and 410 can hinge separately.

             second flange portion, and one elongate member 516 support the barrel portion.
             Thus, the separate elongate members 512, 516, and 518 can combine with the
             covering material 212 (not shown in FIG. 5) to form the anastomosis device 500.

             606, and covering material 212. The first flange portion 602 and the second
             flange portion can each include one or more flange members 608 and 610. The
             flange members 608 and 610 can have different configurations (e.g., lengths,
             widths, shapes, angles, etc.). The covering material 212 can form the hinge
             members 622, allowing the flange members 608 and 610 to pivot with respect to
             the barrel portion 606. In some embodiments, the covering 212 need not cover

             flange members 1208 and 1210 can have different configurations (e.g., lengths,
             widths, shapes, angles, etc.). In FIG. 12, the anastomosis device is shown
             deployed and expanded, as if in an operative site of a patient. Consequently, the
             second flange portion (not shown) is obscured in FIG. 12. The covering material
             212 can form the hinge members 1222, which can allow the flange members
             1208 and 1210 to pivot with respect to the barrel portion 1206 to the deployed
             position shown in FIG. 12. The anastomosis device 1200 has features and

       [00077]              In some embodiments, the devices provided herein can be used for
             sealing or anchoring a heart valve implant. A heart valve implant enables one
             way flow of blood from a heart chamber and usually has a first inflow end and a
             second outflow end. The contractions of the heart cause flow of blood through
             the valve from the inflow end to the outflow end. Between the inflow and outflow
             ends, a valve assembly within the heart valve implant provides for one way flow,
             opening to allow flow from the inflow to the outflow end when the pressure of the
             blood is higher on the inflow end, and closing to prevent flow when the pressure
             on the outflow end is higher than the inflow end. In some embodiments, the
             device includes a tunnel or central aperture through the device with apposition
             portions to anchor a valve assembly and seal against backward flow. A valve
             assembly can be attached in the tunnel or central aperture. The apposition
             portions of the device can be configured to be highly conformable to the
             topography of the heart chambers or blood vessels, and compliant with the
             beating movements of the heart. In some embodiments, a covering material is
             configured to allow flow through a valve assembly in the tunnel or aperture while
             preventing flow around the apposition portions.
