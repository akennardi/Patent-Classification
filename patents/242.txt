    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
     1. Field of the Invention.
 LO        [0002]    This invention relates to measurement of bioelectric currents. More
    particularly, this invention relates to systems for recording bioelectric signals
    from the heart using means inserted into the body.
    2. Description of the Related Art.
           [0003]    Mapping of electrical potentials in the heart is now commonly per
 L5 formed, using cardiac catheters comprising electrophysiological sensors for
    mapping the electrical activity of the heart. Typically, time-varying electrical po
    tentials in the endocardium are sensed and recorded as a function of position in
    side the heart, and then used to map a local activation time. Activation time differs
    from point to point in the endocardium due to the time required for conduction of
20  electrical impulses through the heart muscle. The direction of this electrical con
    duction at any point in the heart is conventionally represented by an activation
    vector, which is normal to an isoelectric activation front, both of which may be de
    rived from a map of activation time. The rate of propagation of the activation front
    through any point in the endocardium may be represented as a velocity vector.
25         [0004]    Mapping the activation front and conduction fields aids the physi
    cian in identifying and diagnosing abnormalities, such as ventricular and atrial
    tachycardia and ventricular and atrial fibrillation, which result from areas of im
    paired electrical propagation in the heart tissue.
           [0005]    Localized defects in the heart's conduction of activation signals may
30  be identified by observing phenomena such as multiple activation fronts, abnor-

    mal concentrations of activation vectors, or changes in the velocity vector or devi
    ation of the vector from normal values. Examples of such defects include re
    entrant areas, which may be associated with signal patterns known as complex
    fractionated electrograms. Once a defect is located by such mapping, it may be
  5 ablated (if it is functioning abnormally) or otherwise treated to restore the normal
    function of the heart insofar as is possible.
           [0006]    Mapping of the electrical activation time in the heart muscle re
    quires that the location of the sensor within the heart be known at the time of each
    measurement. In the past, such mapping was performed using a single movable
 LO electrode sensor inside the heart, which sensor measured activation time relative
    to a fixed external reference electrode. This technique, however, requires calibra
    tion, for example impedance calibrations with adjustments for impedance unre
    lated to that of the body. Mapping of electrical activation time using a single elec
    trode was, furthermore, a lengthy procedure, generally performed under fluoro
 L5 scopic imaging, and thereby exposing the patient to undesirable ionizing radia
    tion. Furthermore, in an arrhythmic heart, activation times at a single location may
    change between consecutive beats.
           [0007]    Because of the drawbacks of single-electrode mapping, a number
    of inventors have taught the use of multiple electrodes to measure electrical po
  0 tentials simultaneously at different locations in the endocardium, thereby allowing
    activation time to be mapped more rapidly and conveniently, as described. Cath
    eters containing position sensors may be used to determine the trajectory of
    points on the cardiac surface. These trajectories may be used to infer motion char
    acteristics such as the contractility of the tissue. As disclosed in U.S. Patent
25  No. 5,738,096, issued to Ben Haim, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by
    reference, maps depicting such motion characteristics may be constructed when
    the trajectory information is sampled at a sufficient number of points in the heart.
           [0008]    Electrical activity at a point in the heart is typically measured by
    advancing a multiple-electrode catheter to measure electrical activity at multiple
30  points in the heart chamber simultaneously. A record derived from time varying
    electrical potentials as measured by one or more electrodes is known as an elec
    trogram. Electrograms may be measured by unipolar or bipolar leads, and are

    used, e.g., to determine onset of electrical propagation at a point, known as local
    activation time.
           [0009]   Commonly      assigned     U.S.    Patent   Application   Publication
    No. <removed-apn>7 by Zino et al., whose disclosure is herein incorporated by refer
  5 ence, describes near realtime data display of electroanatomic data obtained from
    the heart on a monitor. During a time interval that does not exceed a duration of a
    cardiac cycle of the heart the following steps are performed: reading data from at
    least one of the electrodes and sensors, and invoking a processor to perform an
    algorithm on the data. The data is one of a plurality of inputs of the algorithm, and
 L0 the result of the algorithm includes a transformation of the data. The result of the
    algorithm is rendered on the monitor to modify an electroanatomical map.
    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           [0010]   In a conventional cardiac catheterization procedure a colored elec
    troanatomic map is stable until the user starts to ablate. Once the user has begun
 15 ablation, the electroanatomical behavior of the heart changes, but the displayed
    map remains the same. To see the results of the ablation, the user needs to create
    a new map and recolor it. This takes time and effort.
           [0011]   .According to disclosed embodiments of the invention, in one mode
    of operation a map that is initially monocolored, e.g., gray, is presented and col
 >0 ored. Periodically the coloring is removed, and the map recolored based on up
    dated information. The user selects regions of the map using any catheters being
    used. These regions are colored in real time according to the value of a parameter
    to present a functional display. The parameter represented by the coloring can be
    selected by the user, e.g., unipolar potentials, bipolar potentials, or local activa
25  tion times.
           [0012]   There is provided according to embodiments of the invention a
    method of catheterization, which is carried out by inserting a probe into a heart of
    a living subject, the distal portion of the probe having a plurality of sensors dis
    posed thereon. The method is further carried out iteratively by displaying the
30  heart as a first graphic image, processing signals from the sensors according to a
    predefined algorithm to generate respective outputs, selecting a region on the
    first graphic image that is less than all of the first graphic image, graphically dis-

    playing at least a portion of the outputs on the selected region as a second graphic
    image, and thereafter removing the second graphic image.
           [0013]    According to one aspect of the method, the sensors are electrodes
    and the signals are bioelectric voltages.
  5        [0014]    According to a further aspect of the method, the predefined algo
    rithm includes a calculation of wavefront propagation and the outputs are local ac
    tivation times at respective locations of the sensors.
           [0015]    According to yet another aspect of the method, the sensors are
    temperature sensors.
 L0        [0016]    According to still another aspect of the method, the sensors are con
    tact force sensors.
           [0017]    According to another aspect of the method, the sensors are location
    sensors.
           [0018]    According to an additional aspect of the method, removing the se
 L5 cond graphic image is performed after elapse of a time interval.
           [0019]    One aspect of the method includes gating signals from the sensors
    according to a cardiorespiratory cycle.
           [0020]    There is further provided according to embodiments of the inven
    tion an apparatus, including a probe having a plurality of electrodes and sensors,
 )0 electrical circuitry for receiving data from the electrodes and sensors when the
    probe is at a location in a heart of a living subject, a memory, a display monitor,
    and a processor connected to the memory and the display monitor. The apparatus
    is operative for iteratively displaying the heart as a first graphic image, pro
    cessing signals from the sensors according to a predefined algorithm to generate
25  respective outputs, selecting a region on the first graphic image that is less than
    all of the first graphic image, graphically displaying at least a portion of the out
    puts on the selected region as a second graphic image, and thereafter removing
    the second graphic image.
           [0021]    The apparatus may include gating circuitry linked to signals from
30  the sensors, the gating circuitry operative for gating the sensor outputs according
    to the cardiorespiratory cycle.

    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
          [0027]    In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth
    in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various principles of the
    present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that not all
 )0 these details are necessarily needed for practicing the present invention. In this
    instance, well-known circuits, control logic, and the details of computer program
    instructions for conventional algorithms and processes have not been shown in
    detail in order not to obscure the general concepts unnecessarily.
          [0028]    Documents incorporated by reference herein are to be considered
25  an integral part of the application except that, to the extent that any terms are de
    fined in these incorporated documents in a manner that conflicts with definitions
    made explicitly or implicitly in the present specification, only the definitions in the
    present specification should be considered.
    Overview.
30        [0029]    Turning now to the drawings, reference is initially made to Fig. 1,
    which is a pictorial illustration of a system 10 for evaluating electrical activity in a
                                                     5

    heart of a living subject, which is constructed and operative in accordance with a
    disclosed embodiment of the invention. The system comprises a catheter 14,
    which is percutaneously inserted by an operator 16 through the patient's vascular
    system into a chamber or vascular structure of a heart 12. The operator 16, who is
  5 typically a physician, brings the catheter's distal tip 18 into contact with the heart
    wall, for example, at an ablation target site. Electrical activation maps may be
    prepared, according to the methods disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,226,542,
    and 6,301,496, and in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,892,091, whose disclo
    sures are herein incorporated by reference.
 10       [0030]    The system 10 may comprise a general purpose or embedded
    computer processor, which is programmed with suitable software for carrying out
    the functions described hereinbelow. Thus, although portions of the system 10
    shown in other drawing figures herein are shown as comprising a number of sepa
    rate functional blocks, these blocks are not necessarily separate physical entities,
 L5 but rather may represent, for example, different computing tasks or data objects
    stored in a memory that is accessible to the processor. These tasks may be carried
    out in software running on a single processor, or on multiple processors. The soft
    ware may be provided to the processor or processors on tangible non-transitory
    media, such as CD-ROM or non-volatile memory. Alternatively or additionally, the
 )0 system 10 may comprise a digital signal processor or hard-wired logic. One
    commercial product embodying elements of the system 10 is available as the
    CARTO® 3 System, available from 30 Biosense Webster, Inc., 3333 Diamond Can
    yon Road, Diamond Bar, CA 91765. This system may be modified by those skilled
    in the art to embody the principles of the invention described herein.
25        [0031]    Areas determined to be abnormal, for example by evaluation of the
    electrical activation maps, can be ablated by application of thermal energy, e.g.,
    by passage of radiofrequency electrical current through wires in the catheter to
    one or more electrodes at the distal tip 18, which apply the radiofrequency ener
    gy to the myocardium. The energy is absorbed in the tissue, heating it to a point
30  (typically about 50 0 C) at which it permanently loses its electrical excitability.
    When successful, this procedure creates non-conducting lesions in the cardiac tis
    sue, which disrupt the abnormal electrical pathway causing the arrhythmia. The
                                                 6

    principles of the invention can be applied to different heart chambers to diagnose
    and treat many different cardiac arrhythmias.
          [0032]     The catheter 14 typically comprises a handle 20, having suitable
    controls on the handle to enable the operator 16 to steer, position and orient the
  5 distal end of the catheter as desired for the ablation. To aid the operator 16, the
    distal portion of the catheter 14 contains position sensors (not shown) that provide
    signals to a processor 22, located in a console 24. The processor 22 may fulfill
    several processing functions as described below.
          [0033]     The catheter 14 is a multi-electrode catheter, which can be a basket
 10 catheter as shown in the right portion of balloon 37, or a spline catheter as shown
    in the left portion. In any case there are multiple electrodes 32, which are used as
    sensing electrodes and have known locations on the basket or spline, and known
    relationships to one another. Thus, once the catheter is located in the heart, for
    example by constructing a current position map, the location of each of the elec
 L5 trodes 32 in the heart is known. One method for generation of a current position
    map is described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 8,478,383 to Bar-Tal et al.,
    which is herein incorporated by reference.
          [0034]     Electrical signals can be conveyed to and from the heart 12 from the
    electrodes 32 located at or near the distal tip 18 of the catheter 14 via cable 34 to
 )0 the console 24. Pacing signals and other control signals may be conveyed from
    the console 24 through the cable 34 and the electrodes 32 to the heart 12.
          [0035]     Wire connections 35 link the console 24 with body surface elec
    trodes 30 and other components of a positioning sub-system for measuring loca
    tion and orientation coordinates of the catheter 14. The processor 22 or another
25  processor (not shown) may be an element of the positioning subsystem. The elec
    trodes 32 and the body surface electrodes 30 may be used to measure tissue im
    pedance at the ablation site as taught in U.S. Patent No. 7,536,218, issued to Govari
    et aL, which is herein incorporated by reference. A sensor for obtaining a physio
    logical parameter, such as an electrode or temperature sensor (not shown), typi
30  cally a thermocouple or thermistor, may be mounted near the distal tip 18 of the
    catheter 14.
          [0036]     The console 24 typically contains one or more ablation power gen
    erators 25. The catheter 14 may be adapted to conduct ablative energy to the
                                                   7

    heart using any known ablation technique, e.g., radiofrequency energy, ultra
    sound energy, and laser-produced light energy. Such methods are disclosed in
    commonly assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 6,814,733, 6,997,924, and 7,156,816, which
    are herein incorporated by reference.
  5       [0037]    In one embodiment, the positioning subsystem comprises a mag
    netic position tracking arrangement that determines the position and orientation
    of the catheter 14 by generating magnetic fields in a predefined working volume
    and sensing these fields at the catheter, using field generating coils 28. A suitable
    positioning subsystem is described in U.S. Patent No. 7,756,576, which is hereby
 10 incorporated by reference, and in the above-noted U.S. Patent No. 7,536,218.
          [0038]    As noted above, the catheter 14 is coupled to the console 24, which
    enables the operator 16 to observe and regulate the functions of the catheter 14.
    Console 24 includes a processor, preferably a computer with appropriate signal
    processing circuits, which may include gating circuitry that can be configured for
 15 gating sensor readings according to the cardiorespiratory cycle. The processor is
    coupled to drive a monitor 29. The signal processing circuits typically receive,
    amplify, filter and digitize signals from the catheter 14, including signals generat
    ed by the above-noted sensors and a plurality of location sensing electrodes (not
    shown) located distally in the catheter 14. The digitized signals are received and
 >0 used by the console 24 and the positioning system to compute the position and
    orientation of the catheter 14 and to analyze the electrical signals from the elec
    trodes as described in further detail below.
          [0039]    Typically, the system 10 includes other elements, which are not
    shown in the figures for the sake of simplicity. For example, the system 10 may in
25  clude an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor, coupled to receive signals from one
    or more body surface electrodes, to provide an ECG synchronization signal to the
    console 24. As mentioned above, the system 10 typically also includes a reference
    position sensor, either on an externally applied reference patch attached to the
    exterior of the subject's body, or on an internally-placed catheter, which is insert
30  ed into the heart 12 and maintained in a fixed position relative to the heart 12. The
    system 10 may receive image data from an external imaging modality, such as an
    MRI unit or the like and includes image processors that can be incorporated in or
                                                  8

    invoked by the processor 22 for generating and displaying images that are de
    scribed below.
    Operation.
          [0040]    Reference is now made to Fig. 2, which is a flow chart of a method
  5 for real-time coloring of an electrophysiological map of the heart in accordance
    with an embodiment of the invention. The process steps are shown in a particular
    linear sequence in Fig. 2 for clarity of presentation. However, it will be evident
    that many of them can be performed in parallel, asynchronously, or in different
    orders. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that a process could alterna
 LO tively be represented as a number of interrelated states or events, e.g., in a state
    diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated process steps may be required to imple
    ment the process.
          [0041]    At initial step 39 one or more cardiac catheters are introduced into
    the heart of a subject using well-known methods.
 L5       [0042]    Next, at step 41 a reconstruction of the structure of the heart or the
    chamber is prepared, i.e., geometrically defined in 3-dimensional space. This can
    be accomplished by analysis of images from other modalities, i.e., segmentation
    from pre-acquired magnetic resonance images or fluoroscopy images that have
    been registered with model of the chamber. Registration of images acquired or
 )0 prepared by different modalities is known, for example from U.S. Patent Applica
    tion Publication No. 2007/0049817, and commonly assigned U.S. Patent No.
    7,517,318 to Altmann et al., which are herein incorporated by reference. Yet an
    other method of generating the reconstruction is disclosed in commonly assigned
    U.S. Patent No. 9,265,434 to Merschon et al., entitled Dynamic FeatureRich Anatom
25  ical Reconstructionfrom a Point Cloud, which is herein incorporated by reference.
    In this method, the atrium shape is represented as the isosurface of a field func
    tion, defined at all points within a bounding domain Other methods of reconstruc
    tion are known in the art and may be used, for example the methods disclosed in
    U.S. Patent No. 6,226,542 to Reisfeld, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No.
30  2009/0177089 by Govari et al., which are commonly assigned herewith and incor
    porated by reference. Alternatively, the CARTOMERGETM module and other facil
    ities of the above-noted CARTO system can accomplish this step using images of
    the heart prepared at the same or a different session.
                                                  9

          [0043]    At the completion of step 41 the reconstruction is displayed in a sin
    gle color or shade, without contrast. At this stage the representation conveys no
    functional electroanatomic information, but simply depicts a model of the structure
    of the subject's heart.
  5       [0044]    Next at step 43 one or more sensors on the catheter are read out.
    The sensors may be a selected group of electrodes on a multielectrode catheter,
    for example electrodes on a spline, or a set of electrodes known to be in contact
    with the endocardium. The sensors can be, for example, location sensors that are
    components of the above-described positioning system (Fig. 1), mapping elec
 LO trodes, or sensors of physical states such as temperature, voltages and electrical
    phase information, contact force, or a combination thereof.
          [0045]    While it is possible to graphically display the raw data on the moni
    tor 29 (Fig. 1), e.g., temperature readings from thermocouples on the catheter.
    More commonly, at step 45 data is accumulated over a time interval and pro
 15 cessed according to some algorithm in order to develop a functional electroana
    tomic map. For example, voltages may be accumulated over a cardiac cycle to
    derive spatial LAT's. As another example, the second derivative of reflectance da
    ta may be displayed, as described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application
    Publication No. 20150305812 by Govari et al., entitled Prevention of Steam Pops
 >0 during Ablation, which is herein incorporated by reference. In all such cases, the
    values of the information measured or derived may be conveniently shown on the
    monitor 29 in pseudocolors representing ranges of values. In the case of elec
    trodes, the information may be gated to the cardiorespiratory cycle and could be
    unipolar or bipolar potentials.
25        [0046]    Next, at step 47 a region of 3-dimensional space of the cardiac re
    construction prepared in step 41 is selected for display. The region is automatical
    ly created based on current locations of sensors on the catheter, and the display
    spatially indicates information derived from readings of the sensors. The radius
    influenced at the locations, and thus the size of the displayed region is user
30  definable.
          [0047]    The information in the regional display may be represented in the
    as pseudocolors as known in the art, or may be shown in any other suitable graph
    ic display Nonselected areas remain in monocolor. As creating and updating the
                                                  10

    display is limited to an area of interest, the algorithm may execute more rapidly,
    sparing computer resources, as it is not necessary to redraw a functional map of
    the entire heart. Moreover, the operator is protected from information overload.
          [0048]    Next, at step 49 after reading data from the sensors and processing
  5 the data as required in step 45, the output values are displayed in pseudocolor on
    ly on the region chosen in step 47. Processing the data can be, for example, a cal
    culation of wavefront propagation and the output values can be local activation
    times at respective locations of the sensors.
          [0049]    Once the information is displayed, control proceeds to a delay
 10 step 51, where an event leading to regeneration of the display of step 49 is await
    ed. The event may be elapse of a predefined time interval.
          [0050]    Next, at step 53 the display of step 49 is erased, transiently resulting
    in the reappearance of a monocolored image on the monitor 29, depending on the
    system performance. Control then returns to step 43 to iterate the display process,
 15 using new readings of the sensors. A different region may be selected in step 47,
    particularly if the catheter has been navigated in the heart since the previous iter
    ation. In one embodiment, the regional display is deleted and updated with new
    data every 16 ms, or once during each gating interval, according to the current
    mode of operation.
  0 Example.
          [0051]    Reference is now made to Fig. 3, which is a screen display 55 that
    was produced during a cardiac catheterization in accordance with an embodiment
    of the invention. A reconstruction 57 of the left atrium of the heart is shown as a
    mostly monocolored grey form. Catheters 59, 61 have been inserted into the
25  heart. Catheter 61 is an ablation catheter whose distal end lies in a pulmonary vein
    ostium. Colored area 63 near the tip of the catheter represents temperature at an
    ablation site in the ostium. Catheter 59 is a lasso catheter having multiple mapping
    electrodes 67. A colored area 65 about some of the electrodes 67 is a map of local
    activation time in the region, which may vary as the ablation proceeds. Colored
30  areas 63, 65 are represented by different hatching patterns in the figure.
          [0052]    Reference is now made to Fig. 4, which is another screen display 69
    similar to Fig. 3 taken at another time during the catheterization in accordance
    with an embodiment of the invention. The reconstruction 57 has been rotated in
                                                  11

   order to better display certain areas of interest. The parameter represented by
   area 65 has changed, as indicated by differences in coloration compared to Fig. 3.
