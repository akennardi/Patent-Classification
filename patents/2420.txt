        This disclosure is directed to a catheter having a multi-electrode assembly with a
high electrode density. The multi-electrode assembly may be a basket-shaped electrode
assembly or a brush-shaped electrode assembly each having a plurality of spines. Each
spine includes a flexible wire core of a shape memory material. The flexible wires may
have a folding line that provides a controlled folding mechanism for collapsing the
expanded electrode assembly into a delivery configuration.

                         MULTI-ELECTRODE ASSEMBLY WITH
                         CONTROLLED FOLDING MECHANISM
                          FIELD OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE
[001]        This invention relates to electrophysiologic (EP) catheters, in particular, EP
catheters for mapping and/or ablation in the heart. More particularly, the invention
relates to EP catheters having a multi-electrode assembly with a controlled folding
mechanism.
                                        BACKGROUND
[002]        Electrophysiology catheters are commonly-used for mapping electrical
activity in the heart. Various electrode designs are known for different purposes. In
particular, catheters having basket-shaped electrode arrays are known and described, for
example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,772,590, 6,748,255 and 6,973,340, the entire disclosures of
each of which are incorporated herein by reference.
[003]        Basket catheters typically have an elongated catheter body and a basket
shaped electrode assembly mounted at the distal end of the catheter body. The basket
assembly has proximal and distal ends and comprises a plurality of spines connected at
their proximal and distal ends. Each spine comprises at least one electrode. The basket
assembly has an expanded arrangement wherein the spines bow radially outwardly and
a collapsed arrangement wherein the spines are arranged generally along the axis of the
catheter body.
[004]        It is desirable that a basket assembly be capable of detecting in as few beats
as possible, including a single beat, as much of the electrical function of the region in
which the electrode assembly is deployed, such as the left or right atrium as possible.
By implementing a greater number of electrodes in the electrode assembly,
correspondingly greater and more complete coverage of the region may be obtained.
Further, the increased number of electrodes may reduce or eliminate the need to
reposition the electrode assembly to access all of the desired area in the region. Often,
increasing the number of electrodes corresponds with an increase in the number of
spines or other structures that support the electrodes. One problem with prior art
                                               -1-

designs with multiple spines is that the movement of the spines from an expanded
deployed state into the collapsed delivery state may cause stress in the structure as it
transitions between these two configurations. This stress may cause undesirable
damage to the device. Additionally, the space within a catheter is at a premium.
Having an increased number of spines creates a problem of how to orient these spines
within the catheter lumen when the spines are collapsed. As such, there is a need for a
multi-electrode assembly having an improved mechanism for controlling the movement
from the deployed state to the collapsed state to better predict the orientation of the
spines and electrodes within the lumen and that also decreases the stress to the material
as the device transitions between these configurations. The techniques of this disclosure
satisfy this and other needs as described in the following materials.
                                          SUMMARY

including forming an elongate catheter body, forming a flexible wire assembly from a
shape memory material, the flexible wire assembly having a plurality of flexible wires,

[0014]      In one aspect, the multi-electrode assembly may be a basket-shaped multi
electrode assembly or a brush-shaped multi-electrode assembly.

                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0022]       At the outset, it is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to
particularly exemplified materials, architectures, routines, methods or structures as such
may vary. Thus, although a number of such options, similar or equivalent to those
described herein, can be used in the practice or embodiments of this disclosure, the
preferred materials and methods are described herein.
[0023]       It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose
of describing particular embodiments of this disclosure only and is not intended to be
limiting.
                                                -4-

[0024]      The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended
drawings is intended as a description of exemplary embodiments of the present
disclosure and is not intended to represent the only exemplary embodiments in which
the present disclosure can be practiced. The term "exemplary" used throughout this
description means "serving as an example, instance, or illustration," and should not
necessarily be construed as preferred or advantageous over other exemplary
embodiments. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of
providing a thorough understanding of the exemplary embodiments of the specification.
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the exemplary embodiments of the
specification may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well
known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid
obscuring the novelty of the exemplary embodiments presented herein.
[0025]      For purposes of convenience and clarity only, directional terms, such as top,
bottom, left, right, up, down, over, above, below, beneath, rear, back, and front, may be
used with respect to the accompanying drawings. These and similar directional terms
should not be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure in any manner.
[0026]      Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have
the same meaning as commonly understood by one having ordinary skill in the art to
which the disclosure pertains.
[0027]      Finally, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular
forms "a, "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates
otherwise.
[0028]      Multi-electrode assemblies are often used within the heart chamber to
analyze or map the electrical activity. It is desirable to collect this data as quickly as
possible to decrease the procedure time as well as to limit the stress on the patient.
Medical devices with multiple electrodes distributed amongst multiple spines have been
developed to shorten this procedure time. The increase in the number of spines to
accommodate the electrodes has created an opportunity to better control the orientation
of the spines as they are collapsed into the lumen of the catheter and to decrease the
stress on the material that compose the spines. According to the techniques of this
                                              -5-

disclosure, the spines of a basket-shaped or brush-shaped multi-electrode assembly are
configured to have folding lines that control the collapse of the spines into the catheter
lumen in a known or predetermined orientation.
[0029]      Referring now to FIG. 1, catheter 10 comprises an elongated catheter body
12 having proximal and distal ends and a control handle 14 at the proximal end of the
catheter body. Catheter 10 further comprises an electrode assembly 16 at the distal end
of catheter body 12. Electrode assembly 16 is a multi-electrode assembly comprising a
plurality of spines. In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1, electrode assembly 16 is a
basket-shaped electrode assembly 16 having a plurality of spines 18, each carrying
multiple electrodes 20, and mounted at the distal end of the catheter body 12. In another
embodiment, as discussed below and shown in FIG. 5, electrode assembly 16 comprises
a brush-shaped electrode assembly. Catheter body 12 comprises an elongated tubular
construction having a single, axial or central lumen 26, but can optionally have multiple
lumens if desired. To enable accurate mapping of electrical signals, it may be desirable
to provide an array of electrodes with a relatively high density. As such, the number of
spines 18 employed may vary from four to sixteen, or any other suitable number. The
distal ends of spines 18 are joined together at a distal hub 22. Distal hub 22 may take
any form to suit a particular application. In one embodiment, distal hub 22 is a
generally circular and flat structure to allow for more of the electrodes 20 to contact the
tissue to be mapped or treated. In another embodiment, distal hub 22 is a columnar
shape having spines joining the distal hub at a plurality of insertion points. Spines 18
may be evenly or unevenly distributed radially about distal hub 22. Further, each spine
18 may include multiple electrodes 20, such as at least six and up to approximately 16
electrodes per spine, or any other number of electrodes to suit a particular application.
Similarly, the electrodes may be evenly distributed along the spine or may be skewed
proximally, centrally or distally to facilitate analysis of the measured electrical signals.
[0030]      Catheter body 12 is flexible, i.e., bendable, but substantially non
compressible along its length. Catheter body 12 can be of any suitable construction and
made of any suitable material. One construction comprises an outer wall made of
polyurethane or PEBAX* (polyether block amide). The outer wall comprises an
imbedded braided mesh of stainless steel or the like to increase torsional stiffness of the
                                               -6-

catheter body 12 so that, when the control handle 14 is rotated, the distal end of the
catheter body will rotate in a corresponding manner. The outer diameter of the catheter
body 12 is not critical, but generally should be as small as possible and may be no more
than about 10 french depending on the desired application. In one aspect, the overall
diameter of the catheter body 12 may relate to the number of electrodes 20 implemented
by electrode assembly 16 in order to accommodate the associated electrical leads. For
example, a twelve-spine design with each spine carrying sixteen electrodes for a total of
192 electrodes, a ten-spine design with each spine carrying sixteen electrodes for a total
of 160 electrodes and an eight-spine design with each spine carrying sixteen electrodes
for a total of 128 electrodes may utilize up to a 10.0 french catheter body. Likewise the
thickness of the outer wall is not critical, but may be thin enough so that the central
lumen can accommodate a puller wire, lead wires, sensor cables and any other wires,
cables or tubes. If desired, the inner surface of the outer wall is lined with a stiffening
tube (not shown) to provide improved torsional stability. An example of a catheter
body construction suitable for use in connection with the present invention is described
and depicted in U.S. Pat. No. 6,064,905, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated
herein by reference.
[0031]       Spines 18 include a shape memory material, as described below, that
facilitates assuming an expanded arrangement.       When the basket-shaped electrode
assembly 16 is deployed, it assumes an expanded configuration whereby the spines 18
bow outwards into contact or closer proximity with the walls of the chamber in which it
has been deployed, such as the left atrium.
[0032]       In one aspect, an electrophysiologist may introduce a guiding sheath 24,
guidewire and dilator into the patient, as is generally known in the art. As an example, a
suitable guiding sheath for use in connection with the inventive catheter is a 10 french
DiRex TM Guiding Sheath (commercially available from BARD, Murray Hill, NJ). The
guidewire is inserted, the dilator is removed, and the catheter is introduced through the
guiding sheath whereby the guidewire lumen 26 permits the catheter to pass over the
guidewire. In one exemplary procedure, the catheter is first introduced to the right
atrium (RA) via the inferior vena cava (IVC), where it passes through the septum (S) in
order to reach the left atrium (LA).
                                              -7-

[0033]      As will be appreciated, the guiding sheath 24 covers the spines 18 of the
basket-shaped electrode assembly 16 in a collapsed delivery position so that the entire
catheter can be passed through the patient's vasculature to the desired location. Once
the distal end of the catheter reaches the desired location, e.g., the left atrium, the
guiding sheath is withdrawn to expose the basket-shaped electrode assembly 16. Upon
withdrawal of the guiding sheath, the shape memory material of the basket-shaped
electrode assembly radially expands the device within the chamber. With the basket
shaped electrode assembly 16 radially expanded, the ring electrodes 20 contact atrial
tissue. As recognized by one skilled in the art, the basket-shaped electrode assembly 16
may be fully or partially expanded, straight or deflected, in a variety of configurations
depending on the configuration of the region of the heart being mapped.
[0034]       When the basket-shaped electrode assembly 16 is expanded, the
electrophysiologist may map local activation time and/or ablate using electrodes 20,
which can guide the electrophysiologist in diagnosing and providing therapy to the
patient. The catheter may include one or more reference ring electrodes mounted on the
catheter body and/or one or more reference electrodes may be placed outside the body
of the patient. By using the catheter with the multiple electrodes on the basket-shaped
electrode assembly, the electrophysiologist can map the selected region of the heart.
[0035]      As used herein, the term "basket-shaped" in describing the electrode
assembly 16 is not limited to the depicted configuration, but can include other designs,
such as spherical or egg-shaped designs, that include a plurality of expandable arms or
spines connected, directly or indirectly, at their proximal and distal ends. In one aspect,
different sized basket-shaped electrode assemblies may be employed depending on the
patient's anatomy to provide a close fit to the area of the patient being investigated, such
as the right or left atria. Other shapes for electrode assembly 16 are contemplated by
the present invention. Illustrated in FIG. 5, below, is a "brush-shaped" electrode
assembly 16A.
[0036]      A detailed view of one embodiment of the basket-shaped electrode assembly
16 is shown in FIG. 2, featuring a total of eight spines 18, each carrying ten electrodes
20. As noted above, in other embodiments, different numbers of spines 18 and/or
electrodes 20 may be employed, each of which may be evenly or unevenly distributed
                                              -8-

as desired. The distal ends of the spines 18 are joined at distal hub 22.
Correspondingly, the proximal ends of the spines 18 may be secured to the distal end 32
of the catheter body 12. Lumen 26 may be used as a guidewire lumen. In some
embodiments, lumen 26 may also be used to supply a suitable irrigation fluid, such as
heparinized saline, to the basket-shaped electrode assembly 16. A fitting (not shown) in
the control handle 14 may be provided to conduct irrigation fluid from a suitable source
or pump into the lumen 26.
[0037]       Each spine 18 may include cabling with built-in or embedded lead wires for
the electrodes 20 carried by the spine. The cabling has a core, and a plurality of
generally similar wires each covered by an insulating layer that enables each wire to be
formed and to function as a conductor. The core provides a lumen in which can pass
other components such as a support structure in the form of flexible wire 28, discussed
in further detail below, and/or additional lead wire(s), cables, tubing or other
components. Cabling suitable for use with the present invention is described in U.S.
Application Serial No. 13/860,921, filed April 11, 2013, entitled HIGH DENSITY
ELECTRODE STRUCTURE, and U.S. Application Serial No. 14/063,477, filed
October 25, 2013, entitled CONNECTION OF ELECTRODES TO WIRES COILED
ON A CORE, the entire disclosures of which have been incorporated above. Each
cabling (with embedded lead wires) may extend to the control handle 14 for suitable
electrical connection of wires, thereby allowing signals measured by electrodes 20 to be
detected.
[0038]       Each spine 18 may comprise a flexible wire 28 with a non-conductive
covering 30 on which one or more of the ring electrodes 20 are mounted. Each ring
electrodes 20 may be configured as monopolar or bipolar, as known in the art.      In an
embodiment, the flexible wires 28 may be formed from a shape memory material to
facilitate the transition between expanded (deployed) and collapsed (delivery)
configurations and the non-conductive coverings 30 may each comprise biocompatible
plastic tubing, such as polyurethane or polyimide tubing. A plurality of flexible wires
28 may be joined to form a flexible wire assembly 29.
[0039]       FIG. 3 illustrates one embodiment of a flexible wire assembly 29. Flexible
wire assembly 29 comprises a plurality of flexible wires 28. The distal ends of each
                                             -9-

flexible wire 28 are joined at distal hub 22. In one embodiment, flexible wire assembly
29 is composed of nitinol, a nickel-titanium alloy. In this embodiment, flexible wire
assembly 29 is manufactured from a single nitinol tube. In another embodiment, flexible
wire assembly 29 is manufactured from a single sheet of nitinol and formed into the
basket shape. In still other embodiments, individual flexible wires 28 are manufactured
and then joined together at their distal ends to a hub to form the flexible wire assembly.
In each of these embodiments, the proximal ends of the flexible wires 28 are joined to a
distal end 32 of catheter 12.
[0040]      As mentioned above, the flexible wire assembly 29 is composed of Nitinol, a
shape memory material. During manufacture, the flexible wire assembly is heat set into
a "memorized" shape, which is also referred to as the deployed shape or deployed
configuration. At body temperature, nitinol wire is flexible and elastic and, like most
shape memory metals, nitinol wires deform when subjected to minimal force and return
to their shape in the absence of that force. FIG. 3 illustrates the flexible wire assembly
29 in the memorized shape or basket-shape. During manufacture, the nitinol material is
heated and formed into the basket-shape. This shape is then heat set, as is known in the
art. The basket-shaped electrode assembly 16 will have a three dimensional shape that
can be collapsed (deformed) to be fed into a guiding sheath and then returned to its
expanded shape memory configuration upon delivery to the desired region of the patient
upon removal of the guiding sheath. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that
other shape memory materials may be used in place of Nitinol, for example, other shape
memory metals and shape memory polymers.
[0041]      FIG. 3 further illustrates a flexible wire assembly that includes a plurality of
folding lines 36. Folding lines 36 comprise a portion of the nitinol wire or frame that is
fashioned to fold or collapse at a particular location when subjected to a minimal force.
In an example, the minimal force may be from the guiding sheath as either the catheter
or the sheath is moved to cover the deployed electrode assembly 16 and to place the
electrode assembly into the delivery configuration. In another example, the force may
come from the translation of a pull wire (not shown) that has a distal end attached
adjacent to the hub 22 and a proximal end operably connected to handle 14. In this
embodiment, folding lines 36 will controllably bend or fold as the pull wire is moved to
                                              -10-

collapse the expanded electrode assembly 16 to fit within the guiding sheath. In each
embodiment, controlling the collapse of the device reduces or eliminates any spine
distortion and also minimizes any damage that may occur to the electrodes as the
electrode assembly 16 is forced into the guiding sheath.
[0042]       The number and location of the folding lines 36 will vary depending on the
application for the particular device. FIG. 3 illustrates two folding lines 36 near the
distal portion of the flexible wire 28. For the sake of clarity, folding lines 36 are not
shown for each flexible wire. Folding lines 36 are strategically placed along flexible
wires 28 to allow for a controlled transition of the multi-electrode assembly from the
delivery (deformed) configuration to the deployed shape memory configuration.
Folding lines may be placed anywhere along the flexible wire 28 where it would be
advantageous to aid in the transition between the delivery configuration and the
deployed configuration. For example, folding lines 36 may also be placed near the
proximal portion 38 of flexible wire 28 to aid in the controlled collapse of the device.
In another example, folding lines 36 may be evenly distributed among the flexible wires
in a concentric arrangement or may be distributed in a helical arrangement. The
location may also depend on the position of the electrodes attached to the spines.
[0043]       Folding lines 36 may be manufactured in a few non-limiting methods. In
one embodiment, folding lines 36 are portions of the flexible wire 28 that have been
heat set, during the manufacturing process, to fold in a direction that aids in controlling
the collapse of the electrode assembly. In another embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4, the
folding lines may also comprise an area having a slight indentation or groove opposite
to the direction of the fold. For example, the folding line 36 may be on the abluminal
side when the direction of folding is on the luminal side of the collapsing device. In this
embodiment, the indentation, or groove, is not a reduction in the amount of material
forming the flexible wire, but a displacement of the material in a manner to aid in the
folding of the wire. As would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the number
and position of the folding lines along the flexible wires 28 may be dependent on the
purpose of the medical device, the number of spines comprising the device, and the
number of electrodes distributed on each of the spines.
                                            -11-

[0044]       Referring now to FIG. 5, FIG. 5 illustrates another embodiment of a flexible
wire assembly 29A which may be used with the catheter construction described above
for FIG. 1. In this embodiment, flexible wire assembly comprises a plurality of fold
lines 36A, denoted by the dashed lines. In this embodiment, the brush-shaped electrode
assembly is deployed in a substantially planar orientation that will lie essentially flat
against the tissue to be mapped or treated. Flexible wire assembly 29A comprises a
plurality of flexible wires 28A. FIG. 5 illustrates a flexible wire assembly with four
flexible wires 28A. The flexible wire assembly 29A may be comprised from any
number of individual flexible wires to suit a particular need. As an example, flexible
wire assembly 29A may have four, six, or up to sixteen flexible wires 28A. It will be
appreciated that the location of each flexible wire 28A within the brush shaped flexible
wire assembly 29A may determine whether a folding line 36A will be used to aid in
collapsing the device in a controlled manner to fit within a guide sheath.
[0045]       As shown in FIG. 5, each of the flexible wires 28A positioned furthest away
from a center line CL includes a folding line 36A. Those flexible wires 28A closest to
the center line CL may or may not have a folding line 36A depending on the distance
the flexible wire 28A is from the center line. One will appreciate that the further a
flexible wire 28A is from center line CL, the need for at least one folding line 36A to
aid in the collapse of the device is increased. This increased need may be attributed to
the length and angle of the extension arm 38A. For example, the flexible wire 28A1
located at distance D1 may not include a folding line 36A. However, flexible wire
28A2, located at a distance D2, includes a folding line 36A in extension arm 38A due to
the increase in distance, (D1 to D2), from the center line CL. Additionally, as the
attachment angle a from center line CL increases from 00 to 90 for each extension arm
38A, the need of a folding line 36A may also increase. Thus, with a device having any
number of flexible wires 28A comprising the flexible wire assembly 29A, the utilization
of at least one folding line 36A along the length of each extension arm 38A of each
flexible wire will decrease the force required to collapse the device into the guide
sheath.
[0046]       One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that elements of each of the
embodiments described above for FIGS. 2 to 5 may be combined with other elements
                                              -12-

from other embodiments and these combinations are within the scope of the invention.
The following discussion of FIG. 6 also applies to each of the above described
embodiments.
[0047]      To help illustrate use of multi-electrode assembly 16, FIG. 6 is a schematic
depiction of an invasive medical procedure, according to an embodiment of the present
invention. Catheter 10, with electrode assembly 16 (See FIG. 1) at the distal end may
have a connector 60 at the proximal end for coupling the wires from their respective
electrodes 20 (See FIG. 1) to a console 62 for recording and analyzing the signals they
detect. An electrophysiologist 64 may insert the catheter 10 into a patient 66 in order to
acquire electropotential signals from the heart 68 of the patient. The professional uses
the control handle 14 attached to the catheter in order to perform the insertion. Console
62 may include a processing unit 70 which analyzes the received signals, and which
may present results of the analysis on a display 72 attached to the console. The results
are typically in the form of a map, numerical displays, and/or graphs derived from the
signals.
[0048]      In a further aspect, the processing unit 70 may also receive signals from one
or more location sensors 74 provided near a distal end of the catheter 10 adjacent the
electrode assembly 16. The sensor(s) may each comprise a magnetic-field-responsive
coil or a plurality of such coils. Using a plurality of coils enables six-dimensional
position and orientation coordinates to be determined. The sensors may therefore
generate electrical position signals in response to the magnetic fields from external
coils, thereby enabling processor 70 to determine the position, (e.g., the location and
orientation) of the distal end of catheter 10 within the heart cavity. The
electrophysiologist may then view the position of the electrode assembly 16 on an
image the patient's heart on the display 72. By way of example, this method of position
sensing may be implemented using the CARTOTM system, produced by Biosense
Webster Inc. (Diamond Bar, Calif.) and is described in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos.

                                             -13-

be employed. If desired, at least two location sensors may be positioned proximally and
distally of the electrode assembly 16. The coordinates of the distal sensor relative to the
proximal sensor may be determined and, with other known information pertaining to the
spines 18 of the electrode assembly 16, used to find the positions of each of the
electrodes 20.
