   embodiment, each gaming device may have respective player
   interfaces 50a, 50b,..., 50n, including game play mechanisms
   to allow respective player input in the main game and the
   community game.    Furthermore, the elements collected in
30 the main game may be employed by the community game
   controller 70 to determine the community game outcome for
   eligible players.
   Gaming Devices
35
   Herein, the term gaming device is used to refer to any
   device used by a player to play a game and specifically
                                                  10363551_1(GHMaters) P80251.AU.413/06/18

                               - 5
   includes stand alone gaming machines and interactive video
   terminals which implement games in a client/server
   architecture.
 5 A gaming device in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2.   The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
10 houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
15 mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.  Other gaming machines may be configured for ticket
   in that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
20 value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
25 other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device.   In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
30 credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
35 information or images relating to the game.     Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
                                                10363551_1(GHMaters) P80251.AU.413/06/18

                               - 6
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
 5 display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.  Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.   The top box 26 may also include
lo a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
   type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
15 a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
20 Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.   Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
25 with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
   The gaming machine 100 has hardware meters 104 for
   purposes including ensuring regulatory compliance and
30 monitoring player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface
   105 for communicating with peripheral devices of the
   gaming machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or
   the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
   their own memory for storing associated instructions and
35 data for use with the input/output interface or the
   peripheral devices.  A random number generator module 113
   generates random numbers for use by the processor 102.
                                                10363551_1(GHMaters) P80251.AU.413/06/18

                               - 7
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the
   reference to random numbers includes pseudo-random
   numbers.
 5 In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism), a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
10 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110, a
   coin output mechanism 111, and at least one speaker 115.
   Additional hardware may be included as part of the gaming
   machine 100, or hardware may be omitted as required for
   the specific implementation.    For example, while buttons
15 or touch screens are typically used in gaming machines to
   allow a player to place a wager and initiate a play of a
   game any input device that enables the player to input
   game play instructions may be used.    For example, in some
   gaming machines a mechanical handle is uses to initiate a
20 play of the game.  Persons skilled in the art will also
   appreciate that a touch screen can be used to emulate
   other input devices, for example, a touch screen can
   display virtual buttons which a player can "press" by
   touching the screen where they are displayed.
25
   The game controller 101 determines based on game rules
   stored in memory 103, the outcomes of games including
   whether to award a win to a player.
30 In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
35 database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                   In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
                                                 10363551_1(GHMaters) P80251.AU.413/06/18

                               - 8
    communications over a network may be via player marketing
    module - i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
    communication with one or more of the above devices and
    communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.

    Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
    an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
    103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.           The RAM
    103A typically temporarily holds program files for
10  execution by the processor 102 and related data.           The
    EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
    some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
    103C is typically used to store game programs, the
    integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
15  the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
    or elsewhere.
    It is also possible for the operative components of the
    gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
20  input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
    provided remotely from the game controller 101.
    A gaming device as indicated above may also be a gaming
    client of a client/server architecture where a portion of
25  the game is executed on the client and a portion of the
    game is executed on the server.   In such embodiments, the
    client typically takes the form of an interactive video
    terminal which has a similar outward appearance to the
    gaming machine described above but the terminal is only
30  responsible for limited functions, for example rendering
    graphically game outcomes generated by a server.           Further
    detail of a client/server gaming architecture may be found
    in WO 2006/052213 and WO 2007/086779, the disclosures of
    which are incorporated herein by reference.

   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
 5 two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
10 implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
15 network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
20 promotional or informational material.
   In an embodiment, the game server 205 provides a community
   game controller 70 to conduct a community game for the
   plurality of gaming machines, in addition to a main game
25 conducted on the gaming devices by respective game
   controllers, herein referred to as main game controllers
   60.
   A database management server 206 may manage storage of
30 game programs and associated data for downloading or
   access by the gaming devices 202 in a database 206A.
   Typically, if the gaming system enables players to
   participate in a Jackpot game, a Jackpot server 207 will
   be provided to perform accounting functions for the
35 Jackpot game.  A loyalty program server 212 may also be
   provided.
                                               10363551_1(GHMaters) P80251.AU.413/06/18

                              - 10
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
 5 relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming network 200 may communicate with other gaming
10 systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
15 accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
20 server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
25 may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   In an embodiment, the game server 205 provides a community
   game controller 70 to conduct a community game for one or
30 more gaming machines 202, if they are determined to be
   eligible.  A community game may have different game rules,
   which may be stored in database 206A, to a main game
   played on the plurality of gaming machines however it is
   to be appreciated that these rules may be the same.                 Also,
35 community games may enable players of gaming machines to
   either play against other players, against a computer
   generated opponent, typically generated by the game server
                                                10363551_1(GHMaters) P80251.AU.413/06/18

                              - 11
   205, or compete to achieve a predetermined outcome, such
   as designated symbol sequences.  For example, if the
   community game is a stud poker type game, the player will
   compete to make the highest poker ranked hand to obtain
 5 the highest payout.
   It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art
   that eligibility into a community game may be determined
   from an event occurring in the main game and may be
10 determined by either the respective main game controllers
   60 or the server provided community game controller 70.
   In one embodiment, players of gaming machines collect
   elements in the main game for eligibility into a community
   game and these elements are subsequently employed in
15 determining the community game outcome for each player.
   In the example where the community game is a poker game,
   the elements collected in the main game may correspond to
   a pair of playing cards symbols.
20 Referring now to Figures 6 and 7, shown is a single gaming
   device with player interface 50 and main game controller
   60 in communication with a community game controller 70.
   It would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that
   the community game controller 70 may be provided by the
25 game server 205 as described above.
   The player operates game play mechanism 56 of the player
   interface 50 to make a selection and input game
   instructions, selected from a plurality of available
30 instructions, to the main game controller 60.       The player
   interface 50 may vary from embodiment to embodiment but
   will typically include a credit mechanism 52 to enable a
   player to input credits and receive payouts, one or more
   displays 54, the game play mechanism 56, and one or more
35 speakers (not shown).  The game play mechanism 56 of the
   player interface 50 may be in the form of an input device
   such as a touch screen and/or buttons to input player
                                               10363551_1(GHMaters) P80251.AU.413/06/18

                                - 12
   instructions to the main game controller 60.
   The main game controller 60 is in data communication with
   the player interface 50 and typically includes a processor
 5 62 to process game play instructions in accordance with
   game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display.   Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
10 to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:           a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.
15
   In an embodiment, the main game controller 60 conducts a
   main game where a player of a gaming device collects at
   least one element during play of the game for eligibility
   into a community game.    The community game controller 70
20 includes a processor 72 and a memory 74, and conducts the
   community game for each eligible player to determine a
   game outcome in which each collected element is employed
   in determining the community game outcome.    For example,
   if  the community game is  a poker type game and the
25 collected element is a pair of playing card symbols, e.g.
   two aces, the pair of aces are employed in the community
   game to attempt to form the highest ranking poker hand and
   thus be made a community game award.    It would be
   appreciated by those skilled in the art that the poker
30 ranking of the collected card symbols affects the
   probability of making a community game award.         For
   example, a pair of aces collected in the main game
   provides the player with the highest probability of
   obtaining the highest valued poker hand in the community
35 game and thus being made a community game award.
   In one embodiment, the main game is conducted by each
                                                 10363551_1(GHMaters) P80251.AU.413/06/18

                              - 13
   gaming machine 202 and an outcome generator 622 operates
   in response to the player's operation of game play
   mechanism 56 to generate a main game outcome which will
   then be evaluated by outcome evaluator 623 and a community
 5 game module 624 incorporated within the main game
   controller 60.  In an embodiment, the outcome evaluator
   623 evaluates the generated game outcome for the main game
   and the community game module 624 includes an eligibility
   determiner 626 to evaluate the game outcome to determine
10 whether one or more symbols in the main game correspond to
   an element to be collected for eligibility to play a
   community game.  The status of eligibility, or element
   collection, may be displayed on the display 54 via the
   display controller 625.
15
   In the example of a community poker type game, the
   eligibility determiner 626 determines if one or more
   symbols corresponding to a pair of playing card symbols
   occur in the game outcome of the main game for eligibility
20 into a community game.  In another example, the
   eligibility determiner 626 determines if one or more
   symbols corresponding to a picture playing card symbol
   occur in the main game outcome for eligibility.           In any
   event, the eligibility determiner 626 communicates
25 eligibility to the community game controller 70 so that
   the community game can be conducted for eligible players.
   In another embodiment, the determination of eligibility
   into a community game may be made at the game server 205
30 and thus at the provided community game controller 70.                       In
   the case, data could be sent from the game server 205 to
   each community game module 624 to indicate status of the
   community game and status of each player's eligibility.
35 In one example, a player of a gaming machine may collect
   multiple elements for eligibility, as determined by the
   eligibility determiner 626.   For example, a player may
                                                10363551_1(GHMaters) P80251.AU.413/06/18

                               - 14
   collect elements corresponding to multiple pairs of
   playing card symbols.   In this case, the community game
   module 624 sends data to the community game controller 70
   to indicate the multiple eligibility of the player and
 5 displays this to the player via display controller 625.
   The player of the gaming machine may then be given options
   to either play multiple entries in one community game,
   successive entries in multiple community games, or any
   combination thereof.
10
   In an embodiment, the outcome generator 622 generates the
   main game outcome by employing random number generator 621
   to randomly select symbols from a set of symbols specified
   by symbol data 641.   The selected symbols are advised to
15 the display controller 625 which causes them to be
   displayed on display 54 at a set of display positions.
   When selecting symbols, the random number generator 621
   may select symbols from the set of symbols 641 to
   correspond to elements for entry into a community game.
20 For example, symbols, such as aces, may be employed in the
   main game according to the main game rules, but if they
   are displayed in designated display positions they are
   deemed as collected.   In addition, if a designated number
   of these aces are collected in this manner, an element
25  (pair of aces) for eligibility is deemed as being
   collected and the pair of aces can be employed in the
   community game.
   The outcome evaluator 623 may evaluate the main game
30 outcome generated by the outcome generator 622, which is
   displayed as symbols arranged at a set of display
   positions, to determine if the outcome corresponds to a
   winning combination specified in the prize data 642A based
   on game rules 642.   For example, the game rules of the
35 main game may specify that all combinations are evaluated
   left to right or can be evaluated right to left or both.
   Also, to obtain a desired return to player, a probability
                                                10363551_1(GHMaters) P80251.AU.413/06/18

                              - 15
   table having weighted outcomes may be stored in the game
   rules 642 and employed when selecting the symbols.                 In
   addition, further rules for determining an element for
   eligibility into a community game may also be stored in
 5 memory 64.  For example, the game rules may specify an
   element is a playing card symbol, such as an ace, or a
   combination of symbols, such as any pair.   It would also
   be appreciated by those skilled in that art that the
   element may be specified by the game rules to only be
lo deemed as collected if it is displayed in a designated
   position or on a played win-line.  Alternatively, symbols
   corresponding to an element may be specified as scatter
   type symbols.  Also, the game rules 642 may contain a
   probability table employed to determine how often an
15 element is to be deemed as collected and it would be
   appreciated by those skilled in the art that the
   probability of collecting an element could be influenced
   by player activity, such as the value of a main game
   wager, number of win lines played, etc.   In order to
20 assist, game outcomes evaluated by the outcome evaluator
   623 may be stored in memory 64 as meter data 643, which
   may also include community game outcomes, for influencing
   game outcome.
25 In an example, the probability of collecting a pair of
   playing card symbols in the main game for eligibility into
   a poker type community game may be proportional to the
   value of a main game wager selected to be played by a
   playing using the game play mechanism 56.   For example,
30 the probability of collecting a pair of playing card
   symbols may be 1 in 100 if one credit is played per line
   in the main game and 1 in 20 if 5 credits per line are
   played.  Furthermore, a probability table may be employed
   to affect the probability of collecting a higher ranked
35 pair according to the value of the main game wager.
   In another embodiment, the game rules 642 may specify the
                                                10363551_1(GHMaters) P80251.AU.413/06/18

                               - 16
   element collected in the main game to be a symbol
   corresponding to a bingo card, whereby the bingo card
   displays a plurality of symbols to be collected in a
   community game of bingo.   In this embodiment, the
 5 eligibility determiner 626 determines if one or more
   symbols displayed in a main game outcome correspond to a
   bingo card.   The number of bingo cards collected may
   affect the probability of making a community game award.
   Alternatively, the bingo card may have varying numbers of
10 symbols displayed to be collected to affect the
   probability of making a community game award.
   In another embodiment, the element collected in the main
   game corresponds to mahjong tiles for a community game of
15 mahjong.  Alternatively, the element may be a keno card
   for a game of keno.   In any case, the symbols
   corresponding to the elements    (mahjong tiles or keno
   cards) are stored in the game rules 642 and determined to
   be elements for eligibility into the community game by the
20 eligibility determiner 626 as above.
   Also, as described, the community game may be a different
   game to the main game with different rules.       The rules may
   be stored in memory 74 as game rule data 742.          The
25 community game controller 70 may also include a community
   game outcome determiner 722 to determine the outcome of
   the game.   Alternatively, the outcome evaluator 623 of
   each gaming machine may perform this function.
30 In an example, the community game controller 70 may be
   arranged to conduct a community game of poker for players
   of gaming machines determined to be eligible by respective
   eligibility determiners 626.    In this example, each
   eligible player has collected an element in the main game
35 corresponding to a pair of playing card symbols which form
   player hole cards.   The community game controller 70 is
   arranged to select five playing cards to be community
                                                  10363551_1(GHMaters) P80251.AU.413/06/18

                              - 17
   cards in the community game according to the game rules
   742.  Each player then forms a player hand by combining at
   least one hole card with desired community cards to form
   the highest ranked poker hand.   The community game outcome
 5 determiner 722 then evaluates the player hands and a
   community game award is made to the player with the
   highest ranked hand.  Alternatively, the community game
   award may be a series of awards based on the hands formed,
   such as in Caribbean stud poker.   For example, the
10 community game outcome determiner 722 may determine,
   according to the game rules 742, that each player with two
   pairs is to be awarded 10 credits and each player with a
   full house is to be awarded 50 credits.
15 In another example, the community game controller 70 may
   be arranged to conduct a community game of bingo for
   players of gaming machines determined to be eligible.                     In
   this example, each player has collected symbols
   corresponding to a bingo card element to be collected in
20 the main game.  The community game controller 70 is
   arranged to select a number of symbols in the game of
   bingo according to the game rules 742 and each player
   matches selected generated symbols to the plurality of
   symbols displayed on each bingo card.   The community game
25 outcome determiner 722 then evaluates the completed player
   bingo cards and a community game award is made to each
   respective player with the displayed symbols on the bingo
   card matched.
30 In another embodiment, the community game may only be
   conducted when a start condition is met, i.e. the players
   may collect elements for eligibility into the community
   game but the community game is not triggered for these
   players until the start condition is met.   In this case,
35 the community game module 624 may include a start
   condition determiner 626, as shown in Figure 7, to
   determine if an event occurs on a gaming machine which
                                                10363551_1(GHMaters) P80251.AU.413/06/18

                              - 18
   corresponds to a start condition.   For example, the event
   may be a main game outcome trigger event such as a
   designated number of elements to be collected by a
   designated number of players, or the start event may be a
 5 designated number of games played.   Alternatively, the
   start condition may not be a game event but may be a
   designated time period elapsing in the main game before
   the community game is to be conducted for eligible
   players.
10
   The community game module 624 may display the status of
   the start condition to the player of the gaming machine
   via the display controller 625.   For example, when the
   start condition is a time, the player is displayed the
15 time until the next community game is conducted.
   Alternatively, if the start condition is a total number of
   elements collected, such as corresponding to twenty pairs
   in a community game of poker, the number of pair collected
   and or remaining is displayed to each player via
20 respective display controllers 625.
   For example, if the community game is a game of poker,
   each player may need to collect a number of symbols in the
   main game, e.g. ten aces in designated display positions,
25 for eligibility into the community game and to correspond
   to a pair of aces for use in the community game.           The
   community game may not be conducted until a start
   condition, such as a designated number of symbols            (one
   hundred aces) have been displayed in designated positions
30 in the main game.  In a further example, the community
   game may be conducted when a start condition corresponding
   to a number of collections of elements have been
   collected, e.g. symbols corresponding to ten pairs.                  The
   ten pairs could be collected by any number of players and
35 are to be employed in determining the community game
   outcome as described above.
                                                10363551_1(GHMaters) P80251.AU.413/06/18

                               - 19
   A method 800 of gaming is summarised in Figure 8 and
   involves the steps of conducting a main game 810 where at
   least one element for eligibility into a community game is
   collected 820 and subsequently conducting the community
 5 game 830 for all eligible players.    The method 800 then
   determines a community game outcome 840 using each
   collected element for each player.    An alternate method
   900 of gaming is summarised in Figure 9 and involves the
   steps of conducting a main game 910 where at least one
io element for eligibility into a community game is collected
   920, but determining 930 if a start condition is met
   before conducting the community game 940 for all eligible
   players.   The method 900 also then determines a community
   game outcome 940 using each collected element for each
15 player.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system.    It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the methods will be implemented
20 digitally by a processor.    Persons skilled in the art will
   also appreciate that the above methods could be embodied
   in program code.   The program code could be supplied in a
   number of ways, for example on a tangible computer
   readable medium, such as a disc or a memory (for example,
25 that could replace part of memory 103) or as a data signal
    (for example, by transmitting it from a server).            Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that program code
   provides a series of instructions executable by the
   processor.
