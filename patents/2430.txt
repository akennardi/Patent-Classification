  STEERABLE GUIDING SHEATH WITH RING ELECTRODES AND RELATED METHOD
                                        OF CONSTRUCTION
  FIELD OF INVENTION
  [0001]      This invention relates to a guiding sheath which is especially suitable for guiding
  electrophysiology catheter, in particular, a guiding sheath adapted for electrophysiology
  sensing and 3-D mapping.
  BACKGROUND
  [0002]      Guiding sheaths are well known for use in facilitating pathway for a treatment or
  diagnostic catheter.      Catheterization of the human heart often necessitates having a
  catheter gain access to the heart chambers, via a femoral vein and the aorta. To provide
  variation in movement, guiding sheaths (much like the catheters that are passed through
  the guiding sheaths) may be steerable or deflectable with the use of one or more puller
  wires for improved maneuverability in the patient's vasculature.             However, because
  guiding sheaths have a sizable lumen defining the pathway for the catheter, available
  space within guiding sheaths, including lumen space for puller wires, is often limited.
0 Moreover, the sizable lumen in the shaft of the guiding sheaths can lead to kinking and
  undesirable deflection characteristics.
  [0003]      Electrophysiology catheters are known to carry ring electrodes for sensing
  electrical signals within the patient's body, including electrical signals in the heart chamber
  in order to create 3-D electrophysiology maps representative of chamber anatomy and
5 tissue electrical activity, such as for diagnosing cardiac arrhythmias. Such maps can also
  provide visualization of the location of the catheters, by displaying localized ring
                                                 -1
  3412786vl

  electrodes carried      on the catheters, whose location/position        is obtained through
  impedance or current-based measurements, where, for example, tissue impedance is
  measured between the ring electrodes on the catheter and patch electrodes placed on the
  patient's body surface. The position of the catheter is then derived from the impedance
  measurements.       Methods for impedance-based position sensing are disclosed, for
  example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,983,126 to Wittkampf, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,456,864 to Swanson,
  and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,944,022 to Nardella, the entire disclosures of which are
  incorporated herein by reference.
  [0004]      While catheters may be so enabled to sense electrical signals for mapping and
  visualization, guiding sheaths are typically without such adaptations.        Visualization of
  guiding sheaths is usually accomplished by fluoroscopy.
  [0005]      Guiding sheaths typically include a hemostatic valve extending from a control
  handle, to enable the introduction of a fluid into the shaft of the guiding sheath. Because
  of the fluid-tight seal of the hemostatic valve, the vacuum in the lumen of the sheath may
  draw or otherwise displace the catheter. While the hemostatic valve may include a friction
  ring adapted to releasably hold a catheter in place, the friction ring may inadvertently allow
  the introduction of air into the lumen when the catheter first enters the hemostatic valve.
0 [0006]      Accordingly, there is a desire for a guiding sheath with improved pushability and
  deflection characteristics with minimal kinking or buckling. There is also desire for such
  guiding sheath to be enabled for electrical sensing, mapping and visualization via ring
  electrodes. In that regard, it is further desired for such guiding sheath to have improved
  shaft construction so that ring electrode lead wires can extend longitudinally along the
5 shaft without interfering with pushability and deflection characteristics while remaining
  protected from electrical shorts, damage or breakage. There is a further desire that the
                                                 -2
  3412786vl

  hemostatic valve of the guiding sheath be configured to releasably hold a catheter in place
  while reducing the risk of air being introduced into the guiding sheath.

  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
  [0041]      Referring to FIG. 1, in some embodiment of present invention, a guiding sheath
  10 includes an elongated and flexible shaft 12, and a control handle 16 proximal of the
  shaft 12. The shaft 12 includes a proximal section 13 and a distal deflection section 14, a
  distal tip section 15. The control handle 16 may be connected to an electrical connector
  17 for transmitting electrical signals, as sensed by one or more ring electrodes 19
  advantageously carried on the shaft 12, including, for example, the deflection section 14.
  The electrical signals are processed by a remote system (not shown), for example, a
  mapping system that provides visualization of portion(s) of the shaft 12 inside a patient's
  body based on impedance or current-based measurements, where impedance is
  measured between the ring electrodes 19 and patch electrodes (not shown) placed on the
0 patient's body surface. Methods for impedance-based position sensing are disclosed, for
  example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,983,126 to Wittkampf, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,456,864 to Swanson,
  and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,944,022 to Nardella, the entire disclosures of which are
  incorporated herein by reference.        The CARTO 3 mapping system, available from
  Biosense Webster, Inc., employs a hybrid technology using current-based data to also
5 provide visualization of both sensor-based and non-sensor-based catheters and their
  electrodes. The hybrid system, called the Advanced Catheter Location (ACL) feature, is
                                                 -7
  3412786vl

  described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,536,218 to Govari et al., the entire disclosure of which is
  incorporated herein by reference.
  [0042]     Also attached to the control handle 16, as shown in FIG. 1, is a hemostatic
  valve 18 having an end cap 20 adapted to receive a catheter (not shown) that can be
  advanced through a center lumen 22 of the guiding sheath 10, as shown in FIG. 2. The
  valve 18 also has side port 21 terminating in a luer hub, such as a two-way stop cock 22,
  for connection to one or more fluid sources (not shown) for providing fluid into and through
  the lumen 22 of the guiding sheath 10.
  [0043]     Extending through the proximal portion 13 of the shaft 12, as shown in FIG. 2,
  and the distal deflection section 14, as shown in FIG. 3A, an inner tubing or liner 25 has a
  thin-wall construction defining the center lumen 22 of the shaft 12. The liner 25 may be
  constructed of any suitable material, including, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene
  (PTFE).
  [0044]     Also with reference to FIG. 4, a variable braided member or layer 26 of braided
  strands or fibers 27 (separated by interstitial spaces or gaps 50 therebetween) extends
  around an outer surface 23 of the liner 25, generally surrounding the liner along its length
  to minimize kinking, wrinkling or buckling of the shaft 12. The braided layer 26 provides
0 the shaft 12 with a balance of pushability and improved deflection characteristics.        In
  some embodiments, the braided layer has a pitch ranging between about 20 and 50, and
  a pick per inch (PPI) ranging between about 50 and 22, preferably between about 45 and
  27.    The strands or fibers may be constructed of any suitable material, including, for
  example, high-strength stainless steel or high-strength polymer.
5 [0045]     In some embodiments, the pitch and the PPI remain uniform throughout the
  entire length of the shaft 12.    In other embodiments, the pitch and/or the PPI may be
                                               -8
  3412786vl

  varied as appropriate or desired. For example, the braided layer 26 of the distal deflection
  section 14 may have a construction with about 45 PPI whereas the braided layer 26 of the
  proximal section 13 may have construction with about 27 PPI.
  [0046]      To enable deflection (either uni-directional or bi-directional) in the deflection
  section 14, one or two elongated puller wire tubings 30, each with a lumen 31 for a
  respective puller wire 32, extends longitudinally on the outer surface of the inner liner 25.
  Where two tubings 30 are provided, the lumened tubings 30 may be placed diametrically
  opposite of each other, across the lumen 22 for bi-directional deflection within a plane. As
  shown in FIG. 2, FIG. 3A and FIG. 4, the tubing(s) 30 may lie under the braided layer 26,
  for example, directly against the outer surface 23 of the liner 25 under the braided layer 26
  for the entire length of the shaft 12. With the puller wire(s) 32 and tubing(s) 30 extending
  under the braided       layer 26, the deflection     section    14 has improved deflection
  characteristics.
  [0047]      Also extending longitudinally along the shaft 12 are one or more elongated lead
  wire tubings 40, each with a lumen 41 for one or more lead wires 42 and each lead wire
  connected to a respective ring electrode 19 for transmitting electrical signals sensed by
  the ring electrode 19.     The one or more lumened tubings 40 are at radial locations
0 different from radial locations of the one or more puller wire tubings 30. With reference to
  FIG. 2, FIG. 3A and FIG. 4, in the proximal portion 13 of the shaft 12, each tubing 40 lies
  under or below and surrounded by the braided layer 26, for example, lying directly against
  the outer surface of the inner liner 25. In the distal deflection portion 14 of the shaft 12,
  each tubing 40 lies above or outside of the braided layer 26. A junction J defines a
5 location of a transition portion of each tubing 40 that transitions between below and above
  the braided layer 26. Although FIG. 4 illustrates generally uniform braiding at the junction
                                                -9
  3412786vl

  J around the transition portion of the tubing 40, it is understood that the pitch and/or PPI
  may be varied to accommodate the transition portion, resulting in a larger interstitial space
  or gap at location S between the strands or fibers 27 of the braided layer 26 where the
  tubing 40 extends through the braided layer 26.
  [0048]     The transition of the tubing 40 between outside or inside of the braided layer 26
  advantageously allows the lead wires 42 to be connected to the ring electrodes 19 carried
  on the shaft 12 in balancing a variety of competing factors, including, for example, ease of
  manufacturing and assembly, protection of the lead wires from damage, space efficiency
  and radial symmetry of the shaft.
  [0049]     Extending through the lumen 41,       the lead wires 42 are advantageously
  configured with a nonlinear pattern to provide excess length relative to the length of the
  tubing 40 and the shaft 12 so as to provide the lead wires with a degree of slack and
  1"give" in avoiding breakage when the shaft 12 is deflected, especially when deflected
  repeatedly. The nonlinear pattern may include, for example, a serpentine (FIG. 5A), a zig
  zag (FIG. 5B), a coil (FIG. 5C) or combinations thereof. The lead wires 42 may also be
  wrapped around a mandrel or any suitable support structure which would also avoid
  breakage during deflection.
0 [0050]      In other embodiments, the guide wire tubing 40 may also be multi-lumened, as
  shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, for additional lead wires or other suitable components.
  [0051]     Each of the tubings 30 and 40 has a noncircular cross-section so as to minimize
  the overall outer diameter of the shaft 12 while providing a sufficiently large lumen 22 for
  housing the components therein.         For example, the cross-section of the tubings is
5 characterized by a major-axis-to-minor-axis ratio greater than about 2:1.
                                               -10
  3412786vl

  [0052]      The shaft 12 along its length includes an outer layer or coating 48 that extends
  over braided layer 26 and seals all the underlying components.              The outer layer 48
  comprises a material that is applied in a manner that allows the material to seep, for
  example, by reflowing, over the tubings 30 and 40, and between the strands or fibers 27
  of the braided layer 26 and generally fill the interstitial spaces 50 therein. The tubings 30
  and 40, the braided layer 26 and also a distal ring 45 are embedded in the outer layer 48.
  Suitable material for the outer layer 48 includes, for example, polyphthalamide, such as
  VESTAMID, and/or polyether block amide, such as PEBAX.
  [0053]      The outer layer 48 may comprise materials of different durometer for different
  sections of the shaft 12 in providing different deflection characteristics, including, for
  example, a "C" curve or a "U'" curve (see FIG. 1). In the embodiment of FIG. 1, the shaft
   12 has a first (most) proximal section 13A with an outer layer constructed of VESTAMID, a
  second proximal section 13B with an outer layer constructed of PEBAX 6333, a third
  proximal section 13C with an outer layer constructed of PEBAX 5583, a distal section 14
  with an outer layer constructed of 50% PEBAX/50% PEBAX 4533. To enable deflection
  of the shaft 12, durometer of the outer layer 48 (the sections thereof) decreases from its
  proximal end to its distal end.     In other words, flexibility of the outer layer 48 increases
0 from its proximal end to its distal end along the length of the shaft 12.
  [0054]      Each lead wire 42 is connected to its respective ring electrode 19. As shown in
  FIG. 3B, an aperture 55 is formed through the outer layer 48 and the tubing 40 so that a
  lead wire 42 can pass from inside the lumen 41 to outside of the outer layer 48 for
  connection to a respective ring electrode 19. The lead wires 42 transmit electrical signals
5 sensed by the ring electrodes 19 to the remote system via the electrical connector 17
  proximal of the control handle 16, as shown in FIG. 1.

  3412786vl

  [0055]         In the illustrated embodiment, the lead wire tubing 40 has a distal end between
  the distal-most ring electrode 19D and the distal ring 45. In the embodiment of FIG. 6, the
  tubing 40 has a lead wire 42D for the distal-most ring electrode 19D.             Each puller wire
  tubing 30 has a distal end that is also between the distal-most ring electrode 19D and the
  distal ring 45.       A distal end of each puller wire 32 emerging from a distal end of a
  respective tubing 30 is fixedly attached to and anchored by the distal ring 45 mounted on
  the inner liner 25, distal of the distal-most ring electrode 19D.         The distal end of each
  puller wire 32 may be affixed to the ring 45 by any suitable method, including welding, as
  shown at W.          The distal ring 45 has an inner diameter slightly larger than the outer
  diameter of the braided layer 26 so that it can surround and secure a distal end of the
  braided layer 26 onto the inner liner 25. The distal ring 45 has an outer diameter less than
  the outer diameter of the outer layer 48, so that the distal ring is embedded in the outer
  layer 48. A radiopaque marker, e.g., distal ring 46, may be provided to visually indicate
  the distal end of the shaft under fluoroscopy.
  [0056]         In some embodiments of the present invention, a method for manufacturing the
  shaft 12 of the guiding sheath 10 includes:
      a) providing an inner liner,
0     b) positioning a lumened tubing (for example, a lead wire tubing) longitudinally
            alongside an outer surface of the inner liner,
      c) forming a braided member or layer with fibers, wherein
            i) for a first or proximal portion of the shaft, braiding the fibers over both the outer
                surface of the inner liner and a first or proximal portion of the lumened tubing,
5           ii) for a second or distal portion of the shaft, braiding fibers over the outer surface
                of the inner liner but under a second or distal portion of the lumened tubing, and
                                                    -12
  3412786vl

      d) applying an outer layer over the inner liner, the braided fibers, and the lumened
            tubing along a length of the shaft.
  [0057]        The method may include transitioning the lumened tubing at a junction between
  the first and second portions of the shaft so as to change the position of lumened tubing
  relative to the braided member, for example, between being below the fibers and being
  above the fibers.
  [0058]        In more detailed embodiments, the method may include the following:
            a)       positioning the first portion of the lumened tubing in a first position relative to
            the inner liner and the fibers,
            b)       braiding the fibers,
            c)       stopping the braiding,
            d)       after the stopping the braiding, positioning the second portion of the
            lumened tubing in a second position relative to the inner liner and the fibers, and
            e)       after the positioning the second portion of the lumened tubing, resuming the
            braiding.
  [0059]        It is understood that the braiding may begin at a distal end of the shaft and
  progress toward a proximal end of the shaft, or vice versa, as desired or appropriate.
0 Accordingly, the lumened tubing may be moved or adjusted during braiding of the fibers
  from being above the braided member to being under the braided member, or vice versa.
  [0060]        The braiding the fibers may include braiding the fibers with a first braid pitch,
  and the resuming braiding the fibers may include braiding the fibers with a second braid
  pitch different from the first braid pitch.
5 [0061]        The method may also include passing a nonlinear lead wire through the
  lumened tubing, wherein the lead wire has a nonlinear configuration, for example,
                                                      -13
  3412786vl

  serpentine, zigzag, or coil.
  [0062]        The method may further include:
            a)      positioning a puller wire lumened tubing longitudinally alongside the outer
  surface of the inner liner,
            b)      braiding the fibers over the puller wire lumened tubing and the inner liner,
  wherein
  i)        for a first or proximal portion of the shaft, braiding the fibers over both the outer
  surface of the inner liner and a proximal portion of the lumened tubing,
  ii)       for a second or distal portion of the shaft, braiding the fibers over the outer surface
  of the inner liner but under a second or distal portion of the lumened tubing, and
  d)        applying an outer layer over the inner liner, the braided fibers, and the lumened
  tubing.
  [0063]        The applying an outer layer over the inner liner, the braided fibers, and the
  lumened tubing may include reflowing the outer layer wherein the outer layer comprises a
  reflowable plastic or thermoplastic material. Reflowing the outer layer allows the material
  to seep between the fibers, filling the interstitial spaces between the fibers of the braided
  member.        As mentioned herein, the outer layer of different sections of the shaft may
0 comprise reflowable plastic or thermoplastic of different durometer.
  [0064]        The method may also include:
            a) providing a distal ring at or near a distal end of the inner liner, where a distal end
  of a puller wire is affixed to the distal ring; and
            b) applying the outer layer over the distal ring.
5 [0065]        As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 9, the hemostatic valve 18 proximal of the control
  handle 16 includes a hub housing 33 with a central passage 34 through which a catheter
                                                   -14
  3412786vl

  or like device (not shown) may be passed. The housing 33 is configured with a side port
  37 that is in communication with the central passage 34 for enabling passage of a fluid
  (e.g., saline) from a remote source (not shown) into the central passage 34 and distally
  through the shaft 12. The valve 18 includes an end cap 35 mounted on a proximal end of
  the hub housing 33. The end cap 35 has a central opening 36 that defines an entry into
  the central passage 34. Positioned in the central passage 34, distal of the opening 36 of
  the end cap 35, is a seal valve member 37 having a disc configuration corresponding in
  size and shape to the circular cross-sectional shape and size of the central passage 34 to
  block and seal the central passage with the exception of a deformable center opening 34
  (e.g., one or more slits) that remains closed or sealed in a neutral configuration (to prevent
  fluid from leaking out of the valve 18), except under load of a distal end of a catheter or
  like device (used interchangeably herein) being advanced distally into the guiding sheath
   10.
  [0066]      The valve 18 also includes a friction ring 38 to releasably hold a catheter
  inserted into the guiding sheath. The friction ring 38 is configured as a washer with a
  center passage 39 to receive a catheter. In the illustrated embodiment, the friction ring 38
  and the seal valve member 37 are arranged in abutting contact with each other, with the
0 friction ring 38 distal of the seal valve member 37 and positioned between the seal valve
  member 37 and the end cap 35. The center passage 39 of the friction ring 38 is axially
  aligned with the deformable opening 34 of the seal valve member 37 so that a catheter
  passes through both the deformable opening 34 and the center passage 39 when inserted
  into the valve 18. In that regard, both the seal valve member 37 and the friction ring 38
5 are constructed of a deformable, elastic material. However, while the deformable opening
  34 of the seal valve member 37 is configured to remain closed when there is no load, the
                                               -15
  3412786vl

  center passage 39 of the friction ring 38 is configured to remain open and has a radius
  sized according to the french size(s) of the catheter suitable for use with the guiding
  sheath so that the catheter is movable through the center passage 39 but is held in place
  relative to the valve 10 by circumferential frictional contact with the periphery of the center
  passage 39 of the friction ring 38 whenever a user releases his grasp of the catheter.
  [0067]      When a catheter is introduced into the valve 18 and advanced past the central
  opening 36 of the end cap 35, a distal end of the catheter entering the central passage 39
  of the friction ring 38 can displace the air occupying the central passage 39. To prevent
  the displaced air from passing distally through the center opening 34 of the seal valve
  member 37, the friction ring 38 is advantageously configured with one or more air vents
  58 that direct the displaced air to move away from the center opening 34 of the seal valve
  member 37. In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 10, the air vents include one or more
  radial indents 60 provided around the central passage 39 which are space voids free from
  contact with the catheter extending through the central passage 39 and thus allow the
  displaced air to vent radially through the radial indents 60 and then proximally away from
  the center opening 34. The radial indents 60 extend through the entire thickness T of the
  friction ring 38 in the longitudinal direction.     In the illustrated embodiment, the radial
0 indents 60 are arranged in diametrical pairs around the central passage 39.
  [0068]      In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 11, the air vents 58 include one or more
  radial grooves 61 formed in a proximal surface 62, an outer circumferential surface 63 and
  an outer distal surface 64 of the friction ring 38. In the illustrated embodiment, the radial
  grooves 61 are arranged in diametrical pairs around the central passage 39.
5 [0069]      It is understood that where the hemostatic valve 18 is of a Tuohy-Borst type
  with a threaded end cap, the end cap can be adjusted to increase or decrease
                                                -16

  compression of the seal valve member 37 and/or the friction ring 38 to allow adjustment of
  the friction grip exerted by the seal valve member 37 and/or the friction ring 38 on the
  catheter passing therethrough.
