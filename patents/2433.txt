Methods, systems, and software for accepting bets on contests, such as sporting events,
with wagering terms that change in real-time with the progress of the contests are
disclosed. The disclosed methods, systems, and software may include security features
that check the time at which bets are placed to ensure that they are not being placed in the
interval between when an event occurred in the contest and when the wagering terms were
changed to reflect that the event occurred.

25                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [0005]      Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to systems and methods
   for recognizing quantitative mispricing of gaming markers. More specifically, the
   present invention relates to systems and methods for recognizing quantitative mispricing
   of gaming markers via calculation of a divergence of a gaming marker from its true
30 value.
                                                  1

     WO 2011/094561                                                               PCT/US2011/022952
   [0006]       The fair value of a security is determined as the mid price of the "bid/ask"
   spread, which value is based on the public's perceived value of the security. In other
   words, trades only happen when the security offer price (i.e., the price at which the owner
   is willing to sell the security) is equal to the bid price (i.e., the price at which a buyer is
 5 willing to buy the security). This enables the "market maker" (e.g., a stock broker) to
   profit on a risk free basis. It should be noted that the reason for a market maker's
   existence is to supply liquidity to the market. That is, the market maker functions to
   increase the probability that buy and sell orders from the public are executed. Since the
   market maker does not want to be exposed to directional risk, the market maker allows
10 increased buying pressure to increase the security price so that there will be more
   motivation for sellers to sell and vice versa. During this activity, the market maker is
   making money without risk because there is an equal number of buyers and sellers. In
   short, prices are established based upon a buyer's perception of the value of the securities
   and not what they are worth based on a fundamental analysis.
15 [0007]       The gaming oddsmaker is in the same position as the market maker; he simply
   lives in a different environment. Point spreads, odds, and expected point totals are
   similar to the prices of a stock or other security in that they are established initially by the
   oddsmaker/market maker. They then dynamically adjust relative to supply and demand
   and the public's perception of the value of these items in order to ensure equal action on
20 both sides of the wager, which results in a risk free profit for the oddsmaker/market
   maker.
   [0008]       Based on this understanding, it is necessary to appreciate the theory of "Mean
   Reversion" and relative overbought/oversold mean conditions and to recognize how these
   two concepts relate to the quantitative mispricing that results from the improper
25 perception of gaming marker values which is predicated by the psychology of the gaming
   public.
   [0009]       Means Reversion is a theory suggesting that prices and returns eventually
   move back towards the mean or average. This mean or average can be the historical
   average of the price or return or another relevant average such as the average return of an
30 industry or stock. The related concept of Overbought Mean is a situation in which the
   demand for a certain asset unjustifiably pushes the price of an underlying asset to levels
                                                    2

    WO 2011/094561                                                            PCT/US2011/022952
   that are far above its true value. This is generally interpreted as a sign that the price of
   the asset is becoming overvalued and may experience a pullback in price. Similarly, the
   concept of an Oversold Mean is a situation in which the price of an underlying asset has
   fallen sharply to a level below that at which its true value resides. This condition is
 5 usually a result of market overreaction or panic selling. This is generally interpreted as a
   sign that the price of the asset is becoming undervalued, and it may represent a buying
   opportunity for investors.
   [0010]       This "range determined price movement" is ongoing in stocks, currencies,
   metals, commodities, and gaming. Market psychology is ever-present in the sports book
10 industry, and it leads to short term mispricing in matchups in which one side is
   significantly overbought (overvalued) and the other side is significantly oversold
   (undervalued).
   [0011]       The odds makers know when the public will have an overvalued view or an
   undervalued view of any particular team (or other wagering choice) and will adjust the
15 gaming marker accordingly. The more overvalued a team is based on the perception of
   the public, the greater the chance for Mean Reversion (e.g., that one may profit by
   "selling" the team at that "price") and vice versa.
                             BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

   [0027]       Definitions
   [0028]       Mean Reversion: A theory suggesting that prices and returns eventually move

10 overvalued and may experience a pullback in price.
   [0030]       Oversold Mean: A condition in which the price of an underlying asset has
   fallen sharply to a level below which its true value resides. This condition is usually a
   result of market overreaction or panic selling. This is generally interpreted as a sign that

   [0036]       Certain terminology is used herein for convenience only and is not to be taken
   as a limitation on the present invention. The terminology includes the words specifically
 5 mentioned, derivatives thereof and words of similar import. The embodiments discussed
   herein are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form
   disclosed. These embodiments are chosen and described to best explain the principle of
   the invention and its application and practical use and to enable others skilled in the art to
   best utilize the invention.
10 [0037]       As noted above, the present invention relates to systems and methods for
   determining and evaluating the quantitative mispricing of gaming markers which can be
   used in a variety of analysis situations. The method of the present invention analyzes the
   value of a marker to determine when it is skewed from its actual value due to, for
   example, the effects of buying and selling and/or a plurality of tangible and intangible
15 issues having little or nothing to do with a fundamental analysis of the true value of the
   marker. Specifically, the present invention offers technical analysis in the marketplace of
   sports gaming by quantifying qualitative data to give knowledgeable traders and
   speculators information to help identify profit-inducing short-term trend reversals. Based
   upon the concept of Mean Reversion, the main idea of the present invention is to capture
20 when the expectation of a defined entity (e.g., a team, horse, etc.) is too high or too low.
   When it is too high, it is likely that the defined entity is experiencing an overbought
   mean. Conversely, when it is too low, it is likely that the defined entity is experiencing
   an oversold mean. The theory of Mean Reversion assumes that prices and returns will
   eventually move back toward the mean or average.
25 [0038]       Referring now to Fig. 1, depicted is a method for evaluating defined markers
   in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. First, the method defines at
   least two entities at step 10. The defined entities could be, for example, any head-to-head
   competitors in an upcoming event including, without limitation, sports teams, horses, etc.
   [0039]      Next, at step 12, at least one measured marker is defined. The measured
30 marker could be any one of a variety of aspects of the upcoming event which may be
   applied to both entities. For example, the marker could be a point spread in a football
                                                   7

     WO 2011/094561                                                            PCT/US2011/022952
   game or a Beyer's number (i.e., a number assigned to a horse that quantifies the horse's
   past performance) in a horse race.
   [0040]       At step 14, a cumulative period of events of the two entities, each event
   having the measured marker, is defined. The cumulative period is the period of time over
 5 which the defined markers will be evaluated for the defined entities. For example, if the
   defined entities are football teams, the cumulative period of events may be the past five
   games played by the football teams.
   [0041]       Next, at step 16, the method assigns a value to the measured marker based
   upon the ability of each of the at least two entities to achieve (or fail to achieve) the
10 measured marker during the cumulative period defined in step 14. The assigned value is
   based upon a predefined number which represents equal deviations from a value of zero.
   In this embodiment, an integer value is assigned to the marker for each event occurring
   during the cumulative period, and the integer value is based upon the ability of each of
   the at least two entities to achieve (or fail to achieve) the marker for the respective event.
15 The sum of the integer values assigned to the marker(s) may be used to define the
   divergence spread. Most commonly, the integer value is -1, 0, or +1 for each event.
   However, more complex values such as those calculated by an algorithm, may be
   substituted without departing from the scope of the present invention.
   [0042]       For example, in an embodiment of the present invention in which the defined
20 marker is whether a football team will beat the point spread, for each event in which a
   football team beats the point spread, the event is assigned a positive number such as + 1.
   In contrast, for each event in which the team does not beat (or cover) the point spread, the
   event is assigned a negative number such as -1. In this manner, each event played by the
   entity during the defined cumulative period is assigned a value. This same method may
25 be used to assign values to any marker for the events occurring during a given period of
   time, thereby allowing the method of the present invention to be utilized for markers
   other than beating a point spread of a football game.
   [0043]       Additionally, in some embodiments of the present invention, the value
   assigned to the measured marker may be weighted to denote greater significance to an
30 event. For example, the values assigned to the measured marker may be weighted based
                                                    8

    WO 2011/094561                                                              PCT/US2011/022952
   upon chronological order to allow the most recent events in the defined cumulative
   period to have a higher significance than events occurring farther back in time.
   [0044]      The method continues at step 18 by measuring the divergence spread of the
   value of the measured marker during the cumulative period 18. Divergence spread may
 5 be measured via one or more calculations involving the values assigned to the measured
   markers in step 16 as discussed in greater detail below with regards to specific examples
   of the present invention. Divergence spread may be measured for a single entity.
   Alternatively, divergence spread may be measured for two entities, which allows the
   divergence spread of the two entities to be compared or manipulated as discussed herein
10 to determine one entity's future ability to achieve (or fail to achieve) a particular marker
   in a competition against the second entity.
   [0045]      Thereafter, at step 20, divergence may be quantified based upon a selected
   number of events occurring during the cumulative period. First, the divergence spread
   measured in step 18 is divided by a divergence strength number ("DSN")(i.e., the number
15 of events occurring during the cumulative period that the user decides to include in his or
   her assessment of the strength of the team). The DSN will vary at the discretion of the
   user. For example, if the divergence over a five game period is 8, then 8 would be
   divided by 5 to determine a calculated quantitative value of 1.6 based upon a team's
   performance in its last five games.
20 [0046]      In some embodiments of the present invention, the calculated quantitative
   value may then be compared to a scale of quantitative values to determine the
   significance of the quantitative value of the marker. In some embodiments, the
   significance of the quantitative value will alert a user as to the likelihood that the defined
   marker may or may not be met in the next competition, or event, due to the theory of
25 Mean Reversion.
   [0047]      In an additional optional step of the present invention, the method of Fig. 1
   may be utilized to alert a user if an estimated marker of an upcoming event (e.g., a point
   spread for an upcoming football game) generates a calculated quantitative value that is
   determined to be statistically significant (i.e., the value indicates that the likelihood of
30 mispricing of the marker is high). In such an embodiment of the present invention, the
   quantitative values of one or more markers are calculated for a variety of upcoming

   sporting events. An algorithm then compares the calculated quantitative value to one or
   more predefined thresholds (such thresholds may be derived from a scale or customized
   by a user) to determine which values are considered to be statistically significant (i.e., it
   is likely that the marker has been mispriced). Scales of statistical significance may be
 5 developed based upon theories of relative strength indicators ("RSI") as appreciated by
   those skilled in the art.
   [0048]       Any one or more of the quantitative values determined to be statistically
   significant may then be alerted to a user of the present invention. For example, the
   method of the present invention may be offered as a service to multiple clients who
10 define entities of interest. When a quantitative value for the client's entity of interest is
   determined to be statistically significant, the service provider, or the service provider's
   system, may then alert the client to the quantitative value to allow the client to use the
   information as a tool to predict an entity's ability to achieve, or fail to achieve, the
   specified marker in the entity's next competition. In this manner, the present invention
15 identifies and analyzes fundamentals (e.g. factors which affect value) via a technical
   analysis that assists a user to estimate the future values of particular markers.
   [0049]       Referring now to Fig. 2, depicted is an exemplary system 250 for
   implementing embodiments of the present invention. This exemplary system includes,
   inter alia, a computing device, such as computing device 200. In its most basic
20 configuration, computing device 200 typically includes at least one processing unit 202
   and memory 204. Depending on the exact configuration and type of computing device,
   memory 204 may be volatile (such as random access memory (RAM)), non-volatile (such
   as read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, etc.), or some combination of the two. This
   most basic configuration is illustrated in Fig. 2 by dashed line 206. Computing device
25 200 may have additional features/functionality. For example, computing device 200 may
   include additional storage (removable and/or non-removable) including, but not limited
   to, magnetic or optical disks or tape, thumbdrives, and external hard drives. Such
   additional storage is illustrated in Fig. 2 by removable storage 208 and non-removable
   storage 210.
30 [0050]       Computing device 200 typically includes or is provided with a variety of
   computer-readable media. Computer-readable media can be any available media that can
                                                   10

     WO 2011/094561                                                          PCT/US2011/022952
   be accessed by computing device 200 and includes both volatile and non-volatile media,
   removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer
   readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media.
   [0051]      Computer storage media includes volatile and non-volatile, removable and
 5 non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of
   information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or
   other data. Memory 204, removable storage 208, and non-removable storage 210 are all
   examples of computer storage media. Computer storage media includes, but is not
   limited to, RAM, ROM, electrically erasable programmable read-only memory
10 (EEPROM), flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks
   (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage
   or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the
   desired information and which can accessed by computing device 200. Any such
   computer storage media may be part of computing device 200.
15 [0052]      Computing device 200 may also contain communications connection(s) 212
   that allow the device to communicate with other devices. Each such communications
   connection 212 is an example of communication media. Communication media typically
   embodies computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data
   in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and
20 includes any information delivery media. The term "modulated data signal" means a
   signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to
   encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication
   media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and
   wireless media such as acoustic, radio frequency ("RF"), infrared and other wireless
25 media. The term computer-readable media as used herein includes both storage media
   and communication media.
   [0053]      Computing device 200 may also have input device(s) 214 such as keyboard,
   mouse, pen, voice input device, touch input device, etc. Output device(s) 216 such as a
   display, speakers, printer, etc. may also be included. All these devices are generally
30 known to the relevant public and therefore need not be discussed in any detail herein
   except as provided.

   [0054]       Notably, computing device 200 may be one of a plurality of computing
   devices 200 inter-connected by a network 218. Internet-equipped mobile device 201 may
   be one of a plurality of mobile devices 201 capable of being interconnected to one or
   more computing devices 200 and/or server 220 by a network 218. As may be
 5 appreciated, the network 218 may be any appropriate network, each computing device
   200 and/or Internet-equipped mobile device 201 may be connected thereto by way of a
   connection 212 in any appropriate manner, and each computing device 200 and/or
   Internet-equipped mobile device 201 may communicate with one or more of the other
   computing devices 200 and/or Internet-equipped mobile device 201 in the network 218 in
10 any appropriate manner. For example, the network 218 may be a wired or wireless
   network within an organization or home or the like, and may include a direct or indirect
   coupling to an external network such as the Internet or the like. Likewise, the network
   218 may be such an external network. Computing device 200 and/or Internet-equipped
   mobile device 201 may connect to a server 220 on the Internet via such an external
15 network.
   [0055]       It should be understood that the various techniques described herein may be
   implemented in connection with hardware or software or, where appropriate, with a
   combination of both. Thus, the methods and apparatus of the presently disclosed subject
   matter, or certain aspects or portions thereof, may take the form of program code (i.e.,
20 instructions, scripts, and the like) embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes,
   CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other machine-readable storage medium wherein, when
   the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the
   machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the presently disclosed subject matter.
   [0056]       In the case of program code execution on programmable computers, the
25 computing device generally includes a processor, a storage medium readable by the
   processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and/or storage elements), at least
   one input device, and at least one output device. One or more programs may implement
   or utilize the processes described in connection with the presently disclosed subject
   matter, e.g., through the use of an application-program interface (API), reusable controls,
30 or the like. Such programs may be implemented in a high-level procedural or object
   oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the
                                                  12

    WO 2011/094561                                                         PCT/US2011/022952
   program(s) can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any
   case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language, and combined with
   hardware implementations.
   [0057]      Although exemplary embodiments may refer to utilizing aspects of the
 5 presently disclosed subject matter in the context of one or more stand-alone computer
   systems, the subject matter is not so limited, but rather may be implemented in
   connection with any computing environment, such as a network 218 or a distributed
   computing environment. Still further, aspects of the presently disclosed subject matter
   may be implemented in or across a plurality of processing chips or devices, and storage
10 may similarly be effected across a plurality of devices in a network 218. Such devices
   might include personal computers, network servers, and handheld devices, for example.
   [0058]      In the exemplary system 250, server 420 includes a database 224. In the
   exemplary embodiment of the present invention depicted in Fig. 2, database 224 is a
   structured query language ("SQL") database with a relational database management
15 system, namely, MySQL as is commonly known and used in the art. However, other
   databases may be substituted without departing from the scope of the present invention
   including, but not limited to, PostgreSQL and Oracle databases.
   [0059]      The invention will now be described by way of the following examples which
   are not to be interpreted as limiting in any manner.
20 [0060]      Example 1
   [0061]      Systems and methods of the present invention may be applied to sporting
   event competitions for various markers. One such marker may be game win/loss (i.e.,
   whether the expected favorite will win an upcoming sporting event).
   [0062]      Referring now to Fig. 3, depicted is a method for automatically displaying a
25 quantification of a divergence to a user in accordance with one embodiment of the
   present invention. Process 300 begins at 302, at which a user wishes to view a
   quantification of a divergence for an upcoming sporting event in which they are
   interested. In one exemplary Internet embodiment of the present invention, a user begins
   this process by accessing a web page on the Internet via a Uniform Resource Locator
30 ("URL") such as http://www.sportsactioncharts.com. The Web page is accessed by
   entering the URL into a Web browser program executed by a computing device such as
                                                 13

    WO 2011/094561                                                              PCT/US2011/022952
   computing device 200. The Web browser program may be any such commonly known
   program including, but not limited to, Microsoft's Internet Explorer® and Mozilla's
   Firefox*. The URL is the address of a resource located on the Internet that consists of a
   communications protocol followed by the name or address of a computer on the network.
 5 The URL may also include additional locating information such as directory, file name,
   and the like. In our exemplary embodiment, the entering of the URL
   bgp'vv               fortsactioncharts com at a computing device 200 connects computing device
   200 through a network 218 (in our example, network 218 is the Internet) to a computer
   (i.e., in this example, server 220) having an address of
10 http://wwv.sportsactioncharts.com. This connection allows server 220 to provide Web
   pages and Web page content via Internet 218 to a user of method 300 via the Web
   browser located on his or her computing device 200. Process 300 then proceeds to 304.
   Although network 218 is the Internet in this exemplary embodiment of the present
   invention, networks other than the Internet (e.g., a Local Area Lan, Intranet, etc.) may be
15 substituted without departing from the scope of the present invention.
   [0063]        Next, at 304, server 220 provides the user's Web browser with a Web page
   depicting various upcoming sporting events for which the divergence of gaming markers
   may be quantified such as the Web page depicted in Fig. 4. This Web page allows a user
   to select various information regarding the divergence to be quantified via a plurality of
20 pull-down menus including, without limitation: date of the sporting event (pull-down
   menu 402); competitors in sporting event (pull-down menu 404); the number of historical
   (already played) events a user wishes to include in his or her assessment of the gaming
   marker for the next event (pull-down menu 406); and gaming marker to be analyzed and
   form of gaming marker graph (pull-down menu 408). In the depicted Web page, a user
25 has selected pull-down choices in order to quantify the divergence of a gaming marker
   for the July 26, 2010 baseball game between the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles
   Angels. The user has also requested use of data for the last seven games played by both
   teams in the calculation of the divergence by selecting a number of 7 in pull-down menu
   406. Selecting win/loss in pull-down menu 408 notifies the system that the gaming
30 marker selected by the user is game win/loss (i.e., which team will win or lose the game)
   and the user wishes to see a graph of game win/loss in which the actual win or loss for
                                                      14

    WO 2011/094561                                                            PCT/US2011/022952
   each event is the data value. An alternate graph option that may also be selected via pull
   down menu 408 is a "Cumulative Game Win/Loss" option as discussed in greater detail
   below with respect to Fig. 6.
   [0064]      Next, process 300 proceeds to 306, at which the user has entered all selections
 5 in the available pull-down menus. The user then clicks on the chart-it link 410 to activate
   the system to generate a graph of game win/losses and to calculate a divergence value in
   accordance with the data entered by the user.
   [0065]      Next, at step 308, the database connection and authorization values are set to
   allow server 220 to establish a connection to database 224 to allow historical data for
10 game win or loss for the last seven events (as selected by the user)(or, alternatively,
   previously assigned data values as discussed in greater detail below) for each of the two
   selected entities to be retrieved therefrom. This historical data is required to calculate the
   divergence of the upcoming event. It should be noted that although the historical
   information in our example relates to game win/loss, other types of data may be stored
15 and/or analyzed including, but not limited to, point spread, point spread win/loss,
   over/under, over/under win/loss and the like.
   [0066]       Database 224 may be automatically or manually programmed with
   information prior to execution of a method such as method 300, and it may be
   automatically updated on a periodic basis (e.g., after each event, daily, weekly, etc.) to
20 ensure that it contains the most up-to-date information. Or such information may be
   updated upon the request of a user. In one embodiment of the present invention, data is
   updated automatically via methods including, but not limited to, third party data feeds
   (e.g., Extensible Markup Language ("XML") data feeds) and pulling data from third
   party databases via PHP Hypertext Preprocessor ("PHP") Simple Object Access Protocol
25 ("SOAP") scripts, Application Programming Interface ("API") scripts, or the like. Server
   220 may pull this information in this manner from any one or more of a variety of
   commercial information sources associated with gaming through an Internet connection
   or the like. In such an embodiment, network 218 is the Internet and the commercial
   information sources are typically available via a computing device connected thereto in
30 the same manner as server 220 and/or computing devices 200.
                                                 15

    WO 2011/094561                                                            PCT/US2011/022952
   [0067]      Alternatively, information in database 224 may be manually updated. In one
   embodiment of the present invention, a data entry team manually updates database 224
   with information gathered from other sources (e.g., newspapers, television, the Internet,
   etc.). However, alternate methods of updating the data in database 224 may be
 5 substituted without departing from the scope of the present invention.
   [0068]      After the database connection and authorization values are set in step 308,
   process 300 proceeds to 314, at which a bi-directional database connection is established.
   This connection allows server 220 to communicate with database 224 to retrieve the
   required historical data. Process 300 then proceeds to 316.
10 [0069]      At 316, process 300 will retrieve the data required to assign a value to the
   measured marker for each event in the selected cumulative time period of seven games
   back (or, if a value has previously been assigned, the assigned value may be retrieved as
   discussed in greater detail below). Since the marker selected by the user is game
   win/loss, server 220 executes a game win/loss value query for each of the selected teams
15 for each of the last seven games played. Once this data is retrieved, the process then
   proceeds to step 318.
   [0070]      At 318, a value is assigned to each event for each team for the last seven
   games played. In this embodiment, a value of +1 is applied for each game win and a
   value of -I is applied for each game loss. In some embodiments of the present invention,
20 the assigned value is stored in database 224 in relation to the historical game win/loss
   information to avoid the need to re-assign the value the next time the same historical
   game win/loss information is required. That is, on a second iteration of step 318, if a
   value has previously been assigned, the previously assigned value is simply retrieved (the
   value is not re-assigned).
25 [0071]      Next, at 320, for each team, all of the values for each of the last seven games
   are summed to create a cumulative game win/loss value. At 322, the cumulative game
   win/loss values are compared and the lower cumulative win/loss value is subtracted from
   the higher cumulative win/loss value to calculate a divergence spread. In the depicted
   embodiment of the present invention, data will not be calculated if any of the required
30 data values are not available. For example, if a user has requested a divergence value
   calculated for seven games back and one (or both) of the teams has not played seven
                                                 16

    WO 2011/094561                                                            PCT/US2011/022952
   games, the divergence value will be returned to the user as NULL. However, alternate
   embodiments of the present invention are envisioned in which dummy data or estimates
   may be substituted for missing data values.
   [0072]      Next, at 324, the divergence spread is divided by the DSN, the latter of which
 5 is simply the number of games back for which data shall be analyzed. That is, the DSN is
   the number of past games the user decides to include in his or her assessment of the
   strength of the team, and it will vary at the discretion of the user. In our example, the
   DSN equals 7. The result of this calculation is the divergence value.
   [0073]      After the divergence value has been calculated, process 300 proceeds to 326 at
10 which it is displayed to a user via a Web page such as that depicted in Fig. 5. Please note
   that the Web pages of Figs. 4 and 5 are nearly identical with the exception that the Web
   page in Fig. 5 includes the game win/loss divergence number 512 and a graph 514
   depicting the performance of both teams in the last seven games. In this example, the
   chart in Fig. 5 shows the win or loss of each game in accordance with the values assigned
15 to each win or loss in step 318 as discussed above (i.e., each win is depicted as a +1 and
   each loss is depicted as a -1).
   [0074]      In an alternate embodiment of graph 514 created for a user, the graph depicts
   cumulative game win/loss rather than per event game loss. Such a graph 614 is depicted
   in Fig. 6 and it may be substituted for graph 514, or provided in addition to graph 514. In
20 one embodiment of the present invention, a user simply selects a "Cumulative Game
   Win/Loss" option from pull-down menu 408 as discussed in greater detail above.
   [0075]      As seen in Fig. 6, the game win/loss line for each event is cumulative. For
   example, when reviewing data line 602 for Philadelphia ("PHI"), graph 614 indicates that
   PHI lost the seventh game back since it is charted as a -1. Graph 614 further indicates
25 that PHI lost the 5t and 6t games back as well since the data line is decremented by 1 for
   each loss. This results in a cumulative game win/loss value of -3 at five games back.
   Data line 602 then indicates that PHI wins the following four games as the data line is
   incremented by +1 for each game resulting in a cumulative game win/loss value of +1 at
   one game back.
30 [0076]      Similarly, the data line 604 for Colorado ("COL") indicates that COL lost the
   seventh game back since it is charted as a -1. Graph 614 further indicates that COL won
                                                  17

    WO 2011/094561                                                           PCT/US2011/022952
   the 6" game back since the data line is incremented by 1 at this point on the y axis. This
   results in a cumulative game win/loss value of 0 at six games back. Data line 604 then
   indicates that COL loses all of the following five games as the data line is decremented
   by 1 for each game resulting in a cumulative game win/loss value of -5 at one game back.
 5 [0077]       A cumulative game win/loss graph may be preferred by a user of the method.
   Also, when calculating divergence, the cumulative game win/loss graph eliminates the
   need to sum the values assigned to each event since the graph performs this function.
   Each sum for all events in the cumulative time period is simply equal to the value of one
   game back (as presented on the cumulative game win/loss graph).
10 [0078]       Referring back to Fig. 5, the calculated divergence 512 is depicted as 0.29.
   This value is derived as discussed above by summing each of the values assigned to the
   game win/loss of each event for each team. Therefore, the sum of the game win/loss for
   the Boston Red Sox equals the sum of the data points plotted on data line 502, or +1, -1,
   -1, -1, -1, +1, and -1 (i.e., the assigned values for seven games back through one game
15 back, respectively), for a total of -3. The sum of the game win/loss for the Los Angeles
   Angels equals the sum of the data points plotted on data line 504, or -1, +1, -1, +1, +1, -1,
   and -1 (i.e., the assigned values for seven games back through one game back,
   respectively), for a total of -1. The divergence spread is calculated by subtracting the
   lower value of -3 from the higher value of -I for a total of 2. The divergence spread of 2
20 is divided by the DSN of 7 (as selected by the user) to equal a divergence of 0.2857,
   which is rounded up to 0.29.
   [0079]       Finally, at step 328, the calculated divergence may be compared to a scale for
   such divergence to determine whether the calculated divergence is statistically
   significant. One such scale follows below in Table 1:

   [0080]       The higher the statistical significance of the calculated divergence of the
 5 measured marker, the higher the likelihood that Means Reversion will cause an entity to
   fail to achieve an expected marker. In our example, the divergence value of 0.29 rates a
   Not Significant in the scale of Table 1. Therefore, it is not likely that Means Reversion
   will cause an unexpected result in the upcoming competition between Boston and Los
   Angeles.
10 [0081]       In one embodiment of the present invention, the system or method alerts a
   user when the divergence of a specific measured marker falls within a pre-determined
   range (e.g., Very Significant or Extremely Significant) as determined by the scale of
   Table 1.
   [0082]       In one embodiment of the present invention, a user is alerted to the
15 significance of all upcoming competitions in a particular sport by selecting "Alert" in the
   pull-down menu 408. This selection generates a Web page such as that depicted in Fig.
   10. Fig. 10 displays a grid 1000 having columns 1002 through 1018 as the grid proceeds
   from left to right.
   [0083]       Column 1002 depicts the date of an upcoming sporting event. The sporting
20 events depicted in grid 1000 are Major League Baseball sporting events, but divergence
   may be analyzed and/or alert grids may be created for any type of competition including,
   but not limited to, those for the National Football League, NCAA Football, the National
   Basketball Association, NCAA Basketball, and the National Hockey League. Columns
   1004 and 1006 list the home and away competitors for each game, respectively.
25 [0084]       Columns 1008 through 1012 display the calculated game win/loss divergence
   for each upcoming competition using historical data for three, five, and seven games back
                                                   19

    WO 2011/094561                                                           PCT/US2011/022952
   depicted in dedicated columns 1008a, 1010a, and 1012a, respectively. Divergence is
   calculated as discussed above. Each divergence value has an associated team listed to its
   right in columns 1008b, 10 1Ob, and 1012b, respectively. The listed team is the one that is
   being estimated as oversold or underpriced.
 5 [0085]      Similarly, columns 1014, 1016, and 1018 list the over/under divergence
   values (which may be calculated as discussed below in Example 2) for three, five, and
   seven games back, respectively. Importantly, each divergence value is compared to the
   scales of Table 1 (above) and/or Table 2 (below), and the background of the cell in which
   the data is contained is colored in accordance with the respective table. For example, if a
10 divergence value falls in a range that is "Not Significant", the cell background will have
   no color. Conversely, if a divergence value falls in a range that is "Extremely
   Significant", the cell background will be red. Exemplary cell 1020 depicts a cell having a
   colored background. This allows a viewer of the grid to quickly and easily determine
   divergence values with high significance as these values indicate the likelihood of an
15 unexpected result due to Means Reversion. Although grid 1000 depicts values for three,
   five, and seven games back, values may be calculated for any number of games back.
   [0086]      In another embodiment of the present invention, server 220 is programmed to
   automatically alert a user when a divergence value of interest falls into a particular
   category. For example, a user may request automatic notification if a game involving the
20 New York Yankees has a divergence that is extremely significant. In this scenario, if
   divergence falls within the range of 1.6 to 2.0, an alert may be automatically sent to the
   user from server 220 through a network such as the Internet to, for example, the user's
   computer, cell phone, or other mobile device (e.g., an Internet-enabled mobile device 201
   as discussed above).
25 [0087]      As discussed herein, the basic premise behind the present invention is that the
   oddsmaker will set odds that always try to achieve a 50 - 50 probability. Public
   perception and/or wagering are likely to cause a measured marker estimated by an
   oddsmaker to diverge from a value that would result from a true fundamental analysis. In
   a situation in which Team B is the underdog and Team A is the favored team expected to
30 beat the point spread, if Team A has historically beat the point spread several times while
   Team B has not historically beat the point spread, Means Reversion would expect that
                                                20

    WO 2011/094561                                                            PCT/US2011/022952
   Team A will not score enough points to beat the point spread in its upcoming
   competition. The likelihood that Means Reversion will cause an unexpected result is
   indicated by the significance of the divergence as per the scale of Table 1. In other
   words, the categories of statistical significance assist a user placing a wager in
 5 determining the likelihood of the occurrence of Means Reversion in the upcoming
   competition in order to allow the user to place his or her wager accordingly.
   [0088]      Example 2
   [0089]      Similar to Example 1, Example 2 is also an application of the systems and
   methods of the present invention to sporting event competitions for various markers. In
10 this example, the marker is over/under (i.e., whether the total combined points of the
   upcoming sporting event will exceed the over/under value estimated by an oddsmaker).
   [0090]      Referring back to Fig. 3, depicted is a method for automatically displaying a
   quantification of a divergence to a user in accordance with one embodiment of the
   present invention. This process may be used for calculation of over/under divergence as
15 well as game/win loss divergence as discussed below.
   [0091]      Process 300 begins at 302, at which a user wishes to view a quantification of a
   divergence for over/under for an upcoming sporting event in which they are interested.
   In one exemplary Internet embodiment of the present invention, a user begins this process
   by accessing a web page on the Internet as discussed in greater detail above with respect
20 to Example 1.
   [0092]      Next, at 304, server 220 provides the user's Web browser with a Web page
   depicting various upcoming sporting events for which the divergence of gaming markers
   may be quantified such as the Web page depicted in Fig. 4. This Web page allows a user
   to select various information regarding the divergence to be quantified via a plurality of
25 pull-down menus as also discussed above in greater detail with respect to Example 1.
   [0093]      Next, process 300 proceeds to 306, at which the user has entered all selections
   in the available pull-down menus. The user then clicks on the chart-it link 410 to activate
   the system to generate a graph of over/under win/losses and to calculate a divergence
   value in accordance with the data entered by the user. It should be noted that: an
30 over/under win occurs when the total points scored in the event exceeded the over/under
   value estimated by the oddsmaker for that event; an over/under loss occurs when the total
                                                  21

    WO 2011/094561                                                           PCT/US2011/022952
   points scored in the event falls below the over/under value estimated by the oddsmaker
   for that event; and an over/under push occurs when the total points scored in the event is
   equal to the over/under value estimated by the oddsmaker for that event.
   [0094]       An exemplary Web page that may result for this example based upon the
 5 user's selections and the calculation of the steps discussed below is depicted in Fig. 7. In
   this figure, we see that the user has selected pull-down choices in order to quantify the
   divergence of an over/under gaming marker for the July 26, 2010 baseball game between
   the New York Yankees and the Cleveland Indians. The user has also requested use of
   data for the last seven games played by both teams in the calculation of the divergence by
10 selecting a number of 7 in pull-down menu 406. Selecting "Over vs Unders" in pull
   down menu 408 notifies the system that the gaming marker selected by the user is
   over/under (i.e., whether the total number of points scored in the game will exceed the
   over/under value estimated by the oddsmaker) and the user wishes to see a graph of
   over/under win/loss data in which the actual over/under win or loss for each event is the
15 data value. An alternate graph option that may also be selected via pull-down menu 408
   is a "Cumulative Over/Under Win/Loss" option as discussed in greater detail below with
   respect to Fig. 8.
   [0095]       Next, at step 308, the database connection and authorization values are set to
   allow server 220 to establish a connection to database 224 to allow historical data for
20 over/under for the last seven events (as selected by the user in step 304) for each of the
   two selected entities to be retrieved therefrom. This historical data is required to
   calculate the divergence of the upcoming event.
   [0096]       After the database connection and authorization values are set in step 308,
   process 300 proceeds to 314, at which a bi-directional database connection is established.
25 This connection allows server 220 to communicate with database 224 to retrieve the
   required historical data. Process 300 then proceeds to 316.
   [0097]       At 316, process 300 will retrieve the data required to assign a value to the
   measured marker for each event in the selected cumulative time period of seven games
   back. Since the marker selected by the user is over/under, server 220 executes an
30 over/under value query for each of the selected teams for each of the last seven games
   played. Once this data is retrieved, the process then proceeds to step 318.
                                                 22

    WO 2011/094561                                                           PCT/US2011/022952
   [0098]      At 318, a value is assigned to each event for each team for the last seven
   games played. In this embodiment, a value of +1 is applied for each event in which the
   total number of points scored in the event exceeded the over/under value estimated by the
   oddsmaker for that event. A value of -I is applied for each event in which the total
 5 number of points scored in the event fell below the over/under value estimated by the
   oddsmaker for that event. A value of 0 is applied for each event in which the total
   number of points scored in the event equalled the over/under value estimated by the
   oddsmaker for that event. That is, a straight over/under win or loss value is associated
   with each event.
10 [0099]      Various other embodiments for assigning values are envisioned. In one
   scenario, the value assigned to one or more events is the numerical difference between an
   actual outcome of an event and the estimated outcome of the event. For example, in the
   case of over/under, the actual number of points by which a team exceeded the over/under
   value or failed to meet the over/under value would be the assigned value. In another
15 example involving a point spread, the actual number of points by which a team exceeded
   the point spread or failed to meet the point spread would be the assigned value.
   [00100]     In another embodiment, the value assigned to one or more events is the
   percentage difference between an actual outcome of an event and the estimated outcome
   of the event. For example, in the case of over/under, the percentage by which a team
20 exceeded the over/under value or failed to meet the over/under value would be the
   assigned value. In another example involving a point spread, the percentage by which a
   team exceeded the point spread or failed to meet the point spread would be the assigned
   value. These examples are not meant to be limiting as the invention may assume many
   forms of assigned values.
25 [00101]     Next, at 320, for each team, all of the values for each of the last seven games
   are summed to create a cumulative over/under win/loss value. At 322, the cumulative
   over/under values are compared and the lower cumulative over/under value is added to
   the higher cumulative over/under value to calculate a divergence spread.
   [00102]     Next, at 324, the divergence spread is divided by the DSN. In our example,
30 the DSN equals 7. The result of this calculation is the divergence value.
                                                 23

     WO 2011/094561                                                         PCT/US2011/022952
   [00103]     After the divergence value has been calculated, process 300 proceeds to 326 at
   which the divergence value and/or one or more graphs are displayed to a user via a Web
   page such as that depicted in Fig. 7. Please note that the Web pages of Figs. 4 and 7 are
   nearly identical with the exception that the Web page in Fig. 7 includes the over/under
 5 divergence number 720 and a graph 714 depicting the over/under performance of both
   teams in the last seven games. In this example, the chart in Fig. 7 shows the over/under
   win, loss, or push of each game in accordance with the values assigned to each win, loss,
   or push in step 318 as discussed above (i.e., each win is depicted as a +1, each loss is
   depicted as a -1, and each push is depicted as a 0).
10 [00104]     In an alternate embodiment of graph 714 created for a user, the graph depicts
   cumulative over/under win/loss rather than per event over/under loss. Such a graph 814
   is depicted in Fig. 8 and it may be substituted for graph 714, or provided in addition to
   graph 714. In one embodiment of the present invention, a user simply selects a
   "Cumulative Over/Under" option from pull-down menu 408.
15 [00105]      As seen in Fig. 8, the over/under win/loss line for each event and for both
   teams is cumulative. For example, when reviewing data line 802, which is a combined
   data line for both the New York Yankees ("NYY") and the Cleveland Indians ("CLE"),
   graph 814 indicates that both events played by NYY and CLE five games back had total
   points that exceeded the over/under value estimated by the oddsmaker for each event.
20 That is, the data value at five games back is +2 because NYY beat the over/under in its
   5 game back (resulting in assignment of a value of +1) and CLE beat the over/under in
   its 5  game back (resulting in assignment of a value of +1), therefore, the data value is
   the sum of these two events, or +2.
   [00106]     At four games back, graph 814 has a data value of +2. The change from the
25 previous data value is zero (i.e., +2 remains +2 from five games back to four games
   back). This indicates that either both NYY and CLE pushed (0 summed with 0 equals
   zero) or that one team beat the over/under and one team lost the over/under (+1 summed
   with -1 equals zero).
   [00107]     Similarly, the data values of 0 at three games back and -2 at two games back
30 indicate that both teams failed to beat the over/under (-1 summed with -1 equals -2). At
   one game back, the data value is -3, which is a decrease of one as compared to the data
                                                 24

     WO 2011/094561                                                          PCT/US2011/022952
   value at two games back. This change indicates that one team lost and one team pushed
   (-1 summed with 0 equals -1).
   [00108]      A cumulative over/under graph may be preferred by a user of the method.
   This graph makes it easier for a user to view the performance of both teams as one
 5 cumulative graph. Data line 802 depicts the overall trend of both teams' scoring abilities.
   Very high and very low levels for the cumulative over/under data line show very hot or
   very cold teams, respectively. That is, hot teams have historically scored a higher
   quantity of points which drives up the perception that the teams will continue to stay hot.
   Similarly, cold teams have historically scored a low quantity of points which drives up
10 the perception that the teams will continue to stay cold.
   [00109]      Also, when calculating divergence, the cumulative over/under graph
   eliminates the need to sum the values assigned to each event since the graph performs
   this function. Each sum for all events in the cumulative time period is simply equal to the
   value of one game back (as presented on the cumulative over/under graph). As depicted
15 in Fig. 8, the over under divergence is -0.60. This value may be calculated by dividing
   the data point at one game back (i.e., -3) by the DSN of 5 (in this example, the user has
   selected to see divergence data based upon the historical data for five games back)
   [00110]      In yet another alternate embodiment of graph 714 created for a user, the graph
   depicts actual over/under values in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the
20 present invention. Such a graph 914 is depicted in Fig. 9 and it may be substituted for
   graph 714, or provided in addition to graph 714. In one embodiment of the present
   invention, a user simply selects an "Actual Over/Under Values" option from pull-down
   menu 408 as discussed in greater detail above.
   [00111]      As seen in Fig. 9, the actual over/under line of graph 914 includes data that
25 indicates the actual number of points by which each team beat the over/under estimate for
   a particular game. For example, data line 902 represents historical over/under data for
   NYY. At seven games back through one game back, data line 902 indicates that NYY
   beat its over/under by 8, 10, 9, 9, 10, 11, and 10 points, respectively. Data line 904
   represents historical over/under data for CLE. At seven games back through one game
30 back, data line 904 indicates that CLE beat its over/under by 10, 9, 10, 8, 9, 8, and 9
   points, respectively.
                                                  25

    WO 2011/094561                                                             PCT/US2011/022952
   [00112]       Referring back to Fig. 7, the calculated over/under divergence 720 is 0.14.
   This value is derived as discussed above by summing each of the values assigned to the
   over/under of each event for each team. Therefore, the sum of the over/under values
   assigned for NYY equals the sum of +1, +1, +1, +1, -1, 0, and +1 (i.e., the assigned
 5 values for seven games back through one game back, respectively) for a total of +4. The
   sum of the over/under assigned values for CLE equals the sum of -1, +1, -1, -1, -1, +1,
   and -1 (i.e., the assigned values for seven games back through one game back,
   respectively) for a total of -3. The divergence spread is calculated by adding these two
   sums together (+4 + -3) for a total of 1. The divergence spread of 1 is divided by the
10 DSN of 7 (as selected by the user) to equal a divergence of 0.1428, which is rounded
   down to 0.14.
   [00113]       Finally, at step 328, the calculated divergence may be compared to a scale for
   such divergence to determine whether the calculated divergence is statistically
   significant. The scale of Table 1 above may be used for determining the significance of
15 the divergence value. In addition, negative over/under divergence values may be
   categorized according to the following Table 2:
                                                 Table 2
                 Range                          Significance                   Color Coding
               -0.79 to 0                     Not Significant                    No Color
             -0.8 to -1.19                      Significant                       Yellow
            -1.20 to -1.59                   Very Significant                     Orange
            -1.60 to -2.00                 Extremely Significant                   Red
20
   [00114]       The higher the statistical significance of the calculated divergence of the
   measured marker, the higher the likelihood that Means Reversion will cause an entity to
   fail to achieve an expected marker. In our example, the divergence value of 0.14 rates a
   Not Significant in the scale of Table 1. Therefore, it is not likely that Means Reversion
25 will cause an unexpected result in the upcoming competition between NYY and CLE.

   Additionally, a significant divergence value may be programmed to alert a user as
   discussed in greater detail above with respect to Example 1.
   [00115]      Example 3
   [00116]      Similar to Example 1, Example 3 is also an application of the systems and
 5 methods of the present invention to sporting event competitions for various markers. In
   this example, the marker is against the spread ("ATS")(i.e., a team beats the spread if it
   beats the opposing team by a greater number of points than the spread estimated by the
   oddsmaker).
   [00117]      Referring back to Fig. 3, depicted is a method for automatically displaying a
10 quantification of a divergence to a user in accordance with one embodiment of the
   present invention. This process may be used for calculation of ATS divergence as well as
   game/win loss divergence as discussed below.
   [00118]      Process 300 begins at 302, at which a user wishes to view a quantification of a
   divergence for ATS for an upcoming sporting event in which he or she is interested. In
15 one exemplary Internet embodiment of the present invention, a user begins this process
   by accessing a web page on the Internet as discussed in greater detail above with respect
   to Example 1.
   [00119]     Next, at 304, server 220 provides the user's Web browser with a Web page
   depicting various upcoming sporting events for which the divergence of gaming markers
20 may be quantified such as the Web page depicted in Fig. 4. This Web page allows a user
   to select various information regarding the divergence to be quantified via a plurality of
   pull-down menus as also discussed above in greater detail with respect to Example 1.
   [00120]     Next, process 300 proceeds to 306, at which the user has entered all selections
   in the available pull-down menus. For this example, the user will select an option such as
25 "Against the Spead" in pull-down menu 408. The user then clicks on the chart-it link 410
   to activate the system to generate a graph of ATS win/losses/pushes and to calculate a
   divergence value in accordance with the data entered by the user. It should be noted that:
   an ATS win occurs when the winning team beats the losing team by a greater number of
   points than the spread estimated by the oddsmaker for that event (i.e., the team beats the
30 spread); an ATS loss occurs when the winning team does not beat the losing team by a
   greater or equal number of points than the spread estimated by the oddsmaker for that

   event (i.e., the team does not beat the spread); and an ATS push occurs when when the
   winning team beats the losing team by a number of points equal to the spread estimated
   by the oddsmaker for that event (i.e., a push).
   [00121]      Next, at step 308, the database connection and authorization values are set to
 5 allow server 220 to establish a connection to database 224 to allow historical data for
   ATS for the last quantity of events (as selected by the user in step 304) for each of the
   two selected entities to be retrieved therefrom. This historical data is required to
   calculate the divergence of the upcoming event.
   [00122]      After the database connection and authorization values are set in step 308,
10 process 300 proceeds to 314, at which a bi-directional database connection is established.
   This connection allows server 220 to communicate with database 224 to retrieve the
   required historical data. Process 300 then proceeds to 316.
   [00123]      At 316, process 300 will retrieve the data required to assign a value to the
   measured marker for each event in the selected cumulative time period. Since the marker
15 selected by the user is ATS, server 220 executes an ATS value query for each of the
   selected teams for each of the games in the cumulative time period. Once this data is
   retrieved, the process then proceeds to step 318.
   [00124]      At 318, a value is assigned to each event for each team for all events in the
   cumulative time period. In this embodiment, a value of +1 is applied for each event in
20 which the team beats the spread. A value of -I is applied for each event in which the
   team doesn't beat the spread. A value of 0 is applied for each event in which there is a
   push.
   [00125]      Next, at 320, for each team, all of the values for each of the games in the
   cumulative time period are summed to create a cumulative ATS value. At 322, the
25 cumulative ATS values are compared and the lower cumulative ATS value is subtracted
   from the higher cumulative ATS value to calculate a divergence spread.
   [00126]      Next, at 324, the divergence spread is divided by the DSN. The result of this
   calculation is the divergence value.
   [00127]      After the divergence value has been calculated, process 300 proceeds to 326 at
30 which it is displayed to a user, for example, via a Web page with or without a graph of
   ATS values similar to the graphs discussed above in Examples 1 and 2.

  [00128]     Finally, at step 328, the calculated divergence may be compared to a scale for
  such divergence to determine whether the calculated divergence is statistically significant
  such as the scale depicted in Table 1 above.

  thereof. It is understood, therefore, that this invention is not limited to the particular
  embodiments disclosed, but it is intended to cover modifications within the spirit and
