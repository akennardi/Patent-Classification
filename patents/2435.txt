Abstract:
A system and method for controlling an electronic gaming machine ("EGM") (100) from a
mobile device (405) during a remote access play session. The EGM (100) is switched between
a local access mode (600) in which the inputs on the EGM (100) are active and a remote access
mode (601) in which the inputs on the EGM (100) are de-activated and a player interfaces the
EGM (100) using a mobile device (405) such as a smartphone or a tablet computer. During
remote access play sessions, all critical game play operations continue to be performed
exclusively on the EGM (100) and not on the mobile device (405). Critical game play
operations include random number generation and determination of game outcome. Game
content, including video, screenshot images and audio of the game are transmitted to the
mobile device (405) for display to the player. Player input and selections are made on the
mobile device (405).

Background:
[0002] Electronic gaming machines ("EGMs") offer a variety of games such as mechanical
spinning reel games, video spinning reel games, video poker games, roulette games, keno
games and other types of wagering games that are commonly deployed at a casino for use by
players. Playing a particular EGM requires the player to physically sit at the machine and place
a wager on the outcome of the game. The player then interacts with the game during the game
cycle to make selections as directed for different options until the game cycle ends with the
game outcome being selected and displayed to the player. If the outcome is a winner, the player
receives an award corresponding to the outcome.
[0003] To date, to actively play a game on an EGM, a player must be physically present at the
EGM. Prior art exists for the use of mobile devices for certain interactions with an EGM. For
example, United States Patent Publication No. 2012/0315984A1, which is incorporated by
reference herein, describes the use of a mobile device for developing and maintaining customer
loyalty in the casino, although the player is unable to control game play operation of an EGM
directly from a mobile device. This publication describes a technique for playing wager-based
video card or slot games where game content, including game outcomes are generated on a
remote device such as a server, and sent to a mobile device for display. The publication
provides a description of an EGM configured to receive at least game outcomes from a remote
P'7A72fl1     1171n1A1     1

                                                    2
device (server) where the EGM itself does not use a random number generator ("RNG") to
generate game outcomes locally. The game outcomes are instead generated remotely (from the
server) in response to inputs made on the mobile device such as an input indicating a wager
amount and/or an input to initiate the game. The wager amount or initiation information can be
sent from the mobile device to a remote device such as from a mobile gaming device to a
server. After receiving the game outcomes from the remote device (server), a game
presentation for the game outcomes generated remotely can be generated and displayed on the
mobile device. In some instances, the game presentation can also be generated remotely (from
the server) and then streamed for display to the mobile device. (See Paragraph [0092] of
2012/0315984A1).
Summary:
[0004] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate
one or more of the above disadvantages.

                  using the set of inputs on the particular EGM; and
                          a remote access mode in which a player interacts with the particular
                  EGM using the at least one a mobile device;
         at least one gateway communicating on the network, wherein a first gateway among the
at least one gateway is configured to establish a pairing between a first mobile device among

                                                   3
the at least one mobile device and a first EGM among the plurality of EGMs propagating
communication between the first mobile device and the first EGM;
         wherein the first gateway is further configured to establish pairings between additional
EGMs among the plurality of EGMs and additional mobile devices among the at least one
mobile device; and
         wherein if the first gateway reaches operational capacity for communications between
paired mobile devices and EGMs, an initiation of a new pairing of mobile device to EGM is
established at a second gateway.
[0006] In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method
of enabling remote play of games over a network, comprising:
         providing at least one mobile device communicating on the network and configured to
control an electronic gaming machine ("EGM") in a remote access mode;
         providing a plurality of EGMs communicating on the network, each EGM comprising:
                  a random number generator for generating random numbers that determine the
         outcome of the game and that correspond to a predefined set of game outcomes
         including winning and losing outcomes;
                  a display for displaying game play including game outcomes to a player;
                  a set of inputs on each EGM from which a player may interface with the EGM;
                  an EGM controller for controlling game play on the EGM;
                  a mode controller for switching exclusively between:
                          a local access mode in which a player interacts with a selected EGM
                  among the plurality of EGMs using the set of inputs on the selected EGM;
                          a remote access mode in which a player interacts with the selected EGM
                  using a first mobile device among the at least one mobile device;
                  an identification code associated with each EGM; and
         initiating operation of the selected EGM on a first mobile device through a first
gateway among at least one gateway that is connected between the selected EGM and the first
mobile device wherein each gateway among the at least one gateway is configured to propagate
communication on the network between any EGM among the plurality of EGMs and any
mobile device among the at least one mobile device; and
         initiating pairing between the first mobile device and the selected EGM at a second
gateway on the network if the first gateway reaches operational capacity for communications
between paired mobile devices and EGMs.

[0007] The present invention overcomes one or more of the drawbacks of the prior art by
providing a system and method of using a mobile device to remotely control an EGM where
control may be switched between: (a) local control of the EGM by a player physically present
at the EGM interacting with the EGM through the inputs on the EGM; and (b) remote control
of the EGM by a player using a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet computing
device.

Detailed Description of the Invention:
[0023] The present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the
accompanying drawings. It should be understood that the invention may be embodied in many
different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein.
Throughout Figures 1-12, like elements of the invention are referred to by the same reference
numerals for consistency purposes.
[0024] FIG. 1 shows an electronic gaming machine ("EGM") 100 with a number of
components. A primary display 105 is used to show game play and resulting outcomes, and
may be in the form of a video display (shown), or alternatively, physical reels. Touch screen
displays are included on most EGMs and provide a flexible interface for operation of EGM
100, including displaying symbols during game play. Other components include a bill validator
(see Fig. 2) housed inside EGM 100 into which bills may be inserted through bill slot 110.
Buttons 115 on the exterior of EGM 100 are used to initiate and control EGM operations in
conjunction with touch screen display 105 by the player. EGMs may further include a
secondary display 120 for displaying other game functions including bonus screens. Either of
P'7A72fl1     1171O1A1   1

                                                  6
primary display 105 or secondary display 120 may be used to show information to the player
such as pay tables, messages, advertising, entertainment screens or other types of information.
Multiple meters 125 on display 105 are used for tracking credits available for play, amount
won on a particular play, number of coins bet and other amounts are typically positioned near
the bottom of screen 105. EGM 100 may also accept coins. In those cases, a coin tray 130 at
the bottom of EGM 100 is used to catch coins as they are dispensed to a player.
[0025] It is common for EGM 100 to include a ticket-in, ticket-out ("TITO") component that
includes a ticket reader and ticket printer housed inside of EGM 100 that may accept bar coded
credits printed on a ticket through slot 110 and for which the value of the credits is displayed
on meters 125 upon a ticket being inserted.
[0026] FIG. 2 is a block diagram of EGM 100 connected to a central server based system 200
and showing certain internal components of EGM 100. All operational functions of EGM 100
are controlled by a controller 135 such as a microprocessor housed inside EGM 100 that is
resident on a game board 140. The controller executes instructions that include operation of an
EGM based random number generator 145 ("RNG") that is typically implemented in software
and stored in a memory 150. Alternatively, a true hardware random number generator may be
used. The internal components of EGM 100 are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
Game outcomes are determined based on the random numbers selected by RNG 145. A bill
validator 155 for accepting paper currency is shown integrated with a ticket reader and ticket
printer. Bill validator 155 accepts currency in the form of bills or tickets from a player and adds
credit to meters 125 on EGM 100. A camera 160 may also be included in EGM 100 for the
purpose of recording images of game play and game operations on either or both of screens
105 and 120. Camera 160 is preferably capable of capturing both video and still images.
[0027] An external system 205 such as a player tracking system, a slot accounting system or a
bonusing system may also be connected to EGM 100. These types of systems are typically
connected to EGM 100 either through a separate interface board (not shown) or directly to
different components of EGM 100 including but not limited to game board 140. A player
tracking system may also include other components installed in EGM 100 such as a player
tracking display 210, a keypad 215 and a card reader 220. These components allow for direct
interaction between external system 205 and the player to receive information from the player
on keypad 215 or through information on a card inserted into card reader 220, and to display
P'7A72fl1      1171n1A1   1

                                                 7
information to the player on display 210. A network is established between external system 205
and EGM 100 by network connection 225. The network may be connected to all EGMs 100 in
a casino or any smaller subset of EGMs 100.
[0028] Server based system 200 is also connected to EGMs 100 by a network connection 230
which may be on a separate network or the same network as the one connecting EGM 100 to
external system 205. Server based system 200 may be a single server or it may represent a
group of interconnected servers that are configured to be a single system interfacing with a
group of EGMs.
[0029] It will be understood that the type of networks 225, 230 over which data is
communicated can be one of several different types of networks. These include a Local Area
Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), an intranet, the internet or other classes of
networks. Any type of network technology could be used without departing from the principles
of the invention. This would include communication via any protocol on any of the layers of
the OSI model (ISO/IEC 7498-1) with or without encryption (e.g. SSL encryption, VPN, etc).
The time is synchronized on all components of the system via a network protocol such as, for
example, network time protocol ("NTP") to ensure that time stamps may be reliably compared.
[0030] FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing a group of EGMs 100 a-x on a network connection
230 between central server based system 200 and each of EGMs 100 a-x. It should be
understood that the network may be set up with any number of EGMs that may be in the
thousands of machines. Each of EGMs 100 a-x is also connected to external system 205 that
may be a player tracking, slot accounting, bonusing or other type of system.
[0031] FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B show mobile devices that may be used to remotely control EGM
100. Fig. 4A is a smartphone 405 such as an iPhone* sold by Apple* while Fig. 4B is a tablet
computing device 410 such as an iPad* sold by Apple*. Either of these devices as well as other
mobile handheld devices may be used to remotely access and control EGM 100 once EGM 100
is placed in a remote access mode. For ease of reference in this description, a mobile device
will be generally referred to as mobile device 405. However, it should be understood, that
mobile device 405 may be substituted with mobile device 410, or any other electronic device
with communicative connection capabilities that is remotely located from EGM 100 and from
which EGM 100 may be controlled. Such devices may include a dedicated remote electronic
P'7A72fl1     1171n1A1    1

                                                 8
gaming device specially designed and produced for remote gaming purposes, a laptop
computer, a portable video gaming device such as an PlayStation Portable, or PSP*, sold by
Sony*, or any other general computing device that may be programmed or loaded with
application software to provide the necessary capabilities for remotely controlling EGM 100.
[0032] FIG. 5 is a block diagram showing communication between a mobile device 405 and an
EGM 100. To enable remote control, a player interacts with EGM 100 on mobile device 405
using multi-channel communication. Actions are performed using physical buttons such as
touchscreen 105 or buttons 115 on EGM 100 and the touchscreen or buttons on mobile device
405. Actions include, but are not limited to the transfer of funds, game selection, switch to
activate remote control by the mobile device and return local control to the EGM, along with
all other functions required to play a game and receive credit for player loyalty rewards. The
multi-channel communication allows for transmission of game content including streaming
video screen states, individual JPEG screen states, and/or text messaging, as well as audio to be
transmitted between EGM 100 and mobile device 405. Throughout the process, all gaming
functions are performed by EGM 100 with status of those actions transmitted to mobile device
405 for display to the player. The player interacts with EGM 100 by responding when
necessary using inputs on mobile device 405. Since the gaming functions are performed on
EGM 100, there is not an opportunity for a compromise of data or security on mobile device
405, which merely acts to display information to the player and provide responses from the
player when necessary and is in physical lock-out mode while EGM 100 is under remote
control by mobile device 405. Critical gaming functions such as running the RNG and
determining game outcomes are handled exclusively by the internal components of EGM 100
irrespective of whether EGM is in local mode or remote access mode.
[0033] To ensure a secure connection between EGM 100 and mobile device 405 during a
remotely controlled play session, a communication channel must be established between EGM
100 and 405. A mobile device 405 is able to identify a particular EGM by, for example,
scanning a quick response code ("QR"), bar code, radio frequency ("RF") identification tag, or
another code type that is detectable by a mobile device and displayed or detectable on or near
the exterior surface of EGM or on one of the screens 105, 120 of EGM 100. Once mobile
device 405 has the QR code, it can specify the particular EGM with which to establish
communication. In an alternative embodiment, the identification code representing respective
EGMs may be provided by means of an RFID tag attached to the EGM from which the mobile
P'7A72fl1     1171n1A1    1

                                                  9
device may be adapted to read or detect identification information using an RFID
communication protocol.
[0034] It should be understood that a specific identification code (which is encoded into QR or
another code type) is associated with a particular EGM. It is a form of a certificate that is
unique to the particular EGM and is paired with the EGM IP address in the remote play
management system (see Fig. 12). The identification code is attached to the EGM housing and
linked with the EGM, including a visible indicator on the outside of the EGM housing so that a
player can see the code. The displayed code should also include a corresponding human
readable form that can also be displayed on the screen of the mobile device for the player to
confirm that the established connection is with the desired EGM.
[0035] Only authorized or registered mobile devices are enabled to access the EGM for private
remote play using the network, which may be for example, be a WiFi network. The RF link
between the EGM and the WiFi network may be permanently enabled or "on" so that when a
mobile device accesses the WiFi network, the scanned QR code of the EGM that the player
wants to remotely access may be used to link the mobile device and the EGM. Once the
identification code is scanned, the link may be established without login since the mobile
device has been authorized for use on the network by the gaming operator in advance of
establishing the link between the EGM and the mobile device. Or, a login procedure may be
required for additional security.
[0036] To start remote play on a mobile device, the player initiates a connection request from
the mobile device. The mobile device is used to scan a particular EGM for the unique
identification code that is transmitted to the remote play management system. The remote play
management system checks the EGM registry to look up the identification code. If the EGM is
found and remote access is not blocked for any reason, the remote play management system
enables the remote play session for the mobile device. All mobile device requests are routed to
the EGM and responses from the EGM are routed back to the mobile device.
[0037] Once a player has decided to end a play session, the player presses an end play button
on the mobile device. The mobile device scans the identification code again and a disconnect
signal is sent to the remote play management system. The remote play session is then closed by
the remote play management system.

                                                10
[0038] Once a communication channel is established between EGM 100 and mobile device
405, which may use Bluetooth, WiFi, near field communication ("NFC") or any other
communication linking format, transmission of data between EGM 100 and mobile device 405
may be carried out to send an audio/video stream 505 from EGM 100 to mobile device 405 as
shown in Fig. 5. The protocol is used to format transmissions which include video, images and
audio. The protocol may be any standard protocol such as real-time transport protocol ("RTP")
over user data protocol ("UDP") or an MPEG protocol such as MPEG2 video encoder. Any
other codecs or protocol may be used including a proprietary protocol specifically designed for
EGM-mobile device communication. In one embodiment, an encoder known as VideoLAN
x264 encoder may be used in view of this protocol having very low latency for video
streaming. Transmission of the state of EGM 510 is also transmitted from EGM 100 to mobile
device 405. This may include messaging related to the availability of EGM 100 for play, the
timing of game play, a waiting state indicating that EGM 100 is awaiting an input from the user
or other messages related to EGM components such as acceptor/printer 155, buttons 115,
screens 105, 120, doors 520, keys 525, or hopper/dispenser 530 on EGM 100. Operational
instructions 515 are sent from mobile device 405 to EGM 100 to provide user input, a request
to use EGM in remote mode, request to terminate remote mode or other user instructions.
[0039] It should be understood that EGM 100 may switch between local access by a player
physically playing EGM 100 directly at EGM 100 and remote access by a player playing
through mobile device 405. This concept is shown in FIG. 6A showing the options of local
access 600 and remote access 601.
[0040] Once a communication connection is established between EGM 100 and mobile device
405, a gateway 605 (or a proprietary connection service referred to as LightBridge" or
LightBridge" service developed by the assignee of this application) as shown in FIG. 6B is
deployed to switch modes between local access on EGM 100 and remote access on mobile
device 405. Gateway 605 is controlled by EGM controller 135, or a separate controller 135 as
shown in FIG. 6C that is used for the purpose of running gateway 605 and controlling the
connection between EGM 100 and mobile device 405. Upon establishing the connection, all
signals from the buttons 155 and other inputs on EGM 100 are blocked and only gateway
signal transmissions are propagated. As can be seen in FIG. 6B, initially, the QR code is
scanned by mobile device 405 and a signal is sent to EGM 100 to switch from local operation
P'7A72fl1     1171n1A1   1

                                                  11
mode to remote access mode at step 1. Gateway 605 is then notified of the switch after
receiving a signal from mobile device 405 at step 2, and mobile device 405 then initiates a play
session at step 3 that establishes two-communications between EGM 100 and gateway 605 at
step 4, and between mobile device 405 and gateway 605 at step 5.
[0041] Once in remote access mode, a hierarchy of actions 705 becomes available, an example
of which is shown in FIG. 7, where actions can be executed by the player on mobile device
405 which are propagated to EGM 100. Screen actions 710 on mobile device 405 are activated
by touchscreen clicks 715 and use of the mechanical button actions 720 performed by pressing
button 725 on mobile device 405 are implemented during game play by EGM 100. Using
software applications developed for a smartphone, tablet or other mobile device for use with
the gateway, it is possible to specify any button functionality on a touchscreen or physical
buttons on mobile device 405. Key actions 730 performed on a keyboard (not shown) on
mobile device 405 can turn on 735 or turn off 740 a particular functionality. Similarly, access
control 745 can be turned on 750 or turned off 755 using any of the user interface options
previously described (e.g. touchscreen clicks, button depressions, keyboard actions).
[0042] An example of the possible states 800 of EGM 100 are shown in FIG. 8. The states
800, or a subset thereof, may be propagated from EGM 100 to mobile device 405, which is
adjusted according to the states. This may happen at any time appropriate within the session. A
set of touchscreen buttons displayed on the touchscreen of mobile device 405 reflect the
particular screen state 805 as being screen 1 (810) to screen n (815). The screen states cover
any given time and provide the player with the opportunity to make selections with respect to
input and interaction with EGM 100. The states of these buttons are configured to simulate the
states of EGM buttons 115 during play. It should be understood, that for smaller screens, it may
be required or desirable to show only certain subgroups of buttons on the touchscreen of a
mobile device at any given time, particularly if the mobile device is a smartphone. For a larger
device like a tablet or laptop with a larger screen, it may be possible to show the screen of
EGM 100 as it would appear on touchscreen 105 at any particular time. In that case, all buttons
may be shown, while some may be operational or not depending on the input required at that
point in the game play cycle.

                                                  12
[0043] Similar to screens state 805, the state of the speakers 820 on EGM 100 is also
propagated to mobile device 405. However, for speakers, state 820 in the present case is simply
whether there is audio being played or not without any additional states.
[0044] As described earlier, messages related to other functionality on EGM 100 may also be
communicated to mobile device 405. For example, the state of the cabinet 825 may provide
indications related to the state of buttons 830, doors 835, keys 840 and any other components
845 on EGM 100.
[0045] FIG. 9 shows an embodiment in which multiple EGMs 100a-x may be controlled
simultaneously, or in parallel. In this case, the display of screens from each controlled EGM
would be alternated on mobile device 405 as player input and the display of game outcomes is
required. For the control of multiple EGMs simultaneously, it will be necessary to clearly
indicate to the player the particular current screen and the game in play on each particular
remotely accessed EGM that is being viewed at any given time. A selection screen may be
provided on the mobile device 405 on which are arranged a number of icons, each icon
representing a respective EGM being controlled. A thumbnail picture may be shown at each
icon to represent a screen state of the respective EGM. Alternatively a miniaturized video
stream may be shown.
[0046] FIG. 10 is an embodiment where captured still image screenshots or streaming video of
game play content may be in use. In the case of screenshots, EGM 100 sends screenshots of the
particular game play screen to mobile device 405. In doing so, the image of a screenshot that in
local operation mode on EGM 100 would be shown on screen 105 is captured by a remote
session capture component in the form of screengrabber program or hardware 1005. The
captured screenshot image is encoded by encoder 1010 and input to a multiplexer 1015 before
it is transmitted to mobile device 405. Upon being received by mobile device 405, the image is
input to a demultiplexer 1020 and decoded by a decoder 1025 before it is displayed to the
player on screen 1030 of mobile device 405. Within EGM 100, the screenshot image for a
video screen may be captured using a program to freeze the needed screenshot. A host of freely
available screenshot programs are available for this purpose, or a proprietary program may be
used. Also, a program for handling multimedia such as FFmpeg may be used to handle the
image during processing while a media player such as FFmpeg+ may be used to display the
image on screen 1030 of mobile device 405. In the event that it is necessary to capture a set of
P'7A72fl1      1171n1A1   1

                                                 13
spinning reels at one or more particular points during the game play cycle as opposed to an
image on a video screen, a remote session capture component in the form of camera 160
positioned inside of the EGM cabinet may be used for this purpose.
[0047] In the case where streaming video of game play content is in use, it should be
understood that the system works as described above for still image screenshots except that
screenshots are taken continuously to generate a video. For example, screenshots may be
captured sixty times per second. The individual frames are encoded into video using a video
format such as mpeg2 video stream, h264 or any other video encoding format. The video is
input to multiplexer 1015 which may combine video, audio and metadata into one stream that
is then extracted by demultiplexer 1020 when the stream is received at mobile device 405.
[0048] FIG. 11 is a block diagram of a group of EGMs 100a-f on a network connected to a
group of remote access devices 405 a-f through a group of gateways a-n. This diagram shows
the scalability and flexibility of a system of EGMs connecting to remote access devices while
routing communications through a set of gateways 605a-n. As can be seen in Fig. 11, it is not
necessary for an individual gateway 605 to be employed for each EGM-mobile device pairing.
Instead a single gateway 605 may handle communications for large numbers of EGM-mobile
device pairings provided each session established between an EGM and a mobile device is
handled according to the procedures described herein. When a particular gateway reaches
capacity, a pairing is established at another gateway. It should be understood that for the
greatest level of flexibility, any EGM 100 in the system may be paired with any mobile device
405 across any gateway 605 with all gateways being configured in the network to be
connectable to any EGM 100 and any mobile device 405.
[0049] FIG. 12 is a block diagram of a group of EGMs 100a-d on a network connected to a
group of remote access devices 405a-c together with a detailed view of the components of a
gateway 605. Gateway 605 is responsible for remote play management by providing access
control, session management and monitoring of the remote play activities. Gateway 605
includes a number of software components including access point 1205, router 1210, EGM
proxy 1215, session manager 1220, monitor 1225, access control 1230, remote devices registry
1235, EGMs registry 1240 and management console 1250. The software components of
gateway 605 forward, monitor and transform requests communicated between remote access
devices 405a-c and EGMs 100a-d.

                                                 14
[0050] In operation, access point 1205 is the entry point for all communications flowing
between a particular remote access device and a particular EGM. Router 1210 is used to
determine which EGM has been selected to be connected to a particular remote access device
and to route communications accordingly between those two devices. EGM proxy 1215
transforms the messages back and forth between the proprietary protocols used by EGMs 100
and remote access devices 405. Session manager 1220 manages the remote play session from
beginning to end while monitor 1225 is responsible for monitoring the state of the system and
access control 1230 controls access to the system from the particular remote access device in
use. Remote devices registry 1235 holds a list of registered remote access devices 405 available
on the system so that a connection may be established between a particular remote access
device in use by a player and a selected EGM from all EGMs available on the system, a list of
which is held in EGMs registry 1240. And, management console 1245 is a web-based
application or other software interface that allows a system operator to access all aspects of the
system software to manage operations and settings of the system, including for example,
setting up remote access device registry 1235 and EGM registry 1240. Management console
1245 may also be used by an operator to track and review game play by players using remote
access devices 405.
