10 Technical Field
   [1]        The     present          invention         relates         to     a   composition             for
   cartilage          tissue        repair,       a   method        for      preparing          the      same,
   and     a   method        for     using     the      same,      and     more     particularly,             a
   composition             based     on     collagen        as   a   biomaterial            is     prepared
15 in      an    injectable              form      that        can      be      transplanted               into
   cartilage           defect         regions,         and      thus,        the     composition             is
   directly         inserted            into     the       application            sites        through        a
   syringe        needle         without       a    surgical          incision        to     enable         the
   promotion           of       tissue       repair,          thereby          inducing          effective
20 cartilage         tissue        regeneration,             and    thus      inducing         relatively
   easy       and     prompt         cartilage          repair        and      regeneration             while
   reducing        surgery-related               stress        on    animals        excluding            human
   beings,       so that the quality and reliability of a product can
   be      significantly                improved,           thereby          satisfying              various
25 desires         (needs)         of      consumers          as    users        thereof         and       thus
   giving a good impression to patients.
   Background Art
   [2]        As     well         known,         cartilage            damage         is       caused         by
30 traumatism such as a fall, a direct hit,                                    or a turning force,
   or     disease          such    as     arthritis,           osteonecrosis,             inflammatory
   arthritis,               or      osteochondritis                 dissecans.                   Articular
   cartilage             is      the        tissue         that        has       no      neurovascular
   distribution, is               remarkably low in the self-healing capacity
35 compared         with        the      other      tissues,          and      exhibits          different

                                                                2
   effects          due     to     various          surgical         operations            depending           on   the
   size and location of lesion.
   [31         The        articular               cartilage             is      a     smooth,            extremely
   slippery,             and      shiny         white        material,          and      is     maintained           by
 5 minimizing friction and wear resistance at the time of joint
   movement.                 It       has       been         known        that       once        damaged,           the
   articular             cartilage             does        not      regenerate.                The     damage        of
   cartilage            as    a    tissue         in      the body         is    accompanied            by     severe
   pain,        causing          difficulties                in    daily       life,        and     if     chronic,
 0 the      damaged           cartilage             proceeds          to      degenerative             arthritis.
   Therefore,               the        treatment              for      regenerating                the       damaged
   cartilage tissues needs to be carried out at the time of the
   damage            of       cartilage,                 to       prevent          the        proceeding             to
   degenerative arthritis.
 5 [41         For       the       treatment              of     the     damaged          cartilage            defect
   region,           medications                injection,              physical            therapy,           intra
   articular            injection             of     steroids         or     hyaluronic           acid,        or   the
   like is performed as a non-operative treatment method, which
   only       palliates            symptoms            and      pain     but     has     no     effect         on   the
 0 treatment of disease.                          Alternatively, marrow stimulation and
   side         osteochondral                  transplantation                 are      performed              as    an
   operative            treatment            method.            After primary bone                   stimulation
   is    performed on a                 site where               the cartilage             is    damaged to be
   softened           or     the      bone       is      exposed,         the     damaged         cartilage          is
25 repaired,            thereby           relieving             pain     and      preventing            the       blood
   flowing           from        the       bone          to     synovia         from        decomposing             the
   synovia and degrading the capacity of synovia.                                                  However, the
   bone         stimulation                is       insufficiently                 effective,             and       the
   hyaluronic             acid       temporarily              reduces         pain but does              not bring
30 about        the     induction             into       appropriate           new    cartilage            tissues.
   Moreover,             osteochondral                   transplantation               requires            surgery,
   and      is     more       difficult             and      is    burdensome           in      view      of      cost.
   Recently, in order to treat the damaged articular cartilage,
   autologous              chondrocyte                implantation             has     been         carried         out
35 such       that      the     cartilage             tissue       of    a patient           is    collected         to

                                                 3
   isolate      and     culture      cartilage        cells     therefrom,       which    are
   then    again     transplanted.          This      procedure      takes    a   long time
   to perform two times of operation and tissue collection, and
   therefore      is    not    easily accessible            through     the   cost burden
 5 on patients and health care providers.
    [51     Therefore,           a    novel      method         of    transplanting          a
   biomaterial, which is a mixed composition based on collagen,
   is   required       as  a simple       procedure        for   the cartilage         defect
   region.       This      method     is    useful      in   treating      the    cartilage
10 defect region at the early time, and can decrease the number
   of patients requiring serious surgeries, such as chondrocyte
   transplantation and artificial joint surgery, afterward.
    [61     Recently,          there      are       several        attempts        in    that
   biomaterials are applied to the cartilage defect region.
15  [71     The structure          of the human body consists                of cells     and
   biologically          generated       polymers.           Proteins      found      in  the
   human body        are    representative         materials.         If they      are used
   as natural materials,              they can be applied in              a form similar
   to   a   natural      state,      and   the   regeneration         of human       tissues
20 can    be   expected.          Natural     tissues       can    be  used     as   medical
   biological        tissues,       which    can    provide      biological       functions
   that     artificial          materials       cannot,        so    that    the     natural
   tissues      are     inserted       into     the     human      body    to    provide     a
   biocompatible          environment        between       surrounding      tissues,      and
25 further      function         as   biological         tissues      such     as    natural
   tissues.
    [81     In  particular,          collagen      is    a  component      of   structural
   proteins, and accounts for 1/3 of the overall proteins of a
   mammal,      which      constitute         soft      tissues,      such     as    dermis,
30 tendon/ligament,             blood     vessel,        and    cartilage,        and    hard
   tissues of the human body.
    [91     Collagen         is     currently         used     for     various       medical
   purposes,      such as        a styptic,       a wound dressing,           and wrinkle
   improvement.            Collagen      products        which    have   been     medically
35 used for a long time have been used without safety problems

                                                          4
   so  far.
   [10]      Collagen           has     advantages,            such     as      low       antigenicity,
   high       biocompatibility                 and        bioabsorbablity,                 adhesion          to
   cells,        cell       growth,       cell       differentiation             induction,            blood
 5 coagulation,              a   styptic         effect,        and    biocompatibility                  with
   other polymers.
   [11]       In     addition,           as     a      material       based        on       collagen,          a
   composition in which collagen, hyaluronic acid, and a fibrin
   glue     are mixed          can exhibit             remarkable       effects          in   the     repair
 0 and regeneration of cartilage.
   [12]      Hyaluronic            acid      as      a    biomaterial           is     high-viscosity
   polysaccharide material which is one                              kind of biopolymer, and
   has   been       found       in    chicken        combs,      synovial         fluid,         skin,     and
   the like.           The hyaluronic acid has been currently used as an
 5 adjurvant for ophthalmology surgery and a treatment agent of
   arthritis deformans due                    to high lubricant force.
   [13]      A product           with     a   hyaluronic          acid       concentration             of    10
   mg/mL which            is   currently          available        on   the market            is    a  joint
   function         improving         agent       that      eliminates        the pain           caused by
 0 gonarthrosis              and    frozen        shoulder        disease,          and      temporarily
   reduces        the     pain but        causes         problems      in     the     case       of   severe
   inflammation.
   [14]       In   order       to   solve      the      above    problems,          some      prior      arts

   surgery-related           stress     on    animals        excluding     human    beings.
   Further,       a    third     aspect     of     the     present     invention      is   to
   develop     a mixed       composition with biocompatible                  collagen     for
 5 new cartilage regeneration.                    In particular,        a fourth aspect
   of   the present         invention      is     that     the mixed      composition      is
   applied      in     an    injectable        form,       thereby    conveniently        and
   effectively          stabilizing        damaged          cartilage       tissue     sites
   without      surgery.         Further,       a   fifth      aspect    of   the   present
 0 invention       is    that    the   pain due         to   cartilage     defect    can be
   reduced.       Further,        a  sixth     aspect       of  the present      invention
   is    that    the      induction       of    cartilage         regeneration      can    be
   promoted.            Further,       a    seventh         object    of     the    present
   invention is that quality and reliability of the product can
 5 be     significantly            improved,         thereby       satisfying       various

30  [63]      However,         it      shall     be    noted        that       it      is     not     intended         to
   limit         the      present              invention             to       specific                embodiments
   described in the detailed description, but intended to cover
   all        the       modifications,                    equivalents                   or         substitutions
   belonging         to    the        technical          idea      and      technical               scope      of     the
35 present         invention,              which      are      defined            by        the      accompanying

   claims.
   [64]   The    composition       for     cartilage      tissue      repair,       the
   method for preparing        the same,       and the method for using the
   same will be described below.
 5 [65]   First of all,      according to the present invention, when
   a composition based on collagen as a biomaterial is prepared
   in a type of an injection capable of being transplanted into
   cartilage    defect   regions,      cartilage      tissue   regeneration         can
   be effectively induced, thereby making it possible to reduce
10 surgery-related      stress      on   animals      excluding      human     beings
   while   inducing    relatively       easy    and prompt     cartilage       repair
   and regeneration.
   [66]   Further,     according        to    the    present     invention,         the
   cartilage    defect    treatment        is    possible    through       a   simple
15 procedure,     and   through       a   convenient      procedure        in    which
   simple     injection       type      composition        transplantation           is
   performed    without    surgical      incision      surgery,     the    cartilage
   defect    treatment     is    possible       at  an   early      time,     thereby
   decreasing    the   number     of patients       requiring      joint    surgery.
20 Further,    the    above     preventive        treatment     can     lead     to    a
   decrease in the number of patients with osteoarthritis.

 5 [81]   Mixing        method     B:    Method       of     directly        mixing      raw
   material    (powder) with collagen solution
   [82]   1)   The     prepared      collagen     is    diluted     with water         or  a
   physiological          phosphate      buffer        solution        to     prepare      a
   collagen solution having a desired concentration.
10 [83]   2)    The     hyalunoic      acid     (power      type)     is    put    in    the
   collagen      solution        having      an    appropriate           concentration,
   followed by mixing.
   [84]   3) The prepared solution is directly mixed by using a
   two-way syringe enabling mixing for a short time or using a
15 mixing stick.
   [85]   4)    The     above    mixing     manner      is    needed      to   prepare     a
   high-concentration          product,      and     the    mixing      is    easily     and
   smoothly     performed        while     the    surrounding         environment         is
   maintained at a low temperature at the time of mixing.

   [86]   Preparation         of    composition        based      on     collagen      into
   injectable form
   [87]   1)   Collagen and a mixed composition based on collagen
   are deaerated using a centrifuge.
25 [88]   2)     The      centrifuge       conditions         are    that       the    room
   temperature        (1~    301   )   is    maintained         and    the     centrifuge
   effect    (G value) is 2,2000 to 5,000 G.
   [89]   3)    A     syringe      container       is     filled     using       a    high
   viscosity pump.          Here, a precaution is taken not to generate
30 empty   spaces     by gradually        raising      a nozzle      from the bottom
   upward.
   [90]   4)   A gasket       is   put   in   a rear       surface     of    the   syringe
   container     using      a  vacuum     to    completely        seal     the   syringe,
   thereby preventing the leakage                of a liquid from the syringe
35 container.

                                                     16
   [91]      5)     The    filled      syringe          container       is   stored      at    room
   temperature          to   conserve          the     characteristics         unique       to  the
   collagen        (1-301 ).
   [92]      The     solution needs            to be neither          frozen nor denatured
 5 by high temperature.
   [93]      2. For the verification                    of effect      after     the injection
   into     the     body,    a    prepared         sample      is    stained      with    a   small
   quantity of          a blue       staining        agent      (Trypan blue,         binding    to
   protein)        (FIG. 4).
 0 [94]      3. Use method and effect verification
   [95]      1)    After a pig leg is               fixed on a mount,            the articular
   cartilage         of the     knee     is     damaged by using a surgical                   tool,
   and     large       (about      4   cm2 )     and      small     (about     2   cm2)      defect
   regions are induced by using a drill                           (FIG. 5).
 5 [96]      2)     A    syringe        needle          is    connected       to      a    syringe
   container          filled     with       collagen        or     the    like.        Here,    the
   syringe needle is at least 1 1/2 inch(38 mm) in length.
   [97]      3)    The   cut    site     is     sutured with a           suture     thread,     and
   the product with each concentration contained in the syringe
 0 is directly injected into the glenoid cavity                               (a space filled
   with synovia) of the pig knee                       (FIG. 7).
   [98]      4)    The   knee     joint movement             (continuous passive motion
    (CMP))      is   performed        to     promote       the    action    of    the    injected
   material         which     naturally           fills      the     defect      regions.        In
25 addition,         the   sutured        site      is   cut    to   expose      the    cartilage
   portion into which the product is injected, for observation.
   [99]      4.    Results:       The     product         injected      into    the     cartilage
   defect        regions      naturally           fills      defect       inducing       regions,
   thereby showing an effect preferred by an operator                                   (FIG. 8).

   the     same     method as           in Example        1.    In    addition,        a   sample      in
 5 which       60   mg/mL       of     collagen      and     5  mg/mL      of   hyaluronic         acid
   are mixed at a ratio of                     9:1   to 1:9 and a sample in which 60
   mg/mL of collagen                  and 20    mg/mL of hyaluronic               acid are mixed
   at    a   ratio       of     5:5     are   prepared.          Here,      the   effect       of    the
   collagen         and    hyaluronic           acid-mixed         composition          corresponds
10 to additions           of an effect due to characteristics of collagen

   an      effect         due         to    characteristic              of     hyaluronic          acid
   (lubrication            force),         and   thus,      a   composition          suitable        for
   cartilage repair is prepared.

   injectable             type      cartilage           injection           agent,       and     the    syringe
   needle          is      inserted           into        an     application             site      using        the
   syringe          needle         without         surgical          incision,          thereby       directly
   injecting             the       composition             for      cartilage           repair       into       the
15 glenoid           cavity         (a     space       filled         with      synovia)         of    the      pig
   knee.
               9.          A   method         for     using       a    composition           for    cartilage
   tissue            repair,            wherein            a      specimen            is      prepared            by
20 artificially               forming         a   cartilage           defect       region        of   2~4cn;         a
   composition               for      cartilage            repair        is     stained        in    blue       and
   injected           into       the     specimen;           and    then       the    transplanted            site
   is     opened,         thereby          verifying           morphology          of     the    composition
   filling          the     cartilage           defect        region       and    verifying         the water
25 washability                of      the       composition              through          the      degree          of
   adhesion to the cartilage defect region.
