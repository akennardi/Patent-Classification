                                            Field of the Invention

   Application No. 2012355356 is by this cross-reference incorporated into the present
   specification.

                                        Background of the Invention
                The large-scale, economic purification of proteins is an increasingly important
   problem for the biotechnology industry. Generally, proteins are produced by cell culture,
   using either eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell lines engineered to produce the protein of interest
15 by insertion of a recombinant plasmid containing the gene for that protein. These cells must
   be fed with a complex growth medium, containing sugars, amino acids, and growth factors,
   usually supplied from preparations of animal serum. Separation of the desired protein from
   the mixture of compounds fed to the cells and from the by-products of the cells themselves to
   a purity sufficient for use as a human therapeutic poses a formidable challenge.
20              Procedures for purification of proteins from cell debris initially depend on the
   mechanism of expression for the given protein. Some proteins can be caused to be secreted
   directly from the cell into the surrounding growth media; others are made intracellularly. For
   the latter proteins, the first step of a purification process involves lysis of the cell, which can
   be done by a variety of methods, including mechanical shear, osmotic shock, or enzymatic
25 treatments. Such disruption releases the entire contents of the cell into the homogenate, and
   in addition produces subcellular fragments that are difficult to remove due to their small size.
   These are generally removed by differential centrifugation or by filtration. The same problem
   arises, although on a smaller scale, with directly secreted proteins due to the natural death of
   cells and release of intracellular host cell proteins in the course of the protein production run.
30              Once a clarified solution containing the protein of interest without large cellular
   debris components has been obtained, its separation from the remaining other proteins
                                                       1
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   produced by the cell is usually attempted using a combination of different chromatography
   techniques. These techniques separate mixtures of proteins and other impurities on the basis
   of their charge, degree of hydrophobicity, or size. Several different chromatography resins
   are available for each of these techniques, allowing accurate tailoring of the purification
 5 scheme to the particular protein involved. The essence of each of these separation methods is
   that proteins can be caused either to move at different rates down a long column, achieving a
   physical separation that increases as they pass further down the column, or to adhere
   selectively to the separation medium, being then differentially eluted or displaced by different
   solvents or displacers. In some cases, the desired protein is separated from impurities when
10 the impurities specifically adhere to the column, and the protein of interest does not, that is,
   the protein of interest is present in the "flow-through". Publications concerning protein
   purification include Fahrner et al., Biotechnol Genet Eng Rev. 2001;18:301-27.
                A typical large-scale purification process for antibodies is often built around the
   employment of immobilized protein A as the primary capture and purification step in
15 combination with other column operations. Protein A is a cell wall protein from
   Staphylococcus aureas with affinity for the Fc region of IgG. For this reason it is used
   extensively for IgG purification. Protein A column operations in general deliver a product
   related purity over 98% with most process impurities washed away in the flow-through
   fraction. However, there are numerous drawbacks to the use of Protein A chromatography.
20 First, binding is usually done at a neutral to slightly basic pH and elution is usually at an
   acidic pH. One of the potential problems is that low pH can denature or partially denature the
   IgG. Because of this and the high product purity required for clinical applications, additional
   concentrating and purifying steps are required for separation of product-related isomers and
   removal of remaining amounts of host cell proteins/DNA, cell culturing impurities, leached
25 protein A, and viruses. A compounding problem is that many of these impurities can interfere
   with the efficiency of downstream process operational units for isolating purified antibodies.
   Another main problem is price; Protein A columns are far more expensive than conventional
   ion       exchange              columns. Finally, there are numerous scenarios where  Protein A
   chromatography is either not suitable or cost prohibitive, for example with the purification of
30 polypeptides, antibody-like molecules, antibody fragments, and/or full antibodies purified
   from certain cell systems.

   ''comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
   i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition
   of further features in various embodiments of the invention.
                The "composition" to be purified herein comprises the polypeptide of interest and one

   as antibodies, including antibody fragments, binding to any of the above-listed polypeptides.
                 A "contaminant" is a material that is different from the desired polypeptide product.
   The contaminant includes, without limitation: host cell materials, such as Chinese Hamster
10 Ovary Proteins (CHOP) or E. coli Proteins (ECP); leached protein A; nucleic acid; a variant,
   fragment, aggregate, isomer or derivative of the desired polypeptide; another polypeptide;
   endotoxin; viral contaminant; aminoglycoside antibiotic components (e.g., gentamicin,

15 polyacrylic acid), etc.
                 The term "CH2 /CH3 region" when used herein refers to those amino acid residues in
   the Fc region of an immunoglobulin molecule. In preferred embodiments, the CH2/CH3
   region comprises an intact CH2 region followed by an intact CH3 region, and most preferably
   a Fc region of an immunoglobulin. Examples of CH2/CH3 region-containing polypeptides
20 include antibodies, immunoadhesins and fusion proteins comprising a polypeptide of interest
   fused to, or conjugated with, a CH2 /CH3 region.
                In preferred embodiments of the invention, the antibody to be purified herein is a
   recombinant antibody. A "recombinant antibody" is one which has been produced in a host
   cell which has been transformed or transfected with nucleic acid encoding the antibody, or
25 produces the antibody as a result of homologous recombination. "Transformation" and
   "transfection" are used interchangeably to refer to the process of introducing nucleic acid into
   a cell. Following transformation or transfection, the nucleic acid may integrate into the host
   cell genome, or may exist as an extrachromosomal element. The "host cell" includes a cell in
   in vitro cell culture as well as a cell within a host animal. Methods for recombinant
30 production of polypeptides are described in US Patent No. 5,534,615, expressly incorporated
   herein by reference, for example.
                 The term "antibody" is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal
   antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific
                                                       7

   antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they retain, or are
   modified to comprise, a CH2 /CH 3 region as herein defined.
                The antibody herein is directed against an "antigen" of interest. Preferably, the antigen
   is a biologically important polypeptide and administration of the antibody to a mammal
 5 suffering from a disease or disorder can result in a therapeutic benefit in that mammal.
   However, antibodies directed against non-polypeptide antigens (such as tumor-associated
   glycolipid antigens; see US Patent 5,091,178) are also contemplated. Where the antigen is a
   polypeptide, it may be a transmembrane molecule (e.g., receptor) or ligand such as a growth
   factor. Exemplary antigens include those polypeptides discussed above. Preferred molecular
10 targets for antibodies encompassed by the present invention include CD polypeptides such as
   CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD20 and CD34; members of the HER receptor family such as the
   EGF receptor (HERI), HER2, HER3 or HER4 receptor; cell adhesion molecules such as
   LFA-1, Mac1, p150,95, VLA-4, ICAM-1, VCAM and av/b3 integrin including either a or b
   subunits thereof (e.g., anti-CD1 la, anti-CD18 or anti-CD1 lb antibodies); growth factors such
15 as VEGF; IgE; blood group antigens; fik2/flt3 receptor; obesity (OB) receptor; mpl receptor;
   CTLA-4; polypeptide C etc. Soluble antigens or fragments thereof, optionally conjugated to
   other molecules, can be used as immunogens for generating antibodies. For transmembrane
   molecules, such as receptors, fragments of these (e.g., the extracellular domain of a receptor)
   can be used as the immunogen. Alternatively, cells expressing the transmembrane molecule
20 can be used as the immunogen. Such cells can be derived from a natural source (e.g., cancer
   cell lines) or may be cells which have been transformed by recombinant techniques to
   express the transmembrane molecule.

20              The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a
   population              of substantially homogeneous    antibodies,  i.e., the   individual antibodies
   comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that
   may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed
   against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody
25 preparations               which typically include different  antibodies   directed   against different
   determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on
   the antigen. The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being
   obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be
   construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the
30 monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by
   the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., Nature 256:495 (1975), or may be
   made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567). In a further
   embodiment, "monoclonal antibodies" can be isolated from antibody phage libraries
                                                         11
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al., Nature, 348:552-554 (1990).
   Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J Mol. Biol., 222:581-597
   (1991) describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies, respectively, using phage
   libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity (nM range) human
 5 antibodies by chain shuffling (Marks et al., Bio/Technology, 10:779-783 (1992)), as well as
   combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large
   phage libraries (Waterhouse et al., Nuc. Acids. Res., 21:2265-2266 (1993)). Thus, these
   techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques
   for isolation of monoclonal antibodies. Alternatively, it is now possible to produce transgenic
10 animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of
   human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it
   has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region
   (JH) gene              in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of
   endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene
15 array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon
   antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:2551 (1993);
   Jakobovits et al., Nature, 362:255-258 (1993); Bruggermann et al., Year in Immuno., 7:33
   (1993); and Duchosal et al., Nature 355:25 8 (1992).
                The monoclonal antibodies         herein   specifically include "chimeric" antibodies
20 (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or
   homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or
   belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is
   identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another
   species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such
25 antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567;
   and Morrison et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-6855 (1984)).
                The term "hypervariable region" when used herein refers to the amino acid residues
   of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region
   comprises amino acid residues from a "complementarity determining region" or "CDR" (i.e.,
30 residues 24-34 (LI), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35
   (HI), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al.,
   Sequences ofPolypeptides ofImmunologicalInterest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National
   Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)) and/or those residues from a "hypervariable
                                                         12
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   loop" (i.e., residues 26-32 (LI), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain
   and 26-32 (HI), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia
   and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)).                     "Framework" or "FR" residues are those
   variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.
 5              "Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies
   that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part,
   humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues
   from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable
   region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman
10 primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv
   framework               region      (FR)  residues  of the    human   immunoglobulin   are replaced  by
   corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise
   residues which are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These
   modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized
15 antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains,
   in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non
   human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human
   immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a
   portion          of an            immunoglobulin   constant  region  (Fc), typically that  of a   human
20 immunoglobulin.
                The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making
   the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called
   "best-fit" method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened
   against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence
25 which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework (FR) for the
   humanized antibody (Sims et al., J. Immunol., 151:2296 (1993); Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol.,
    196:901 (1987)).
                Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of
   all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework
30 may be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
   USA, 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., J. Immnol., 151:2623 (1993)).
                It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for
   the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a
                                                               13
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental
   sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the
   parental          and         humanized sequences.  Three-dimensional   immunoglobulin    models  are
   commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are
 5 available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures
   of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits
   analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin
   sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate
   immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined
10 from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as
   increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are
   directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.
                 "Antibody fragments" comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally the
   antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab,
15 Fab', F(ab') 2 , and Fv fragments;               diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody
   molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Various techniques
   have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments
   were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., Journal
   of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24:107-117 (1992) and Brennan et al., Science,
20 229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host
   cells. For example, the antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries
   discussed above. Alternatively, Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from E. coli and
   chemically coupled to form F(ab') 2 fragments (Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167
   (1992)). In another embodiment, the F(ab') 2 is formed using the leucine zipper GCN4 to
25 promote assembly of the F(ab') 2 molecule. According to another approach, F(ab') 2 fragments
   can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the
   production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner.
                In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv).
   See WO 93/16185. "Single-chain Fv" or "sFv" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL
30 domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain.
   Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL
   domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review
                                                           14

   and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).
                The term "diabodies" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding
   sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light
 5 chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH - VL). By using a linker that is
   too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are
   forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen
   binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO
   93/11161; and Hollinger et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448 (1993).
10              The expression "linear antibodies" when used throughout this application refers to the
   antibodies described in Zapata et al., Polypeptide Eng. 8(10):1057-1062 (1995). Briefly,
   these antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (VH-CHl-VH-CH1) which form a
   pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.
                "Multispecific antibodies" have binding specificities for at least two different
15 epitopes, where the epitopes are usually from different antigens. While such molecules
   normally will only bind two antigens (i.e., bispecific antibodies, BsAbs), antibodies with
   additional specificities such as trispecific antibodies are encompassed by this expression
   when used herein. Examples of BsAbs include those with one arm directed against a tumor
   cell antigen and the other arm directed against a cytotoxic trigger molecule such as anti
20 FcyRI/anti-CD15, anti-p185 HER2/FcyRIII (CD16), anti-CD3/anti-malignant B-cell (1D10),

   stimulating hormone analog, anti-EGF receptor/anti-CD3,                    anti-CD3/anti-CAMA1,     anti
   CD3/anti-CD19, anti-CD3/MoV18, anti-neural cell ahesion molecule (NCAM)/anti-CD3,

   3 1)/anti-CD3; BsAbs with one arm which binds specifically to a tumor antigen and one arm
   which binds to a toxin such as anti-saporin/anti-Id-1, anti-CD22/anti-saporin, anti-CD7/anti
   saporin, anti-CD38/anti-saporin, anti-CEA/anti-ricin A chain, anti-interferon-u(IFN-a)/anti
   hybridoma idiotype, anti-CEA/anti-vinca alkaloid; BsAbs for converting enzyme activated
30 prodrugs such as anti-CD30/anti-alkaline phosphatase (which catalyzes conversion of
   mitomycin phosphate prodrug to mitomycin alcohol); BsAbs which can be used as
   fibrinolytic agents such as anti-fibrin/anti-tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), anti-fibrin/anti

   urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA); BsAbs for targeting immune complexes to cell
   surface receptors such as anti-low density lipoprotein (LDL)/anti-Fc receptor (e.g., FcyRI, or

   simplex virus (HSV), anti-T-cell receptor:CD3 complex/anti-influenza, anti-FcyR/anti-HIV;

   hormone,                anti-somatostatin/anti-substance   P, anti-HRP/anti-FITC, anti-CEA/anti-p
   galactosidase. Examples of trispecific antibodies include anti-CD3/anti-CD4/anti-CD37, anti
10 CD3/anti-CD5/anti-CD37 and anti-CD3/anti-CD8/anti-CD37. Bispecific antibodies can be
   prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., F(ab') 2 bispecific antibodies).
                Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific
   antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al., J Immunol. 147: 60 (1991).
                A "naked antibody" for the purposes herein is an antibody that is not conjugated to a
15 cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.
                An "intact antibody" herein is one which comprises two antigen binding regions, and
   an Fc region. Preferably, the intact antibody has a functional Fc region.
                "Treatment" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative
   measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those
20 in which the disorder is to be prevented.
                A "disorder" is any condition that would benefit from treatment with the antibody
   purified as described herein. This includes both chronic and acute disorders and diseases and
   those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question.
                The phrase "ion exchange chromatography" refers to a separation technique in which
25 compounds are separated based on their net charge. Molecules are classified as either anions
   (having a negative charge) or cations (having a positive charge). Some molecules (e.g.,
   polypeptides) may have both anionic and cationic groups.
                An ion-exchange resin or ion-exchange polymer is an insoluble matrix (or support
   structure) normally in the form of small (1-2 mm diameter) beads, fabricated from an organic
30 polymer substrate. Horie et al. Pure Appl. Chem. (2004) Vol. 76, No. 4, pp. 889-906. The
   material has highly developed structure of pores on the surface of which are sites with easily
   trapped and released ions. The trapping of ions takes place only with simultaneous releasing
                                                            16

   of other ions; thus the process is called ion-exchange. There are multiple different types of
   ion-exchange resin which are fabricated to selectively prefer one or several different types of
   ions.
                Most typical ion-exchange resins are based on cross linked polystyrene. The required
 5 active groups can be introduced after polymerization, or substituted monomers can be used.
   For example, the cross linking is often achieved by adding 0.5-25% of divinylbenzene to
   styrene at the polymerization process. Non-cross linked polymers are used only rarely
   because they are less stable. Cross linking decreases ion- exchange capacity of the resin and
   prolongs the time needed to accomplish the ion exchange processes. Particle size also
10 influences the resin parameters; smaller particles have larger outer surface, but cause larger
   head loss in the column processes.
                There are four main types of ion exchange resins differing in their functional groups:
   strongly acidic (typically, sulfonic acid groups, e.g. sodium polystyrene sulfonate or
   polyAMPS); strongly basic, (quaternary amino groups, for example, trimethylammonium
15 groups, e.g. polyAPTAC); weakly acidic (mostly, carboxylic acid groups); weakly basic
   (primary, secondary, and/or ternary amino groups, e.g. polyethylene amine). There are also
   specialized types: chelating resins (iminodiacetic acid, thiourea, and many others).
                An ion exchange chromatography membrane will bind a compound with an overall
   positive or negative charge. Binding sites are located along the pores of the adsorber. The
20 compound is transported to the binding site by convection. A positively charged membrane
   (anion exchanger) will bind a compound with an overall negative charge. Conversely, a
   negatively charged membrane (cation exchanger) will bind a compound with an overall
   positive charge.
                Ion exchange membranes can be further categorized as either strong or weak. Strong
25 ion exchange membranes are charged (ionized) across a wide range of pH levels. Weak ion
   exchange membranes are ionized within a narrow pH range. The four most common ion
   exchange chemistries are:
                                                      17

                In general, ion exchange membranes have pore sizes of 0.1 to 100 [Lm. As a reference,
   Sartobind          Q (Sartorius     AG) is a strong anion exchange membrane having a nominal pore size
   of 3-5 ptm and is commercially available in a single or multiple layer format, and Mustang              Q
 5 (Pall Corporation) is a strong anion exchange membrane having a nominal pore size of 0.8
   [tm and is likewise commercially available in a single or multiple layer format. As another
   reference, Sartobind S (Sartorius AG) is a strong cation exchange membrane having a
   nominal pore size of 3-5 [tm and is commercially available in a single or multiple layer
   format, and Mustang S (Pall Corporation) is a strong cation exchange membrane having a
10 nominal pore size of 0.8 [tm and is similarly commercially available in a single or multiple
   layer format.                As another reference, Natrix S (Natrix Separations, Inc.) is a strong cation
   exchange membrane comprised of a non-woven highly fibrous durable polymeric substrate
   encased within a high surface area macro-porous hydrogel.
                A "nominal" pore size rating describes the ability of the membrane to retain the
15 majority of particulates at 60 to 98% the rated pore size.
                The "pH" of a solution measures the acidity or alkalinity relative to the ionization of a
   water sample. The pH of water is neutral, i.e., 7. Most pH readings range from 0 to 14.
   Solutions with a higher [H+] than water (pH less than 7) are acidic; solutions with a lower
   [H+] than water (pH greater than 7) are basic or alkaline. pH can be measured using a pH
20 meter. Buffer pH may be adjusted using an acid or base like HCl or NaOH.
                The "pI" or "isoelectric point" of a molecule such as a polypeptide refers to the pH at
   which the polypeptide contains an equal number of positive and negative charges. The pI can
   be calculated from the net charge of the amino acid residues of the polypeptide or can be
   determined by isoelectric focusing. The amphoteric nature of polypeptides to have both
25 anionic and cationic groups may be manipulated. The pH of a polypeptide may be lowered to
   the point where the desired polypeptide behaves as a cation (having a positive charge).
   Alternatively, the pH of a polypeptide may be increased to the point where the desired
   polypeptide behaves as an anion (having a negative charge).
                                                             18
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

                The term "conductivity" refers to the ability of a solution to conduct an electric
   current between two electrodes. The basic unit of conductivity is the siemens (S), formerly
   called the mho. Conductivity is commonly expressed in units of mS/cm. Since the charge on
   ions in solution facilities the conductance of electrical current, the conductivity of a solution
 5 is proportional to its ion concentration. Both these measurements correlate well with the ionic
   strength. Ionic strength is closely related to the concentration of electrolytes and indicates
   how effectively the charge on a particular ion is shielded or stabilized by other ions in an
   electrolyte. The main difference between ionic strength and electrolyte concentration is that
   the former is higher if some of the ions are more highly charged. Another difference between
10 the two is that ionic strength reflects the concentration of free ions, and not just of how much
   salt was added to a solution. Conductivity can be measured using a conductivity meter, such
   as various models of Orion conductivity meters. Conductivity of a solution may be altered by
   changing the concentration of ions therein. For example, the concentration of a buffering
   agent and/or the concentration of a salt (e.g., sodium chloride, sodium acetate, or potassium
15 chloride) in the solution may be altered in order to achieve the desired conductivity.
   Preferably, the salt concentration of the various buffers is modified to achieve the desired
   conductivity.
                For membrane chromatography, the "flow rate" is usually described as membrane
   volumes per hour (MV/h).
20              For membrane chromatography, the "load density" is often expressed as grams of
   composition processed per liter of membrane.
                A "buffer" is a solution that resists changes in pH by the action of its acid-base
   conjugate components. Various buffers which can be employed depending, for example, on
   the desired pH of the buffer are described in Buffers. A Guidefor the Preparationand Use of
25 Buffers in BiologicalSystems, Gueffroy, D., Ed. Calbiochem Corporation (1975).
                By "purifying" a polypeptide from a composition comprising the polypeptide and one
   or more contaminants is meant increasing the degree of purity of the polypeptide in the
   composition by removing (completely or partially) at least one contaminant from the
   composition. A "purification step" may be part of an overall purification process resulting in
30 a "homogeneous" composition. "Homogeneous" is used herein to refer to a composition
   comprising at least about 70% by weight of the antibody of interest, based on total weight of
   the composition, preferably at least about 80% by weight, more preferably at least about 90%
   by weight, even more preferably at least about 95% by weight.

                By "binding" a molecule to an ion exchange membrane is meant exposing the
   molecule to the ion exchange membrane under appropriate                conditions (pH and/or
   conductivity) such that the molecule is reversibly immobilized in or on the ion exchange
   membrane by virtue of electrostatic interactions between the molecule and a charged group or
 5 charged groups of the ion exchange membrane.
                By "washing" the ion exchange membrane is meant passing an appropriate buffer
   through or over the ion exchange membrane.
                By "eluting" a molecule (e.g., antibody or contaminant) from an ion exchange
   membrane is meant to remove the molecule therefrom.
10              For membrane chromatography, "flow-through" refers to binding of impurities to the
   membrane while the compound is unretained.
                For membrane chromatography, "competitive adsorption" refers to more than one
   component binding to the membrane at a given condition.
                For membrane chromatography, "overload chromatography" refers to promoting
15 competitive adsorption of both the compound of interest and impurities to the membrane.
   The membrane is loaded beyond the binding capacity of a compound.            By exploiting the
   differential binding strength of the compound and impurities, wherein the impurity binds
   more strongly, the compound is displaced by the impurities and desorbs from the membrane
   and flows into the membrane effluent.
20              "Displacement chromatography" refers to a chromatography technique in which a
   sample is placed onto a column or membrane and is then displaced by a solute that is more
   strongly adsorbed than the components of the original mixture. The result is that the
   components are resolved into consecutive "rectangular" zones of highly concentrated pure
   substances rather than solvent-separated "peaks". Tugcu (1994) Methods in Molecular
25 Biology: Vol 421 Affinity Chromatography: Methods and Protocols pp 71-89. Higher
   product concentration, higher purity, and increased throughput may be obtained compared to
   other modes of chromatography. Displacement chromatography is an efficient technique for
   the purification of proteins from complex mixtures at high column loadings in a variety of
   applications. Displacement chromatography is well suited for obtaining mg quantities of
30 purified proteins from complex mixtures using standard analytical chromatography columns
   at the bench scale. It is also particularly well suited for enriching trace components in the
   feed. Displacement chromatography can be readily carried out using a variety of resin
                                                   20

                The phrase "mixed mode" refers to a sorbent that has the ability to separate
   compounds                 based   on two  different mechanisms,     e.g. a   separation  based   on
 5 hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity differences between polypeptides overlaid on a separation
   based on net charge. This is often accomplished by using a multi-modal ligand that may
   interact with a target molecule in several different ways including ionic interaction and
   hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interaction. Sorbents like GE Healthcare CaptoT M MMC
   and CaptoTM Adhere are examples of "mixed mode" chromatography resins.
10              A "depth filter" is a variety of filter that uses a porous filtration medium to retain
   particles throughout the medium, rather just on the surface of the medium. These filters are
   commonly used when the fluid to be filtered contains a high load of particles because,
   relative to other types of filters, they can retain a large mass of particles before becoming
   clogged.
15              A "monolith" refers to a chromatographic media comprised of a porous substrate that
   has been chemically altered for a specific application.          Ion exchange monoliths have been
   developed as an alternative              to chromatographic   resin, typically demonstrating   high
   permeability and short diffusion distances resulting in better mass transport and lower
   pressures, enabling their use at higher flow rates and/or shorter residence times.
20 Modes for Carrying Out the Invention
                The invention herein provides methods for purifying a polypeptide from a
   composition (e.g., an aqueous solution) comprising the polypeptide and one or more
   contaminants. The composition is generally one resulting from the recombinant production of
   the polypeptide, but may be that resulting from production of the polypeptide by peptide
25 synthesis (or other synthetic means) or the polypeptide may be purified from a native source
   of the polypeptide. Preferably the polypeptide is a CH2/CH3 region-containing polypeptide. In
   preferred embodiments, the CH2/CH3 region-containing polypeptide is an antibody.
   Recombinant Productionof Antibodies
                For recombinant production of the polypeptide, the nucleic acid encoding the
30 polypeptide sequence is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning
   (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the polypeptide is readily
   isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes
                                                       21
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of an
   antibody). Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include, but are not
   limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or
   more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination
 5 sequence (e.g., as described in US Patent 5,534,615, specifically incorporated herein by
   reference).
                Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein are
   prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryotic cells. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include
   eubacteria,              such     as Gram-negative or    Gram-positive organisms,   for   example,
10 Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia, e.g., E. coli, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella,
   Proteus, Salmonella, e.g., Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia, e.g., Serratiamarcescans, and
   Shigella, as well as Bacilli such as B. subtilis and B. lichenformis (e.g., B. lichenformis 41P
   disclosed in DD 266,710 published 12 April 1989), Pseudomonas such as P. aeruginosa,and
   Streptomyces. One preferred E. coli cloning host is E. coli 294 (ATCC 31,446), although
15 other strains such as E. coli B, E. coli X1776 (ATCC 31,537), and E. coli W3110 (ATCC
   27,325) are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.
                In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are
   suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody encoding vectors. Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae, or common baker's yeast, is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic
20 host microorganisms. However, a number of other genera, species, and strains are commonly
   available and useful herein, such as Schizosaccharomycespombe; Kluyveromyces hosts such
   as, e.g., K. lactis, K. fragilis (ATCC 12,424), K. bulgaricus (ATCC 16,045), K. wickeramii
   (ATCC 24,178), K. waltii (ATCC 56,500), K. drosophilarum (ATCC 36,906), K .
   thermotolerans, and K. marxianus; yarrowia (EP 402,226); Pichia pastoris (EP 183,070);
25 Candida; Trichoderma reesia (EP 244,234); Neurospora crassa; Schwanniomyces such as
   Schwanniomyces occidentalis; and filamentous fungi such as, e.g., Neurospora, Penicillium,
   Tolypocladium, and Aspergillus hosts such as A. nidulans and A. niger.
                Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated polypeptide are derived from
   multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells.
30 Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells
   from hosts such as Spodoptera frugiperda (caterpillar), Aedes aegypti (mosquito), Aedes
   albopictus (mosquito), Drosophila melanogaster (fruitfly), and Bombyx mori have been
   identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available, e.g., the L-1
                                                         22

   variant of Autographa cahfornica NPV and the Bm-5 strain of Bombyx mori NPV, and such
   viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention, particularly for
   transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Plant cell cultures of cotton, corn, potato,
   soybean, petunia, tomato, and tobacco can also be utilized as hosts.
 5              However, interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells, and propagation of vertebrate
   cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful
   mammalian host cell lines include, but are not limited to, monkey kidney CV1 cells
   transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney cells (293 or
   293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., J Gen Virol. 36:59
10 (1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/
   DHFR (CHO, Urlaub et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216 (1980)); mouse sertoli cells
   (TM4, Mather, Biol. Reprod. 23:243-251 (1980)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL
   70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical
   carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34);
15 buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL
   75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC
   CCL51); TRI cells (Mather et al., Annals N.Y Acad. Sci. 383:44-68 (1982)); MRC 5 cells;
   FS4 cells; and human hepatoma cells (Hep G2). Often, CHO cells are preferred for the
   expression of antibodies, and may be advantageously used to produce the antibodies purified
20 in accordance with the present invention.
                Host cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for
   polypeptide production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate
   for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired
   sequences.
25              The host cells used to produce the polypeptide of this invention may be cultured in a
   variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F1O (Sigma), Minimal
   Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's
   Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the
   media         described in Ham et al., Meth. Enz. 58:44            (1979),  Barnes   et al., Anal.

   media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with
   hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth
                                                      23

   factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as
   HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), aminoglycoside antibiotics (such as
   gentamicin), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final
   concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any
 5 other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would
   be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the
   like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent
   to the ordinarily skilled artisan.
                When using recombinant techniques, the polypeptide can be produced intracellularly,
10 in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the polypeptide is produced
   intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed cells (e.g.,
   resulting from homogenization), is removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration.
   Where the polypeptide is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression
   systems may be concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for
15 example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit.
                One aspect of the present invention considers the impact of gentamicin on CEX
   columns. Gentamicin, and other aminoglycoside antibiotics, can be used as a bactericidal
   additive in the cell culture applications to prevent non-resistant contaminations. When added
   to a cell culture it must be removed as a process related impurity. Typical removal is
20 accomplished using an affinity chromatography step, however, in some processes an affinity
   step may not be the first purification step.
                As a cationic aminoglycoside antibiotic, gentamicin is positively charged at or below
   neutral pH. If a CEX column were the first chromatography step, with the intention of
   binding the polypeptide of interest at or below neutral pH, gentamicin would be competing
25 for binding sites on the column. Previous work has demonstrated that gentamicin will bind
   stronger than an antibody to a CEX membrane or resin, The effect on a CEX column is an
   apparent decrease in antibody binding capacity.
                Another aspect of the present invention considers the impact of polyethyleneimine
   (PEI), or other cationic polymers, on CEX columns.            PEI can be used as a pre-harvest
30 flocculation agent in an E.coli polypeptide purification processes. When PEI is added after a
   cell homogenization step, it acts as an impurity binder and makes both centrifugation and
   filtration more robust processes. A concern with incorporating this step is the effect of any
                                                     24
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   extra PEI that isn' t used to flocculate impuritiesbecause it then remains in the purification
   pools that eventually come in contact with the CEX columns.
                There are many different forms of PEI, ranging from linear or branched polymers,
   and they can contain primary, secondary, or tertiary amines. The shape of the PEI isn' t as
 5 much of a concern as the fact that it is positively charged at the majority of processing
   conditions. Therefore it will bind to a CEX column very strongly. Furthermore, the first
   chromatography step for most E.coli proteins may be a CEX column due to their relatively
   high binding capacities. Additionally, due to the strong binding of the CEX column to PEI, it
   occasionally requires the use of a weaker CEX column so that the PEI can be eluted from the
10 column after each run.
                Previous work has demonstrated that when varying levels of PEI are used for
   flocculation, the binding capacity of the CEX column will increase as lower PEI levels are
   used. It has also been observed that the CEX chromatography step yield will increase with
   lower levels of PEI in the load.
15              Using a similarly charged ion exchange membrane prior to an ion exchange column
   to decrease impurities can result in increases in binding capacity, yield, impurity clearance,
   all of which can enable a more efficient process and reduced operating costs.
   The Membrane Ion Exchange ChromatographyMethod of the Invention
                In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the composition to be subjected to the
20 purification method herein is a recombinantly produced polypeptide, preferably an intact
   antibody, expressed by a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) or E.coli recombinant host cell
   culture. Optionally, the composition has been subjected to at least one purification step prior
   to membrane ion exchange chromatography. The composition contains the polypeptide of
   interest and one or more contaminants, such as Chinese Hamster Ovary Proteins (CHOP);
25 E.coli Proteins (ECP); leached protein A; nucleic acid; a variant, fragment, aggregate or
   derivative of the desired antibody; another polypeptide; endotoxin; viral contaminant;
   aminoglycoside antibiotic components (e.g., gentamicin); or an ionic polymer added to the
   purification              process    (e.g., polyethyleneimine   (PEI),   polyvinylamine,   polyarginine,
   polyvinylsulfonic acid, polyacrylic acid), etc.
30              Examples of additional purification procedures which may be performed prior to,
   during, or following the membrane                      ion exchange   chromatography    method include
   fractionation                on   a hydrophobic    interaction chromatography    (e.g.,  on  PHENYL
                                                             25

   chromatography on HEPARIN SEPHAROSE TM, anion exchange chromatography, cation
   exchange chromatography, mixed mode ion exchange, chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE,
 5 ammonium                 sulfate precipitation, hydroxyapatite  chromatography,  gel electrophoresis,
   dialysis, hydrophic charge induction chromatography, high performance tangential flow
   filtration (HPTFF), and affinity chromatography (e.g., using protein A, protein G, an
   antibody, or a specific substrate, ligand or antigen as the capture reagent).
                When using recombinant techniques, the polypeptide can be produced intracellularly,
10 in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the polypeptide is produced
   intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, is
   removed, for example, by centrifugation or filtration. Where the polypeptide is secreted into
   the medium, the recombinant host cells may be separated from the cell culture medium by
   centrifugation or filtration, for example.
15              In the case of isolating antibodies, the majority of the purification occurs during
   protein A affinity chromatography, if used as the first step. Protein A is a bacterial cell wall
   protein that binds specifically to the Fc region of antibodies. When immobilized onto
   chromatography media, protein A provides a technique for purifying recombinant antibodies
   because it can selectively bind antibodies in complex solutions, allowing impurities to flow
20 through.
                The basic protocol of protein A affinity column is straightforward: bind at about
   neutral pH and elute at acid pH. Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used to purify the
   CH2 /CH 3        region-containing polypeptide. The solid phase is preferably a column comprising a
   glass, silica, agarose, or polystyrenedivinylbenzene surface for immobilizing the protein A.
25 Preferably, the solid phase is a controlled pore glass column, silicic acid column, or highly
   cross-linked agarose column. A Mabselect SuReTM column, commercially available from GE
   Healthcare, is an example of a highly cross-linked agarose protein A column effective at
   purifying antibodies. Sometimes, the column has been coated with a reagent, such as
   glycerol, in an attempt to prevent nonspecific adherence to the column. The PROSEP              ATM
30 column, commercially available from Millipore Corporation, is an example of a protein A
   controlled pore glass column which is coated with glycerol. The solid phase for the protein A
   chromatography is equilibrated with a suitable buffer.
                                                             26
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

                The contaminated preparation derived from the recombinant host cells is loaded on the
   equilibrated solid phase using a loading buffer which may be the same as the equilibration
   buffer. As the contaminated preparation flows through the solid phase, the polypeptide is
   adsorbed to the immobilized protein A, and other contaminants (such as Chinese Hamster
 5 Ovary Proteins, CHOP, where the polypeptide is produced in a CHO cell, gentamicin, and
   polyethyleneimine (PEI)) bind nonspecifically to the solid phase.
                The next step performed sequentially entails removing the contaminants bound to the
   solid phase by washing the solid phase with a solution containing a salt, amino acid, and/or
   hydrophobic electrolyte solvent in an intermediate wash step. In preferred embodiments, the
10 salt in this wash is potassium phosphate, the amino acid is arginine, and the hydrophobic
   electrolyte is TEMAC and/or TEAC. While a single solute may be present in the wash, in
   certain embodiments, two or more such solutes may be used. The solute(s) are preferably
   added to a pH buffered solution having a pH at about neutrality.
                Following the intermediate wash step of the preceding paragraph, the polypeptide of
15 interest is recovered from the column. This is normally achieved using a suitable elution
   buffer. The polypeptide may, for example, be eluted from the column using an elution buffer
   having a low pH, e.g., in the range from about 2 to about 5, and preferably in the range from
   about 2.5 to about 3.5. Examples of elution buffers for this purpose include citrate or acetate
   buffers.
20              Membrane ion exchange chromatography is performed as claimed herein. A decision
   is first made as to whether an anion or cation exchange membrane is to be employed.
   Although the isoelectric point (pI) of some antibodies ranges from approximately 6.7 to 9.4,
   the pI of many antibodies is high (often >8 and sometimes >9). In general, a cation exchange
   membrane may be used for antibodies with pI' s greatr than about 8, and an anion exchange
25 membrane may be used for antibodies with pI' s lessthan about 8.
                For membrane cation exchange chromatography run in overload mode, the pH of the
   load material is adjusted to about 1 to about 5 pH units below the pI of the antibody, the
   conductivity of the load material is adjusted to < about 40 mS/cm, depending on the pH, and
   the antibody is then pumped through the membrane. In some embodiments, the pH of the
30 load material is adjusted to about 1 to about 4 pH units, about 1 to about 3 pH units, about 1
   to about 2 pH units, or about 1 pH unit, below the pI of the antibody. In other embodiments,
   the conductivity of the load material is adjusted to < about 20 mS/cm or < about 10 mS/cm,
   depending on the pH. Because the pH of the load is less than the pI of the antibody, the
                                                     27
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   antibody (which has become positively charged) will NOT flow through initially. Rather, the
   antibody will be electrostatically bound to the negative functional groups of the cation
   exchanger. This is because the antibody (positive) and membrane (negative) have opposite
   charge. Since the pI of many contaminants, e.g., host cell proteins, such as CHOP or ECP,
 5 aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gentamicin, and ionic polymer additives, such as
   polyethyleneimine                 (PEI), that elute with the   antibody  during protein   A affinity
   chromatography is only slightly different from the pI of the antibody, that is, the pIs may
   differ by only about 0.05 to about 0.2 pI units, these contaminants, like the "basic"
   antibodies, will also bind to the membrane. In purification schemes where Protein A
10 chromatography is not used, gentamicin or PEI or other impurities will remain in high
   enough concentrations to disrupt the performance of an IEX column unless a membrane is
   used. Without being bound by theory, it appears that for membrane cation exchange
   chromatography run in overload mode, at pH and conductivity conditions that induce charge
   with minimal ionic shielding, competitive                  adsorption occurs  and the   contaminants
15 preferentially bind to the membrane, or otherwise effectively "displace" the antibody from
   the membrane (RR Drager , FE Regnier, J Chromatogr. 359:147-55 (1986)), allowing the
   antibody to "elute" from the matrix or flow through after binding and be recovered in the
   effluent.
                For membrane anion exchange chromatography run in overload mode, the pH of the
20 load material is adjusted to about 1 to about 5 pH units above the pI of the antibody, the
   conductivity of the load material is adjusted to < about 40 mS/cm, depending on the pH, and
   the antibody is then pumped through the membrane. In some embodiments, the pH of the
   load material is adjusted to about 1 to about 4 pH units, about 1 to about 3 pH units, about 1
   to about 2 pH units, or about 1 pH unit, above the pI of the antibody. In other embodiments,
25 the conductivity of the load material is adjusted to < about 20 mS/cm or < about 10 mS/cm,
   depending on the pH. Because the pH of the load is greater than the pI of the antibody, the
   antibody (which has become negatively charged) will NOT flow through initially. Rather, the
   antibody will be electrostatically bound to the positive functional groups of the anion
   exchanger. This is because the antibody (negative) and membrane (positive) have opposite
30 charge. Since the pI of many contaminants, e.g., host cell proteins, such as CHOP, that elute
   with the antibody during protein A affinity chromatography is only slightly different from the
   pI of the antibody, that is, the pIs may differ by only about 0.05 to about 0.2 pI units, these
   contaminants, like the "acidic" antibodies, will also bind to the membrane. Without being
                                                           28

   bound by theory, it appears that for membrane anion exchange chromatography run in
   overload mode, at pH and conductivity conditions that induce charge with minimal ionic
   shielding, competitive adsorption occurs and the contaminants preferentially bind to the
   membrane, or otherwise effectively "displace" the antibody from the membrane (RR Drager,
 5 FE Regnier, J Chromatogr. 359:147-55 (1986)), allowing the antibody to "elute" from the
   matrix or flow through after binding and be recovered in the effluent.
                In       one       example,  membrane    chromatography    is run on  either a standard
   chromatography system or a custom chromatography system like an AKTATM Explorer (GE
   Healthcare) equipped with pressure gauges, sensors, and pump plus pump controllers. In this
10 example, the membrane device is installed downstream of a pressure gauge. In said example,
   the pH and conductivity detectors are installed downstream of the membrane device.
   Continuing with this example, the system is thoroughly flushed with water and then with
   equilibration buffer before the installation of the membrane. Continuing further with the
   example, the system with the membrane is flushed with equilibration buffer until the solution
15 pH and conductivity outlet match the equilibration buffer specification (about five membrane
   volumes) and a stable baseline is observed. Continuing even further with this example, the
   feed material is loaded by a pump at 333 - 2667 MV/hour, pH 5.5 (for purification of a
   hypothetical "basic" antibody) or pH 8.0 (for purification of a hypothetical "acidic"
   antibody), and a conductivity of approximately 4 mS/cm. Continuing still further with this
20 example, the operation backpressure, and pH and conductivity changes during the operation
   are recorded. Finally, in this example, the polypeptide in the membrane effluent is collected
   immediately when an ultraviolet (UV) absorbance trace at 280 nm is 0.2 absorbance units
   over the baseline.                  After loading the feed material, the membrane is washed with an
   appropriate wash buffer, and the pool collection is stopped once the UV trace at 280 nm is
25 below 0.2 absorbance units, and the samples from the pool in the membrane effluent fraction
   are assayed for polypeptide concentration, dimer/aggregation level, host cell proteins, DNA,
   and leached protein A. The step recovery is typically calculated using the polypeptide loaded
   and the polypeptide in the membrane effluent. The membrane is traditionally one-time-use
   only. Regarding analytical assays, polypeptide content (polypeptide concentration) may be
30 determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a Beckman spectrophotometer. Polypeptide
   aggregation may be determined by size-exclusion chromatography. Host cell protein, e.g.,
   CHOP or ECP, levels may be analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Host-cell DNA may be quantitated by employment of TaqMAN PCR (polymerase chain
                                                             29

   reaction). Leached protein A may be performed using the immunochemical ELISA-based
   method recommended by the protein A resin vendor. Gentamicin may be analyzed by ELISA
   and polyethyleneimine (PEI), levels may be quantitated by             Q  Sepharose Fast Flow
   chromatography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

   acetic acid, citric acid, HEPES, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sodium hydroxide, TRIS,
   or other such acidic and basic buffers to reach a suitable pH. Any buffer system can also be
   conductivity adjusted up or down using purified water, water for injection (WFI), sodium
   acetate, sodium chloride, potassium phosphate, or other such low and high salt containing
25 buffers to reach a suitable conductivity.
                Development of the competitive adsorption membrane chromatography step involves
   running the load material through the membrane at various levels of pH and conductivity.
   The retention of the polypeptide, either polypeptide of interest or contaminant, can be
   enhanced when the molecule has a large electrostatic interaction. Electrostatic interactions
30 can be enhanced when operating under conditions where the polypeptides are highly charged,
   i.e., when using a buffer having a pH sufficiently distinct from the pI of the polypeptide,
   enhancing the charge of the polypeptide, and a low ionic strength to prevent the shielding of
   charges by buffer ions. In contrast, electrostatic interactions can be reduced when operating
                                                     30
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   under conditions where the polypeptides are poorly charged, i.e., when using a buffer having
   a pH sufficiently close to the pI of the polypeptide, reducing the charge of the polypeptide,
   and a high ionic strength to permit the shielding of charges by buffer ions. As a result,
   polypeptides having different physico-chemical properties can be separated by membrane
 5 adsorption by optimizing buffer solution. Some molecules can be retained on a given
   membrane while other ones flow through based on the appropriate selection of the pH and
   ionic strength of the buffer.
                The polypeptide preparation obtained according to the membrane ion exchange
   chromatography method herein may be subjected to additional purification steps, if
10 necessary. Exemplary further purification steps have been discussed above.
                Referring to Figure 1, one example of a successful purification scheme for an
   antibody is a recovery process entailing an initial capture step of protein A affinity
   chromatography, followed by a cation exchange column in run in bind and elute mode,
   followed by a final polishing step or steps.
15              Referring to Figure 1, one example of an improved purification scheme is a recovery
   process entailing an initial capture step of protein A affinity chromatography, followed by a
   cation exchange membrane run in overload mode protecting a cation exchange column run in
   bind and elute mode, followed by a final polishing step or steps.
                Referring to Figure 1, another example of an improved purification scheme is a
20 recovery process entailing an initial cation exchange membrane run in overload mode
   protecting a cation exchange column run in bind and elute mode, followed by a polishing step
   or steps.
                Referring to Figure 2, one example of a successful purification scheme for a non
   antibody is a recovery process entailing an initial capture step of cation exchange
25 chromatography, followed by a final polishing step or steps.
                Referring to Figure 2, one example of an improved purification scheme is a recovery
   process entailing an initial cation exchange membrane run in overload mode protecting a
   cation exchange column run in bind and elute mode, followed by a polishing step or steps.
                Unlike applications that use the IEX membranes primarily as a sole purification step
30 or final polishing step, the membranes in the present purification method are being used to
   protect a similarly charged ion exchange membrane (e.g. a cation exchange membrane placed
   directly in front of a cation exchange resin). This is beneficial because the membranes are
   more selective for impurities than polypeptides/antibodies so they reduce or eliminate the
                                                     31
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   impurities going onto the column. The impurities can also displace the polypeptide / antibody
   so that it eventually makes its way onto the column. The membranes can be used either
   continuously or non-continuously with the aforementioned column.
                Using the membranes prior to the similarly charged ion exchange column in this
 5 purification method may be advantageous whenever impurities in the load are decreasing the
   performance of the cation exchange column.                By removing those impurities with the
   membrane, it may allow the cation exchange column to be loaded to higher binding capacity,
   resulting in a reduced column size or a decreased number of cycles per run. Alternatively, by
   removing those impurities with a membrane, it may allow the cation exchange column to
10 have an increase step yield, or have a longer resin lifetime before being discarded, or result in
   decreased impurity levels in the cation exchange pool, or decrease the number of downstream
   polishing steps. It may also allow a cation exchange column to replace a protein A affinity
   column which may be advantageous if a cheaper alternative to protein A affinity resin were
   needed, or if the polypeptide of interest will not bind to a protein A affinity resin. Using a
15 cation exchange membrane and cation exchange column in continuous operation may be
   advantageous by reducing total processing time, buffers, or equipment such as tanks or
   chromatography skids.
                Optionally, the polypeptide is conjugated to one or more heterologous molecules as
   desired. The heterologous molecule may, for example, be one which increases the serum
20 half-life of the polypeptide (e.g., polyethylene glycol, PEG), or it may be a label (e.g., an
   enzyme, fluorescent label and/or radionuclide), or a cytotoxic molecule (e.g., a toxin,
   chemotherapeutic drug, or radioactive isotope etc).
                A therapeutic formulation comprising the polypeptide, optionally conjugated with a
   heterologous molecule, may be prepared by mixing the polypeptide having the desired degree
25 of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers
   (Remington's PharmaceuticalSciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), in the form of
   lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. "Pharmaceutically acceptable" carriers,
   excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations
   employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids;
30 antioxidants                 including  ascorbic acid and  methionine;  preservatives  (such   as
   octadecyldimethylbenzyl                ammonium chloride; hexamethonium   chloride; benzalkonium
   chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as
   methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low

   molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin,
   gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino
   acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides,
   disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating
 5 agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming
   counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic
   surfactants such as TWEENTM , PLURONICST M or polyethylene glycol (PEG).
                The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared, for example,
   by         coacervation           techniques   or   by   interfacial    polymerization,    for  example,
10 hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule,
   respectively,              in colloidal   drug delivery systems     (for example,    liposomes,  albumin
   microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such
   techniques are disclosed in Remington's PharmaceuticalSciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.
   (1980).
15              The formulation to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily
   accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.
                Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained
   release preparations                include semipermeable   matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers
   containing the polypeptide, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or
20 microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for
   example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat.
   No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and y ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable
   ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON

   Example 1
                Introduction
                This study focuses on the purification of monoclonal antibodies using ion exchange
 5 membranes in competitive adsorption mode to enhance the efficiency of downstream
   columns. Since membranes operating in competitive adsorption mode bind many impurities
   more strongly than monoclonal antibodies or other polypeptides of interest, the membrane
   effectively removes impurities that can have a detrimental effect on a similarly charged,
   downstream column.
10              This approach is counter-intuitive to many purification processes which try to
   eliminate redundant cation exchange or anion exchange purification steps.                    In this
   application, a redundant membrane prior to a downstream column can enhance the
   performance of the column such that the overall process is more efficient.
                One recombinant DNA derived mAb, one recombinant DNA derived one-armed
15 antibody, and one recombinant DNA derived polypeptide were selected for analysis based on
   their molecular variety. The mAb was produced in CHO cell cultures and varied in degrees of
   purification ranging from no chromatography purification to three column chromatography
   steps (Protein A, anion exchange, and cation exchange).                  The one-armed antibody was
   produced in E.coli cell cultures and had been purified through a Protein A chromatography
20 step. The polypeptide was produced in E.coli cell cultures and had no prior chromatography
   purification. Feedstreams were chosen based on residual levels of impurities that could
   negatively affect a chromatography column.
                This         study   explores the ability   for impurities,   such  as gentamicin  and
   polyethyleneimine (PEI), to negatively affect ion exchange columns and the ability of ion
25 exchange membranes, such as Mustang TM S and Natrix S, to clear those impurities resulting
   in improved column performance.
                Materials and Methods
                Feedstream
                The feedstreams were taken from industrial, pilot, or small-scale cell culture batches
30 (Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California) initially produced for commercial or
   research purposes. Feedstreams had varying degrees of purification, meaning the cells were
   separated and the clarified fluid was or was not purified over at least one column
   chromatography step. Each feedstream contained a target therapeutic polypeptide and a
                                                          34

      quantifiable level of impurities. The composition of each feedstream varied depending on the
      individual polypeptide process and the level of purification. Table 1 shows feedstream
      characteristics for each of the antibodies, polypeptides, or monovalent antibodies used in this
      study.

                Polypeptide Quantification
                The concentration of polypeptide was determined using three methods.         When
   impurity levels were too low to have an appreciable effect on UV absorbance, a
 5 UV-spectrophotometric scan at 280 and 320 nm was used. When impurity levels or color
   may have had an appreciable effect on UV absorbance, an analytical affinity column or ion
   exchange column was used to quantify antibody or polypeptide concentrations, respectively.
                For samples tested by UV-spectrophotometric            scan, the samples containing
   polypeptide were diluted with appropriate non-interfering diluent into the range of 0.1 to 1.0
10 AU. Sample preparation and spec scan readings were performed in duplicate and the average
   value was recorded. The absorption coefficient for the polypeptides tested was 1.45 - 1.70
   (mg/mL) cm 1 . The absorbance at 280 and 320 nm, dilution factor, path length (1 cm), and
   absorption extinction coefficient were used to calculate the mAb concentration using the
   equation known as the Beer-Lambert Law.
                                         A28o - A320              15

                                         abs.coeff.
                For samples tested by analytical affinity columns, the samples containing antibody
   were diluted with appropriate non-interfering diluent, if needed, into the range of 0.025 - 4.0
   mg/mL. Alternatively, the injection volume could be doubled or halved for lower or higher
   concentration samples, respectively. Sample preparation and HPLC testing were performed
20 in duplicate and the average value was recorded. As a generic antibody HPLC assay, the
   sample concentration results are corrected for the specific antibody by using the
   corresponding absorption extinction coefficient against the reference material' s Mtibody
   absorption extinction coefficient.
                For samples tested by analytical ion exchange column, the samples containing
25 polypeptide were diluted with appropriate non-interfering diluent, if needed, into the range of
   0.1 - 0.8 mg/mL. Sample preparation and HPLC testing were performed in duplicate and the
   average value was recorded. The sample concentration results are determined by integrating
   the area under the injection peak and correlated to a standard curve using reference material.
                CHO Host Cell Proteins (CHOP) Quantification
30              An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantitate the levels of
   CHOP. Affinity-purified goat anti-CHOP antibodies were immobilized on microtiter plate
   wells. Dilutions of the samples containing CHOP, standards, and controls, were incubated in
                                                      36

   the wells, followed by incubation with goat anti-CHOP antibodies conjugated to horseradish
   peroxidase.              The      horseradish peroxidase  enzymatic activity was detected with o
   phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. The CHOP was quantitated by reading absorbance at 492
   nm in a microtiter plate reader. A computer curve-fitting program was used to generate the
 5 standard curve and automatically calculate the sample concentration. The assay range for the
   ELISA was typically 5 ng/ml to 320 ng/ml. For each sample, 2-4 dilutions were assayed and
   the values were averaged. CHOP values were divided by the protein concentration and the
   results were reported in units of ppm (ng CHOP/mg protein).
                E. Coli Proteins (ECP) Quantification
10              An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantitate the levels of
   ECP in a similar manner as for CHOP Quantification.
                Gentamicin Quantification
                An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantitate the levels of
   gentamicin. Goat polyclonal antibody to gentamicin-BSA is immobilized on microtiter plate
15 wells. Gentamicin competes with biotin-gentamicin for binding to the antibody. The amount
   of bound biotin-gentamicin is measured with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin whose
   enzymatic activity is detected with tetramethyl benzidine (TMB). Samples are diluted with
   the ELISA assay diluent according to the acceptable dilution established during sample
   qualification. The gentamicin is quantitated by reading absorbance at 450 nm in a microtiter
20 plate reader. A minimum 4-parameter computer curve-fitting program is used to generate the
   standard curve and automatically calculate the sample concentration. Typically, the reporting
   range for the standard curve in the gentamicin assay is 0.58 ng/mL to 90 ng/mL. For each
   sample, 2-4 dilutions were assayed and the values were averaged. Gentamicin values were
   divided by the protein concentration and the results were reported in units of ppm (ng
25 gentamicin/mg protein).
                Polyethyleneimine Quantification
                All data was recorded on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5mm
   gradient-equipped TCI cryoprobe and an auto sampler. Data was acquired using a spin-echo
   pulse sequence designed to minimize resonance signals from the protein in solution. An
30 excitation sculpting pulse sequence coupled with a presaturation pulse sequence was
   designed to minimize the resonance signal from water in solution. Prior to the NMR
                                                            37

   measurement, D 2 0 was added to all samples to a final concentration of 10% (630 mL of
   sample + 70 mL of D2 0).
                The quantitative NMR assay is a general analytical method and can be applied to an
   exceptionally large number of organic molecules. Generally, every molecule has a unique set
 5 of NMR signals with characteristic resonance frequencies, relative peak intensities, line
   widths, and coupling patterns. The only criteria for the NMR assay to be suitable for
   determining concentration of a small, proton-containing molecule is that the NMR signal of
   analyte and the buffer components do not overlap. The NMR assay is accurate and precise
   over a large range of analyte concentrations (for example, 1 ug/mL to 154,500 ug/mL for
10 propylene glycol.)
                Chromatography Membranes
                The membranes tested were the Mustang TM S (Pall Corporation, East Hills, New
   York) and Natrix S (Natrix Separations, Burlington, Canada). The Mustang TM S and Natrix S
   are strong cation exchange membranes that effectively bind positively-charged proteins and
15 viral particles. The Mustang TM S is made of polyethersulfone (PES) with 0.8 pm pores and
   modified with a form of sulfonic acid.           The Natrix S membrane consists of a polymeric
   hydrogel formed within a flexible porous support matrix. The support matrix provides
   mechanical strength, while the hydrogel properties determine the separation chemistry of the
   product.           To increase binding capacity the manufacturer can combine multiple layers of
20 membrane into each device. The total number of layers and thickness vary depending on the
   manufacturer and the size of the device being fabricated.        Membrane volume (MV) is the
   physical volume of the membrane (solids and voids) and is measured in units of mL. A
   variety of membrane devices representing multiple scales were used in this study. Table 2
   lists the pertinent specifications for each membrane tested.

   Jersey).          The Fractogel SE Hicap and SP Sepharose Fast Flow resins are strong cation
   exchange resins. The Fractogel SE Hicap resin is made of cross linked polymethacrylate
10 particles of 40 - 90 pm diameter with pore size of about 800 A. The functional ligand is
   covalently attached to the particle with a long, linear polymer chain. The SP Sepharose Fast
   Flow resin is made of highly cross-linked agarose particles of 45 - 165 pm diameter with a
    ~4,000,000 Da exclusion limit.                   Sepharose Fast Flow is a cross-linked derivative of
   Sepharose with a sulfopropyl ligand as the functional group. The cross-linking method is
15 proprietary to the manufacturer.
                Membrane and Resin Purification Systems
                Small-scale tests were performed with an AKTA ExplorerT M 100 (GE Healthcare,
   Fairfield, Connecticut), which is a programmable process purification system that includes an
   integrated metering pump, pressure sensor, and in-line pH, conductivity, and UV sensor. The
20 Explorer system was programmed and controlled through a computer running UNICORNTM
   v5.10 software (GE Healthcare,                    Fairfield, Connecticut). Small-scale tests were also
   performed using a manual system consisting of a Masterflex@ L/S@ digital economy drive
   peristaltic pump (Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, Illinois), in-line DTX T M Plus TNF-R pressure
                                                              39

   sensor (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey), and a AND EK-1200i balance
   (A&D Company, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The balance was used to physically monitor the flow
   rate of the pump by measuring mass accumulation. Mass was converted to volume assuming
   a feedstream density of 1.0 g/mL. The pressure from the in-line transducers and mass from
 5 the balance were continuously monitored using a NetDAQTM 2640A/41A network data
   acquisition system (Fluke, Everett, Washington) which was linked to a computer running
   TrendlinkTM version 3.1.1 (Canary Labs Inc., Martinsburg, Pennsylvania) and RsCom version
   2.40 (A&D Company, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) software for pressure and mass collection,
   respectively.
10              Membrane Flow Through Sample Collection Techniques
                Flow through samples were collected in three different ways. Grab samples and
   fractions were the most common. A grab sample is a small instantaneous aliquot of flow
   through taken at a specific throughput. Fractions are larger flow through samples and are
   defined by throughput ranges. Flow through was also collected as a single large pool. Pool
15 analysis is effective, but grab samples and fractions are generally more useful for monitoring
   mAb and impurity levels because consecutive samples can be combined to show trends.
                Dynamic Binding Capacity (DBC) Techniques
                The dynamic binding capacities (DBC) of membranes and resins were determined by
   loading the feedstream onto the media at a typical process flow rate.         This was preferred
20 rather than letting the media soak in the load feedstream, as typically done to determine a
   static binding capacity. For this application, the DBC was a more appropriate measure of the
   medias'          performance.     The DBC was determined by taking flow through grab samples or
   fractions during the loading phase. Using the specific throughput for grab samples or the
   volume of all fractions and the concentration of the polypeptide or impurity for all grab
25 samples or fractions enabled a DBC graph to be generated. Additionally, if the polypeptide
   or impurity concentrations in the load material was known, a graph could be generated to
   compare the filtrate concentrations (C) to the load concentration (Co). In this case, a C/Co
   value of 0 indicates the filtrate concentration is much lower than the load concentration,
   while a C/Co value of 1 indicates the filtrate concentration is similar to the load
30 concentration.

                Experimental
                Feedstock was removed from cold storage (2-8'C or < -70'C) and allowed to
   equilibrate to room temperature. It was then optionally pH and/or conductivity adjusted from
   the conditions shown in Table 1 using appropriate titrating agent (i.e. 1.5 M tris base or 1 M
 5 citric acid) or diluent (purified water or 5 M sodium chloride). It was then filtered offline
   using an AcroPak TM 20 (Pall Corporation, East Hills, New York), AcroPakTM 1000 (Pall
   Corporation, East Hills, New York), or 1000 mL vacuum filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
   Rochester, New York) to remove any precipitates that may have formed during cold storage
   or conditioning.
10              The purification system was prepared by flushing the load and flow through lines
   using purified water or appropriate buffer. The membrane was placed in-line downstream of
   the feed pump and pressure sensor and then it was flushed with 50 - 500 MV of purified
   water or equilibration buffer. After flushing, the feedstream was loaded onto the membrane
   and a variable amount was loaded at a constant flow rate of 333 - 2667 MV/hour. During the
15 load phase the flow through was sampled as necessary. The membrane was then optionally
   chased with buffer to collect any residual product. To maintain retention of impurities on the
   membrane, the chase (a.k.a wash buffer) buffer was generally similar in pH and equal to or
   lower in conductivity to the feed.
                The resulting membrane grab samples, fractions, or pools were then analyzed to
20 determine polypeptide and/or impurity concentrations.
                In some cases, the resulting membrane pools were then loaded onto a resin. Resin
   chromatography was only performed using an Xkta Explorer so that UV, pH, and
   conductivity could be trended real-time and pooling could be facilitated by the in-line UV
   sensor. During the load phase the flow through was sampled as necessary.
25              In some cases the membrane was eluted. Membrane elution was only performed using
   the Xkta Explorer so that pooling could be facilitated by the in-line UV sensor. The
   membrane was eluted using a high salt buffer (20 mM sodium acetate and 350 mM sodium
   chloride, pH 5.5). Additionally, in some cases the membrane was eluted with a gradient of
   two buffers, (20 mM sodium acetate, 0 mM sodium chloride, pH 5.5 and 20 mM sodium
30 acetate, 2000 mM sodium chloride, pH 5.5) from 0 - 100% over 20 mL.
                In some cases the resin was eluted. Resin elution was only performed using the Akta
   Explorer so that pooling could be facilitated by the in-line UV sensor. The resins were eluted
                                                     41

   using a high salt buffer gradient (50 to 500 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5) or a high salt step
   (50 mM HEPES, 200 mM sodium chloride, 0.05% Triton, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5) at a constant
   flow rate of 200 cm/hr and was pooled from 0.5 - 1.0 OD or 1.25 - 1.25 OD for the Fractogel
   SE Hicap and SP Sepharose Fast Flow, respectively.
 5              Results
                Small-scale Cation Exchange Membrane Yield
                MAb 1 anion exchange pool at pH 8.0 and 5.0 mS/cm and mAb 1 anion exchange
   pool that was adjusted to pH 5.5 and 6.4 mS/cm using IM citric acid, were processed over a
   Mustang TM S membrane at 667 MV/hour. The Mustang TM S membrane used was a 0.18 mL
10 Acrodisc@ device. The mAb 1 feedstreams at pH 5.5 and pH 8.0 were both below the pI of
   the antibody, and therefore positively charged. Feed and flow through grab samples were
   analyzed for antibody concentration. Although initial samples show some antibody binding to
   the membrane, Figure 3 shows yield is similar at both pH conditions, increased rapidly under
    1000 g/L load density, and >96% is attainable after a load density of approxi mately 5000
15 g/L.
                Small-scale Anion Exchange Membrane Yield
                For comparison purposes mAb 2 was selected for testing using an anion exchange
   membrane above the isoelectric point of 7.7. Proteins are prone to deamidation and
   aggregation at high pH so similar tests were not performed on mAb 1. Cation exchange pool
20 at pH 5.5 and 9 mS/cm was pH adjusted to 8.0 using 1.5 M tris base. The feedstock was then
   split into three separate pools and conductivity was adjusted using purified water. The first
   pool was at 10 mS/cm, the second and third pools were adjusted to 7 mS/cm and 4 mS/cm,
   respectively. All three pools were maintained at pH 8.0. Each feedstream was then processed
   over a small-scale 0.35 mL Mustang TM      Q at constant flow rate of 600 MV/hour. The mAb 3
25 at pH 8.0 was 0.3 pH units above the pI and therefore the antibody was negatively charged.
   Load and flow through pools were analyzed for antibody concentration.         Figure 4 shows
   yield is similar at all three pH conditions, increased rapidly initially under 200 g/L load
   density, and -96% after approximately 1000 g/L load density.
                Small-scale Cation Exchange Membrane Impurity Clearance
30              To evaluate cation exchange membrane impurity clearance, mAb 3 Protein A pool at
   pH 5.5 and 3.2 mS/cm was processed over a small-scale 0.18 mL Mustang TM S membrane at
                                                   42
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   a constant flow rate of 1333 MV/hour. The mAb 3 load was 3.4 units below the calculated pI
   and therefore the antibody was positively charged. Load, flow through fractions, and elution
   samples were analyzed and the results for CHOP are shown in Figure 5. The data show the
   Mustang TM S initially reduced CHOP from 438 to 109 ppm. CHOP increased to 318 ppm as
 5 load density approached 55,300 g/L. The membrane was eluted using a solution containing
   high salt.             The salt ions are used to shield the charges, thus disrupting the electrostatic
   interactions and causing the proteins to desorb from the membrane surface and move freely
   into the mobile phase. Analysis of the elution pool shows an enrichment of impurities
   confirming that CHOP bind to the membrane due to electrostatic forces.
10              To further evaluate adsorber performance, mAb 3 anion exchange pool at pH 5.5 and
   6.0 mS/cm was processed over a small-scale 0.18 mL Mustang TM S membrane at a constant
   flow rate of 667 MV/hour. The mAb 3 pH was 3.4 pH units below the pI and therefore the
   antibody was positively charged. Feed and flow through grab samples were analyzed for
   mAb, CHOP, and gentamicin concentrations.                   To compare the feed and grab sample
15 concentrations, a C/Co graph (grab sample / load) as a function of membrane load density
   was generated. As shown in Figure 6, mAb C/Co values are near 1.0 from 2 to 16 kg/L load
   densities, suggesting that the grab sample concentrations are nearly identical to the load
   concentration, and once again yield would be high. Conversely, the CHOP and gentamicin
   C/Co values are low, at <0. 2 from 2 to 16 kg/L load densities, suggesting that the grab
20 sample concentrations are much lower than the load concentration and the Mustang TM S is
   removing the majority of these impurities despite being overloaded with mAb.
                Small-scale Cation Exchange Membrane Binding Selectivity
                To evaluate whether the cation exchange membranes are selective for binding certain
   impurities versus mAb, a series of experiments were designed and executed using mAb 3
25 Protein A pool. This pool was chosen due to its higher level of impurities, including high
   molecular weight species (HMWS), dimer, low molecular weight species (LMWS),
   gentamicin, and CHOP. The Protein A pool was adjusted to pH 5.5 and 4.4 mS/cm. Prior to
   loading, each Mustang TM S membrane was equilibrated with 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5
   and 1.3 mS/cm buffer.                 Four experiments were performed, each loading a 0.18 mL
30 Mustang TM S membrane at 1333 MV/hour to load densities of 1000, 5000, 10000, or 15000
   g/L. After loading, the membranes were washed with 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5 and 1.3
   mS/cm buffer. After washing, a gradient elution using wash buffer and 20 mM sodium
                                                          43
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   acetate, 2M sodium chloride, pH 5.1 and ~500 mS/cm was used to elute the membrane. The
   gradient was formed over 20 mL, and elution fractions were taken every 2 mL to be
   analyzed. For the four experiments, the elution fractions were analyzed for all impurities and
   mAb concentrations. At any given load density experiment, the fractions could be compared
 5 to determine when an impurity or mAb was eluting from the membrane, with later eluting
   species being bound more tightly than earlier eluting species.              Figure 7 shows the %
   normalized concentrations of the various species analyzed across the 10 fraction elution for
   the 5000 g/L load density experiment The position of each peak suggests that mAb monomer
   is binding the weakest to the membrane since it elutes earliest. In increasing order of binding
10 strength, monomer is followed by HMWS, Dimer, CHOP, LMWS, and gentamicin.
   Although many species are eluting at a similar position in the gradient, this graph clearly
   shows gentamicin binds much stronger than the competing species.
                Additionally, for each load density, the total mass of each impurity or mAb bound to
   the column could be calculated, and compared across the various load density experiments.
15 Figure 8 shows the % normalized mass of each species as a function of increasing membrane
   load density. The direction of the lines indicates whether the species' mass is increasing or
   decreasing. mAb monomer, which was previously shown to bind the weakest, has decreasing
   levels of mass as load density increases.          Conversely, dimer, HMWS, CHOP, gentamicin,
   and LMWS are all increasing in mass as load density increases. This confirms the previous
20 binding strength results and suggests that mAb monomer is decreasing due to other species
   continually binding to the membrane.
                Small-scale Cation Exchange Membrane Displacement
                To determine if a strong binding species such as gentamicin can elute mAb monomer,
   as a hypothesis to explain the binding selectivity results, an experiment was performed using
25 mAb 3 Protein A pool.             The Protein A pool was adjusted to pH 5.5 and 4.2 mS/cm. The
   experiment was performed by equilibrating the 0.18 mL Mustang TM S membrane with 20
   mM sodium acetate, pH 5.4.             The mAb 1 Protein A pool was loaded until the UV trend
   clearly showed mAb breakthrough.              The membrane was then washed with equilibration
   buffer before an elution buffer comprised of equilibration buffer and 2 g/L gentamicin was
30 used to elute the membrane.            It should be noted that the equilibration buffer and elution
   buffer were of identical pH and conductivity to prevent any effects on mAb binding to the
   membrane. Figure 9 shows the chromatogram, including UV, pH, and conductivity trends,
                                                       44
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   during the load, wash, and elution phases. The chromatogram shows that the wash phase was
   sufficient in returning the UV trend to baseline before the elution phase was initiated. It also
   shows that during the elution phase, a large UV peak is observed without any significant
   change to the pH or conductivity trends. This demonstrates that gentamicin can effectively
 5 displace bound mAb monomer from a cation exchange membrane.
                CEX Membranes Gentamicin Binding Comparison
                To determine the CEX membrane binding capacity of gentamicin, experiments were
   performed testing the 0.18 mL Mustang TM S membrane and the 0.23 mL Natrix S. A PBS
   buffer at pH 7.2 was adjusted with 2.OM acetic acid and PW to a final pH of 5.00 and
10 conductivity of 8.10 mS/cm. The adjusted buffer was then spiked with mAb 3 UF/DF pool
   and gentamicin to final concentrations of approximately 1.0 mg/mL and 40,000 ng/mL. The
   resulting spiked solution was used as the load feedstream.
                To perform the experiments, both membranes were flushed with PW, equilibrated
   with the adjusted buffer, loaded with the spiked solution, and washed with the adjusted
15 buffer. During the loading phase, 4 mL flow-through grab samples were collected for the
   Mustang TM S at 20, 40, 60, and 80 mL. For the Natrix S, a 4 mL flow-through grab sample
   was collected at 10 mL and then every 60 mL for a total of 19 samples. All samples were
   then        analyzed            for mAb and gentamicin concentration   and compared to the      load
   concentrations to create a C/Co graph versus membrane load density as shown in Figure 10.
20              Although not plotted, the mAb concentration reaches a C/Co value of 1.0, suggesting
   that the step would be high yielding for antibody in the flow-through.             Gentamicin C/Co
   values, conversely, reach 1.0 much later, suggesting that both membranes are binding
   significant levels. The Mustang TM S had a gentamicin binding capacity between 4.4 and 8.9
   g/Lm while the Natrix S had a higher gentamicin binding capacity and showed slower
25 breakthrough. At 50 g/L, the C/Co value was 0.3 and the breakthrough curve was somewhat
   linear up to about 125 g/Lm and a C/Co value of about 0.8. After 125 g/Lm the breakthrough
   curve flattens out suggesting that the membrane may still be binding gentamicin while
   possibly displacing small levels of mAb.
                These results show that different CEX membranes have different gentamicin binding
30 capacities and breakthrough curves.              The Natrix S, with its higher binding capacity and
   gradual breakthrough, would make a more effective membrane for removing gentamicin.
                                                         45
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   Additionally, by binding higher levels of gentamicin, it would be expected that more mAb is
   displaced, resulting in a higher yielding operation.
                CEX Resins and the Effects of Strongly Binding Aminoglycoside Antibiotics
                To determine what effect a strongly binding impurity such as gentamicin may have on
 5 a packed column of CEX resin, a series of experiments were designed to test both model
   feedstreams and actual feedstreams, with or without a CEX membrane protecting the column.
   Figure 11 shows the various experiments, antibody and impurity concentrations, and steps
   needed to perform these experiments.
                First, using a model feedstream of PBS spiked with mAb 3 UF/DF pool and varying
10 levels of gentamicin, a Fractogel SE Hicap resin was tested for antibody binding capacity by
   generating breakthrough curves. The PBS was first adjusted with 1.OM acetic acid to pH 5.0,
   then adjusted with PW to a conductivity of 8.0 mS/cm. The UF/DF pool was spiked into the
   adjusted buffer to a mAb concentration of approximately 1.6 mg/mL.
                For each chromatography experiment performed, the Fractogel SE Hicap was first
15 equilibrated with 25 mM sodium acetate at pH 5 prior to loading with the desired feedstream.
   After loading, the column was washed with 50 mM sodium acetate at pH 5.5, washed with 25
   mM HEPES at pH 7.7, washed with 50 mM sodium acetate at pH 5.5, eluted using 350 mM
   sodium acetate at pH 5.5, regenerated using 1 M NaCl and 0.5N NaOH, and then stored in
   0.1N NaOH until the column' s next use.
20              Without spiking gentamicin, a first experiment was performed and showed an
   antibody DBC of 108 g/L. Next, the above adjustment and spiking was performed with the
   addition of gentamicin to a final concentration of 24,100 mg/mL. This experiment showed a
   decreased antibody DBC of 89 g/L.              That condition was repeated with a gentamicin
   concentration of 30,500, and the antibody DBC of 88 g/L was calculated. This data shows
25 that using a model system of PBS, purified antibody, and varying levels of gentamicin, the
   presence of gentamicin decreases antibody DBC on the Fractogel SE Hicap resin from 108
   mg/mL to approximately 88 g/L.
                Next, two experiments were performed using harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF)
   containing approximately 0.9 mg/mL mAb 3, 24,100 - 30,000 ng/mL gentamicin, and
30 408,000 ng/mL CHOP.               Using HCCF at gentamicin levels consistent with the model
   feedstream, antibody DBCs of 68 and 71 g/L.             A possible explanation for the difference
                                                      46
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   between the model feedstream DBCs of 88 and 89 g/L and the DBCs of 68 and 71 g/L using
   HCCF is the presence of high levels of CHOP in the feedstream.
                Figure 12 shows all antibody breakthrough curves from the above mentioned
   experiments, as well as impurity levels of the feedstream, and approximated DBCs. The runs
 5 were also performed in a randomized order to avoid possible degradation of the column or
   gentamicin carryover from run to run.         The order of experiments is listed in the table
   accompanying Figure 12.           There was no correlation between order of experiments and
   antibody DBC, so it is unlikely that the column was degrading or that gentamicin carryover
   was affecting subsequent runs.
10              Finally, knowing that the presence of gentamicin in the feedstream shows a
   significant decrease in column DBCs and that CEX membranes are able to bind gentamicin
   without binding significant levels of antibody, two experiments were performed to test
   whether a CEX membrane could protect and improve performance on a CEX resin. Because
   the Natrix S showed improved binding capacity of gentamicin over the Mustang TM S it was
15 used to protect the Fractogel SE Hicap. 2L of HCCF were thawed, adjusted to pH 5 with 2M
   acetic acid, adjusted to 8 mS/cm with PW, and off-line sterile filtered to remove any effects
   from the freezing and thawing of the feedstream. From this adjusted and filtered feedstream,
   the load was split with one portion being loaded onto the column while the other portion was
   processed through a 0.75 mL Natrix S and then loaded onto the Fractogel SE Hicap. For
20 both column load phases, 15 mL fractions were taken for about 60 samples each.           The
   adjusted HCCF, Natrix flow-through, and Fractogel SE Hicap fractions were analyzed for
   antibody and gentamicin concentrations.        The resulting HCCF and Natrix flow-through
   feedstream antibody and impurity concentrations, as well as the resulting Fractogel SE Hicap
   breakthrough curves are shown in Figure 13.             The resulting data shows the Natrix
25 successfully reduced gentamicin levels in the adjusted HCCF from 24,100 ng/mL to 870
   ng/mL. CHOP levels were slightly decreased from 408,000 ng/mL to 328,000 ng/mL. The
   antibody concentration was slightly lower at 0.83 mg/mL compared to the adjusted HCCF
   concentration of 0.88 mg/mL, representing a yield of about 94%. Finally, the resulting CEX
   column breakthrough curves show column had an antibody DBC of 72 g/L using the adjusted
30 HCCF and an antibody DBC of 94 g/L using the Natrix flow-through. This represents an
   approximate 30% increase in DBC by passing a gentamicin containing feedstream through a
   CEX membrane prior to loading on the CEX column.

                CEX Membrane ECP and PEI Breakthrough
                To test whether similar performance could be observed using a CEX membrane with
   other impurities, such as ECPs or PEI, an experiment was performed using Monovalent
   Antibody 1 Protein A pool and a 0.23 mL Natrix S membrane. The Protein A pool used had
 5 been previously adjusted to pH 6.7 using 1.5M TRIS base, and diluted to a conductivity of
   2.5 mS/cm using PW. The load, which had an antibody concentration of 4.7 g/L, 130 ug/mL
   PEI, and 8,870 ng/mL ECP, was loaded onto an equilibrated Natrix S and flow-through
   fractions of 2 mL for 10 samples followed by 5 mL fractions for 12 samples were taken. The
   flow-through fractions were then analyzed for antibody, PEI, and ECP concentration which
10 were then used to generate a C/Co versus the membrane' s antibody load density. Figure 14
   shows that both antibody and ECPs break through the CEX membrane at approximately 123
   mg/mL. Because the PEI level of quantification is 30 ug/mL, the first few samples were at or
   below that level, and Figure 14 shows a C/Co value of 0.23 since it was unknown what
   concentration of PEI exists in those samples. Disregarding the PEI levels at 0.23, PEI appears
15 to break through at 330 mg/mL, significantly later than both antibody and ECPs.           These
   results suggest that CEX membranes are also effective in removing ionic polymers without
   negatively effecting antibody yield.
                CEX Resins and the Effects of Strongly Binding Ionic Polymers
                To determine what effect a strongly binding impurity such as PEI may have on a
20 packed column of CEX resin, a series of experiments were performed evaluating the levels of
   PEI used during the extraction of Polypeptide 1 and their effect on a SP Sepharose Fast Flow
   column. Because the feedstream was more impure for this product, it was not possible to
   quantify the PEI levels going onto the column, instead the levels of PEI used during
   extraction were noted.
25              For these experiments, the extracted product was conditioned with varying levels of
   PEI ranging from 0.75 to 1.05%, diluted with PW, and centrifuged to produce 4 centrate
   samples.           Each centrate sample, at approximately pH 7.0 and 8.0 mS/cm was then loaded
   onto the SP Sepharose Fast Flow column with flow-through samples collected and analyzed
   for polypeptide concentration. The resulting data was used to generate a C/Co graph as a
30 function of resin polypeptide load density. Figure 15 shows the breakthrough curves and the
   corresponding DBC of the column for each centrate tested. As shown in the table, as PEI %
   increases during the extraction process, the column' s DBC decreases.
                                                       48
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

                Additionally, on a second set of experiments using Polypeptide 1, centrates of varying
   PEI % were loaded onto the SP Sepharose Fast Flow column, with the column subsequently
   being washed and eluted for each experiment. The resulting pools from each experiment
   were then analyzed for polypeptide concentration, ECPs, and product size by size exclusion
 5 chromatograph. Figure 16 shows that the pools generated using increasing levels of PEI %
   during extraction result in decreases in step yield and the pool increasing levels of impurity,
   such as ECPs, product aggregates, or dimers.
                Although experiments were not performed using a CEX membrane prior to this CEX
   column, knowing that PEI can be bound by the Natrix S from previous experiments and
10 seeing the decreased CEX column' s performance as a function of PEI %, it could be
   hypothesized that using a CEX membrane on this feedstream would improve not only the
   binding capacity of the column, but also the resulting pool.
                Conclusion
                Ion exchange membranes were shown to be effective at removing impurities at pH
15 and conductivity conditions that cause protein binding.                     By operating via overload
   chromatography and promoting competitive adsorption between impurities and the protein of
   interest, yields were shown to be >96% after load densities of 1000 -                   5000 g/Lm were
   achieved.              Cation exchange membranes were shown to bind and significantly reduce
   impurities such as CHOP and gentamicin in the membrane flow through fractions, with C/Co
20 values < 0.2 to load densities of 16,000 g/Lm.                The cation exchange membranes were also
   shown to exhibit selectivity for binding certain impurities versus antibody using more crude
   feedstreams containing high molecular weight species, dimer, low molecular weight species,
   gentamicin, and CHOP.                   In these studies, it was shown that these impurities bind with
   varying strength, increasing membrane load densities show continued binding of impurities
25 while antibody bound to the membrane decreases, and small molecular weight, highly
   charged species such as gentamicin bind much stronger than the competing species.
   Furthermore, competitive adsorption and displacement chromatography were confirmed to
   occur by eluting antibody from a cation exchange membrane using buffer containing
   gentamicin. Two cation exchange membranes, the Mustang TM S and Natrix S, were shown to
30 have dynamic binding capacities for gentamicin of 4.4 - 8.9 g/Lm and 50 g/Lm, respectively.
   The breakthrough curve for the Natrix S was also shown to be more gradual than the
   Mustang TM S.                 The Natrix S is designed to have higher binding capacities than traditional
                                                             49
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   membranes, and this property along with the gradual breakthrough makes it well suited for
   clearing impurities.
                Cation exchange resins were shown to exhibit varying dynamic binding capacities in
   the presence of gentamicin, with DBC decreasing as gentamicin concentrations in the
 5 feedstream increase. A Fractogel SE Hicap column decreased in DBC from 108 to 88 g/L
   using a model feedstream containing 0 to 30,500 ng/mg gentamicin. Using a representative
   feedstream, the Fractogel SE Hicap showed DBCs of 68-71 g/L. The usefulness of a cation
   exchange membrane was verified when it was able to decrease gentamicin concentrations in
   that feedstream from 24,100 ng/mg to 870 ng/mg gentamicin with a yield of 94%.               The
10 decreased gentamicin concentration feedstream enabled the Fractogel SE Hicap to have a
   DBC of 94 g/L compared to a 72 g/L when directly compared. Much like gentamicin, cation
   exchange membranes were shown to bind highly charged ionic polymers such as PEI in the
   presence of a monovalent antibody and ECPs. Finally, cation exchange resins were shown to
   be negatively affected by varying PEI concentrations in the feedstream, resulting in decreased
15 dynamic binding capacity and increased pool impurities as PEI concentrations increased.
   The SP Sepharose Fast Flow column was shown to decrease from 51 g/L to 36 g/L as PEI
   increases from 0.75% to 1.05% upstream. In a separate study, step yield decreased from 96%
   to 70%, ECPs increased from 155 ng/mg to 904 ng/mg, aggregate increased from 2.5% to
    17.3%, and dimer increased from 3.7% to 5.9% as the PEI concentration used upstream
20 increased from 0.6% to 1.1%.            The use of a cation exchange membrane prior to the SP
   Sepharose Fast Flow column was not tested, but knowing that the column is negatively
   impacted by PEI and a membrane is effective in binding PEI, a properly sized membrane
   should reduce PEI % going onto the column leading to higher binding capacities and yield,
   while also decreasing pool impurity concentrations.
25              Better purification technologies are constantly emerging. As higher binding capacity
   ion exchange resins are developed, their use as a Protein A affinity resin alternative seems
   likely due to decreased operating costs.            However, when subjected to feedstreams of
   increasing impurity levels, or impurities such as gentamicin or PEI not typically observed in
   downstream applications, their true effectiveness may be decreased.           The use of an ion
30 exchange membrane prior to such an ion exchange resin can protect the column by
   decreasing the impurities loaded onto the column. This can lead to several improvements for
   the column, such as higher dynamic binding capacities, increased step yields, or decreased
   pool impurity concentrations. By selecting an appropriate membrane with sufficient impurity
                                                       50
   9860041_1 (GHMatters) P97341.AU.1

   binding capacity, volume, and permeability, the two steps may be operated continuously,
   further reducing operating time and ultimately purification process costs.
