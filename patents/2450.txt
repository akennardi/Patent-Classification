LABELED INHIBITORS OF PROSTATE SPECIFIC MEMBRANE ANTIGEN (PSMA),
THEIR USE AS IMAGING AGENTS AND PHARMACEUTICAL AGENTS FOR THE
TREATMENT OF PROSTATE CANCER
The present application is a divisional application of Australian Application No.
2014336638 , which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.
The present invention generally relates to the field of radiopharmaceuticals and their
use in nuclear medicine as tracers, imaging agents and for the treatment of various
disease states of prostate cancer.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the leading cancer in the US and European population. At
least 1-2 million men in the western hemisphere suffer from prostate cancer and it is
estimated that the disease will strike one in six men between the ages of 55 and 85.
There are more than 300.000 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed each year in
USA. The mortality from the disease is second only to lung cancer. Currently anatomic
methods, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and
ultrasound, predominate for clinical imaging of prostate cancer. An estimated $ 2 billion
is currently spent worldwide on surgical, radiation, drug therapy and minimally invasive
treatments. However, there is presently no effective therapy for relapsing, metastatic,
androgen-independent prostate cancer.
A variety of experimental low molecular weight PCa imaging agents are currently being
pursued           clinically,      including         radiolabeled         choline        analogs
[ 1 8F]fluorodihydrotestosterone      ([ 18 F]FDHT),    anti-1 -amino-3-[ 18F]fluorocyclobutyl-1
carboxylic      acid    (anti[18F]F-FACBC,       ["C]acetate     and 1-(2-deoxy-2-[1 8F]flouro-L
arabinofuranosyl)-5-methyluracil (-[ 1 8F]FMAU)(Scher, B.; et al. Eur J Nuc/ Med Mol

5  M.; et al. J Nuci Med 2004, 45, 366-373; Schuster, D.M.; et al. J Nuci Med 2007, 48,
  56-63; Tehrani, O.S.; et al. J Nuci Med 2007, 48, 1436-1441).       Each operates by a
  different mechanism and has certain advantages, e.g., low urinary excretion for

 ["C]choline, and disadvantages, such as the short physical half-life of positron
 emitting radionuclides.
 It is well known that tumors may express unique proteins associated with their
 malignant phenotype or may over-express normal constituent proteins in greater
 number than normal cells. The expression of distinct proteins on the surface of tumor
 cells offers the opportunity to diagnose and characterize disease by probing the
 phenotypic identity and biochemical composition and activity of the tumor.
 Radioactive molecules that selectively bind to specific tumor cell surface proteins
 provide an attractive route for imaging and treating tumors under non-invasive
 conditions. A promising new series of low molecular weight imaging agents targets
 the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) (Mease R.C. et al. Clin Cancer Res.
 2008, 14, 3036-3043; Foss, CA.; et al. Clin Cancer Res 2005, 11, 4022-4028;
 Pomper, M.G.; et al. Mol Imaging 2002, 1, 96-101; Zhou, J.; etr al. Nat Rev Drug
 Discov 2005, 4, 1015-1026; WO 20131022797).
 PSMA is a trans-membrane, 750 amino acid type 11 glycoprotein that has abundant
 and restricted expression on the surface of PCa, particularly in androgen
 independent, advanced and metastatic disease (Schulke, N.; et al. Proc Natl Acad
Sci U S A 2003, 100, 12590-12595). The latter is important since almost all PCa
become androgen independent over the time. PSMA possesses the criteria of a
promising target for therapy, i.e., abundant and restricted (to prostate) expression at
all stages of the disease, presentation at the cell surface but not shed into the
circulation and association with enzymatic or signaling activity (Schulke, N.; et al.
Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. U S A 2003, 100, 12590-12595). The PSMA gene is located on
the short arm of chromosome 11 and functions both as a folate hydrolase and
neuropeptidase. It has neuropeptidase function that is equivalent to glutamate
carboxypeptidase 11 (GCPII), which is referred to as the "brain PSMA", and may
modulate glutamatergic transmission by cleaving N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG)
to N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and glutamate (Nan, F.; et al. J Med Chem 2000, 43,
772-774). There are up to 106 PSMA molecules per cancer cell, further suggesting it
as an ideal target for imaging and therapy with radionuclide-based techniques
(Tasch, J.; et al. Crit Rev Immunol 2001, 21, 249-261).
The radio-immunoconjugate of the anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7E11,
known as the PROSTASCINT@ scan, is currently being used to diagnose prostate

cancer metastasis and recurrence. However, this agent tends to produce images that
are challenging to interpret (Lange, P.H. PROSTASCINT scan for staging prostate
cancer. Urology 2001,       57, 402-406; Haseman, M.K.; et al. Cancer Biother
Radiopharm 2000, 15, 131-140; Rosenthal, S.A.; et al. Tech Urol 2001, 7, 27-37).
 More recently, monoclonal antibodies have been developed that bind to the
extracellular domain of PSMA and have been radiolabeled and shown to accumulate
in PSMA-positive prostate tumor models in animals. However, diagnosis and tumor
detection using monoclonal antibodies has been limited by the low permeability of the
monoclonal antibody in solid tumors.
The selective targeting of cancer cells with radiopharmaceuticals, either for imaging
or therapeutic purposes is challenging. A variety of radionuclides are known to be
                                                                             6 8Ga, 17 Lu,
useful for radio-imaging or cancer radiotherapy, including "'in,       MY,
99 "Tc, 1231 and 1311. Recently it has been shown that some compounds containing a
glutamate-urea-glutamate      (GUG)    or a glutamate-urea-lysine (GUL) recognition
element linked to a radionuclide-ligand conjugate exhibit high affinity for PSMA.
New agents that will enable rapid visualization of prostate cancer and specific
targeting to allow radiotherapy present are needed.
Thus, the object of the present invention is to develop ligands that interact with
PSMA and carry appropriate radionuclides which provide a promising and novel
targeting option for the detection, treatment and management of prostate cancer.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The solution of said object is achieved by providing the embodiments characterized
in the claims.
The inventors found new compounds which are useful radiopharmaceuticals and
their use in nuclear medicine as tracers, imaging agents and for the treatment of
various disease states of prostate cancer.

 The novel imaging agents with structural modifications in the linker region have
  improved tumor targeting properties and pharmacokinetics. The pharmacophore
 presents three carboxylic groups able to interact with the respective side chains of
 PSMA and an oxygen as part of zinc complexation in the active center. Besides
 these obligatory interactions, the inventors were able to optimize the lipophilic
 interactions in the linker region.

10 carbon atoms.
"Aryl" refers to an aromatic monocyclic or polycycic ring system having 6 to 14
carbon atoms, preferably 6 to 10 carbon atoms. The aryl group can be substituted,
where appropriate, with one or several ring substituents, like alkyl groups. Preferred
aryl groups are phenyl, benzyl or naphthyl.

 Although it is preferred that the Z-Group is -CO 2 H it may be easily replaced with
 biosteric replacements such as -SO2H, -SO3 H, -SO4 H, -PO2H, -POH, -PO 4 H2 , see e.g.

 The invention also relates to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of
 general formula (Ia) and/or (Ib). The invention also relates to solvates of the
 compounds, including the salts as well as the active metabolites thereof and, where
 appropriate, the tautomers thereof according to general formula (]a) and/or (Ib)
 including prodrug formulations.
A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is a pharmaceutically acceptable, organic or
 inorganic acid or base salt of a compound of the invention. Representative
pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, e.g., alkali metal salts, alkali earth salts,
ammonium salts, water-soluble and water-insoluble salts, such as the acetate,
carbonate, chloride, gluconate, glutamate, lactate, laurate, malate or tartrate.
The term "prodrug" refers to a precursor of a drug that is a compound which upon
administration to a patient, must undergo chemical conversion by metabolic
processes before becoming an active pharmacological agent. Illustrative prodrugs of
compounds in accordance with Formula (1a) and/or (Ib) are esters and amides,
preferably alkyl esters of fatty acid esters. Prodrug formulations here comprise all
substances which are formed by simple transformation including hydrolysis, oxidation
or reduction either enzymatically, metabolically or in any other way. A suitable
prodrug contains e.g. a substance of general formula (la) and/or (Ib) bound via an
enzymatically cleavable linker (e.g. carbamate, phosphate, N-glycoside or a disulfide
group) to a dissolution-improving substance (e.g. tetraethylene glycol, saccharides,
formic acids or glucuronic acid, etc.). Such a prodrug of a compound according to the
invention can be applied to a patient, and this prodrug can be transformed into a
substance of general formula (ia) and/or (Ib) so as to obtain the desired
pharmacological effect.
Some compounds of Formula ([a) and/or (Ib) are encompassed in form of the
racemates, their enantiomers and optionally in form of their diastereomers and all
possible mixtures thereof.
According to the invention all chiral C-atoms shall have D- and/or L-configuration;
also combinations within one compound shall be possible, i.e. some of the chiral C
atoms may be D- and others may be L-configuration.
The obtained compounds can be optionally separated by known methods (e.g.
Allinger, N-L. und Elliel EL. in Topics in Stereochemistry" Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience,

 1971)    in their enantiomers     and/or diasteromers.      One possible method       of
 enantiomeric separation is the use of chromatography.
The invention also relates to pharmaceutical            preparations which contain a
therapeutically effective amount of the active ingredients (compound according to the
 invention of formula ([a) or (ib) together with organic or inorganic solid or liquid,
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers which are suited for the intended administration
and which interact with the active ingredients without drawbacks.
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those
compounds, material, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope
of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a patient
without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or
complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
A "patient" includes an animal, such as a human, monkey, cow, horse, cat or dog.
The animal can be a mammal such as a non-primate and a primate (e.g., monkey
and human). In one embodiment, a patient is a human being.
In general, the Formula (]a) or (lb) compound or pharmaceutical compositions
thereof, may be administered orally or via a parenteral route, usually injection or
infusion.
A "parenteral administration route" means modes of administration other than enteral
and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation,
intravenous,     intramuscular,  intraarterial, intrathecal,  intracapsular, intraorbital,
intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular,
intraarticluare, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal and intrasternal injection and
infusion.
The dosage of the compounds according to the invention is determined by the
physician on the basis of the patient-specific parameters, such as age, weight, sex,
severity of the disease, etc. The dosage is preferably from 0.00001 mg/kg to 100
mg/kg body weight, preferably from 0.001 to 50 mg/kg body weight and most
preferably from 0.01 to 10 mg/kg body weight.
Corresponding to the kind of administration, the medicament is suitably formulated,
e.g. in the form of solutions or suspensions, simple tablets or dragees, hard or soft

 gelatine capsules, suppositories, ovules, preparations for injection, which are
 prepared according to common galenic methods.
 The compounds according to the invention can be formulated, where appropriate,
 together with further active substances and with excipients and carriers common in
 pharmaceutical compositions, e.g. - depending on the preparation to be produced
 talcum, gum arabic, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, cocoa butter, aqueous and
 non-aqueous carriers, fatty bodies of animal or vegetable origin, paraffin derivatives,
 glycols (in particular polyethylene glycol), various plasticizers, dispersants or
 emulsifiers, pharmaceutically compatible gases (e.g. air, oxygen, carbon dioxide,
 etc.), preservatives.
 In order to produce liquid preparations, additives, such as sodium chloride solution,
 ethanol, sorbitol, glycerine, olive oil, almond oil, propylene glycol or ethylene glycol,
 can be used.
When solutions for infusion or injection are used, they are preferably aqueous
 solutions or suspensions, it being possible to produce them prior to use, e.g. from
 lyophilized preparations which contain the active substance as such or together with
 a carrier, such as mannitol, lactose, glucose, albumin and the like. The ready made
solutions are sterilized and, where appropriate, mixed with excipients, e.g. with
 preservatives, stabilizers, emulsifiers, solubilizers, buffers and/or salts for regulating
the osmotic pressure. The sterilization can be obtained by sterile filtration using filters
having a small pore size according to which the composition can be lyophilized,
where appropriate. Small amounts of antibiotics can also be added to ensure the
maintenance of sterility.
The phrases ,effective amount' or "therapeutically-effective amount' as used herein
means that amount of a compound, material, or composition comprising a compound
of the invention, or other active ingredient which is effective for producing some
desired therapeutic effect in at least a sub-population of cells in an animal at a
reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. A therapeutically
effective amount with respect to a compound of the invention means that amount of
therapeutic agent alone, or in combination with other therapies, that provides a
therapeutic benefit in the treatment of prevention of a disease. Used in connection
with a compound of the invention, the term can encompass an amount that improves

overall therapy, reduces or avoids symptoms or causes of disease, or enhances the
therapeutic efficacy of or synergies with another therapeutic agent.
As used herein, the terms "treating" or 'treatment" is intended to encompass also
diagnosis, prophylaxis, prevention, therapy and cure.
The terms, "prevent", "preventing," and "prevention" refer to the prevention of the
onset, recurrence, or spread of the disease in a patient resulting from the
administration of a prophylactic or therapeutic agent.
Depending on whether the inventive Formula (]a) and/or (Ib) compounds are to be
used as radio-imaging agents or radio-pharmaceuticals different radionuclides are
complexed to the chelator. Illustrative radionuclides include, for example,           89Zr, 44Sc,
 "'In, 90Y, 6 6Ga, 67Ga, 6 Ga,  1 7Lu,  99 "Tc, 61Cu, 62Cu,   64Cu, 6 7Cu, 14 9Tb, 152Tb, 155Tb,
161Tb, 153 Gd, 155Gd, 1 57Gd, 213Bi, 225Ac, 230U,   n 3 Ra, 165Er and Fe. According to one
aspect of this invention, the radionuclide is 'In, 90Y,       68Ga,  4Cu, '53 Gd,  155Gd, 2138i,
'25Ac, Fe, or '"Lu.
As noted above, complexes of the compounds according Formula (Ia) or (Ib) may
contain one or more radionuclides which are suitable for use as radio-imaging agents
or as therapeutics for the treatment of rapidly proliferating cells, for example, PSMA
expressing prostate cancer cells. According to the present invention they are called
"metal complexes" or "radiopharmaceuticals".
Preferred imaging methods are positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT).
 Accordingly, in one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition is provided including
a complex that includes a radionuclide and a compound of Formula (Ia) or Formula
(lb), a salt, solvate, stereoisomer, or tautomer thereof, and a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier.
According to another aspect, a pharmaceutical composition is provided, which is
suitable for in vivo imaging and radiotherapy. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions
may contain a radio imaging agent, or a radiotherapeutic agent that has a
radionuclide either as an element, i.e. radioactive iodine, or a radioactive metal
chelate complex of the compound of Formula (la) and/or (Ib) in an amount sufficient
for imaging, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable radiological vehicle. The
radiological vehicle should be suitable for injection or aspiration, such as human

 serum albumin; aqueous buffer solutions, e.g., tris(hydromethyl) aminomethane (and
 its salts), phosphate, citrate, bicarbonate, etc; sterile water physiological saline; and
 balanced ionic solutions containing chloride and or dicarbonate salts or normal blood
 plasma cautions such as calcium potassium, sodium and magnesium.
The concentration of the imaging agent or the therapeutic agent in the radiological
vehicle should be sufficient to provide satisfactory imaging. For example, when using
an aqueous solution, the dosage is about 1.0 to 100 millicuries. The actual dose
administered to a patient for imaging or therapeutic purposes, however, is
determined by the physician administering treatment. The imaging agent or
therapeutic agent should be administered so as to remain in the patient for about 1
hour to 10 days, although both longer and shorter time periods are acceptable.
Therefore, convenient ampoules containing 1 to 10 mL of aqueous solution may be
prepared.
Imaging may be carried out in the normal manner, for example by injecting a
sufficient amount of the imaging composition to provide adequate imaging and then
scanning with a suitable imaging or scanning machine, such as a tomograph or
gamma camera. In certain embodiments, a method of imaging a region in a patient
includes the steps of: (i) administering to a patient a diagnostically effective amount
of a compound complexed with a radionuclide; exposing a region of the patient to the
scanning device; and (ii) obtaining an image of the region of the patient. In certain
embodiments of the region imaged is the head or thorax. In other embodiments, the
compounds and complexes of Formula |(a) and/or (lb) target the PSMA protein.
Thus, in some embodiments, a method of imaging tissue such as spleen tissue,
kidney tissue, or PSMA-expressing tumor tissue is provided including contacting the
tissue with a complex synthesized by contacting a radionuclide and a Formula (Ia)
and/or Formula (Ib) compound.
The amount of the compound of the present invention, or a formulation comprising a
complex of a metal and a compound according to Formula ([a) and/or (Ib), or its salt,
solvate, stereoisomer, or tautomer that is administered to a patient depends on
several physiological factors that are routinely used by the physician, including the
nature of imaging to be carried out, tissue to be targeted for imaging or therapy and

the body weight and medical history of the patient to be imaged or treated using a
 radiopharmaceutical.
Accordingly in another aspect, the invention provides a method for treating a patient
by administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a Formula (]a)
and/or (Ib) compound complexed to a radionuclide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt or solvate of the complex to treat a patient suffering from a cell proliferative
disease or disorder. Specifically, the cell proliferative disease or disorder to be
treated     or     imaged    using      a    compound,     pharmaceutical composition or
radiopharmaceutical in accordance with this invention is a cancer, for example,
prostate cancer and/or prostate cancer metastasis in e.g. lung, liver, kidney, bones,
brain, spinal cord, bladder, etc.
The synthesis of the compounds of the present invention is described in detail in the
example section. An overview of the synthesis is exemplified in Scheme 2
concerning DOTA conjugated-PSMA inhibitors. However, a person skilled in the art
would be able to modify the reactions e.g. by using another chelator. Thus, this
scheme shall not be understood to limit the compounds of the present invention to
the DOTA chelator only.

 The synthesized compounds are chemically characterized by RP-HPLC, MS, and/or
 NMR.
 The novel chelator-conjugated imaging agents with structural modifications in the
 linker region have improved tumor targeting properties and pharmacokinetics. The
 pharmacophore presents three carboxylic group able to interact with the respective
 side chains of PSMA and an oxygen as part of zinc complexation in the active center.
 Besides these obligatory interactions, the inventors were able to optimize the
 lipophilic interactions in the linker region.
The preclinical evaluation includes in vitro assays (affinity, internalization) and in vivo
experiments (pPET screening and organ distribution).
The compounds of the present invention are better than known reference compounds
with regard to kidney clearance and enrichment in the tumor. The binding affinity of
 PSMA inhibitors of the present invention can be influenced by linker modifications.
Two cyclic motives and at least one aromatic moiety in the linker region of the
substance seem to be preferable and resulted in the high affinity compounds MB4
and MB17. In this regard, a very promising compound is MB17.
Thus, the compounds of the present invention represent novel PSMA-targeting
probes with optimal characteristics which was also confirmed by organ distribution
and small animal PET imaging. The compounds of the present invention show a high
PSMA-specific tumor uptake. In addition, they are characterized by an early
enrichment in the bladder and also the maximum kidney uptake. With regard to
therapeutic use, this gives clear clinical advantages for the compounds of the present
invention compared to other PSMA-inhibitors. In the PET diagrams the compounds of
the present invention, in particular MB17, show a rapid background clearance as well
as a substantial reduction of the enrichment in the kidney after 2 hours while it is
further accumulated and retained in the PSMA-expressing tumor. Also first in vivo
treatments with MB 17 showed promising data (c.f. Fig. 17 and 18).
The below example explains the invention in more detail but are not construed to limit
the invention in any way to the exemplified embodiments only.

 Examples
 Example 1: Synthesis of DOTA-conjugated inhibitors
The DOTA conjugated-PSMA inhibitors are synthesized via solid-phase peptide
 synthesis (c.f. Scheme 2). In a first step, the isocyanate of the glutamyl moiety was
generated in situ by adding a mixture of 3 mmol of bis(tert-butyl)-L-glutamate
 hydrochloride and 3 mL of N-ethyldiisopropylamine (DIPEA) in 200 mL of dry CH 2 CI 2
to a solution of 1 mmol triphosgene in 10 mL of dry CH 2 CI 2 at 5*C for 3 h. After the
reaction, 0.5 mmol of a resin-immobilized (2-chloro-tritylresin) s-allyloxycarbonyl
protected lysine was added and reacted for 16 h with gentle agitation. The resin was
filtered off and the allyloxy-protecting group was removed using 50 mg tetrakis
(triphenyl)palladium and 400 pL morpholine in 4 mL CH 2 CI 2 for 2 h.
The subsequent synthesis of the peptidomimetic PSMA binding motif was performed
according to standard Fmoc protocol. The following coupling of the linker part was
performed using 2 mmol of the corresponding Fmoc-protected acid, 3.96 mmol of
HBTU and 2 mmol of N-ethyl-diisopropylamine in a final volume of 4 mL DMF. After
activation with 3.95 eq of HBTU and DIPEA for 2 h, 4 eq of tris(t-bu)-DOTA
(Chematech) relative to the resin loading were reacted in a final volume of 3 mL
DMF. The product was cleaved from the resin in a 2 mL mixture consisting of
trifluoroacetic acid, triisopropylsilane, and water (95:2.5:2.5).
The chelator was also conjugated by using HBTU activated DOTA-NHS ester
(CheMatech) or DOTA-TFP ester (Mier W., Hoffend J., Krimer S., Schuhmacher J.,
Hull W. E., Eisenhut M., Haberkorn U., Bioconjugate Chem. 2005,16: 237-240).
Analysis of the synthesized molecules was performed using reversed-phase high
performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC; Chromolith RP-18e, 100x4.6 mm;
Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with a linear A-B gradient (0% B to 100% B in 6 min) at
a flow rate of 4 mL/min (analysis) or 6 mL/min (purification). Solvent A consisted of
0.1% aqueous TFA and solvent B was 0.1% TFA in CH 3 CN. The HPLC system
(L6200 A; Merck-Hitachi, Darmstadt, Germany) was equipped with a UV and a
gamma detector (Bioscan; Washington, USA). UV absorbance was measured at 214

 nm. Mass spectrometry was performed with a MALDI-MS Daltonics Microflex system
 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).
 Example 2: Radiolabeling
Typically, 1.5 nmol of a synthesized compound of Example 1 (dissolved in 0.1 M
 HEPES buffer pH 7.5) was added in a volume of 100 pL to a mixture of 10 pL 2.1 M
 HEPES solution and 40 pL r 8 Ga]Ga3 eluate (40 MBq). The pH of the labeling
solution was adjusted to 4.5.
The radiolabeling of the compounds resulted in a radiochemical yield of >97% after
 15 minutes at 95 *C and was determined by RP-HPLC and TLC. Subsequent
purification was done using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges.
Example 3: Synthesis of compounds MB4 and MB17
The isocyanate of the glutamyl moiety was generated in situ by adding a mixture of 3
mmol of bis(tert-butyl) L-glutamate hydrochloride and 1.5 mL of N
ethyldiisopropylamine (DIPEA) in 200 mL of dry CH2 CI2 to a solution of 1 mmol
triphosgene in 10 mL of dry CH 2CI2 at 0 "C over 4 h. After agitation of the reaction
mixture for 1 h at 25 C, 0.5 mmol of the resin-immobilized (2-chloro-tritylresin) E
allyloxycarbonyl protected lysine in 4 mL DCM was added and reacted for 16 h with
gentle agitation. The resin was filtered off and the allyloxy-protecting group was
removed using 30 mg tetrakis(tripheny)palladium(O) and 400 pL morpholine in 4 mL
CH 2CI 2 for 3 hours- The following coupling of 3 times 4-(Fmoc-aminomethyl)benzoic
acid (in case of MB4) or Fmoc-3-(2-naphthyi)-L-alanine and trans-4-(Fmoc
aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (in case of MB17), respectively, was
performed stepwise using 2 mmol of the Fmoc-protected acid, 1.96 mmol of HBTU
and 2 mmol of N-ethyldiisopropylamine in a final volume of 4 mL DMF. After
activation with 3.95 eq of HBTU and DIPEA for 2 h, 4 eq of tris(t-bu)-DOTA
(Chematech) relative to the resin loading were reacted for 3 h in a final volume of 3
mL DMF. The product was cleaved from the resin in a 2 mL mixture consisting of
trifluoroacetic acid, triisopropylsilane, and water (95:2.5:2.5). Purification was
performed using RP-HPLC and the purified product was analysed by analytical RP
HPLC and MALDI-MS.

 For preparing MB-17D which is the stereoisomer of MB17(L), the synthesis was
 based on Fmoc-3(2-naphthyl)-D-alanine. If not stated otherwise, in the present
 description MB17 means the L-stereoisomer.

The chelators (DOTA, NOTA, NODAGA, DTPA, CHX-DTPA, PCTA, Do3A) were
coupled to the MB17 linker by solid phase synthesis- In general, 13 pmol of resin
which was coupled with the PSMA binding motif was swollen with DCM in a syringe
with a filter. After washing the resin 5 x with DMF, it was incubated 2 x for 5 min with
20% of piperidine in DMF to deprotect the N-terminus. Another 5 x washing with
DMF followed.
Between 1.5 and 4 equivalents of the chelator (depending of the chelator), 0.98 x
ncheiator HATU (if needed) and 10 equivalents of DIPEA were dissolved in 500 pl of
DMF, the solution was drawn up into the syringe containing the resin and incubated
overnight. Next, the resin was washed 5 x each with DMF, methanol, DCM and
diethyl ether and dried over vacuum.
To check the state of the reaction, test separations were used. This was achieved by
washing a small amount of resin with DCM into a filter tip and adding 100 pl of
separation solution containing 95% TFA, 2.5% water and 2.5% TIPS. After 30 min of
incubation, the solution was pipetted into ice cold diethyl ether and centrifuged. The
diethyl ether was decanted and the remaining pellet was dissolved in 35 pl of ACN :
H20 (1 : 1) and analysed by HPLC (0 - 100% ACN in water within 5 min) and LC/MS.

If the desired product was obtained, the complete peptide was separated from the
resin. The dried resin was incubated with 500 pl of the separation solution (95% TFA,
2.5% H2 0, 2.5% TIPS) for 2 hours. The resulting solution was mixed with ice cold
diethyl ether and centrifuged (4000 min', 5 min). The supernatant was discarded,
new diethyl ether was added and the receptacle was shaken vigorously to resuspend
the pellet. Again, the solution was centrifuged (4000 min", 5 min) and the resulting
supernatant discarded. The pellet was then vacuum dried and finally resuspended in
1 ml of ACN : H2O (1 : 1).
Purification was achieved by preparative HPLC, the peaks were analysed by analytic
HPLC (0 - 100% ACN in water within 5 min) and LC/MS and those containing the
product were pooled and lyophilized.
Example 5: Radiolabelling
1 7Lu-labellinq
17 7
     Lu (approx. 100 MBq) was mixed with 200 p] of 0.4 M sodium acetate buffer
containing Chelex (pH = 5). 10 pi of a 1 mM solution of the compound in 10% DMSO
in water, 2 pl of a saturated solution of ascorbic acid and 40 pl of the solution
containing   1 77
                 Lu were mixed and heated to 95 *C for 10 min. The labelling was
checked by radio-HPLC (0 - 100% ACN in water within 5 min, Monolith column).
68Ga-labelling
For the PET scan CHX-DTPA was labelled with 68Ga. 1 ml of 6 8Ga was eluted from a
6aGet68 Ga generator with 0.6 M HCI. 298 pl NaOAc buffer and 1 pl of a 10 mM
solution of CHX-DTPA in DMSO was added and incubated for 5 min. Afterwards the
product was purified using a SOLA cartridge. Washing was done with a 0.9% NaGI
solution and for elution ethanol was used. The ethanol then was vaporized and the
remaining product was dissolved in 100 pl of a 0.9% NaCl solution and 10 pl of
phosphate buffer.

 Example 6: Determination of the IC50 value
A filter plate MultiScreenHTs-DV was incubated at room temperature with 100 pl PBS
with 1% BSA per well for 30 min. After removing the PBS/BSA solution 105 LNCaP
cells in 50 pl of Opti-MEM were applied to each well. Different concentrations of the
compounds (leading to concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000
and 5000 nM in each well) in 300 pi of Opti-MEM were mixed with 3 pl of a 150 nM
solution of 1251-labeled MIP - 1466 in Opti-MEM. 50 pl of the resulting solution were
added to each well, each concentration was pipetted in quadruples. Each well now
contained the radioactively labelled ligand in a concentration of 0.75 nM and the
competitive, not labelled ligand in the concentration mentioned above. The plate was
then incubated for 45 min at room temperature on a shaker.
After the incubation, the cells were washed 2 x with 100 pl of ice cold PBS and 1 x
with 200 pi of ice cold PBS. Finally, the filters were collected and the remaining
radioactivity was measured with a gamma counter. Each tube was measured for 5
min.
The data measured by the gamma counter were evaluated with Graphpad Prism to
achieve an inhibition concentration 50 (IC50) against the radioactively labelled MIP
1095.

 Example 7: p PET - imaging using CHX-DTPA-MB17
 Before injection into the mouse, the solution containing the purified 6" Ga-CHX-DTPA
coupled PSMA inhibitor was sterile-filtered. 100 p of this solution was taken up into a
syringe and then injected into a BALB/c nude mouse LNCaP xenograft, intravenously
into the tail vein. The PET scan was recorded for 140 min with a Siemens Inveon
PET (Fig- 15)
Example 8: Determination of the competitive binding affinity
In order to compare the series of novel compounds the competitive binding affinity
and the specific internalization was analyzed using the PSMA expressing cell line
LNCaP. To determine specific cellular uptake, cells were blocked with 2
(phosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic acid (PMPA). The inhibition potency was also
investigated by the enzyme-based NAALADase assay.
Cell culture
For binding studies and in vivo experiments LNCaP cells (metastatic lesion of human
prostatic adenocarcinoma, ATCGC CRL-1740) were cultured in RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and Glutamax (PAA, Austria). During cell
culture, cells were grown at 37 0 C in an incubator with humidified air, equilibrated with
5 % C02. The cells were harvested using trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(trypsin-EDTA; 0.25% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA, all from PAA, Austria) and washed with
PBS.
Cell binding and internalization
The competitive cell binding assay and internalization experiments were performed
as described previously (Eder et al. 2012). Briefly, the respective cells (105 per well)
were incubated with the radioligand (68Ga-labeled [Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)]2-HBED-CC
(Schafer et al., 2012) in the presence of 12 different concentrations of analyte (0-

 5000 nM, 100 pL/weli). After incubation, washing was carried out using a multiscreen
 vacuum manifold (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Cell-bound radioactivity was measured
 using a gamma counter (Packard Cobra 11, GMI, Minnesota, USA). The 50 %
 inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated by fitting the data using a nonlinear
 regression algorithm (GraphPad Software). Experiments were performed three times.
To determine the specific cell uptake and internalization, 105 cells were seeded in
 poly-L-lysine coated 24-well cell culture plates 24 h before incubation. After washing,
the cells were incubated with 25 nM of the radiolabeled compounds for 45 min at
37*C and at 40C, respectively. Specific cellular uptake was determined by
competitive blocking with 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (500 pM final
concentration , PMPA, Axxora, Loerrach, Germany). Cellular uptake was terminated
by washing 4 times with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS. Cells were subsequently incubated
twice with 0-5 mL glycine-HCI in PBS (50 mM, pH = 2.8) for 5 min to remove the
surface-bound fraction. The cells were washed with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS and lysed
using 0.3 N NaOH (0.5 mL). The surface-bound and the internalized fractions were
measured in a gamma counter. The cell uptake was calculated as per cent of the
initially added radioactivity bound to 106 cells [%ID/106 cells].
Naaladase assay
Recombinant human PSMA (rhPSMA, R&D systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) was
diluted in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.5) to 0.4 pg/mL. The
substrate Ac-Asp-Glu (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany, 40 pM final concentration) was
mixed with natGa labeled analyte at concentrations ranging from 0.05 nM to 1000 nM
in a final volume of 125 pL assay buffer. The mixtures were combined with 125 pL of
the rhPSMA solution (0.4 pg/mL) and incubated for one hour at 370 C. The reaction
was stopped by heating at 950C for 5 minutes. 250 pL of a 15 mM solution of ortho
phthaldialdehyde (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) was added to all vials and
incubated for 10 minutes at ambient temperature. Finally, 200 pL of the reaction
solutions were loaded onto a F16 Black Maxisorp Plate (Nunc, Langenselbold,
Germany) and read at excitation and emission wavelengths of 330 nm and 450 nm,
respectively, using a microplate reader (DTX-880, Beckman Coulter, Krefeld,

Germany). The data were analyzed by a one site-total binding regression algorithm
of GraphPad (GraphPad Software, California, USA).
Biodistribution
7- to 8-week-old male BALB/c nu/nu mice (Charles River Laboratories) were
subcutaneously inoculated into the right trunk with 5x10 6 cells of LNCaP (in 50%
Matrigel; Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). The tumors were allowed to grow
until approximately 1 cm3 in size. The radiolabeled compounds were injected into the
tail vein (approx. 1 MBq per mouse; 0.06 nmol). At 1 h after injection the animals
were sacrificed. Organs of interest were dissected, blotted dry, and weighed. The
radioactivity was measured using a gamma counter and calculated as % ID/g.
MicroPET
For the microPET studies, 10 - 25 MBq of the radiolabeled compounds in a volume
of 0.15 ml (- 0.5 nmol) were injected via a lateral tail vein into mice bearing LNCaP
tumor xenografts. The anesthetized animals (2% sevoflurane, Abbott, Wiesbaden,
Germany) were placed in prone position into the Inveon small animal PET scanner
(Siemens, Knoxville, Tenn, USA) to perform dynamic microPET scans and 20 min
static scans; c.f. Fig.1, 3, 5-14

 The present example shows that the binding affinity of PSMA inhibitors can be
 influenced by linker modifications. Two cyclic motives and at least one aromatic
 moiety in the linker region of the substance seem to be preferable and resulted in the
 high affinity compounds MB4 and MB17. These novel variants show low nanomolar
 affinity to LNCap cell line and were specifically internalized at 37 "C up to 48 %ID/106
 cells. Former studies showed that besides binding affinity the internalization
 properties of PSMA-targeting probes are highly important and high internalization
 rates are essential for high in vivo tumor uptake and retention. Thus, MB17
 represents a novel PSMA-targeting probe with optimal characteristics which was also
 confirmed by organ distribution and small animal PET imaging. MB 17 shows a high
 PSMA-specific tumor uptake (Fig.2). In addition, dynamic PET imaging of MB17 (Fig.
 2) shows an early enrichment in the bladder and also the maximum kidney uptake
 (highest point in the time-activity-curve) is as early as 15 min after injection of the
 radiotracer and diminishes substantially already after 20 minutes. With regard to
therapeutic use, this gives clear clinical advantages for MB17 compared to other
 PSMA-inhibitors. In the PET diagrams (Fig. 1) MB17 shows a rapid background
clearance as well as a substantial reduction of the enrichment in the kidney after 2
hours while it is further accumulated and retained in the PSMA-expressing tumor.
In addition, organ distribution with  177Lu  (Fig. 4) showed that the high initial kidney
uptake is nearly completely washed out (2.13 ± 1.36 % ID/g) after 24 hours while the
tumor uptake remained high and even increased (10.58 ± 4.50 % ID/g). Other organs
as liver (0.08 ± 0.03 % ID/g), lung (0.11 ± 0.13 % ID/g) and spleen (0.13 ± 0.05 %
ID/g) showed very low uptake. The favourable pharmacokinetics led to extremly high
tumor-to-background ratios (Tumor/Blood: 1058; Tumor/Muscle: 529) after 24 hours

 Table A clearly confirms that the chemical modifications in the linker region of the
  molecule affect the biological properties, e.g. affinity and internalization efficacy.
  MB17 and MB4 show the most promising binding properties on cells.
 Example 9: Clinical Data concerning MB17
 PET/CT imaging was performed using the radiotracer MB17 labeled with Ga-68 (c.f
 Fig. 17)
 The 6aGeP 8Ga-generator used for radiopharmaceutical production was purchased
 from IDB-Holland BV (Baarle-Nassau, The Netherlands). Disposable cassette kits
 and chemicals including the precursor in GMP-compliant grade used for the
 radiosynthesis were obtained from ABX advanced biochemical compounds
 (Radeberg, Germany). An Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex) (acetonitrile (A),
 water + 0,1 % TFA (B); gradient: 0.5 min 95% B, 10.0 min 80% A, flowrate: 2
 mL/min) equipped with a Chromolith Performance RP-1Se column (100 x 4.6 mm,
 Merck) and a Nal radiodetector (Raytest) was used to determine the radiochemical
 purity. Residual solvents were determined using a 6850 Series gas chromatograph
 (Agilent Technologies). Endotoxin testing was performed with an Endosafe@-PTS
 device (Charles River).
2 pg of MB17 were dissolved in 1.5 M acetate buffer pH 4.5 (1 mL) and 1 M ascorbic
acid (10 pL) and transferred into the reaction vessel. The     6 8Gef 8 Ga-generator  was
eluted with 10 mL of 0.6 M HCI and the eluate diluted with 9 mL of ultrapure water.
The mixture was then transferred to a cation exchange cartridge (Macherey-Nagel
PS-H+, Size M) and eluted with 5 M NaCl solution (1.2 mL) into the preheated
reaction vessel (100"C). The reaction mixture was heated for 10 minutes. The crude
reaction mixture was then removed from the reaction vessel and transferred to a pre
conditioned (10 mL EtOH/10 mL ultrapure water) C18 cartridge (Waters Sep-Pak
light). 9 mL ultrapure water was used to rinse the reaction vessel and passed over
the C18 cartridge. The C18 cartridge was washed with another 5 mL of ultrapure
water. The final product was eluted from the C18 cartridge with 2 mL of EtOH/H 2 0
(v:v 1:1), sterile filtered (Millipore Cathivex-GV, 0.22 pm) and diluted with 10 mL of
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution pH 7.4 (according to Eur. Ph. 8.0

  (4005000)). The 68Ga-MB17    complex solution was applied to patients via an
  intravenous bolus.
                                      177
 Example 10: Human therapy with           Lu-labeled MB17
 For therapy, the PSMA ligand MB17 was radiolabeled with Lu-177.        177LuCl  was
 obtained from Perkin Elmer (4 GBq, NEZ307D, 0,04 M HCI). 80 nmoles of MB17
 were dissolved in 400 pL sodium acetate buffer (0.4 M, pH 5) supplemented with 5
 pL of 20 % ascorbic acid. The solution was transferred to the   177 LuC1  and incubated
                                                                         3
 for 10 minutes at 95"C. Finally, 2 mL 0.9 % NaCl was added. For quality control,
 ITLC and radio-HPLC was performed.
The 1"Lu-labeled MB17 was applied to patients via an intravenous bolus (5 mL,
slowly within 30 seconds). The intravenous application was accompanied by an
infusion of 0.9% NaCl for 4.5 h starting at 0.5 h before injection. Reference is made
to Fig. 18.
