   STATEMENT REGARDING                  FEDERALLY         SPONSORED        RESEARCH        OR
   DEVELOPMENT
15 [0002] This invention was made with support from the National Institutes of Health
   (Grants A144257, NS065933, and AR048796), the Alliance for Lupus Research, and the
   Washington State Life Science Discovery Fund (2087750). The government has certain
   rights in the invention.
   BACKGROUND
20 [0003] Excessive release of (ribo)nucleoprotein particles from dead and dying cells can
   cause lupus pathology by two mechanisms: (i) Deposition or in situ formation of
   chromatin / anti-chromatin complexes causes nephritis and leads to loss of renal function;
   and (ii) nucleoproteins activate innate immunity through toll-like receptor (TLR) 7, 8, and
   9 as well as TLR-independent pathway(s).         Release of nucleoproteins can serve as a
25 potent antigen for autoantibodies in SLE, providing amplification of B cell and DC
   activation through co-engagement of antigen receptors and TLRs. Thus, there exists a
   need for a means to remove inciting antigens and/or attenuate immune stimulation,
   immune amplification, and immune complex mediated disease in subjects in need thereof.
   SUMMARY

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0056] Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease
characterized by the presence of high titer autoantibodies directed against self nucleoproteins.
There is strong evidence that defective clearance or processing of dead and dying cells in
SLE leads to disease, predominantly through accumulation of ribo- and deoxy
ribonucleoproteins (abbreviated nucleoproteins). The nucleoproteins cause damage through
three mechanisms: i) activation of the innate immune system to produce inflammatory
cytokines; ii) serve as antigens to generate circulating immune complexes; and iii) serve as
antigens to generate in situ complex formation at local sites such as the kidney. The present
invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that digestion of the extracellular nucleic
acids has a therapeutic effect in vivo.
[0057] Accordingly, the present invention provides methods for treating diseases
characterized by defective clearance or processing of apoptotic cells and cell debris, such as
SLE, by administering an effective amount of a nuclease activity to degrade extracellular
RNA and DNA containing complexes. Such treatment can inhibit production of Type I
interferons (IFNs) which are prominent cytokines in SLE and are strongly correlated with
disease activity and nephritis.
[0058] In one embodiment, a subject is treated by administering a nuclease activity which is
a DNase or an RNase activity, preferably in the form of a hybrid nuclease molecule. In one
aspect, the nuclease activity is a first nuclease domain. In another aspect, the nuclease
domain is coupled to a modified Fc domain such that the molecule has reduced cytotoxicity.
In one aspect a hybrid nuclease molecule includes a second nuclease domain.
[0059] In another aspect, a method of treating SLE is provided in which an effective amount
of a nuclease-containing composition is administered to a subject. In one aspect, treatment
results in degradation of immune complexes containing RNA, DNA or both RNA and DNA.
In another aspect, treatment results in inhibition of Type I interferons, such as interferon-a in
a subject. In one aspect, a method of treating a subject comprises administering an effective
                                                 11

amount of a composition of a hybrid nuclease molecule comprising an amino acid sequence
set forth in SEQ ID NO: 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 92, 94, 96, or 98. In another
aspect, the composition is a hybrid nuclease molecule comprising an amino acid sequence set
forth in SEQ ID NO: 96 or 98.
[0060] Terms used in the claims and specification are defined as set forth below unless
otherwise specified. In the case of direct conflict with a term used in a parent provisional
patent application, the term used in the instant specification shall control.
[0061] "Amino acid" refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids, as well as
amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the
naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the
genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g., hydroxyproline, y
carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have
the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an a carbon that is
bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, e.g., homoserine,
norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified
R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical
structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical
compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an
amino acid, but that function in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.
[0062] Amino acids can be referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter
symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical
Nomenclature Commission. Nucleotides, likewise, can be referred to by their commonly
accepted single-letter codes.
[0063] An "amino acid substitution" refers to the replacement of at least one existing amino
acid residue in a predetermined amino acid sequence (an amino acid sequence of a starting
polypeptide) with a second, different "replacement" amino acid residue. An "amino acid
insertion" refers to the incorporation of at least one additional amino acid into a
predetermined amino acid sequence. While the insertion will usually consist of the insertion
of one or two amino acid residues, the present larger "peptide insertions," can be made, e.g.
insertion of about three to about five or even up to about ten, fifteen, or twenty amino acid
residues. The inserted residue(s) may be naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring as
disclosed above. An "amino acid deletion" refers to the removal of at least one amino acid
residue from a predetermined amino acid sequence.
                                                 12

[0064] "Polypeptide," "peptide", and "protein" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a
polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or
more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally
occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and non
naturally occurring amino acid polymer.
[0065] "Nucleic acid" refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers
thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. Unless specifically limited, the term
encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogues of natural nucleotides that have
similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolized in a manner
similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic
acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g.,
degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences and as well as the sequence
explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions can be achieved by
generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is
substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., Nucleic Acid Res.
19:5081, 1991; Ohtsuka et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260:2605-2608, 1985); and Cassol et al., 1992;
Rossolini et al., Mol. Cell. Probes 8:91-98, 1994). For arginine and leucine, modifications at
the second base can also be conservative. The term nucleic acid is used interchangeably with
gene, cDNA, and mRNA encoded by a gene.
[0066] Polynucleotides of the present invention can be composed of any polyribonucleotide
or polydeoxribonucleotide, which can be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or
DNA. For example, polynucleotides can be composed of single- and double-stranded DNA,
DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded
RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules
comprising DNA and RNA that can be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or
a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, the polynucleotide can be
composed of triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. A
polynucleotide can also contain one or more modified bases or DNA or RNA backbones
modified for stability or for other reasons. "Modified" bases include, for example, tritylated
bases and unusual bases such as inosine. A variety of modifications can be made to DNA and
RNA; thus, "polynucleotide" embraces chemically, enzymatically, or metabolically modified
forms.
                                                13

[0067] As used herein, the term "hybrid nuclease molecule" refers to polynucleotides or
polypeptides that comprise at least one nuclease domain and at least one Fe domain. Hybrid
nuclease molecules are also referred to as fusion protein(s) and fusion gene(s). For example,
in one embodiment, a hybrid nuclease molecule can be a polypeptide comprising at least one
Fc domain linked to a nuclease domain such as DNase and/or RNase. As another example, a
hybrid nuclease molecule can include an RNase nuclease domain, a linker domain, and an Fc
domain. Examples of hybrid nuclease molecules include SE ID NO:62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 78,
80, 82, 84, 86, 92, 94, 96, and 98. Other examples are described in more detail below. In one
embodiment a hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention can include additional
modifications. In another embodiment, a hybrid nuclease molecule may be modified to add a
functional moiety (e.g., PEG, a drug, or a label).
[0068] As used herein, a "hybrid bispecific nuclease molecule," or a "binuclease molecule"
refer to a hybrid nuclease molecule with 2 or more nuclease domains, e.g., a DNase domain
and an RNase domain.
[0069] In certain aspects, the hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention can employ one or
more "linker domains," such as polypeptide linkers. As used herein, the term "linker domain"
refers to a sequence which connects two or more domains in a linear sequence. As used
herein, the term "polypeptide linker" refers to a peptide or polypeptide sequence (e.g., a
synthetic peptide or polypeptide sequence) which connects two or more domains in a linear
amino acid sequence of a polypeptide chain. For example, polypeptide linkers may be used
to connect a nuclease domain to an Fc domain. Preferably, such polypeptide linkers can
provide flexibility to the polypeptide molecule. In certain embodiments the polypeptide
linker is used to connect (e.g., genetically fuse) one or more Fc domains and/or one or more
nuclease domains. A hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention may comprise more than one
linker domain or peptide linker.
[0070] As used herein, the term "gly-ser polypeptide linker" refers to a peptide that consists
of glycine and seine residues. An exemplary gly/ser polypeptide linker comprises the amino
acid sequence Ser(Gly 4 Ser)n. In one embodiment, n=1. In one embodiment, n=2. In another
embodiment, n=3, i.e., Ser(Gly 4Ser)3. In another embodiment, n=4, i.e., Ser(Gly 4 Ser)4. In
another embodiment, n=5. In yet another embodiment, n=6. In another embodiment, n=7. In
yet another embodiment, n=8. In another embodiment, n=9. In yet another embodiment,
n=10. Another exemplary gly/ser polypeptide linker comprises the amino acid sequence
Ser(Gly 4 Ser)n. In one embodiment, n=1. In one embodiment, n=2. In a preferred
                                                 14

embodiment, n=3. In another embodiment, n=4. In another embodiment, n=5. In yet another
embodiment, n=6.
[0071] As used herein, the terms "linked," "fused", or "fusion", are used interchangeably.
These terms refer to the joining together of two more elements or components or domains, by
whatever means including chemical conjugation or recombinant means. Methods of
chemical conjugation (e.g., using heterobifunctional crosslinking agents) are known in the
art.
[0072] As used herein, the term "Fc region" shall be defined as the portion of a native
immunoglobulin formed by the respective Fc domains (or Fc moieties) of its two heavy
chains.
[0073] As used herein, the term "Fc domain" refers to a portion of a single immunoglobulin
(Ig) heavy chain wherein the Fc domain does not comprise an Fv domain. As such, Fc
domain can also be referred to as "Ig" or "IgG." In some embodiments, an Fc domain begins
in the hinge region just upstream of the papain cleavage site and ending at the C-terminus of
the antibody. Accordingly, a complete Fc domain comprises at least a hinge domain, a CH2
domain, and a CH3 domain. In certain embodiments, an Fc domain comprises at least one of:
a hinge (e.g., upper, middle, and/or lower hinge region) domain, a CH2 domain, a CH3
domain, a CH4 domain, or a variant, portion, or fragment thereof. In other embodiments, an
Fc domain comprises a complete Fc domain (i.e., a hinge domain, a CH2 domain, and a CH3
domain). In one embodiment, an Fc domain comprises a hinge domain (or portion thereof)
fused to a CH3 domain (or portion thereof). In another embodiment, an Fc domain comprises
a CH2 domain (or portion thereof) fused to a CH3 domain (or portion thereof). In another
embodiment, an Fc domain consists of a CH3 domain or portion thereof. In another
embodiment, an Fc domain consists of a hinge domain (or portion thereof) and a CH3 domain
(or portion thereof). In another embodiment, an Fc domain consists of a CH2 domain (or
portion thereof) and a CH3 domain. In another embodiment, an Fc domain consists of a hinge
domain (or portion thereof) and a CH2 domain (or portion thereof). In one embodiment, an
Fc domain lacks at least a portion of a CH2 domain (e.g., all or part of a CH2 domain). In
one embodiment, an Fc domain of the invention comprises at least the portion of an Fc
molecule known in the art to be required for FcRn binding. In another embodiment, an Fc
domain of the invention comprises at least the portion of an Fc molecule known in the art to
be required for FcyR binding. In one embodiment, an Fc domain of the invention comprises
at least the portion of an Fc molecule known in the art to be required for Protein A binding.
                                               15

In one embodiment, an Fe domain of the invention comprises at least the portion of an Fc
molecule known in the art to be required for protein G binding. An Fe domain herein
generally refers to a polypeptide comprising all or part of the Fe domain of an
immunoglobulin heavy-chain. This includes, but is not limited to, polypeptides comprising
the entire CH1, hinge, CH2, and/or CH3 domains as well as fragments of such peptides
comprising only, e.g., the hinge, CH2, and CH3 domain. The Fe domain may be derived from
an immunoglobulin of any species and/or any subtype, including, but not limited to, a human
IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgD, IgA, IgE, or IgM antibody. The Fe domain encompasses
native Fe and Fc variant molecules. As with Fc variants and native Fe's, the term Fe domain
includes molecules in monomeric or multimeric form, whether digested from whole antibody
or produced by other means. The assignment of amino acids residue numbers to an Fe
domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat. See, e.g., Sequences ofProteins of
Immunological Interest (Table of Contents, Introduction and Constant Region Sequences
sections), 5th edition, Bethesda, MD:NIH vol. 1:647-723 (1991); Kabat et al., "Introduction"
Sequences ofProteins ofImmunological Interest, US Dept of Health and Human Services,
NIH, 5th edition, Bethesda, MD vol. 1:xiii-xcvi (1991); Chothia & Lesk, J. Mol. Biol.
196:901-917 (1987); Chothia et al., Nature 342:878-883 (1989), each of which is herein
incorporated by reference for all purposes.
[0074] As set forth herein, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that any Fe
domain may be modified such that it varies in amino acid sequence from the native Fe
domain of a naturally occurring immunoglobulin molecule. In certain exemplary
embodiments, the Fe domain retains an effector function (e.g., FeyR binding).
[0075] The Fe domains of a polypeptide of the invention may be derived from different
immunoglobulin molecules. For example, an Fe domain of a polypeptide may comprise a
CH2 and/or CH3 domain derived from an IgGI molecule and a hinge region derived from an
IgG3 molecule. In another example, an Fe domain can comprise a chimeric hinge region
derived, in part, from an IgGI molecule and, in part, from an IgG3 molecule. In another
example, an Fe domain can comprise a chimeric hinge derived, in part, from an IgGI
molecule and, in part, from an IgG4 molecule.
[0076] A polypeptide or amino acid sequence "derived from" a designated polypeptide or
protein refers to the origin of the polypeptide. Preferably, the polypeptide or amino acid
sequence which is derived from a particular sequence has an amino acid sequence that is
essentially identical to that sequence or a portion thereof, wherein the portion consists of at
                                                 16

least 10-20 amino acids, preferably at least 20-30 amino acids, more preferably at least 30-50
amino acids, or which is otherwise identifiable to one of ordinary skill in the art as having its
origin in the sequence.
[0077] Polypeptides derived from another peptide may have one or more mutations relative
to the starting polypeptide, e.g., one or more amino acid residues which have been substituted
with another amino acid residue or which has one or more amino acid residue insertions or
deletions.
[0078] A polypeptide can comprise an amino acid sequence which is not naturally occurring.
Such variants necessarily have less than 100% sequence identity or similarity with the
starting hybrid nuclease molecules. In a preferred embodiment, the variant will have an
amino acid sequence from about 75% to less than 100% amino acid sequence identity or
similarity with the amino acid sequence of the starting polypeptide, more preferably from
about 80% to less than 100%, more preferably from about 85% to less than 100%, more
preferably from about 90% to less than 100% (e.g., 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%,
98%, 99%) and most preferably from about 95% to less than 100%, e.g., over the length of
the variant molecule.
[0079] In one embodiment, there is one amino acid difference between a starting polypeptide
sequence and the sequence derived therefrom. Identity or similarity with respect to this
sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence
that are identical (i.e., same residue) with the starting amino acid residues, after aligning the
sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence
identity.
[0080] In one embodiment, a polypeptide of the invention consists of, consists essentially of,
or comprises an amino acid sequence selected from Table 1 and functionally active variants
thereof. In an embodiment, a polypeptide includes an amino acid sequence at least 80%,
81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%,
97%, 98%, or 99% identical to an amino acid sequence set forth in Table 1. In an
embodiment, a polypeptide includes a contiguous amino acid sequence at least 80%, 810%,
82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%,
98%, or 99% identical to a contiguous amino acid sequence set forth in Table 1. In an
embodiment, a polypeptide includes an amino acid sequence having at least 10, 15, 20, 25,
30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 (or any
                                                 17

integer within these numbers) contiguous amino acids of an amino acid sequence set forth in
Table 1.
[0081] In an embodiment, the peptides of the invention are encoded by a nucleotide
sequence. Nucleotide sequences of the invention can be useful for a number of applications,
including: cloning, gene therapy, protein expression and purification, mutation introduction,
DNA vaccination of a host in need therof, antibody generation for, e.g., passive
immunization, PCR, primer and probe generation, siRNA design and generation (see, e.g.,
the Dharmacon siDesign website), and the like. In an embodiment, the nucleotide sequence
of the invention comprises, consists of, or consists essentially of, a nucleotide sequence
selected from Table 1. In an embodiment, a nucleotide sequence includes a nucleotide
sequence at least 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%,
93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to a nucleotide sequence set forth in
Table 1. In an embodiment, a nucleotide sequence includes a contiguous nucleotide sequence
at least 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%,
94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to a contiguous nucleotide sequence set forth in
Table 1. In an embodiment, a nucleotide sequence includes a nucleotide sequence having at
least 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 200, 300, 400,
or 500 (or any integer within these numbers) contiguous nucleotides of a nucleotide sequence
set forth in Table 1.
[0082] Preferred hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention comprise a sequence (e.g., at
least one Fc domain) derived from a human immunoglobulin sequence. However, sequences
may comprise one or more sequences from another mammalian species. For example, a
primate Fc domain or nuclease domain may be included in the subject sequence.
Alternatively, one or more murine amino acids may be present in a polypeptide. In some
embodiments, polypeptide sequences of the invention are not immunogenic and/or have
reduced immunogenicity.
[0083] It will also be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the hybrid nuclease
molecules of the invention may be altered such that they vary in sequence from the naturally
occurring or native sequences from which they were derived, while retaining the desirable
activity of the native sequences. For example, nucleotide or amino acid substitutions leading
to conservative substitutions or changes at "non-essential" amino acid residues may be made.
An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a non-natural variant of a hybrid nuclease
molecule derived from an immunoglobulin (e.g., an Fc domain) can be created by introducing
                                                  18

one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of
the immunoglobulin such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions
are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations may be introduced by standard
techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis.
[0084] The peptide hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention may comprise conservative
amino acid substitutions at one or more amino acid residues, e.g., at essential or non-essential
amino acid residues. A "conservative amino acid substitution" is one in which the amino
acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of
amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art, including basic
side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic
acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine,
tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline,
phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine,
isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine).
Thus, a nonessential amino acid residue in a binding polypeptide is preferably replaced with
another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. In another embodiment, a string
of amino acids can be replaced with a structurally similar string that differs in order and/or
composition of side chain family members. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations
may be introduced randomly along all or part of a coding sequence, such as by saturation
mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be incorporated into binding polypeptides of the
invention and screened for their ability to bind to the desired target.
[0085] The term "ameliorating" refers to any therapeutically beneficial result in the treatment
of a disease state, e.g., an autoimmune disease state (e.g., SLE), including prophylaxis,
lessening in the severity or progression, remission, or cure thereof.
[0086] The term "in situ" refers to processes that occur in a living cell growing separate from
a living organism, e.g., growing in tissue culture.
[0087] The term "in vivo" refers to processes that occur in a living organism.
[0088] The term "mammal" or "subject" or "patient" as used herein includes both humans
and non-humans and include but is not limited to humans, non-human primates, canines,
felines, murines, bovines, equines, and porcines.
[0089] The term percent "identity," in the context of two or more nucleic acid or polypeptide
sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that have a specified percentage
of nucleotides or amino acid residues that are the same, when compared and aligned for
                                                  19

maximum correspondence, as measured using one of the sequence comparison algorithms
described below (e.g., BLASTP and BLASTN or other algorithms available to persons of
skill) or by visual inspection. Depending on the application, the percent "identity" can exist
over a region of the sequence being compared, e.g., over a functional domain, or,
alternatively, exist over the full length of the two sequences to be compared.
[0090] For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to
which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and
reference sequences are input into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if
necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence
comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s)
relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters.
[0091] Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local
homology algorithm of Smith & Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482 (1981), by the
homology alignment algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970), by the
search for similarity method of Pearson & Lipman, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444
(1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and
TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575
Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by visual inspection (see generally Ausubel et al., infra).
[0092] One example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence
identity and sequence similarity is the BLAST algorithm, which is described in Altschul et
al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990). Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly
available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information website.
[0093] The term "sufficient amount" means an amount sufficient to produce a desired effect,
e.g., an amount sufficient to modulate protein aggregation in a cell.
[0094] The term "therapeutically effective amount" is an amount that is effective to
ameliorate a symptom of a disease. A therapeutically effective amount can be a
"prophylactically effective amount" as prophylaxis can be considered therapy.
[0095] It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the
singular forms "a," "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates
otherwise.

                 Hybrid nuclease molecules
[0096] In some embodiments, a composition of the invention includes a hybrid nuclease
molecule. In some embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule includes a nuclease domain
operatively linked to an Fc domain. In some embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule
includes a nuclease domain linked to an Fc domain. In some embodiments the hybrid
nuclease molecule is a nuclease protein. In some embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecule
is a nuclease polynucleotide.
[0097] In some embodiments, the nuclease domain is linked to the Fc domain via a linker
domain. In some embodiments, the linker domain is a linker peptide. In some embodiments,
the linker domain is a linker nucleotide. In some embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecule
includes a leader molecule, e.g., a leader peptide. In some embodiments, the leader molecule
is a leader peptide positioned at the N-terminus of the nuclease domain. In embodiments, a
hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention comprises a leader peptide at the N-terminus of the
molecule, wherein the leader peptide is later cleaved from the hybrid nuclease molecule.
Methods for generating nucleic acid sequences encoding a leader peptide fused to a
recombinant protein are well known in the art. In embodiments, any of the hybrid nuclease
molecules of the present invention can be expressed either with or without a leader fused to
their N-terminus. The protein sequence of a hybrid nuclease molecule of the present
invention following cleavage of a fused leader peptide can be predicted and/or deduced by
one of skill in the art. Examples of hybrid nuclease molecules of the present invention
additionally including a VK3 leader peptide (VK3LP), wherein the leader peptide is fused to
the N-terminus of the hybrid nuclease molecule, are set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 92 (RSLV
132) and 94 (RSLV-133). The corresponding nucleotide sequences are set forth in SEQ ID
NOS: 91 and 93, respectively. In embodiments, following cleavage of the VK3 leader, these
hybrid nuclease molecules have the sequences as set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 96 (RSLV-132)
and 98 (RSLV-133), respectively. The corresponding nucleotide sequences are set forth in

SCC or SSS. In other aspects, the molecules contain the SCC hinge, but are otherwise wild
type for human IgGI Fc CH2 and CH3 domains, and bind efficiently to Fc receptors,
facilitating uptake of the hybrid nuclease molecule into the endocytic compartment of cells to
which they are bound. In other aspects, the molecule has activity against single and/or
double-stranded RNA substrates.

P331S linked via a NLG linker domain to a human DNasel G105R Al 14F domain. In some
aspects, a hybrid nuclease molecule comprises a wild-type, human RNase l domain linked to

and/or in vivo. In some aspects, the hybrid nuclease molecule binds to a cell, a malignant
cell, or a cancer cell and interferes with its biologic activity.
[00107]      In another aspect, a multifunctional RNase molecule is provided that is attached to
another enzyme or antibody having binding specificity, such as an scFv targeted to RNA or a
second nuclease domain with the same or different specificities as the first domain.
[00108]      In another aspect, a multifunctional DNase molecule is provided that is attached to

[00109]      In another aspect, a hybrid nuclease molecule is adapted for preventing or treating
a disease or disorder in a mammal by administering an hybrid nuclease molecule attached to
an Fc region, in a therapeutically effective amount to the mammal in need thereof, wherein
the disease is prevented or treated. In other aspects, the disease or disorder is an autoimmune

                                                  24

premature menopause, male infertility, juvenile diabetes, Goodpasture's syndrome,

erythematosus, or connective tissue disease.
[00110]      In some embodiments, the targets of the RNase enzyme activity of RNase hybrid
nuclease molecules are primarily extracellular, consisting of, e.g., RNA contained in immune
complexes with anti-RNP autoantibody and RNA expressed on the surface of cells
undergoing apoptosis. In some embodiments, the RNase hybrid nuclease molecule is active
in the acidic environment of the endocytic vesicles. In some embodiments, an RNase hybrid
nuclease molecule includes a wild-type (wt) Fc domain in order to, e.g, allow the molecule to
bind FcR and enter the endocytic compartment through the entry pathway used by immune
complexes. In some embodiments, an RNase hybrid nuclease molecule including a wt Fc
domain is adapted to be active both extracellularly and in the endocytic environment (where
TLR7 can be expressed). In some aspects, this allows an RNase hybrid nuclease molecule
including a wt Fc domain to stop TLR7 signaling through previously engulfed immune
complexes or by RNAs that activate TLR7 after viral infection. In some embodiments, the
wt RNase of an RNase hybrid nuclease molecule is not resistant to inhibition by an RNase
cytoplasmic inhibitor. In some embodiments, the wt RNase of an RNase hybrid nuclease
molecule is not active in the cytoplasm of a cell.
[00111]      In some embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule including a wt Fc domain is
used for therapy of an autoimmune disease, e.g., SLE.
[00112]      In some embodiments, Fc domain binding to an Fc receptor (FcR) is increased,
e.g., via alterations of glycosylation and/or changes in amino acid sequence. In some
embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule has one or more Fc alterations that increase FcR
binding.
[00113]      Alternative ways to construct a hybrid nuclease molecule attached to an Fc
domain are envisioned. In some embodiments, the domain orientation can be altered to
construct an Ig-RNase molecule or an Ig-DNase molecule or an RNase-Ig molecule or an
RNase-Ig molecule that retains FcR binding and has active nuclease domains.
[00114]      In some embodiments, DNase hybrid nuclease molecules include a wt Fc domain
that can allow, e.g., the molecules to undergo endocytosis after binding FcR. In some
                                                25

embodiments, the DNase hybrid nuclease molecules can be active towards extracellular
immune complexes containing DNA, e.g., either in soluble form or deposited as insoluble
complexes.
[00115]      In some embodiments, hybrid nuclease molecules include both DNase and RNase.
In some embodiments, these hybrid nuclease molecules can improve the therapy of SLE
because they can, e.g., digest immune complexes containing RNA, DNA, or a combination of
both RNA and DNA; and when they further include a wt Fc domain, they are active both
extracellularly and in the endocytic compartment where TLR7 and TLR9 can be located.
[00116]      In some embodiments, linker domains include (gly4ser) 3, 4 or 5 variants that
alter the length of the linker by 5 amino acid progressions. In another embodiment, a linker
domain is approximately 18 amino acids in length and includes an N-linked glycosylation
site, which can be sensitive to protease cleavage in vivo. In some embodiments, an N-linked
glycosylation site can protect the hybrid nuclease molecules from cleavage in the linker
domain. In some embodiments, an N-linked glycosylation site can assist in separating the
folding of independent functional domains separated by the linker domain.
[00117]      In some embodiments, hybrid nuclease molecules can include both mutant and/or
wild type human IgGI Fc domains. In some embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecules
can be expressed from both COS transient and CHO stable transfections. In some
embodiments, both the CD80/86 binding and the RNase activity are preserved in a hybrid
nuclease molecule. In some embodiments, hybrid nuclease molecules include DNase1L3-Ig
linker-RNase constructs. In some embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule includes a
DNasel-Ig-linker-RNase construct or an RNase-Ig-linker-DNase construct. In some
embodiments, fusion junctions between enzyme domains and the other domains of the hybrid
nuclease molecule is optimized.
[00118]      In some embodiments, hybrid nuclease molecules include DNase-Ig hybrid
nuclease molecules and/or hybrid DNase-RNase hybrid nuclease molecules.
[00119]      In some embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule includes TREXI. In some
embodiments, a TREXI hybrid nuclease molecule can digest chromatin. In some
embodiments, a TREXI hybrid nuclease molecule is expressed by a cell. In some
embodiments, the expressed hybrid nuclease molecule includes murine TREX-1 and a murine
(wt or mutant) Fc domain. In some embodiments, a 20-25 amino acid (aa) linker domain
between TREXI and the IgG hinge can be required to allow DNase activity. In some
embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule with a 15 aa linker domain is not active. In some
                                                26

embodiments, use of the 20 and 25 amino acid linker domains (plus 2 or more amino acids to
incorporate restriction sites) results in functional activity as measured by chromatin digestion.
In some embodiments, a hydrophobic region of approximately 72 aa can be removed from
the COOH end of TREX- 1 prior to fusion to the Fc domain via the linker domain. In some
embodiments, a 20 amino acid linker domain version of the hybrid nuclease molecule
exhibits high expression levels compared to controls and/or other hybrid nuclease molecules.
In some embodiments, kinetic enzyme assays are used to compare the enzyme activity of
hybrid nuclease molecules and controls in a quantitative manner.
[00120]     In some embodiments, further optimization of the fusion junction chosen for
truncation of a TREXI enzyme can be used to improve expression of the hybrid nuclease
molecules.
[00121]     In some embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecule includes a human TREXI
linker-Ig Fc domain hybrid nuclease molecule with 20 and/or 25 aa linker domains. In some
embodiments, the linker domain(s) are variants of a (gly4ser)4 or (gly4ser)5 cassette with one
or more restriction sites attached for incorporation into the hybrid nuclease molecules
construct. In some embodiments, because of the head-to-tail dimerization useful for TREXI
enzyme activity; a flexible, longer linker domain can be used to facilitate proper folding.
[00122]     In some embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecule is a TREXI-tandem hybrid
nuclease molecule. In some embodiments, an alternative method for facilitating head-to-tail
folding of TREXI is to generate a TREXI-TREXI-Ig hybrid hybrid nuclease molecule that
incorporates two TREXI domains in tandem, followed by a linker domain and an Ig Fc
domain. In some embodiments, positioning of TREXI cassettes in a head-to-tail manner can
be corrected for head-to tail folding on either arm of the immunoenzyme and introduce a
single TREXI functional domain into each arm of the molecule. In some embodiments, each
immunoenzyme of a hybrid nuclease molecule has two functional TREXI enzymes attached
to a single IgG Fc domain.
[00123]     In some embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecule includes TREXI-linkerl-Ig
linker2-RNase.
[00124]     In some embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecule includes RNase-Ig-linker
TREXI. In some embodiments, cassettes are derived for both amino and carboxyl fusion of
each enzyme for incorporation into hybrid nuclease molecules where the enzyme
configuration is reversed. In some embodiments, the RNase enzyme exhibits comparable
functional activity regardless of its position in the hybrid nuclease molecules. In some
                                                 27

embodiments, alternative hybrid nuclease molecules can be designed to test whether a
particular configuration demonstrates improved expression and/or function of the hybrid
nuclease molecule components.
[00125]     In some embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecule includes 1L3-Ig. In some
embodiments, the 1L3 DNase is constructed from a murine sequence and expressed. In some
embodiments, the enzyme is active. In some embodiments, a murine 1L3 DNase-Ig-RNase
hybrid nuclease is constructed and expressed. In some embodiments, the molecule includes
human 1L3-Ig, human 1L3-Ig-RNase, and/or human RNase-Ig-1L3.
[00126]     In some embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecule includes DNasel-Ig. In
some embodiments, a naturally occurring variant allele, Al 14F, which shows reduced
sensitivity to actin is included in a DNasel-Ig hybrid nuclease molecule. In some
embodiments, this mutation is introduced into a hybrid nuclease molecule to generate a more
stable derivative of human DNasel. In some embodiments, a DNasel-linker-Ig containing a
20 or 25 aa linker domain is made. In some embodiments, hybrid nuclease molecules include
RNase-Ig-linker-DNasel where the DNasel domain is located at the COOH side of the Ig Fc
domain. In some embodiments, hybrid nuclease molecules are made that incorporate DNase 1
and include: DNase 1-linker-Ig-linker2-RNase, and/or RNase-Ig-linker-DNase 1.
[00127]     Another aspect of the present invention is to use gene therapy methods for treating
or preventing disorders, diseases, and conditions with one or more hybrid nuclease
molecules. The gene therapy methods relate to the introduction of hybrid nuclease molecule
nucleic acid (DNA, RNA and antisense DNA or RNA) sequences into an animal to achieve
expression of the polypeptide or polypeptides of the present invention. This method can
include introduction of one or more polynucleotides encoding a hybrid nuclease molecule
polypeptide of the present invention operatively linked to a promoter and any other genetic
elements necessary for the expression of the polypeptide by the target tissue.
[00128]     In gene therapy applications, hybrid nuclease molecule genes are introduced into
cells in order to achieve in vivo synthesis of a therapeutically effective genetic product.
"Gene therapy" includes both conventional gene therapies where a lasting effect is achieved
by a single treatment, and the administration of gene therapeutic agents, which involves the
one time or repeated administration of a therapeutically effective DNA or mRNA. The
oligonucleotides can be modified to enhance their uptake, e.g., by substituting their
negatively charged phosphodiester groups by uncharged groups.
                                                28

                Fc Domains
[00129]     In some embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule includes an Fc domain. The Fc
domain does not contain a variable region that binds to antigen. In embodiments, the Fc
domain does not contain a variable region. Fc domains useful for producing the hybrid
nuclease molecules of the present invention may be obtained from a number of different
sources. In preferred embodiments, an Fc domain of the hybrid nuclease molecule is derived
from a human immunoglobulin. It is understood, however, that the Fc domain may be derived
from an immunoglobulin of another mammalian species, including for example, a rodent (e.g.
a mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig) or non-human primate (e.g. chimpanzee, macaque) species.
Moreover, the hybrid nuclease molecule Fc domain or portion thereof may be derived from
any immunoglobulin class, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA, and IgE, and any immunoglobulin
isotype, including IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. In a preferred embodiment, the human
isotype IgGI is used.
[00130]     In some aspects, a hybrid nuclease molecule includes a mutant Fc domain. In
some aspects, a hybrid nuclease molecule includes a mutant, IgGI Fc domain. In some
aspects, a mutant Fc domain comprises one or more mutations in the hinge, CH2, and/or CH3
domains. In some aspects, a mutant Fc domain includes a P238S mutation. In some aspects,
a mutant Fc domain includes a P33 IS mutation. In some aspects, a mutant Fc domain
includes a P238S mutation and a P331S mutation. In some aspects, a mutant Fc domain
comprises P238S and/or P331S, and may include mutations in one or more of the three hinge
cysteines. In some aspects, a mutant Fc domain comprises P238S and/or P331S, and/or one
or more mutations in the three hinge cysteines. In some aspects, a mutant Fc domain

[00131]      A variety of Fc domain gene sequences (e.g., human constant region gene
sequences) are available in the form of publicly accessible deposits. Constant region domains
comprising an Fc domain sequence can be selected having a particular effector function (or
lacking a particular effector function) or with a particular modification to reduce
immunogenicity. Many sequences of antibodies and antibody-encoding genes have been
published and suitable Fc domain sequences (e.g. hinge, CH2, and/or CH3 sequences, or
portions thereof) can be derived from these sequences using art recognized techniques. The
genetic material obtained using any of the foregoing methods may then be altered or
synthesized to obtain polypeptides of the present invention. It will further be appreciated that
the scope of this invention encompasses alleles, variants and mutations of constant region
DNA sequences.
[00132]      Fc domain sequences can be cloned, e.g., using the polymerase chain reaction and
primers which are selected to amplify the domain of interest. To clone an Fc domain
sequence from an antibody, mRNA can be isolated from hybridoma, spleen, or lymph cells,
reverse transcribed into DNA, and antibody genes amplified by PCR. PCR amplification
methods are described in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195; 4,683,202; 4,800,159; 4,965,188;
and in, e.g., "PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications" Innis et al. eds.,
Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990); Ho et al. 1989. Gene 77:5 1; Horton et al. 1993.
Methods Enzymol. 217:270). PCR may be initiated by consensus constant region primers or
by more specific primers based on the published heavy and light chain DNA and amino acid
sequences. As discussed above, PCR also may be used to isolate DNA clones encoding the
antibody light and heavy chains. In this case the libraries may be screened by consensus
primers or larger homologous probes, such as mouse constant region probes. Numerous
primer sets suitable for amplification of antibody genes are known in the art (e.g., 5' primers
based on the N-terminal sequence of purified antibodies (Benhar and Pastan. 1994. Protein
Engineering 7:1509); rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Ruberti, F. et al. 1994. J. Immunol.
Methods 173:33); antibody leader sequences (Larrick et al. 1989 Biochem. Biophys. Res.
                                                30

Commun. 160:1250). The cloning of antibody sequences is further described in Newman et
al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,570, filed Jan. 25, 1995, which is incorporated by reference herein.
[00133]     The hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention may comprise one or more Fc
domains (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more Fc domains). In one embodiment, the Fc
domains may be of different types. In one embodiment, at least one Fc domain present in the
hybrid nuclease molecule comprises a hinge domain or portion thereof. In another
embodiment, the hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention comprises at least one Fc domain
which comprises at least one CH2 domain or portion thereof. In another embodiment, the
hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention comprises at least one Fc domain which comprises
at least one CH3 domain or portion thereof. In another embodiment, the hybrid nuclease
molecule of the invention comprises at least one Fc domain which comprises at least one
CH4 domain or portion thereof. In another embodiment, the hybrid nuclease molecule of the
invention comprises at least one Fc domain which comprises at least one hinge domain or
portion thereof and at least one CH2 domain or portion thereof (e.g, in the hinge-CH2
orientation). In another embodiment, the hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention
comprises at least one Fc domain which comprises at least one CH2 domain or portion
thereof and at least one CH3 domain or portion thereof (e.g, in the CH2-CH3 orientation). In
another embodiment, the hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention comprises at least one Fc
domain comprising at least one hinge domain or portion thereof, at least one CH2 domain or
portion thereof, and least one CH3 domain or portion thereof, for example in the orientation
hinge-CH2-CH3, hinge-CH3-CH2, or CH2-CH3-hinge.
[00134]     In certain embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecule comprises at least one
complete Fc region derived from one or more immunoglobulin heavy chains (e.g., an Fc
domain including hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains, although these need not be derived from
the same antibody). In other embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecule comprises at least
two complete Fc domains derived from one or more immunoglobulin heavy chains. In
preferred embodiments, the complete Fc domain is derived from a human IgG
immunoglobulin heavy chain (e.g., human IgGI).
[00135]     In another embodiment, a hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention comprises at
least one Fc domain comprising a complete CH3 domain. In another embodiment, a hybrid
nuclease molecule of the invention comprises at least one Fc domain comprising a complete
CH2 domain. In another embodiment, a hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention comprises
at least one Fc domain comprising at least a CH3 domain, and at least one of a hinge region,
                                                  31

and a CH2 domain. In one embodiment, a hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention
comprises at least one Fe domain comprising a hinge and a CH3 domain. In another
embodiment, a hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention comprises at least one Fe domain
comprising a hinge, a CH2, and a CH3 domain. In preferred embodiments, the Fe domain is
derived from a human IgG immunoglobulin heavy chain (e.g., human IgGI).
[00136]     The constant region domains or portions thereof making up an Fe domain of a
hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention may be derived from different immunoglobulin
molecules. For example, a polypeptide of the invention may comprise a CH2 domain or
portion thereof derived from an IgG 1 molecule and a CH3 region or portion thereof derived
from an IgG3 molecule. In another example, a hybrid nuclease molecule can comprise an Fe
domain comprising a hinge domain derived, in part, from an IgGI molecule and, in part, from
an IgG3 molecule. As set forth herein, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art
that an Fe domain may be altered such that it varies in amino acid sequence from a naturally
occurring antibody molecule.
[00137]     In another embodiment, a hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention comprises
one or more truncated Fe domains that are nonetheless sufficient to confer Fc receptor (FcR)
binding properties to the Fc region. Thus, an Fe domain of a hybrid nuclease molecule of the
invention may comprise or consist of an FcRn binding portion. FcRn binding portions may be
derived from heavy chains of any isotype, including IgGI, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. In one
embodiment, an FcRn binding portion from an antibody of the human isotype IgGI is used.
In another embodiment, an FcRn binding portion from an antibody of the human isotype
IgG4 is used.
[00138]     In one embodiment, a hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention lacks one or
more constant region domains of a complete Fe region, i.e., they are partially or entirely
deleted. In a certain embodiments hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention will lack an
entire CH2 domain (ACH2 constructs). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that such
constructs may be preferred due to the regulatory properties of the CH2 domain on the
catabolic rate of the antibody. In certain embodiments, hybrid nuclease molecules of the
invention comprise CH2 domain-deleted Fc regions derived from a vector (e.g., from IDEC
Pharmaceuticals, San Diego) encoding an IgGI human constant region domain (see, e.g., WO
02/060955A2 and W002/096948A2). This exemplary vector is engineered to delete the CH2
domain and provide a synthetic vector expressing a domain-deleted IgG 1 constant region. It
                                               32

will be noted that these exemplary constructs are preferably engineered to fuse a binding
CH3 domain directly to a hinge region of the respective Fc domain.
[00139]      In other constructs it may be desirable to provide a peptide spacer between one or
more constituent Fc domains. For example, a peptide spacer may be placed between a hinge
region and a CH2 domain and/or between a CH2 and a CH3 domain. For example,
compatible constructs could be expressed wherein the CH2 domain has been deleted and the
remaining CH3 domain (synthetic or unsynthetic) is joined to the hinge region with a 1-20, 1
10, or 1-5 amino acid peptide spacer. Such a peptide spacer may be added, for instance, to
ensure that the regulatory elements of the constant region domain remain free and accessible
or that the hinge region remains flexible. Preferably, any linker peptide compatible with the
instant invention will be relatively non-immunogenic and not prevent proper folding of the
Fc.
[00140]      Changes to Fc Amino Acids
[00141]      In certain embodiments, an Fc domain employed in a hybrid nuclease molecule of
the invention is altered or modified, e.g., by amino acid mutation (e.g., addition, deletion, or
substitution). As used herein, the term "Fc domain variant" refers to an Fc domain having at
least one amino acid modification, such as an amino acid substitution, as compared to the
wild-type Fc from which the Fc domain is derived. For example, wherein the Fc domain is
derived from a human IgGI antibody, a variant comprises at least one amino acid mutation
(e.g., substitution) as compared to a wild type amino acid at the corresponding position of the
human IgGI Fc region.
[00142]      The amino acid substitution(s) of an Fc variant may be located at a position within
the Fc domain referred to as corresponding to the portion number that that residue would be
given in an Fc region in an antibody.
[00143]      In one embodiment, the Fc variant comprises a substitution at an amino acid
position located in a hinge domain or portion thereof. In another embodiment, the Fc variant
comprises a substitution at an amino acid position located in a CH2 domain or portion
thereof. In another embodiment, the Fc variant comprises a substitution at an amino acid
position located in a CH3 domain or portion thereof. In another embodiment, the Fc variant
comprises a substitution at an amino acid position located in a CH4 domain or portion
thereof.
[00144]      In certain embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention comprise
an Fc variant comprising more than one amino acid substitution. The hybrid nuclease
                                                 33

molecules of the invention may comprise, for example, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more amino
acid substitutions. Preferably, the amino acid substitutions are spatially positioned from each
other by an interval of at least 1 amino acid position or more, for example, at least 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 amino acid positions or more. More preferably, the engineered amino acids
are spatially positioned apart from each other by an interval of at least 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25
amino acid positions or more.
[00145]      In certain embodiments, the Fc variant confers an improvement in at least one
effector function imparted by an Fc domain comprising said wild-type Fc domain (e.g., an
improvement in the ability of the Fc domain to bind to Fc receptors (e.g. FcyRI, FcyRII, or
FcyRIII) or complement proteins (e.g. Clq), or to trigger antibody-dependent cytotoxicity
(ADCC), phagocytosis, or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDCC)). In other
embodiments, the Fc variant provides an engineered cysteine residue.
[00146]      In some aspects, an Fc domain includes changes in the region between amino
acids 234-238, including the sequence LLGGP at the beginning of the CH2 domain. In some
aspects, an Fc variant alters Fc mediated effector function, particularly ADCC, and/or
decrease binding avidity for Fc receptors. In some aspects, sequence changes closer to the
CH2-CH3 junction, at positions such as K322 or P331 can eliminate complement mediated
cytotoxicity and/or alter avidity for FcR binding. In some aspects, an Fc domain incorporates
changes at residues P238 and P331, e.g., changing the wild type prolines at these positions to
seine.   In some aspects, alterations in the hinge region at one or more of the three hinge
cysteines, to encode CCC, SCC, SSC, SCS, or SSS at these residues can also affect FcR
binding and molecular homogeneity, e.g., by elimination of unpaired cysteines that may
destabilize the folded protein.
[00147]      The hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention may employ art-recognized Fc
variants which are known to impart an improvement in effector function and/or FcR binding.
Specifically, a hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention may include, for example, a change
(e.g., a substitution) at one or more of the amino acid positions disclosed in International PCT

[00148]      Other amino acid mutations in the Fc domain are contemplated to reduce binding

binding as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,737,056, issued May 18, 2004, incorporated herein by

six fold lower affinity as compared to unmutated IgG3, indicating the involvement of Pro331
in Fc gamma RI binding. In addition, amino acid modifications at positions 234, 235, 236,

No. 2003/0108548, published June 12, 2003 and incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety. In embodiments, the described modifications are included either individually or in
combination.
[00150]      In certain embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention comprises an
amino acid substitution to an Fc domain which alters the antigen-independent effector
functions of the antibody, in particular the circulating half-life of the antibody. Such hybrid
nuclease molecules exhibit either increased or decreased binding to FcRn when compared to
hybrid nuclease molecules lacking these substitutions and, therefore, have an increased or
decreased half-life in serum, respectively. Fc variants with improved affinity for FcRn are
anticipated to have longer serum half-lives, and such molecules have useful applications in
methods of treating mammals where long half-life of the administered polypeptide is desired,
e.g., to treat a chronic disease or disorder. In contrast, Fc variants with decreased FcRn
binding affinity are expected to have shorter half-lives, and such molecules are also useful,
for example, for administration to a mammal where a shortened circulation time may be
advantageous, e.g. for in vivo diagnostic imaging or in situations where the starting
polypeptide has toxic side effects when present in the circulation for prolonged periods. Fc
variants with decreased FcRn binding affinity are also less likely to cross the placenta and,
thus, are also useful in the treatment of diseases or disorders in pregnant women. In addition,
other applications in which reduced FcRn binding affinity may be desired include those
applications in which localization the brain, kidney, and/or liver is desired. In one exemplary
embodiment, the hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention exhibit reduced transport across
the epithelium of kidney glomeruli from the vasculature. In another embodiment, the hybrid
nuclease molecules of the invention exhibit reduced transport across the blood brain barrier
(BBB) from the brain, into the vascular space. In one embodiment, a hybrid nuclease
molecule with altered FcRn binding comprises at least one Fc domain (e.g., one or two Fc
                                                 37

domains) having one or more amino acid substitutions within the "FcRn binding loop" of an
Fe domain. Exemplary amino acid substitutions which altered FcRn binding activity are
disclosed in International PCT Publication No. W005/047327 which is incorporated by
reference herein.
[00151]     In other embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention comprises an
Fc variant comprising an amino acid substitution which alters the antigen-dependent effector
functions of the polypeptide, in particular ADCC or complement activation, e.g., as compared
to a wild type Fc region. In exemplary embodiment, said hybrid nuclease molecules exhibit
altered binding to an Fc gamma receptor (e.g., CD16). Such hybrid nuclease molecules
exhibit either increased or decreased binding to FcR gamma when compared to wild-type
polypeptides and, therefore, mediate enhanced or reduced effector function, respectively. Fc
variants with improved affinity for FcyRs are anticipated to enhance effector function, and
such molecules have useful applications in methods of treating mammals where target
molecule destruction is desired. In contrast, Fc variants with decreased FcyR binding affinity
are expected to reduce effector function, and such molecules are also useful, for example, for
treatment of conditions in which target cell destruction is undesirable, e.g., where normal
cells may express target molecules, or where chronic administration of the polypeptide might
result in unwanted immune system activation. In one embodiment, the polypeptide
comprising an Fc exhibits at least one altered antigen-dependent effector function selected
from the group consisting of opsonization, phagocytosis, complement dependent cytotoxicity,
antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), or effector cell modulation as compared to a
polypeptide comprising a wild type Fc region.
[00152]     In one embodiment the hybrid nuclease molecule exhibits altered binding to an
activating FcyR (e.g. FcyI, FcyIIa, or FcyRIIIa). In another embodiment, the hybrid nuclease
molecule exhibits altered binding affinity to an inhibitory FcyR (e.g. FcyRIIb). Exemplary
amino acid substitutions which altered FcR or complement binding activity are disclosed in
International PCT Publication No. W005/063815 which is incorporated by reference herein.
[00153]     A hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention may also comprise an amino acid
substitution which alters the glycosylation of the hybrid nuclease molecule. For example, the
Fc domain of the hybrid nuclease molecule may comprise an Fc domain having a mutation
leading to reduced glycosylation (e.g., N- or O-linked glycosylation) or may comprise an
altered glycoform of the wild-type Fc domain (e.g., a low fucose or fucose-free glycan). In
another embodiment, the hybrid nuclease molecule has an amino acid substitution near or
                                               38

within a glycosylation motif, for example, an N-linked glycosylation motif that contains the
amino acid sequence NXT or NXS. Exemplary amino acid substitutions which reduce or
alter glycosylation are disclosed in International PCT Publication No. W005/018572 and US
Patent Publication No. 2007/0111281, which are incorporated by reference herein.
[00154]     In other embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention comprises at
least one Fc domain having engineered cysteine residue or analog thereof which is located at
the solvent-exposed surface. Preferably the engineered cysteine residue or analog thereof
does not interfere with an effector function conferred by the Fc. More preferably, the
alteration does not interfere with the ability of the Fc to bind to Fc receptors (e.g. FcyRI,
FcyRII, or FcyRIII) or complement proteins (e.g. Clq), or to trigger immune effector function
(e.g., antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis, or complement-dependent
cytotoxicity (CDCC)). In preferred embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecules of the
invention comprise an Fc domain comprising at least one engineered free cysteine residue or
analog thereof that is substantially free of disulfide bonding with a second cysteine residue.
Any of the above engineered cysteine residues or analogs thereof may subsequently be
conjugated to a functional domain using art-recognized techniques (e.g., conjugated with a
thiol-reactive heterobifunctional linker).
[00155]     In one embodiment, the hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention may comprise
a genetically fused Fc domain having two or more of its constituent Fc domains
independently selected from the Fc domains described herein. In one embodiment, the Fc
domains are the same. In another embodiment, at least two of the Fc domains are different.
For example, the Fc domains of the hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention comprise the
same number of amino acid residues or they may differ in length by one or more amino acid
residues (e.g., by about 5 amino acid residues (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 amino acid residues), about
10 residues, about 15 residues, about 20 residues, about 30 residues, about 40 residues, or
about 50 residues). In yet other embodiments, the Fc domains of the hybrid nuclease
molecules of the invention may differ in sequence at one or more amino acid positions. For
example, at least two of the Fc domains may differ at about 5 amino acid positions (e.g., 1, 2,
3, 4, or 5 amino acid positions), about 10 positions, about 15 positions, about 20 positions,
about 30 positions, about 40 positions, or about 50 positions).
                                                 39

                Linker Domains
[00156]     In some embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule includes a linker domain. In
some embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule includes a plurality of linker domains. In
some embodiments, the linker domain is a polypeptide linker. In certain aspects, it is
desirable to employ a polypeptide linker to fuse one or more Fc domains to one or more
nuclease domains to form a hybrid nuclease molecule.
[00157]     In one embodiment, the polypeptide linker is synthetic. As used herein the term
"synthetic" with respect to a polypeptide linker includes peptides (or polypeptides) which
comprise an amino acid sequence (which may or may not be naturally occurring) that is
linked in a linear sequence of amino acids to a sequence (which may or may not be naturally
occurring) (e.g., an Fc domain sequence) to which it is not naturally linked in nature. For
example, the polypeptide linker may comprise non-naturally occurring polypeptides which
are modified forms of naturally occurring polypeptides (e.g., comprising a mutation such as
an addition, substitution or deletion) or which comprise a first amino acid sequence (which
may or may not be naturally occurring). The polypeptide linkers of the invention may be
employed, for instance, to ensure that Fc domains are juxtaposed to ensure proper folding and
formation of a functional Fc domain. Preferably, a polypeptide linker compatible with the
instant invention will be relatively non-immunogenic and not inhibit any non-covalent
association among monomer subunits of a binding protein.
[00158]     In certain embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention employ a
polypeptide linker to join any two or more domains in frame in a single polypeptide chain. In
one embodiment, the two or more domains may be independently selected from any of the Fc
domains or nuclease domains discussed herein. For example, in certain embodiments, a
polypeptide linker can be used to fuse identical Fc domains, thereby forming a homomeric Fc
region. In other embodiments, a polypeptide linker can be used to fuse different Fc domains
(e.g. a wild-type Fc domain and a Fc domain variant), thereby forming a heteromeric Fc
region. In other embodiments, a polypeptide linker of the invention can be used to
genetically fuse the C-terminus of a first Fc domain (e.g. a hinge domain or portion thereof, a
CH2 domain or portion thereof, a complete CH3 domain or portion thereof, a FcRn binding
portion, an FcyR binding portion, a complement binding portion, or portion thereof) to the N
terminus of a second Fc domain (e.g., a complete Fc domain).
[00159]     In one embodiment, a polypeptide linker comprises a portion of an Fc domain.
For example, in one embodiment, a polypeptide linker can comprise an immunoglobulin
                                               40

hinge domain of an IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, and/or IgG4 antibody. In another embodiment, a
polypeptide linker can comprise a CH2 domain of an IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, and/or IgG4
antibody. In other embodiments, a polypeptide linker can comprise a CH3 domain of an
IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, and/or IgG4 antibody. Other portions of an immunoglobulin (e.g. a
human immunoglobulin) can be used as well. For example, a polypeptide linker can
comprise a CHI domain or portion thereof, a CL domain or portion thereof, a VH domain or
portion thereof, or a VL domain or portion thereof. Said portions can be derived from any
immunoglobulin, including, for example, an IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, and/or IgG4 antibody.
[00160]      In exemplary embodiments, a polypeptide linker can comprise at least a portion of
an immunoglobulin hinge region. In one embodiment, a polypeptide linker comprises an
upper hinge domain (e.g., an IgGI, an IgG2, an IgG3, or IgG4 upper hinge domain). In
another embodiment, a polypeptide linker comprises a middle hinge domain (e.g., an IgGI,
an IgG2, an IgG3, or an IgG4 middle hinge domain). In another embodiment, a polypeptide
linker comprises a lower hinge domain (e.g., an IgGI, an IgG2, an IgG3, or an IgG4 lower
hinge domain).
[00161]      In other embodiments, polypeptide linkers can be constructed which combine
hinge elements derived from the same or different antibody isotypes. In one embodiment, the
polypeptide linker comprises a chimeric hinge comprising at least a portion of an IgG 1 hinge
region and at least a portion of an IgG2 hinge region. In one embodiment, the polypeptide
linker comprises a chimeric hinge comprising at least a portion of an IgG 1 hinge region and
at least a portion of an IgG3 hinge region. In another embodiment, a polypeptide linker
comprises a chimeric hinge comprising at least a portion of an IgG 1 hinge region and at least
a portion of an IgG4 hinge region. In one embodiment, the polypeptide linker comprises a
chimeric hinge comprising at least a portion of an IgG2 hinge region and at least a portion of
an IgG3 hinge region. In one embodiment, the polypeptide linker comprises a chimeric hinge
comprising at least a portion of an IgG2 hinge region and at least a portion of an IgG4 hinge
region. In one embodiment, the polypeptide linker comprises a chimeric hinge comprising at
least a portion of an IgGI hinge region, at least a portion of an IgG2 hinge region, and at least
a portion of an IgG4 hinge region. In another embodiment, a polypeptide linker can comprise
an IgG 1 upper and middle hinge and a single IgG3 middle hinge repeat motif. In another
embodiment, a polypeptide linker can comprise an IgG4 upper hinge, an IgGI middle hinge
and a IgG2 lower hinge.
                                               41

[00162]     In another embodiment, a polypeptide linker comprises or consists of a gly-ser
linker. As used herein, the term "gly-ser linker" refers to a peptide that consists of glycine
and serine residues. An exemplary gly/ser linker comprises an amino acid sequence of the
formula (Gly 4 Ser)n, wherein n is a positive integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). A preferred gly/ser
linker is (Gly 4 Ser)4. Another preferred gly/ser linker is (Gly 4Ser)3. Another preferred
gly/ser linker is (Gly 4 Ser)5. In certain embodiments, the gly-ser linker may be inserted
between two other sequences of the polypeptide linker (e.g., any of the polypeptide linker
sequences described herein). In other embodiments, a gly-ser linker is attached at one or
both ends of another sequence of the polypeptide linker (e.g., any of the polypeptide linker
sequences described herein). In yet other embodiments, two or more gly-ser linker are
incorporated in series in a polypeptide linker. In one embodiment, a polypeptide linker of the
invention comprises at least a portion of an upper hinge region (e.g., derived from an IgGI,
IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 molecule), at least a portion of a middle hinge region (e.g., derived from
an IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 molecule) and a series of gly/ser amino acid residues (e.g., a
gly/ser linker such as (Gly 4 Ser)n).
[00163]     In one embodiment, a polypeptide linker of the invention comprises a non
naturally occurring immunoglobulin hinge region domain, e.g., a hinge region domain that is
not naturally found in the polypeptide comprising the hinge region domain and/or a hinge
region domain that has been altered so that it differs in amino acid sequence from a naturally
occurring immunoglobulin hinge region domain. In one embodiment, mutations can be made
to hinge region domains to make a polypeptide linker of the invention. In one embodiment, a
polypeptide linker of the invention comprises a hinge domain which does not comprise a
naturally occurring number of cysteines, i.e., the polypeptide linker comprises either fewer
cysteines or a greater number of cysteines than a naturally occurring hinge molecule.
[00164]     In other embodiments, a polypeptide linker of the invention comprises a
biologically relevant peptide sequence or a sequence portion thereof. For example, a
biologically relevant peptide sequence may include, but is not limited to, sequences derived
from an anti-rejection or anti-inflammatory peptide. Said anti-rejection or anti-inflammatory
peptides may be selected from the group consisting of a cytokine inhibitory peptide, a cell
adhesion inhibitory peptide, a thrombin inhibitory peptide, and a platelet inhibitory peptide.
In a one preferred embodiment, a polypeptide linker comprises a peptide sequence selected
from the group consisting of an IL-I inhibitory or antagonist peptide sequence, an
erythropoietin (EPO)-mimetic peptide sequence, a thrombopoietin (TPO)-mimetic peptide
                                                42

sequence, G-CSF mimetic peptide sequence, a TNF-antagonist peptide sequence, an integrin
binding peptide sequence, a selectin antagonist peptide sequence, an anti-pathogenic peptide
sequence, a vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) mimetic peptide sequence, a calmodulin
antagonist peptide sequence, a mast cell antagonist, a SH3 antagonist peptide sequence, an
urokinase receptor (UKR) antagonist peptide sequence, a somatostatin or cortistatin mimetic
peptide sequence, and a macrophage and/or T-cell inhibiting peptide sequence. Exemplary
peptide sequences, any one of which may be employed as a polypeptide linker, are disclosed
in U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,843, which is incorporated by reference herein.
[00165]     It will be understood that variant forms of these exemplary polypeptide linkers
can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into
the nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide linker such that one or more amino acid
substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the polypeptide linker. For example,
mutations may be introduced by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and
PCR-mediated mutagenesis.
[00166]     Polypeptide linkers of the invention are at least one amino acid in length and can
be of varying lengths. In one embodiment, a polypeptide linker of the invention is from
about 1 to about 50 amino acids in length. As used in this context, the term "about" indicates
+/- two amino acid residues. Since linker length must be a positive integer, the length of
from about 1 to about 50 amino acids in length, means a length of from 1 to 48-52 amino
acids in length. In another embodiment, a polypeptide linker of the invention is from about
10-20 amino acids in length. In another embodiment, a polypeptide linker of the invention is
from about 15 to about 50 amino acids in length.
[00167]     In another embodiment, a polypeptide linker of the invention is from about 20 to
about 45 amino acids in length. In another embodiment, a polypeptide linker of the invention
is from about 15 to about 25 amino acids in length. In another embodiment, a polypeptide
linker of the invention is from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,
44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56 ,57, 58, 59, 60, or more amino acids in
length.
[00168]     Polypeptide linkers can be introduced into polypeptide sequences using
techniques known in the art. Modifications can be confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.
Plasmid DNA can be used to transform host cells for stable production of the polypeptides
produced.

                 Nuclease Domains
[00169]      In certain aspects, a hybrid nuclease molecule includes a nuclease domain.
Accordingly, the hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention typically comprise at least one
nuclease domain and at least one linked Fc domain. In certain aspects, a hybrid nuclease
molecule includes a plurality of nuclease domains.
[00170]      In some embodiments, a nuclease domain is substantially all or at least an
enzymatically active fragment of a DNase. In some embodiments, the DNase is a Type I
secreted DNase, preferably a human DNase such as DNase 1. Exemplary DNase 1 domains
are set forth in SEQ ID NOs 48-53 and 102. An exemplary human DNase 1 is described at
UniProtKB entry P24855 (SEQ ID NO:49 and 102). In some embodiments, the DNase is
DNase 1 and/or a DNase 1- like (DNaseL) enzyme, 1-3. An exemplary human Dnase 1-like
enzyme, 1-3 is described at UniProtKB entry Q13609 (SEQ ID NO:57 and 103). In some
embodiments, the DNase is TREXI (Three prime repair exonuclease 1). An exemplary
human TREXI is described at UniProtKB entry Q9NSU2 (SEQ ID NO: 104). Preferably the
human TREXI is a C-terminal truncated human TREXI lacking intracellular nuclear
targeting sequences, e.g., a human TREXI lacking 72 C-terminal amino acids as set forth in
SEQ ID NO:105.
[00171]      In some embodiments, a nuclease domain is substantially all or at least an
enzymatically active fragment of an RNase. In some embodiments, the RNase is an
extracellular or secretory RNase of the RNase A superfamily, e.g., RNase A, preferably a
human pancreatic RNase. An exemplary human Rnase is described at UniProtKB entry
P07998 (SEQ ID NO:58 and 101).
[00172]      In one embodiment, the nuclease domain is operably linked (e.g., chemically
conjugated or genetically fused (e.g., either directly or via a polypeptide linker)) to the N
terminus of an Fc domain. In another embodiment, the nuclease domain is operably linked
(e.g., chemically conjugated or genetically fused (e.g., either directly or via a polypeptide
linker)) to the C-terminus of an Fc domain. In other embodiments, a nuclease domain is
operably linked (e.g., chemically conjugated or genetically fused (e.g., either directly or via a
polypeptide linker)) via an amino acid side chain of an Fc domain. In certain exemplary
embodiments, the nuclease domain is fused to an Fc domain via a human immunoglobulin
hinge domain or portion thereof.
[00173]      In certain embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention comprise
two or more nuclease domains and at least one Fc domain. For example, nuclease domains
                                                 44

may be operably linked to both the N-terminus and C-terminus of an Fe domain. In other
exemplary embodiments, nuclease domains may be operably linked to both the N- and C
terminal ends of multiple Fe domains (e.g., two, three, four, five, or more Fe domains) which
are linked together in series to form a tandem array of Fe domains.
[00174]      In other embodiments, two or more nuclease domains are linked to each other
(e.g., via a polypeptide linker) in series, and the tandem array of nuclease domains is
operably linked (e.g., chemically conjugated or genetically fused (e.g., either directly or via a
polypeptide linker)) to either the C-terminus or the N-terminus of a Fe domain or a tandem
array of Fe domains. In other embodiments, the tandem array of nuclease domains is
operably linked to both the C-terminus and the N-terminus of a Fe domain or a tandem array
of Fe domains.
[00175]      In other embodiments, one or more nuclease domains may be inserted between
two Fe domains. For example, one or more nuclease domains may form all or part of a
polypeptide linker of a hybrid nuclease molecule of the invention.
[00176]      Preferred hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention comprise at least one
nuclease domain (e.g., RNase or DNase), at least one linker domain, and at least one Fe
domain.
[00177]      In certain embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention have at
least one nuclease domain specific for a target molecule which mediates a biological effect.
In another embodiment, binding of the hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention to a target
molecule (e.g. DNA or RNA) results in the reduction or elimination of the target molecule,
e.g., from a cell, a tissue, or from circulation.
[00178]      In certain embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention may
comprise two or more nuclease domains. In one embodiment, the nuclease domains are
identical, e.g., RNase and RNase, or TREXI and TREXI. In another embodiment, the
nuclease domains are different, e.g., DNase and RNase.
[00179]      In other embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecules of the invention may be
assembled together or with other polypeptides to form binding proteins having two or more
polypeptides ("multimers"), wherein at least one polypeptide of the multimer is a hybrid
nuclease molecule of the invention. Exemplary multimeric forms include dimeric, trimeric,
tetrameric, and hexameric altered binding proteins and the like. In one embodiment, the
polypeptides of the multimer are the same (ie. homomeric altered binding proteins, e.g.
                                                  45

homodimers, homotetramers). In another embodiment, the polypeptides of the multimer are
different (e.g. heteromeric).
        Methods of Making Hybrid Nuclease Molecules
[00180]     The hybrid nuclease molecules of this invention largely may be made in
transformed host cells using recombinant DNA techniques. To do so, a recombinant DNA
molecule coding for the peptide is prepared. Methods of preparing such DNA molecules are
well known in the art. For instance, sequences coding for the peptides could be excised from
DNA using suitable restriction enzymes. Alternatively, the DNA molecule could be
synthesized using chemical synthesis techniques, such as the phosphoramidate method. Also,
a combination of these techniques could be used.
[00181]     The invention also includes a vector capable of expressing the peptides in an
appropriate host. The vector comprises the DNA molecule that codes for the peptides
operatively linked to appropriate expression control sequences. Methods of affecting this
operative linking, either before or after the DNA molecule is inserted into the vector, are well
known. Expression control sequences include promoters, activators, enhancers, operators,
ribosomal nuclease domains, start signals, stop signals, cap signals, polyadenylation signals,
and other signals involved with the control of transcription or translation.
[00182]     The resulting vector having the DNA molecule thereon is used to transform an
appropriate host. This transformation may be performed using methods well known in the
art.
[00183]     Any of a large number of available and well-known host cells may be used in the
practice of this invention. The selection of a particular host is dependent upon a number of
factors recognized by the art. These include, for example, compatibility with the chosen
expression vector, toxicity of the peptides encoded by the DNA molecule, rate of
transformation, ease of recovery of the peptides, expression characteristics, bio-safety and
costs. A balance of these factors must be struck with the understanding that not all hosts may
be equally effective for the expression of a particular DNA sequence. Within these general
guidelines, useful microbial hosts include bacteria (such as E. coli sp.), yeast (such as
Saccharomyces sp.) and other fungi, insects, plants, mammalian (including human) cells in
culture, or other hosts known in the art.
[00184]     Next, the transformed host is cultured and purified. Host cells may be cultured
under conventional fermentation conditions so that the desired compounds are expressed.
                                                46

Such fermentation conditions are well known in the art. Finally, the peptides are purified
from culture by methods well known in the art.
[00185]      The compounds may also be made by synthetic methods. For example, solid phase
synthesis techniques may be used. Suitable techniques are well known in the art, and include

making individual peptides since it is the most cost-effective method of making small
peptides. Compounds that contain derivatized peptides or which contain non-peptide groups
may be synthesized by well-known organic chemistry techniques.

         Pharmaceutical Compositions and Therapeutic Methods of Use
[00187]      In certain embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule is administered alone. In
certain embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule is administered prior to the administration
of at least one other therapeutic agent. In certain embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule is
administered concurrent with the administration of at least one other therapeutic agent. In
certain embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule is administered subsequent to the
administration of at least one other therapeutic agent. In other embodiments, a hybrid
nuclease molecule is administered prior to the administration of at least one other therapeutic
agent. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in some embodiments, the hybrid
nuclease molecule is combined with the other agent/compound. In some embodiments, the
hybrid nuclease molecule and other agent are administered concurrently. In some
embodiments, the hybrid nuclease molecule and other agent are not administered
simultaneously, with the hybrid nuclease molecule being administered before or after the
agent is administered. In some embodiments, the subject receives both the hybrid nuclease
molecule and the other agent during a same period of prevention, occurrence of a disorder,
and/or period of treatment.
[00188]      Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered in combination
therapy, i.e., combined with other agents. In certain embodiments, the combination therapy
comprises nuclease molecule, in combination with at least one other agent. Agents include,
                                                47

but are not limited to, in vitro synthetically prepared chemical compositions, antibodies,
antigen binding regions, and combinations and conjugates thereof. In certain embodiments,
an agent can act as an agonist, antagonist, allosteric modulator, or toxin.
[00189]       In certain embodiments, the invention provides for pharmaceutical compositions
comprising a hybrid nuclease molecule together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent,
carrier, solubilizer, emulsifier, preservative and/or adjuvant.
[00190]       In certain embodiments, the invention provides for pharmaceutical compositions
comprising a hybrid nuclease molecule and a therapeutically effective amount of at least one
additional therapeutic agent, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier,
solubilizer, emulsifier, preservative and/or adjuvant.
[00191]       In certain embodiments, acceptable formulation materials preferably are nontoxic
to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. In some embodiments, the
formulation material(s) are for s.c. and/or I.V. administration. In certain embodiments, the
pharmaceutical composition can contain formulation materials for modifying, maintaining or
preserving, for example, the pH, osmolarity, viscosity, clarity, color, isotonicity, odor,
sterility, stability, rate of dissolution or release, adsorption or penetration of the composition.
In certain embodiments, suitable formulation materials include, but are not limited to, amino
acids (such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine); antimicrobials; antioxidants
(such as ascorbic acid, sodium sulfite or sodium hydrogen-sulfite); buffers (such as borate,
bicarbonate, Tris-HCl, citrates, phosphates or other organic acids); bulking agents (such as
mannitol or glycine); chelating agents (such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA));
complexing agents (such as caffeine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, beta-cyclodextrin or
hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin); fillers; monosaccharides; disaccharides; and other
carbohydrates (such as glucose, mannose or dextrins); proteins (such as serum albumin,
gelatin or immunoglobulins); coloring, flavoring and diluting agents; emulsifying agents;
hydrophilic polymers (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone); low molecular weight polypeptides;
salt-forming counterions (such as sodium); preservatives (such as benzalkonium chloride,
benzoic acid, salicylic acid, thimerosal, phenethyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben,
chlorhexidine, sorbic acid or hydrogen peroxide); solvents (such as glycerin, propylene
glycol or polyethylene glycol); sugar alcohols (such as mannitol or sorbitol); suspending
agents; surfactants or wetting agents (such as pluronics, PEG, sorbitan esters, polysorbates
such as polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80, triton, tromethamine, lecithin, cholesterol, tyloxapal);
stability enhancing agents (such as sucrose or sorbitol); tonicity enhancing agents (such as
                                                    48

alkali metal halides, preferably sodium or potassium chloride, mannitol sorbitol); delivery
vehicles; diluents; excipients and/or pharmaceutical adjuvants. (Remington's Pharmaceutical
Sciences, 18th Edition, A. R. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Company (1995). In some
embodiments, the formulation comprises PBS; 20 mM NaOAC, pH 5.2, 50 mM NaCl; and/or
10 mM NAOAC, pH 5.2, 9% Sucrose.
[00192]     In certain embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule and/or a therapeutic molecule
is linked to a half-life extending vehicle known in the art. Such vehicles include, but are not
limited to, polyethylene glycol, glycogen (e.g., glycosylation of the hybrid nuclease
molecule), and dextran. Such vehicles are described, e.g., in U.S. application Ser. No.
09/428,082, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,843 and published PCT Application No. WO 99/25044,
which are hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.
[00193]     In certain embodiments, the optimal pharmaceutical composition will be
determined by one skilled in the art depending upon, for example, the intended route of
administration, delivery format and desired dosage. See, for example, Remington's
Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra. In certain embodiments, such compositions may influence
the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release and rate of in vivo clearance of the
antibodies of the invention.
[00194]     In certain embodiments, the primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical
composition can be either aqueous or non-aqueous in nature. For example, in certain
embodiments, a suitable vehicle or carrier can be water for injection, physiological saline
solution or artificial cerebrospinal fluid, possibly supplemented with other materials common
in compositions for parenteral administration. In some embodiments, the saline comprises
isotonic phosphate-buffered saline. In certain embodiments, neutral buffered saline or saline
mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. In certain embodiments,
pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris buffer of about pH 7.0-8.5, or acetate buffer of
about pH 4.0-5.5, which can further include sorbitol or a suitable substitute therefore. In
certain embodiments, a composition comprising a hybrid nuclease molecule, with or without
at least one additional therapeutic agents, can be prepared for storage by mixing the selected
composition having the desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents
(Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra) in the form of a lyophilized cake or an
aqueous solution. Further, in certain embodiments, a composition comprising a hybrid
nuclease molecule, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, can be
formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipients such as sucrose.
                                                   49

[00195]     In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be selected for
parenteral delivery. In certain embodiments, the compositions can be selected for inhalation
or for delivery through the digestive tract, such as orally. The preparation of such
pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is within the ability of one skilled in the art.
[00196]     In certain embodiments, the formulation components are present in concentrations
that are acceptable to the site of administration. In certain embodiments, buffers are used to
maintain the composition at physiological pH or at a slightly lower pH, typically within a pH
range of from about 5 to about 8.
[00197]     In certain embodiments, when parenteral administration is contemplated, a
therapeutic composition can be in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable
aqueous solution comprising a desired hybrid nuclease molecule, with or without additional
therapeutic agents, in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. In certain embodiments, a
vehicle for parenteral injection is sterile distilled water in which a hybrid nuclease molecule,
with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, is formulated as a sterile, isotonic
solution, properly preserved. In certain embodiments, the preparation can involve the
formulation of the desired molecule with an agent, such as injectable microspheres, bio
erodible particles, polymeric compounds (such as polylactic acid or polyglycolic acid), beads
or liposomes, that can provide for the controlled or sustained release of the product which can
then be delivered via a depot injection. In certain embodiments, hyaluronic acid can also be
used, and can have the effect of promoting sustained duration in the circulation. In certain
embodiments, implantable drug delivery devices can be used to introduce the desired
molecule.
[00198]     In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition can be formulated for
inhalation. In certain embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule, with or without at least one
additional therapeutic agent, can be formulated as a dry powder for inhalation. In certain
embodiments, an inhalation solution comprising a hybrid nuclease molecule, with or without
at least one additional therapeutic agent, can be formulated with a propellant for aerosol
delivery. In certain embodiments, solutions can be nebulized. Pulmonary administration is
further described in PCT application no. PCT/US94/001875, which describes pulmonary
delivery of chemically modified proteins.
[00199]     In certain embodiments, it is contemplated that formulations can be administered
orally. In certain embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule, with or without at least one
additional therapeutic agents, that is administered in this fashion can be formulated with or
                                                  50

without those carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as
tablets and capsules. In certain embodiments, a capsule can be designed to release the active
portion of the formulation at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when bioavailability is
maximized and pre-systemic degradation is minimized. In certain embodiments, at least one
additional agent can be included to facilitate absorption of a hybrid nuclease molecule and/or
any additional therapeutic agents. In certain embodiments, diluents, flavorings, low melting
point waxes, vegetable oils, lubricants, suspending agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and
binders can also be employed.
[00200]     In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition can involve an effective
quantity of a hybrid nuclease molecule, with or without at least one additional therapeutic
agents, in a mixture with non-toxic excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of
tablets. In certain embodiments, by dissolving the tablets in sterile water, or another
appropriate vehicle, solutions can be prepared in unit-dose form. In certain embodiments,
suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate,
sodium carbonate or bicarbonate, lactose, or calcium phosphate; or binding agents, such as
starch, gelatin, or acacia; or lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or
talc.
[00201]     Additional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the art,
including formulations involving a hybrid nuclease molecule, with or without at least one
additional therapeutic agent(s), in sustained- or controlled-delivery formulations. In certain
embodiments, techniques for formulating a variety of other sustained- or controlled-delivery
means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible microparticles or porous beads and depot
injections, are also known to those skilled in the art. See for example, PCT Application No.
PCT/US93/00829 which describes the controlled release of porous polymeric microparticles
for the delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. In certain embodiments, sustained-release
preparations can include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g.
films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices can include polyesters, hydrogels,
polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919 and EP 058,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and
gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., Biopolymers, 22:547-556 (1983)), poly (2
hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (Langer et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res., 15:167-277 (1981) and
Langer, Chem. Tech., 12:98-105 (1982)), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra) or
poly-D(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988). In certain embodiments, sustained release
compositions can also include liposomes, which can be prepared by any of several methods
                                                 51

known in the art. See, e.g., Eppstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82:3688-3692 (1985);
EP 036,676; EP 088,046 and EP 143,949.
[00202]      The pharmaceutical composition to be used for in vivo administration typically is
sterile. In certain embodiments, this can be accomplished by filtration through sterile
filtration membranes. In certain embodiments, where the composition is lyophilized,
sterilization using this method can be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization
and reconstitution. In certain embodiments, the composition for parenteral administration can
be stored in lyophilized form or in a solution. In certain embodiments, parenteral
compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example,
an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection
needle.
[00203]      In certain embodiments, once the pharmaceutical composition has been
formulated, it can be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or
as a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. In certain embodiments, such formulations can be
stored either in a ready-to-use form or in a form (e.g., lyophilized) that is reconstituted prior
to administration.
[00204]      In certain embodiments, kits are provided for producing a single-dose
administration unit. In certain embodiments, the kit can contain both a first container having
a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous formulation. In certain
embodiments, kits containing single and multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid
syringes and lyosyringes) are included.
[00205]      In certain embodiments, the effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition
comprising a hybrid nuclease molecule, with or without at least one additional therapeutic
agent, to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic context
and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for
treatment, according to certain embodiments, will thus vary depending, in part, upon the
molecule delivered, the indication for which a hybrid nuclease molecule, with or without at
least one additional therapeutic agent, is being used, the route of administration, and the size
(body weight, body surface or organ size) and/or condition (the age and general health) of the
patient. In certain embodiments, the clinician can titer the dosage and modify the route of
administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. In certain embodiments, a typical
dosage can range from about 0.1 pig/kg to up to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the
                                                 52

factors mentioned above. In certain embodiments, the dosage can range from 0.1 pig/kg up to
about 100 mg/kg; or 1 ptg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 ptg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg.
[00206]      In certain embodiments, the frequency of dosing will take into account the
pharmacokinetic parameters of a hybrid nuclease molecule and/or any additional therapeutic
agents in the formulation used. In certain embodiments, a clinician will administer the
composition until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. In certain
embodiments, the composition can therefore be administered as a single dose, or as two or
more doses (which may or may not contain the same amount of the desired molecule) over
time, or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or catheter. Further refinement
of the appropriate dosage is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art and is within
the ambit of tasks routinely performed by them. In certain embodiments, appropriate dosages
can be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data.
[00207]      In certain embodiments, the route of administration of the pharmaceutical
composition is in accord with known methods, e.g. orally, through injection by intravenous,
intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intra-parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular,
subcutaneously, intra-ocular, intraarterial, intraportal, or intralesional routes; by sustained
release systems or by implantation devices. In certain embodiments, the compositions can be
administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation device.
[00208]      In certain embodiments, the composition can be administered locally via
implantation of a membrane, sponge or another appropriate material onto which the desired
molecule has been absorbed or encapsulated. In certain embodiments, where an implantation
device is used, the device can be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of
the desired molecule can be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous administration.
[00209]      In certain embodiments, it can be desirable to use a pharmaceutical composition
comprising a hybrid nuclease molecule, with or without at least one additional therapeutic
agent, in an ex vivo manner. In such instances, cells, tissues and/or organs that have been
removed from the patient are exposed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a hybrid
nuclease molecule, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, after which the
cells, tissues and/or organs are subsequently implanted back into the patient.
[00210]      In certain embodiments, a hybrid nuclease molecule and/or any additional
therapeutic agents can be delivered by implanting certain cells that have been genetically
engineered, using methods such as those described herein, to express and secrete the
polypeptides. In certain embodiments, such cells can be animal or human cells, and can be
                                                 53

autologous, heterologous, or xenogeneic. In certain embodiments, the cells can be
immortalized. In certain embodiments, in order to decrease the chance of an immunological
response, the cells can be encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. In certain
embodiments, the encapsulation materials are typically biocompatible, semi-permeable
polymeric enclosures or membranes that allow the release of the protein product(s) but
prevent the destruction of the cells by the patient's immune system or by other detrimental
factors from the surrounding tissues.
[00211]     The hybrid nuclease molecules of the instant invention are particularly effective in
the treatment of autoimmune disorders or abnormal immune responses. In this regard, it will
be appreciated that the hybrid nuclease molecules of the present invention may be used to
control, suppress, modulate, treat, or eliminate unwanted immune responses to both external
and autoantigens. In yet other embodiments the polypeptides of the present invention may
be used to treat immune disorders that include, but are not limited to, insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,
rheumatoid arthritis, experimental autoimmune arthritis, myasthenia gravis, thyroiditis, an
experimental form of uveoretinitis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, primary myxoedema,
thyrotoxicosis, pernicious anaemia, autoimmune atrophic gastritis, Addison's disease,
premature menopause, male infertility, juvenile diabetes, Goodpasture's syndrome,
pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigoid, sympathetic ophthalmia, phacogenic uveitis, autoimmune
haemolytic anaemia, idiopathic leucopenia, primary biliary cirrhosis, active chronic hepatitis
Hbs-ve, cryptogenic cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma,
Wegener's granulomatosis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, discoid LE, systemic lupus
erythematosus, or connective tissue disease.
        Kits
[00212]     A kit can include a hybrid nuclease molecule disclosed herein and instructions for
use. The kits may comprise, in a suitable container, a hybrid nuclease molecule disclosed
herein, one or more controls, and various buffers, reagents, enzymes and other standard
ingredients well known in the art.
[00213]     The container can include at least one vial, well, test tube, flask, bottle, syringe, or
other container means, into which a hybrid nuclease molecule may be placed, and in some
instances, suitably aliquoted. Where an additional component is provided, the kit can contain
additional containers into which this component may be placed. The kits can also include a
means for containing the hybrid nuclease molecule and any other reagent containers in close
                                                54

confinement for commercial sale. Such containers may include injection or blow-molded
plastic containers into which the desired vials are retained. Containers and/or kits can
include labeling with instructions for use and/or warnings.
EXAMPLES
[00214]     Below are examples of specific embodiments for carrying out the present
invention. The examples are offered for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to
limit the scope of the present invention in any way. Efforts have been made to ensure
accuracy with respect to numbers used (e.g., amounts, temperatures, etc.), but some
experimental error and deviation should, of course, be allowed for.
[00215]     The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated,
conventional methods of protein chemistry, biochemistry, recombinant DNA techniques and
pharmacology, within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the
literature. See, e.g., T.E. Creighton, Proteins:Structures and MolecularProperties(W.H.

         Example 1. General Approach for generating hybrid nuclease molecules.
[00216]     Hybrid nuclease molecules were designed to incorporate desired structures and
functional activity of single enzyme or multi-enzyme structures as modular cassettes with
compatible restriction enzyme sites for shuttling and domain exchange. The schematic
structure of different embodiments of hybrid nuclease molecules is illustrated in Figure 1.
The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of representative hybrid nuclease molecules are
shown in Table 1.
[00217]     Human cDNAs were isolated from human pancreas RNA (Ambion) or human
PBMC RNA from normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (approximately 5x10e6)
using QIAgen RNAeasy kits (Valencia, CA) and QlAshredder kits to homogenize cell lysates
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Human PBMCs were isolated from heparinized human blood
diluted 1:1 in D-PBS and layered over LSM Lymphocyte Separation Medium (MP
Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) Ficoll gradients.
                                                55

[00218]      Mouse spleen RNA was isolated using QIAgen RNAeasy kits (Valencia, CA)
from approximately 5x10e6 splenocytes. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation from the
culture medium, and 5x10e6 cells were used to prepare RNA. RNA was isolated from the
cells using the QIAGEN RNAeasy kit (Valencia, Calif.) total RNA isolation kit and
QIAGEN QlAshredder according to the manufacturer's instructions accompanying the kit.
One to two microgram (1-2 pig) of total RNA was used as template to prepare cDNA by
reverse transcription. The RNA, 300 ng random primers, and 500 ng Oligo dT (12-18), and 1
ptl 25 mM dNTPs were combined and denatured at 80 0 C for 5 minutes prior to addition of
enzyme. Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) was added to
the RNA plus primer mixture in a total volume of 25 tl in the presence of 5 times second
strand buffer and 0.1 M DTT provided with the enzyme. The reverse transcription reaction
was allowed to proceed at 50 0C for one hour.
[00219]      Between 10-100ng cDNA was used in PCR amplification reactions using primers
specific for the nuclease gene of interest (RNaseA, RNasel, DNasel, Trex1, DNase1L3, etc.)
For initial cloning reactions, primers were designed to isolate the full length cDNA or
truncation products encoding the gene of interest. Full length or shortened PCR fragments
were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and purified using Qiagen QlAquick columns to
remove nucleotides, primers, and unwanted amplified products. Purified fragments were
cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO cloning vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transformed into
TOP 10 competent bacteria. Isolated colonies were picked into Luria Broth media containing
50 ug/ml carbenicillin, and grown overnight to isolate plasmids. TOPO clones were screened
for inserts of the correct size by digestion with EcoRI (NEB, Ipswich, MA) restriction
enzyme and agarose gel electrophoresis of digested fragments. DNA sequence analysis of
positive clones was performed with ABI Ready Reaction Mix v 3.1 and analyzed using an
ABI 3730 XL DNA sequencer. Once correct clones were obtained, further sequence
modifications were designed and PCR reactions performed to generate the desired alleles or
expression cassettes. Truncation products and alleles were generated by PCR mutagenesis
using overlapping primers for introduction of mutations at specific positions in the genes.
Linkers were synthesized by overlapping PCR using internal overlapping primers and
successive rounds of PCR to attach additional sequence to each terminus. Hybrid nuclease
molecules were assembled as a string of several interchangeable cassettes. Molecules of the
preferred embodiment contain a fixed leader peptide, a nuclease cassette, an optional cassette
encoding a choice of several different polypeptide linkers, an -Ig Fc domain cassette with
                                                56

either a STOP codon or a linker at the carboxyl end of the CH3 domain, and for resolvlCase
type molecules, a second linker cassette, followed by a second nuclease cassette. Figure 1
illustrate the cassette type structure of these hybrid nuclease molecules and examples of
potential sequences inserted at each position. Once hybrid nuclease molecules were
assembled, they were transferred to a mammalian expression plasmid pDG appropriate for
transient expression in COS7 or other cells and stable expression in CHO DG44 cells using
selection for DHFR with methotrexate.
[00220]      Transient Expression of Hybrid nuclease molecules
[00221]      COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with expression vector pDG containing
hybrid nuclease molecule gene inserts. The day before transfection, cells were seeded at
4x10e5 cells per 60 mm dish in 4 ml DMEM (ThermoFisher/Mediatech cell gro) + 10% FBS
tissue culture media. DMEM basal media was supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose, sodium
pyruvate, L-glutamine 4 mM, and non-essential amino acids. Fetal bovine serum (Hyclone,
Logan, UT ThermoFisher Scientific) was added to media at 10% final volume. Cells were
incubated at 37 0 C, 5% C02 overnight and were approximately 40-80% confluent on the day
of transfection. Plasmid DNA was prepared using Qiagen (Valencia, CA) QlAprep miniprep
kits according to manufacturer's instructions, and eluted in 50 ul EB buffer. DNA
concentrations were measured using a Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Wilmington DE) spectrophotometer. Plasmid DNA was transfected using Polyfect (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) transfection reagent according to manufacturer's instructions, using 2.5 ug
plasmid DNA per 60 mm dish and 15 ul polyfect reagent in 150 ul serum free DMEM
transfection cocktails. After complex formation, reactions were diluted into 1 ml cell growth
media containing serum and all supplements, and added drop-wise to the plates containing 3
ml fresh DMEM complete culture media. Transient transfections were incubated for 48-72
hours prior to harvesting culture supernatants for further analysis.
[00222]      Generation of Stable CHO DG44 transfectants expressing the hybrid nuclease
molecules of interest
[00223]      Stable production of the hybrid nuclease molecules was achieved by
electroporation of a selectable, amplifiable plasmid, pDG, containing the nuclease-Ig cDNA
under the control of the CMV promoter, into Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The pDG
vector is a modified version of pcDNA3 encoding the DHFR selectable marker with an
attenuated promoter to increase selection pressure for the plasmid. Plasmid DNA was
prepared using Qiagen maxiprep kits, and purified plasmid was linearized at a unique AscI
                                                 57

site prior to phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Salmon sperm DNA (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, Mo.) was added as carrier DNA, and 100 [tg each of plasmid and carrier DNA was
used to transfect 107 CHO DG44 cells by electroporation. Cells were grown to logarithmic
phase in Excell 302 media (JRH Biosciences) containing glutamine (4 mM), pyruvate,
recombinant insulin, penicillin-streptomycin, and 2xDMEM nonessential amino acids (all
from Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.), hereafter referred to as "Excell 302 complete"
media. Media for untransfected cells also contained HT (diluted from a 100x solution of
hypoxanthine and thymidine) (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). Media for transfections under
selection contained varying levels of methotrexate (Sigma-Aldrich) as selective agent,
ranging from 50 nM to 1 tM. Electroporations were performed at 280 volts, 950
microFarads. Transfected cells were allowed to recover overnight in non-selective media
prior to selective plating in 96 well flat bottom plates (Costar) at varying serial dilutions
ranging from 125 cells/well to 2000 cells/well. Culture media for cell cloning was Excell 302
complete, containing 50 nM methotrexate. Once clonal outgrowth was sufficient, serial
dilutions of culture supernatants from master wells were screened for expression of hybrid
nuclease molecules by use of an -IgG sandwich ELISA. Briefly, NUNC immulon II plates
were coated overnight at 40 C with 7.5 microgram/ml F(ab'2) goat anti-mouse IgG (KPL
Labs, Gaithersburg, MD) or 2 ug/ml goat anti-human or anti-mouse IgG (Jackson
Immunoresearch, West Grove PA) in PBS. Plates were blocked in PBS/2-3% BSA, and serial
dilutions of culture supernatants incubated at room temperature for 2-3 hours. Plates were
washed three times in PBS/0.05 % Tween 20, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase
conjugated F(ab'2)goat anti-mouse IgG2a (Southern Biotechnologies) and goat anti-mouse
IgG (KPL) mixed together, each at 1:3500 in PBS/1.0% BSA, or in horseradish peroxidase
conjugated F(ab')2 goat anti-human IgGI (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) at
1:2500 for 1-2 hours at room temperature. Plates were washed four times in PBS/0.05%
Tween 20, and binding detected with SureBlue Reserve, TMB substrate (KPL Labs,
Gaithersburg, MD). Reactions were stopped by addition of equal volume of IN HCl, and
plates read at 450nM on a Spectramax Pro plate reader (Microdevices, Sunnyvale CA). The
clones with the highest production of the hybrid nuclease molecule were expanded into T25
and then T75 flasks to provide adequate numbers of cells for freezing and for scaling up
production of the fusion protein. Production levels were further increased in cultures from the
four best clones by progressive amplification in methotrexate containing culture media. At
each successive passage of cells, the Excell 302 complete media contained an increased
                                                 58

concentration of methotrexate, such that only the cells that amplified the DHFR plasmid
could survive.
[00224]      Supernatants were collected from CHO cells expressing the hybrid nuclease
molecule, filtered through 0.2 pim PES express filters (Nalgene, Rochester, N.Y.) and were
passed over a Protein A-agarose (IPA 300 crosslinked agarose) column (Repligen, Needham,
Mass.). The column was washed with column wash buffer (90mM Tris-Base, 150mM NaCl,
0.05% sodium azide, pH 8.7) , and bound protein was eluted using 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH
3.0. Fractions were collected and protein concentration was determined at 28OnM using a
Nanodrop (Wilmington DE) microsample spectrophotometer, and blank determination using
0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 3.0. Fractions containing hybrid nuclease molecules were pooled,
and buffer exchange performed by serial spins in PBS using centricon concentrators followed
by filtration through 0.2 pim filter devices, to reduce the possibility of endotoxin
contamination.

         Example 2: Construction of RNase-Ig Fusion Genes.
[00226]      Murine RNase 1 was amplified as a full-length cDNA from an EST library (from
Dr. C. Raine, Albert Einstein School of Medicine, Bronx, NY) who sent the clone to our
laboratory without an MTA. Sequence specific 5' and 3' primers used were from the
published sequences. The sequence of the clone was verified by sequencing analysis. The
Genebank accession number is NCBI genelD 19752. Full length human RNase 1 was
isolated from random primed and oligo dT primed cDNA derived from human pancreas total
RNA (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX).
[00227]      Once a full-length clone was isolated, primers were designed to create a fusion
gene with the mouse IgG2a or human IgGI (SEQ ID NO:40) Fc domains. Two different
primers were designed for the 5' sequence fused at the amino terminus of the Fc tail; the first
incorporated the native leader peptide from mouse (or human) RNase, while the second
attached an Agel site to the amino terminus of RNase at the predicted signal peptide cleavage
site in order to fuse the RNase to a human VKIII leader peptide that we already had cloned
and used for other expression studies. For the murine RNase, the sequence of the first primer
is:

sequence and the mature sequence at the 5' end of the RNase, at or near the predicted leader
peptide cleavage site.

         Example 3: Isolation of human and mouse -Fc domains and introduction of
         mutations into the coding sequence.
[00245]      For isolation of mouse and human -Fc domains (SEQ ID NO:40), RNA was
derived from mouse or human tissue as follows. A single cell suspension was generated from
mouse spleen in RPMI culture media. Alternatively, human PBMCs were isolated from
fresh, whole blood using Lymphocyte Separation Media (LSM) Organon Teknika (Durham,
NC), buffy coats harvested according to manufacturer's directions, and cells washed three
                                               60

times in PBS prior to use. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation from the culture medium,
and 2x10 7 cells were used to prepare RNA. RNA was isolated from the cells using the
QIAGEN RNAeasy kit (Valencia, Calif.) total RNA isolation kit and QIAGEN QlAshredder
columns according to the manufacturer's instructions accompanying the kits. One
microgram (4 fig) of total RNA was used as template to prepare cDNA by reverse
transcription. The RNA, 300 ng random primers, and 500 ng Oligo dT (12-18), and 1 1tl       25
mM dNTPs were combined and denatured at 80 0 C for 5 minutes prior to addition of enzyme.
Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) was added to the RNA
plus primer mixture in a total volume of 25 tl in the presence of .second strand buffer and 0.1
M DTT provided with the enzyme. The reverse transcription reaction was allowed to
proceed at 50 0 C for one hour. cDNA was purified using QlAquick (QIAGEN) PCR
purification columns according to manufacturer's directions, and eluted in 40 microliters EB
buffer prior to use in PCR reactions.
[00246]      Wild type mouse and human -Fc domains were isolated by PCR amplification
using the cDNA described above as template. The following primers were used for initial
amplification of wild type sequences, but incorporated the desired mutational changes in the
hinge domain:

[00259]      PCR reactions were performed using a C 1000 thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules
CA) or an Eppendorf thermal cycler (ThermoFisher Scientific, Houston TX). Reactions
included an initial denaturation step at 95 0 C for 2 minutes, followed by 34 cycles with a
94 0 C, 30 sec denaturation, 50 0 C, 30 see annealing, and 72 0 C, 1 minute extension step,
                                                 61

followed by a final 4 minute extension at 72 0 C. Once wild type tails were isolated, the
fragments were TOPO cloned into pCR2.1 vectors, DNA prepared using the QIAGEN spin
plasmid miniprep kits according to manufacturer's instructions and clones sequenced using
ABI Dye Terminator v3.1 sequencing reactions according to manufacturer's instructions.
[00260]     DNA from the correct clones were used as templates in overlap extension PCRs to
introduce mutations at the desired positions in the coding sequence for mouse IgG2a or
human -IgGI. PCR reactions were set up using the full length wild type clones as template
(1 microliter), 50 pmol 5' and 3' primers to PCR each portion of the -Fc domain up to and
including the desired mutation site from each direction, and PCR hi fidelity Supermix
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA), in 50 microliter reaction volumes using a short amplification
cycle. As an example of the overlapping PCR mutagenesis, the primer combination used to
introduce the P33 1S mutation into human -IgG1, was as follows:
[00261]     A 5' subfragment was amplified using the full-length wild type clone as template,
and the 5' primer was hIgG 1-5scc: 5'-agatctcgagcccaaatcttctgacaaaactcacacatgtccaccgtgt-3'
(SEQ ID NO:12), while the 3' primer was P331AS: 5'
gttttctcgatggaggctgggagggctttgttggagacc-3' (SEQ ID NO:13). A 3' subfragments was
amplified using the full-length wild type clone as template and the 5' primer was P33 IS:
5'aaggtctccaacaaagccctcccagcctccatcgagaaaacaatctcc-3'     (SEQ ID NO: 14), while the 3'
primer was mahIgG IS: 5'-tctagattatcatttacccggagacagagagaggctcttctgcgtgtagtg-3'      (SEQ ID
NO:15).
[00262]     Once subfragments were amplified and isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis,
they were purified by QlAquick gel purification columns and eluted in 30 microliters EB
buffer according to manufacturer's instructions. Two rounds of PCR were then performed
with the two subfragments as overlapping templates in new reactions. The cycler was paused
and the 5' (hIgG1-5sec, see above) and 3' (mahIgGIS, see above) flanking primers were
added to the reactions (50 pmol each). PCR amplifications were then carried out for 34
cycles at the conditions described for the wild type molecules above. Full length fragments
were isolated by gel electrophoresis, and TOPO cloned into pCR2.1 vectors for sequence
analysis. Fragments from clones with the correct sequence were then subcloned into
expression vectors for creation of the different hybrid nuclease molecules described herein.
         Example 4: Ouantitation of RSLV-124 protein and RNase enzyme activity in
         mouse sera.
[00263]     In vivo mouse stability analysis of RSLV-124 construct (SEQ ID NO:106).
                                                62

[00264]     Four mice (C220, C221, C222, C223) were injected intravenously with a single
injection of RSLV-124 at time zero. At various times following the injection blood samples
were collected and analyzed for the presence of RSLV-124 protein (a human wild type
RNase linked to a wild-type human IgG 1 Fc domain (SEQ ID NO:106)) and RNase
enzymatic activity. To detect the RSLV-124 compound in mouse serum, an ELISA was
developed which captures the human Fc from the mouse serum followed by detection of the
human RNase. When the ELISA was run on the blood samples of the four mice the presence
of RSLV-124 protein was detected at five minutes following a single intravenous injection of
150 ug, at between 38gg/ml to 55gg/ml (Figure 2). At one day post injection the
concentration of RSLV-124 dropped rapidly to between 8gg/ml to 12gg/ml. The blood
concentration of the drug remained relatively stable for the duration of the analysis out to
seven days where blood levels of the drug were approximately 5gg/ml. The same blood
samples used to measure the RSLV-124 protein by ELISA were used to quantitate the RNase
enzymatic activity of the drug. The RNaseAlert QC system from Ambion (Cat # AM 1966)
was used to measure the enzyme kinetics of the RSLV-124 protein in mouse blood samples
with some modifications. The drug compound was captured from mouse serum onto the
RNaseAlert assay plate using a human anti-Fc monoclonal antibody and quantitated by
measurement of fluorescence per the Ambion kit instructions. Analysis of the relative
fluorescent units (RFU's) of the RSLV-124 molecule showed between 80,000 - 140,000
RFU's at five minutes after injection (Figure 3). The RFU's declined rapidly in parallel with
the protein concentration, remaining relatively stable at between 18,000 - 40,000 RFU's out
to day seven. The RNaseAlert QC system was used to develop a standard curve using known
quantities of protein, from this standard curve the RFU's of the RSLV-124 in the blood
samples were used to extrapolate the protein concentration of RSLV-124. From this analysis
it was determined that the protein concentration present in the mouse blood over the seven
day experiment as calculated using the RNase enzymatic activity assay were very similar to
the values that were measured using the ELISA (Figure 4). From these experiments it was
concluded that the RSLV-124 compound is stable in vivo in mouse circulation over seven
days and retains its enzymatic activity, suggesting that the compound is not susceptible to
degradation in vivo in the mouse since nearly 100% of the enzymatic activity is retained over
seven days in the mouse circulation. Since Fc fusion proteins are often susceptible to
degradation in the circulation this finding further confirms the use of the RNase-Fc fusion
proteins as valuable drugs.

         Example 5: Phenotype of TLR7.1xRNaseA double transgenic mice.
[00266]      Mice were created that overexpress RNaseA (RNase Tg). This nuclease is
expressed at high levels in RNase Tg mice . We have developed both a single radial diffusion
(SRED) method (Figure 5 and a much more quantitative ELISA to quantify RNase in the
serum (Figure 6). Both assays show a significant increase in RNase activity in the RNase Tg.
Quantitation of the level of RNase in Figure 6 compared with wild type B6 mice showed
there was an approximately 10-fold increase in RNase in the RNase Tg. We crossed RNaseA
Tg with TLR7.1 Tg mice to create the double Tg (DTg). TLR7.1 mice have 8-16 copies of
TLR7 and develop a very aggressive, rapidly progressive lupus-like disease and start to die at
3 mo of age with a median survival of 6 mo. In a preliminary analysis, we bled DTg and
littermate controls at 3 mo of age to see whether the DTg mice exhibited signs of
improvement. As shown in Fig. 5, DTg mice had very high levels of RNase in their serum
(equivalent to >13 U/ml RNase based on our standard with specific activity of 993 U /mg).
RNaseA concentration in Tg and DTg mice was also measured by ELISA assay as shown in
Fig. 6. The RNase A Tg and TLR7. 1XRNaseA Dtg mice have RNase A serum
concentrations between 1-2 ng/ml.

        Example 6. Survival curves for TLR7.1 transgenic mouse strains.
[00275]      There was a highly significant difference between the DTg and the TLR7.1
littermate controls in survival. As shown in Figure 7, at 10 months, 61% of TLR7.1 mice had
died, whereas 310%of DTg mice had died. This data shows that overexpression of RNaseA
exerted a strong therapeutic effect. The reasons why TLR7.1 mice die prematurely is not
entirely clear, although severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and glomerulonephritis could play
a part. To determine whether red cell and platelet counts were positively impacted by
RNaseA expression in the DTg mice, we performed blood counts but found no differences
between the TLR7.1 and DTg mice. In contrast, there was a significant improvement in
kidney histopathology in the DTg mice. We observed decreased deposition of IgG and C3 in
DTg mice. PAS staining, which reflects inflammation in the mesangium was also reduced in
DTg mice compared to TLR7.1 littermate controls. When we have now compared
macrophage infiltration of the kidneys using anti-MAC-2 (galectin3) antibody (Lyoda et al.
Nephrol Dial Transplat 22: 3451, 2007), there were many fewer mac-2 positive cells in the
glomeruli of the DTg mice. The results of counting 20 glomeruli per mouse in 5 mice in each
group revelaed mean +/- SE of 3.8+/-1.1 and 1.4+/-0.2 for single versus DTg respectively,
p=.05. In addition, we quantified glomerular tuft size and observed a significant reduction in
glomerular tuft size in the DTg mice (179+/- 41 versus 128+/- 16.8 um2 in single versus DTg
respectively, p=0.037). In summary, TLR7. 1XRNaseA DTg mice survive longer than their
single Tg TLR7.1 littermates and have less inflammation and injury in their kidneys. This
finding indicates that removing RNA immune complexes in this mouse model significantly
improved overall mortality and decreased kidney damage and overall imflammation
associated with this lupus-like pathology.
        Example 7. Analysis of IRGs in spleens of TLR Tg mice.
[00276]     Analysis of interferon response genes (IRGs) in the spleens of TLR7.1 Tg and
TLR7.1 X RNaseA DTg mice mice showed that expression of the IRF7 gene (Interferon
regulatory factor 7 (UniProtKB P70434)) was significantly lower in the DTg mice (p=0.03).
Some other IRGs including MX1 (Interferon-induced GTP-binding protein Mx1 (UniProtKB
P09922)) and VIGI (Radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing protein 2
                                               65

(UniProtKB Q8CBB9)) were lower in DTg mice compared to Tg mice, but the differences
were not significant. (Figure 8). Quantitative PCR was performed as follows: total RNA
was isolated from mouse spleens using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA),
DNase treated using Turbo DNA-free (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and first
strand cDNA was produced with the RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems) using random
primers. The 260/280 was between 1.7 and 2.0 for isolated RNA measured with a NanoDrop
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). cDNA was diluted to an equivalent of Ing/ul total
RNA and 8ul were used per reaction. Primers for the reference gene (18s) and genes of
interest (GOI) were synthesized (IDT, Coralville, Iowa, USA) and diluted to the appropriate
concentrations for qPCR using molecular grade water. BLAST results of the primers show
specific sequence homology only to the reference gene or GOI. Reactions in duplicate (20ul)
were run on an ABI Fast 7500 system using a 1:1 mix of template and primer to SensiMix
SYBR low-ROX master mix (Bioline, London, UK). Relative quantification was calculated
using the  2 -ddCT method with age matched wild type B6 mice as baseline to determine fold
changes for each GOI. The dissociation curves for the reactions show a single melt peak for
each gene. The standard curve showed similar amplification efficiencies for each gene and
that template concentrations were within the linear dynamic range for each of primer set.

polymorphism in the gene encoding human DNAse 1 that is polymorphic in some or all
populations, and that is relevant to autoimmunity. (See Yasuda T, Ueki M, Takeshita H,
Fujihara J, Kimura-Kataoka K, Lida R, Tsubota E, Soejima M, Koda Y, Dato H, Panduro A.
Int J Biochem Cell Biol 42(7): 1216-1225 (2010), herein incorporated by reference). Allelic
                                               66

variants at this position resulted in high activity harboring DNase 1 isoforms relative to wild
type. Another naturally occurring, polymorphic mutation (R2 1 S) has also been reported to
confer higher activity. (See Yasuda, supra)
[00279]      SLE patients have been reported to have significantly decreased levels of DNasel
activity (See Martinez-Valle F, Balada E, Ordi-Ros J, Bujan-Rivas S, Sellas-Fernandez A,
Vilardell-Tarres M. Lupus 18(5): 418-423 (2009), herein incorporated by reference).
[00280]     Naturally occurring enzyme variants may thus be less immunogenic when
administered to patients, since these isoforms occur in the human population. We reasoned
that the combination of the actin resistant properties of alleles similar to Al 14F with the
increased enzymatic activity of alleles like G105R would generate novel allelic variants of
human DNase l that might show improved clinical activity in vitro and in vivo. To our
knowledge, ours is the first report of this new mutant form of DNasel generated from a
combination of two naturally occurring variants G105R and Al 14F.
[00281]     Human DNase 1 was isolated as described previously from human pancreas RNA
(Ambion), by random primed cDNA and PCR using the following primer sets:
[00282]     5'hDNasel-age: GTT ACC GGT CTG AAG ATC GCA GCC TTC AAC ATC

[00283]     5'hDNasel-bx: GTT CTC GAG ATC TTT CAG CAT CAC CTC CAC TGG
ATA GTG (SEQ ID NO:17)
[00284]     Alternatively, the 3' DNase cassettes were amplified by PCR using the following
primer pair.

CAG (SEQ ID NO:18)

[00287]     PCR reactions were performed using 50 pmol each primer, 2 ul cDNA, in a total
volume of 50 ul using Platinum PCR Supermix as previously described. The amplification
profile was 94C 30 sec; 55C 30 sec; 68C 90 see for 35 cycles.
[00288]     Once the wild type gene was amplified by PCR, the fragments were subjected to
gel electrophoresis and 850 bp fragments purified by QlAquick column purification.
Fragments were cloned into pCR2. 1, transformed by TOPO cloning according to
manufacturer's instructions as described for the other constructs. Once sequence was
verified, PCR primers were used to generate subfragments containing naturally occurring
                                                 67

alleles for DNase 1 that have been reported to improve specific activity and improve
resistance to the inhibitory activity of actin. These subfragments contained overlapping
sequence, permitting amplification of complete DNasel subclones containing the desired
allelic variations. COS 7 cells were transiently transfected in 60 mm dishes using Polyfect
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) transfection reagent. Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen
QlAprep miniprep kits according to manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids were eluted in 50
ul EB buffer. DNA concentration was measured using the Nanodrop and an aliquot
equivalent to 2.5 ug plasmid DNA used for each transfection reaction. Each DNaseIg ) or
RNase-Ig-DNase ) expression cassette was inserted into the mammalian expression vector
pDG, a derivative of pcDNA3. 1. Transfected cells were incubated for 72 hours at 37 0 C, 5%
C02 prior to harvest of culture supernatants for further analysis. Culture supernatants were
harvested, residual cells centrifuged from the solution, and the liquid transferred to new
tubes.
COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids containing human DNasel wild type
or naturally occurring DNase 1 mutant alleles (G105R and/or Al 14F) ) fused to the wild type
human IgGI Fc domain. This hinge-CH2-CH3 cassette contains a single C->S mutation in
the hinge region to eliminate the first cysteine in this domain since it is unpaired due to
absence of its pairing partner present in the light chain of the antibody. In addition, more
complex multi-nuclease fusion proteins were also expressed from COS cell transient
transfections.
 Example 9: Isolation of human-Ig tails, introduction of mutations into the coding
sequence, and construction of mutant nuclease molecules
[00289]      For isolation of mutant human -Ig Fc domains, RNA was derived from human
PBMCs isolated from fresh, whole blood using Lymphocyte Separation Media (LSM)
Organon Teknika (Durham, NC), buffy coats harvested according to manufacturer's
directions, and cells washed three times in PBS prior to use. Cells were pelleted by
centrifugation from the culture medium, and 2x107 cells were used to prepare RNA. RNA
was isolated from the cells using the QIAGEN RNAeasy kit (Valencia, Calif.) total RNA
isolation kit and QIAGEN QlAshredder columns according to the manufacturer's instructions
accompanying the kits. One microgram (4 pig) of total RNA was used as template to prepare
cDNA by reverse transcription. The RNA, 300 ng random primers, and 500 ng Oligo dT (12
18), and 1 ptl 25 mM dNTPs were combined and denatured at 80 0 C. for 5 minutes prior to
addition of enzyme. Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) was
                                                 68

added to the RNA plus primer mixture in a total volume of 25 tl in the presence of second
strand buffer and 0.1 M DTT provided with the enzyme. The reverse transcription reaction
was allowed to proceed at 50 0 C for one hour. cDNA was purified using QlAquick
(QIAGEN) PCR purification columns according to manufacturer's directions, and eluted in
40 microliters EB buffer prior to use in PCR reactions.
[00290]     Wild type human -Ig Fc domains were isolated by PCR amplification using the
cDNA described above as template. The mutant -Ig fragments were isolated by PCR
directed mutagenesis, using appropriate PCR primers containing the desired mutations and
the wild type cassettes as template. PCR reactions were performed using a C 1000 thermal
cycler (BioRad, Hercules CA). Reactions included an initial denaturation step at 95 0 C for 2
minutes, followed by 34 cycles with a 94 0 C, 30 second denaturation, 55 0 C, 30 second
annealing, and 72 0 C, 1 minute extension step, followed by a final 4 minute extension at 72 0 C.
Once full length mutant tails were isolated, the fragments were TOPO cloned into pCR2.1
vectors, DNA prepared using the QIAGEN spin plasmid miniprep kits according to
manufacturer's instructions and clones sequenced using ABI Dye Terminator v3.1
sequencing reactions according to manufacturer's instructions.
[00291]     Recombinant molecules were generated by PCR mutagenesis using overlap
extension PCR with mutated oligonucleotides.
[00292]     The following oligonucleotides were used to derive these molecules.

[00298]     The P238S mutation and SSS substitutions for SCC were introduced by PCR
mutagenesis using two overlapping 5' oligos in sequential PCR reactions. The first PCR
reaction included the following 5' primer that incorporates the P238S mutation within its

[00300]     DNA from the correct clones was used as template in overlap extension PCRs to
introduce mutations at the desired internal positions in the coding sequence for human -IgG1.
PCR reactions were set up using the full length clones as template (1 microliter), 50 pmol 5'
and 3' primers to PCR each portion of the -Ig tail up to and including the desired mutation
site from each direction, and PCR hi fidelity Supermix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA), in 50
microliter reaction volumes using a short amplification cycle. As an example of the
overlapping PCR mutagenesis, the primer combination used to introduce the P331S mutation
into the human -IgGI with the already introduced P238S mutation was as follows:
[00301]     A 5' subfragment was amplified using the full-length wild type clone as template,
and the 5' primer was SSSH-5-2: AGA TCT CGA GCC CAA ATC TTC TGA CAA AAC

TTA TCA TTT TCC CGG AGA GAG AGA GAG GCT CTT CTG CGT GTA GTG

[00303]     Once subfragments were amplified and isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis,
they were purified by QlAquick gel purification columns and eluted in 30 microliters EB
buffer according to manufacturer's instructions. Two rounds of PCR were then performed
with the two subfragments as overlapping templates in new reactions. The cycler was paused
and the 5' and 3' flanking primers were added to the reactions (50 pmol each). PCR
amplifications were then carried out for 34 cycles at the conditions described for the wild
type molecules above. Full length fragments were isolated by gel electrophoresis, and TOPO
cloned into pCR2.1 vectors for sequence analysis. Fragments from clones with the correct
                                               70

sequence were then subeloned into expression vectors for creation of the different nuclease
molecules described herein.
[00304]     For multispecific nuclease molecules, PCR reactions were performed using an
alternative primer for the 3' end of the Fc domain, removing the STOP codon and adding on
the NLG linker and the EcoRV restriction site to the molecules to facilitate fusion to the rest
of the cassettes. The primer sequence is listed below: 5' GAT ATC CTG CAC GCT AGG

[00305]     RSLV mutant nucleases were constructed by fusing the mutated human -Ig tails
to the wild type RNase domain with or without a linker separating the two domains. RSLV
125 and RSLV126 fuse human RNase to the mutant hinge and IgGI Fc domain. RSLV125
contains no linker, while RSLV 126 contains the (gly4ser)4 linker as a (BglII-XhoI) fragment
inserted between the nuclease domain and hinge regions. RSLV-125 incorporates a wild type
RNase cassette fused directly to an SSS (rather than CCC or wild type) version of the human
IgGI hinge, and a P238S, P33 1S mutant human IgGI Fc domain (SEQ ID NO:61-62).
[00306]     RSLV 126 incorporates a wild type RNase cassette fused to a (gly4ser)4 linker
domain, followed by the SSS mutant hinge, and a P238S-P33 1S double mutant Fc domain
(SEQ ID NO:63-64).
[00307]     RSLV-127 is a multinuclease fusion construct that incorporates an amino terminal
human DNase (G105R/A1 14F) fused to a (gly4ser)4 linker domain, followed by an SSS
mutant hinge and P238S-P33 IS double mutant Fc domain fused to an NLG linker domain
and followed by a C terminal wild type RNase domain (SEQ ID NO:65-66).
[00308]      RSLV-128 is a multinuclease fusion construct that incorporates an amino
terminal wild type human RNase domain, fused to a (gly4ser)4 linker domain, followed by an
SSS mutant hinge and P238S-P33 1S double mutant Fc domain fused to an NLG linker
domain and followed by a C terminal mutant DNase (G105R/A1 14F) domain (SEQ ID
NO:67-68).
[00309]     RSLV-129 is a multispecific fusion construct that incorporates an amino terminal
wild type human RNase domain, fused to an SSS mutant hinge and P238S-P33 1S double
mutant Fc domain fused to an NLG linker domain and followed by a C terminal mutant
DNase (G105R/A1 14F) domain (SEQ ID NO:69-70).
[00310]      RSLV-132 incorporates a wild type RNase cassette fused directly to an SCC
version of the human IgGI hinge, and a P238S, P33 1S mutant human IgGI Fc domain (SEQ
ID NOS: 91-92 and 95-96).
                                               71

[00311]     RSLV-133 is a multispecific fusion construct that incorporates an amino terminal
wild type human RNase domain, fused to an SCC mutant hinge and P238S-P33iS double
mutant Fe domain fused to an NLG linker domain and followed by a C terminal mutant
DNase (G105R/A1 14F) domain (SEQ ID NOS: 93-94 and 97-98).
[00312]     Additional versions of RSLV-125-RSLV-129 with an SCC hinge are shown in
Table 1 as RSLV-125-2 (SEQ ID NO:77-78), RSLV-126-2 (SEQ ID NO:79-80), RSLV-127
2 (SEQ ID NO:81-82), RSLV-128-2 (SEQ ID NO:83-84), and RSLV-129-2 (SEQ ID NO:85
86).
        Example 10: Western Blot on RSLV 125-129 fusion proteins expressed from
        COS7 transfections
[00313]     Figure 9 shows a Western Blot on COS transfection supernatants from RSLV 125
129 constructs. Expression plasmids containing RSLV 125, 126, 127, 128, or 129 were
transfected into COS7 cells using Polyfect transfection reagent and supernatants harvested
after 48 hours. In addition to the single nuclease molecules contained in RSLV 125 and 126,
more complex multi-nuclease fusion proteins were also expressed from COS cell transient
transfections, encoded by RSLV 127, 128, and 129. Western blot analysis was performed on
supernatants from transient transfectants. The molecules shown in Figure 9 contain human
RNasel fused to the human SSS IgGI hinge, and Ig GI P238S-P331S Fc domain or include
human RNasel (wild type) fused to the SSS hinge-(P238S-33 IS) CH2-CH3 Fc domain of
human IgG 1, followed by a novel linker containing an N-linked glycosylation site to protect
the linker domain from protease cleavage, and the mutant allele G105R-A1 14F form of
human DNasel at the carboxy terminus of the molecule. In addition, RSLV 127 encodes the
human DNasel mutant above at the amino terminus and the RNase 1 WT at the carboxy
terminus of the mutant -Ig tail. COS supernatants were harvested after 72 hours and 0.5 ml
samples were immunoprecipitated overnight at 40 C with 100 ul protein A-agarose beads.
Protein A beads were centrifuged and washed twice in PBS prior to resuspending in SDS
PAGE loading buffer, for NuPAGE gels-reducing or nonreducing LDS sample buffer
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Samples were heated according to manufacturer's instructions,
protein A beads centrifuged to pellet, and sample buffer loaded onto 5-12% NuPAGE
gradient gels. Samples were electrophoresed at 150 volts for 1.5-2 hours, and gels blotted to
nitrocellulose membranes at 30 mAmp for 1 hour. Western blots were blocked in TBS/5%
non-fat milk overnight. Blots were incubated with 1:2500 HRP (horseradish peroxidase)
conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Fc specific, Jackson Immunoresearch) for 1.5 hours at room
                                               72

temperature, washed in PBS/0.5% Tween20 five or more times, and blots developed using
ECL reagent. The results demonstrate that the construction of the nuclease Fc fusion
proteins was successful and the proteins are readily expressed from COS cells. Furthermore
analyzing the reducing and non-reducing profiles for these nuclease Fc fusion proteins
confirms that the DNA constructs encode proteins of the appropriate molecular weight. The
pattern on non-redcing SDS-PAGE confirms the di-sulfide bonding properties of the proteins
are consistent with the expected behavior of the constructs.
        Example 11: SRED analysis of affinity purified proteins from COS7
        transfectants
[00314]     Figure 10 shows SRED analysis comparing aliquots of protein A purified proteins
from RSLV transfected COS supernatants from Example 10. A 2% agarose gel was prepared
with distilled water. Poly-IC (Sigma) was dissolved in distilled water at 3 mg/ml. The gel
plate was prepared as follows: 1.5 ml reaction buffer (0.2M Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 40mM EDTA
and 0.1 mg/ml ethidium bromide), 1 ml Poly-IC and 0.5 ml water were place in the tube and
maintained at 50 0C for 5 min. 3 ml of the agarose (kept at 50 0 C) was added to the tube. The
mixture was immediately poured onto a glass plate. Sampling wells were punched in the gel.
2 1dof each control, serum sample, or affinity purified RSLV proteins, was loaded into wells
and the gel was incubated at 37oC for 4 hours in the moist chamber. Then the gel was
incubated in a buffer (20 mM sodium acetate pH5.2, 20mg/ml ethidium bromide) on ice for
30 min. and read under UV. Gels were photographed on a UV transilluminator using a Kodak
digital camera DC290 system equipped with ethidium bromide filters and analyzd using
Kodak Molecular Imaging software. The results from the RNase enzymatic activity assay
indicate that the constructs all contain catalytically active RNase moieties
        Example 12: In gel DNase activity of RSLV nuclease molecules
[00315]     Figure 11 shows results from a DNase nuclease activity assay performed on
protein A purified protein from COS7 supernatants transfected with the RSLV fusion
plasmids in Example 10. Figure 11 shows fivee panels (11 a, 1 Ib, 1 lc), with each gel panel
showing the digestion pattern with decreasing amounts of the indicated fusion protein and 1
microgram of plasmid DNA. Each protein was serially diluted in two-fold increments in
nuclease free water from 500ng to 4ng of enzyme. To each sample, was added 1 ug PDG
plasmid DNA, incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees. One-half of each sample was
subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis for 30 minutes at 100 volts using 1.2% TAE agarose
gels. Figure 1 Ic shows the reslts of an in gel DNase enzyme activity assay using
                                                 73

commercially available DNase 1 (Biolabs, Inc.). The far right lane is a negative control with
the DNA alone and no enzyme, the lane to the left of that is another negative control, this is
an RNase-Ig molecule which has RNase activity but no DNase activity, as expected the
plasmid DNA remains intact and is not digested in both cases. The results demonstrate that
commercially available DNasel enzyme is highly active and digests all the DNA at most of
the concentrations tested. The results in Figures 11 a and 11 b show the DNase activity of four
different nuclease Fc fusion constructs. The top panel in Figure 11 a shows the ability of a
DNase-Ig fusion protein to digest the plasmid DNA, as is apparent from the gel, this enzyme
digests all the DNA at all concentrations tested is as active, or more active than commercially
available DNase 1. In the lower panel of Figure 11 a is a bi-specific nuclease Fc fusion
protein with the DNase on the amino terminus of the Fc (SED ID 65-66) and it also has
robust DNase enzymatic activity, but a little less than the DNase-Ig in the upper panel of
Figure 1 la. The top panel of Figure 11 b shows the DNase enzymatic activity of another bi
specific nuclease, this Fc fusion protein has the DNase on the C-terminus of the Fc connected
to the Fc via a specially engineered NLG linker (SEQ ID 67-68). As is apparent by the data
this enzyme also has robust DNase enzymatic activity and appears to be more active than the
other bi-specific nucleases examined here. The bottom panel of Figure 1 lb shows the DNase
enzymatic activity of another bi-specific nuclease molecule that is lacking the (G4S)4 linker
connecting the RNase module with the Fc (SEQ ID 69-70). This bi-specific nuclease also
has good DNase activity but it appears to be somewhat less than the other two bi-specific
nuclease Fc fusion proteins shown in this experiment. This data suggests that all of the bi
specific nucleases have good DNase activity, which is an unexpected given the past efforts of
others in this regard (Dwyer et al. JBC; Vol 271, No. 14; pp 9738-9743). Furthermore the
position of the DNase in the construct as well as the linker length and composition
connecting the DNase to the Fc are critical in creating a highly active DNase enzyme in the
context of a bi-specific nuclease Fc fusion protein.
        Example 13: Analysis of Enzyme Kinetics
[00316]      Figures 12-13 show results from a kinetic fluorescence enzyme activity assay
comparing the RNase enzyme activity of recombinant RNase A (Ambion), RSLV 125, RSLV
126, hRNase WT-SCCH-WThIgG1, and hRNaseG88D-SCCH-(P238S/K322S/P33 1 S)hIgG1.
To further define the functional characteristics of the bivalent mRNase-Ig fusion protein, we
studied the enzyme kinetics of different nuclease fusion proteins using the RNase Alert
Substrate (Ambion/IDT) and fluorescence was quantified with a Biotek Synergy2 microplate
                                                74

reader. Data was analyzed using Gen5 software (Biotek Instruments, Inc., Winooski,
Vermont). Relative fluorescence units as a function of time were assayed very minute over
the course of a 45 minute experiment incubated at 37C according to manufacturer's
instructions, using decreasing enzyme concentrations starting from 10 pg/ul and serially
diluting to 0.1 pg/ul by 0.67x increments. Each sample included a fixed concentration of
RNase Alert substrate (200nM) in IX RNase Alert Reaction Buffer.
[00317]      Figure 12 shows the RFU (relative fluorescence units) versus time for each
protein at equimolar concentrations, with the test proteins at 4.5 pg/ul or 4.5 ng/ml, and the
recombinant RNaseA control at 1.3 pg/ul in the presence of 200 nM RNase Alert substrate.
[00318]      Figure 13 shows a Lineweaver Burk plot of the different molecules. In order to
estimate the Vmax and Km, RNase Alert kinetic fluorescence assays were set up using
105pM enzyme, and the substrate concentration was decreased from 200nM to 50 pM in four
fold increments. Thus, the enzyme concentration was fixed and substrate concentration
titrated in this series of experiments. The data show the Lineweaver Burk plots generated for
the different fusion proteins under these conditions. Taken together the data in Figures 12
and 13 demonstrate that the RNase moieties are highly active in the three RNase Fc fusion
proteins constructed and tested here.
[00319]      Example 14: Assessment of in vitro cytotoxicity against human THP-1 cell
line
[00320]      Figures 14-15 show results of in vitro studies analyzing the effects of RNaseIg
fusion proteins with wild type or mutant (including SCC, P238S, P331 S) -IgG Fc domains
on the survival of a human monocytic cell line, THP 1. The THP 1 cells were maintained in
logarithmic growth in RPMI/10% FBS prior to harvest for the assays. Cells were greater
than 98% viable prior to use in cytotoxicity assays. THP1 cells were plated in 96 well plates
at a cell density of 1xOe6 c/ml, or 100,000 cells per well. Hybrid nuclease proteins were
added to successive wells using a two-fold serial dilution series starting at 5 micrograms/ml
and ending with 0.01 microgram/ml fusion protein per reaction. In this experiment an
RNase-Fc fusion protein with a wild type IgGI Fc (wtRNasewtIgG) was compared with an
RNase-Fc with a mutant Fc (P238S, P33 1S) that had significantly reduced Fc receptor
binding and internalization (mtRNasemglgG), with respect to their ability to induce
cytotoxicity in the cultured THP1 cells. Reactions were incubated in 96 well plates for three
days at 37oC, 5% C02 prior to cell harvest and analysis. After three days, cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 1000 rpm, washed in PBS/2%FBS, and incubated with FITC
                                                75

Annexin V apoptosis detection kit reagents (#556547, Becton Dickinson/Pharmingen),
according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed with 100 microliters cold
binding buffer supplied with the kit, and annexin V-FITC/Propidium Iodide (PI) added at
1:100 in 100 ul binding buffer. Samples were incubated on ice for 20 minutes, after which
400 gl additional binding buffer was added to each sample. Stained samples were analyzed
by flow cytometry using a FACS Canto (Becton Dickinson) and data analyzed using Flowjo
software (Treestar, Ashland, OR).
[00321]      Figure 14 shows the effect of RNase Fc fusion proteins with a wild type or mutant
Fc domain on cell death as measured by two methods, Annexin V binding (top panel) and
propidium iodide binding (bottom panel), both are sensitive measure of cell death. This
experiment demonstrates that binding of the RNase fusion protein with mutant Fc (P23 8S,
P33 IS) has reduced binding to Fc recptors on the surface of the THP1 cells, and subsequent
internalization of the protein. The results show a significant decrease in cell death by the
RNase-Fc mutant compared to RNase-wild type Fc fusion proteins (e.g., an approximately 3
fold decrease at 1.25 gg/ml of protein). Figure 15 presents the results of fluorescence
activated cell sorting (FACS) experiments to examine the cytotoxicity of RNase Fc fusions
constructs with a wild type or mutant Fc domain (RNase-wtIgG or RNase-mtIgG
respectively). The data demonstrate a significant decrease in the number of dead cells when
the THP 1 cells are incubated with the RNase Fc construct with a mutant Fc (smaller peak
size to the right of the graph for the RNase Fc mutant compared to RNase -wtIgG). These
data show an approximately 3- to 5- fold decrease in cell death by the RNase Fc mutant
compared to wild type. These and other experiments examining Fc receptor binding clearly
show that in the presence of cells bearing Fc receptors the RNase Fc construct with a mutated
Fc region has reduced binding to Fc receptors and less internalization by cells, resulting in
less cell death due to the RNase activity of the construct. Such constructs are particularly
useful in treating autoimmune diseases as it may be undesirable to use a protein therapeutic
which is cytotoxic to Fc receptor bearing cells.
         Example 15: IFN-alpha production by human PBMCs is inhibited by RSLV-132
         addition to cultures in vitro.
[00322]      RSLV 132 addition abolished the induction of interferon-a from human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells stimulated using immune complexes formed with serum from three
SLE patients plus necrotic cell extract (NCE) (Figure 16). To measure the ability of RSLV
132 to bind to and degrade RNA contained in the immune complexes of lupus patients, and in
                                                76

vitro bioassay was developed. The experiment involves the formation of immune complexes
in vitro using the autoantibodies from lupus patients and NCE from cultured human cells
(U937). Combining the lupus patient serum with the NCE results in the formation of immune
complexes (IC) which are very potenti inducers of interferon, normal human serum does not
stimulate the production of interferon. The IC are incubated with normal human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's) as reporter cells. The production of interferon by the
reporter cell sis measured using an interferon-a ELISA. Reporter cells were obtained from
normal volunteers by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Lupus patient or healthy normal
volunteer serum was obtained under University of Washington Institutional Rreview Board
#HSD No. 3971, the serum was diluted 1/1000 and added to 10% (v/v) of necrotic cell
extract (NCE) derived from cultured U937 cells as above. Diluted lupus patient or normal
volunteer serum was incubated with the NCE for 15 minutes at room temperature, the
resulting IC's were incubated with or without various doses of RSLV-132, RSLV-124, or
wild type RNase for 15 minutes then incubated with normal PBMC's for 20 hours in the
presence of 500 U/mL Universal IFN followed by measurement of the amount of IFN
secreted from the PBMC culture.      Serum was obtained from three (3) different lupus patients
with various degrees of disease activity ranging from mild to active. The NCE was incubated
with either lupus patient serum or healthy normal volunteer serum at room temperature for 15
minutes followed by 20 hour incubation with PBMC's. IFN-a was quantitated by ELISA
where IFN-a is captured using a mouse MAb against human IFN alpha (MMHA- 11) [PBL
Biomedical Laboratories, product # 2112-1] and was detected using a rabbit polyclonal
antibody against IFN alpha [PBL Biomedical Laboratories, product # 31101-1], followed by
development using anti-rabbit HRP [Jackson Immuno Research, product # 711-035-152] and
TMB substrate.     In some cases prior to addition of the NCE to the PBMC's, the test article
(RSLV-124 or RSLV-132) was added at concentrations of 0.16, 0.5, 1.6 and 5.0 ug/mL or
RNAse was added at concentrations of 0.05, 0.16, 0.5 and 1.6 ug/mL (equimolar) to the NCE.
The ability of the lupus patient serum to stimulate production of IFN from the PBMC's was
reduced by approximately 50% with the addition of 5.0 ug/mL RSLV-124. This inhibition
mirrored that of an equimolar quantity of RNAse. Addition of the same concentration of
huRSLV-132 was as or more effective at inhibiting IFN than RSLV-124, with almost
completely abolished IFN production with the addition of 5.0 ug/mL of huRSLV-132. When
combined with NCE, lupus patient anti-RNA/DNA antibodies are potent induces of IFN from
freshly isolated PBMC's. Serum from normal volunteers does not have this same ability to
                                               77

stimulate IFN production from the reporter cells. This data indicates that the auto-antibodies
circulating in lupus patient serum are able to form immune complexes which presumably
trigger TLR7 and the subsequent production of IFN. The exact type and subtypes of IFN
were not analyzed. This data indicates that RSLV-132 binds to its molecular target, the RNA
associated with the lupus patient IC's and potently degrades it, thereby preventing the
stimulation of IFN from the PBMC's (Figure 16). RSLV-132 appears to be more active than
RSLV-124 in this assay.
Example 16: RSLV-132 is a potent in vivo inhibitor of RNA-induced Interferon
activation.
To assess the ability of RSLV-132 to bind to and degrade RNA in the circulation of the
mouse, a pharmacodynamic model was developed using an RNA mimetic
polyinosinic:polycytidilic acid (poly I:C) which is a robust activator of the interferon
pathway. Poly(I:C) is a mismatched double-stranded RNA with one strand being a polymer
of inosinic acid, the other a polymer of cytidylic acid. It is know to interact with toll-like
receptor 3 (TLR3) which is expressed in the membrane of B cells, macrophages and dendritic
cells. Poly(I:C) is available from Invitrogen. The effects of poly I:C can be quantitated by
measuring the expression levels of interferon stimulated genes in the spleen of the mouse
following administration.    On day zero 10 B6 mice, three months of age, were treated with
either RSLV-132 (250ug per mouse) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (Privigen,
Behring) (250ug per mouse) as a control, both via intraperitoneal injection. Twenty hours
after injection of RSLV-132 or IVIG, poly(I:C) was injected into the mice at 200ug per
mouse intraperitoneally. Two hours later, the animals were sacrificed by C02 exposure, the
spleens were collected into RNAlater (Qiagen) and stored at -80C for later study of the
expression of Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Spleen samples were subjected to study of
the expression of ISGs, including Ifit1 (Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide
repeats 1 (UniProt Q64282)), Irf7 (Interferon regulatory factor 7 (UniProt P70434)) and Mx1
gene by qPCR. The results from these experiments demonstrate that intraperitoneal injection
of RSLV-132 results in serum concentrations of RSLV-132 which are able to bind to
circulating poly (I:C) and effectively degrade the RNA mimetic, thereby effectively
preventing stimulation of the Interferon pathway and the three ISG's monitored (Figure 17).
         Example 17. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetics for RSLV-132 and RSLV-133
[00323]      RSLV-132 and RSLV-133 were transiently expressed in CHO cells and purified
using protein-A. The RNase activity of these RNase Fc fusion proteins was quantitated using
                                                78

the RNaseAlert QC kit from Ambion (Cat # AM 1966).        Various amounts of the RNase Fc
fusion protein were used and the results shown in Figure 18 in relative fluorescence units
(RFU's) over time. The results demonstrate that RSLV-132 is a highly active RNase
enzyme, and has increased RNase activity relative to other RNase Fc fusion constructs such
as RSLV-124 and wild type RNase For example using equal amounts (400pM) of RSLV132
and RSLV-124 yields more than twice the RFU's (80,000 vs. 35,000) for RSLV-132 vs.
RSLV-124. In addition, two production lots were tested for their stability at 4C. RSLV
132.1 was stored at 4C for 8 weeks prior to this experiment and RSLV-132.2 was stored at
80C and thawed just prior to testing, demonstrating that the protein is stable at 4C for up to 2
months. The stability of the drug and increased catalytic activity may provide increased
efficacy in a therapeutic setting.
[00324]     Figure 19 shows the RNase enzymatic activity in RFUs over time, comparing the
amount of RNase activity of the bi-specific RSLV-133 molecule with the monospecific
RSLV-132, and wild type RNase. As demonstrated in Figure 19 the RSLV-133 molecule has
significantly increased RNase activity relative to the monospecific RSLV-124 molecule or,
an earlier bispecific nuclease Fc, RSLV-123, or wild type RNase, yielding greater than 2-fold
more RFU's with an equal amount of protein. Figure 20 show the results of a DNase
enzymatic activity assay of the RLSV-133 molecule in comparison to RSLV-123, a previous
bi-specific nuclease construct, and wild type DNase. In this experiment DNase enzymatic
activity was quantitated using the DNaseAlert Kit from Integrated DNA Technologies,
Cleavage of the DNA substrate yielded a fluorescent emission which was quantitated using a
Synergy2 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Figure
20 shows the RFU's of DNase enzymatic activity over time for RSLV-133, RSLV-123, or
wild type DNase. The results of the experiment demonstrate that RSLV-133 has increased
DNase activity relative to wild type DNase and RSLV-123, the earlier bi-specific nuclease
molecule, yielding more than 3-fold more DNase activity in the linear range of the
experiment. Figure 21 demonstrates the ability of the RSLV-133 molecule to digest DNA in
an in-gel digestion experiment. The results show that RSLV-133 is able to digest DNA in
this assay as effectively as wild type DNase (compare lanes 5&7). Given the relative
molecular weights of RSLV-133 and wild type DNase it appears that RSLV-133 is more
effective in digesting DNA in this assay as well.
[00325]     Example 18: RSLV-132 Demonstrates decreased Fc Receptor binding.
                                               79

[00326]     To examine the ability of RNase Fc fusion proteins to bind Fc receptors in vitro,
RSLV124 (wild type Fe domain) and RSLV-132 (mutant Fe domain; P238S/P33 IS) were
incubated with an Fe bearing human myeloid cell line, THP 1 and the specific binding to the
cells was quantitated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. RLSV-124 and
RSLV-132 were fluorescently labeled using alexa fluor dye AF-647 from Invitrogen (Cat #
A20006). After dialyzing the RNase Fe fusion proteins to remove the unbound dye, varying
amounts of the labeled proteins were incubated with THP1 cells for one hour, the cells were
washed stringently to remove unbound RNase Fe fusion protein, and the specifically bound
protein was quantitated by FACS measuring mean fluorescence intensity. The results in
Figure 22 demonstrate that the RSLV-132 protein which has a mutant Fe domain has
significantly less Fe receptor binding than RSLV-124 which has a wild type Fe domain,
exhibiting greater than 4-fold reduction in Fc receptor binding This finding is consistent with
our previous findings that RNase Fe fusion proteins with a mutant Fe domain (P238S/P33 1S)
have significantly decreased cytotoxicity.
        Example 19: In vitro assessment of hybrid nuclease molecule biological activity.
[00327]     One or more hybrid nuclease molecules are purified, e.g., by affinity or ion
exchange chromatography as previously described in the examples above. In some instances
the hybrid nuclease molecule is a polypeptide. In some instances, the hybrid nuclease
molecule includes one or more sequences from Table 1. In some instances, the hybrid
nuclease molecule includes a nuclease domain linked to a mutant Fe domain. In some
instances, the hybrid nuclease molecule includes a mutant Fe domain. In some instances, the
mutant Fe domain comprises mutations in the hinge, CH2, and/or CH3 domains. In some
instances, the mutant Fe domain comprises P238S and/or P33 IS, and may include mutations
in one or more of the three hinge cysteines. In some instances, the mutant Fe domain
comprises P238S and/or P331S, and/or mutations in the three hinge cysteines. In some
instances, the mutant Fe domain comprises P238S and/or P331S, and/or mutations in the
three hinge cysteines to SSS. In some instances, the mutant Fe domain comprises P238S and
P331S and mutations in the three hinge cysteines. In some instances, the mutant Fe domain
comprises P238S and P331S and SSS. In some instances the mutant Fe domain is shown in
SEQ ID NOs 59, 60, 61. In some instances, the hybrid nuclease molecule is shown in SEQ
ID NOs. Various linker domains (e.g., those described herein) can be used to link the Fe
domains to nuclease domains. For example, linker domains 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,

38, 39, 40 or more amino acids in length can be used. Molecules are assayed for the specific
nuclease activity in vitro using qualitative assays to verify that they possess the desired
nuclease function. Specific activities are generally then determined by fluorescence based
kinetic assays utilizing substrates such as the RNase or DNase Alert Kit reagents, and a
fluorescence plate reader set to take readings as a function of time. In addition, protein
solutions are generally checked for endotoxin contamination using a commercially available
kits, such as the Pyrotell Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) kit, 0.06 EU/ml detection limit
from Cape Cod ,Inc. (E. Palmouth, MA). Molecules are then assayed using a variety of in
vitro assays for biological activity.
[00328]     One series of in vitro assays will measure the effect of the molecules on cytokine
production by human PBMC in response to various stimuli, in the presence or absence of the
molecules in the cultures. Normal or patient human PBMC (approximately 1xOe6 cells) are
cultured for 24, 48, or 96 hours depending on the assay. PBMC are cultured in the presence
of stimuli such as TLR ligands, costimulatory antibodies, immune complexes, and normal or
autoimmune sera. The effects of the molecules on cytokine production is measured using
commercially available reagents, such as the antibody pair kits from Biolegend (San Diego,
CA) for IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-4, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha. Culture supernatants from in vitro
cultures are harvested at 24, 48 hours or later time points to determine the effects of the
molcules on cytokine production. IFN-alpha production is measured using, e.g., anti-human
IFN-alpha antibodies and standard curve reagents available from PBL interferon source
(Piscataway, NJ). A similar set of assays is performed using human lymphocyte
subpopulations (isolated monocytes, B cells, pDCs, T cells, etc.); purified using, e.g.,
commercially available magnetic bead based isolation kits available from Miltenyi Biotech
(Auburn, CA).
[00329]     In addition, the effect of the molecules on expression of lymphocyte activation
receptors such as CD5, CD23, CD69, CD80, CD86, and CD25 is assessed at various time
points after stimulation. PBMC or isolated cell subpopulations are subjected to multi-color
flow cytometry to determine how these molecules affect the expression of different receptors
associated with immune cell activation.
[00330]     Another set of assays will measure the effects of these molecules on the
proliferation of different lymphocyte subpopulations in vitro. These assays will utilize, e.g.,
CFDA-SE staining (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) of human PBMCs prior to stimulation. CFSE
at 5mM is diluted 1:3000 in PBS/0.5% BSA with 10e7-10e8 PBMCS or purified cell subsets
                                                81

and labeling reactions incubated for 3-4 minutes at 37C prior to washing several times in
RPMI/10% FBS to remove remaining CFSE. CFSE labeled cells are then incubated in co
culture reactions with various stimuli (TLR ligands, costimulatory antibodies, etc.) and the
molecules for 4 days prior to analysis of cell proliferation by flow cytometry using dye
conjugated cell subpopulation specific antibodies.
[00331]      Another assay will measure the cytotoxicity of one or more molecules. This assay
will measure toxicity using Annexin 5 staining (e.g., Annexin 5-FITC). Cells of interest
(e.g., monocytes or a monocyte cell line) are contacted with a hybrid nuclease molecule of
interest (e.g., a hybrid nuclease molecule having a mutant Fc domain) or one or more
controls. At various time points following contact, cells are separated from culture and
stained with Annexin 5. The number of apoptotic or dead cells are then counted, e.g., using
flow cytometry or a fluorescence microscope. Cells contacted with a hybrid nuclease
molecule of interest show lower numbers of cells staining positive for Annexin 5 compared
to positive controls.
[00332]      The effect of these molecules on in vitro maturation of monocytes into DCs and
macrophages is also assessed using both normal and patient PBMC samples.
[00333]      The effectiveness of a hybrid nuclease molecule is demonstrated by comparing the
results of an assay from cells treated with a hybrid nuclease molecule disclosed herein to the
results of the assay from cells treated with control formulations. After treatment, the levels of
the various markers (e.g., cytokines, cell-surface receptors, proliferation) described above are
generally improved in an effective molecule-treated group relative to the marker levels
existing prior to the treatment, or relative to the levels measured in a control group.
        Example 20: Administration of a hybrid nuclease molecule to a mammal in need
        thereof.
[00334]      Mammals (e.g., mice, rats, rodents, humans, guinea pigs) are used in the study.
Mammals are administered (e.g., intravenously) one or more hybrid nuclease molecules
comprising one or more sequences from Table 1 or a control. In some instances the hybrid
nuclease molecule is a polypeptide. In some instances, the hybrid nuclease molecule includes
one or more sequences from Table 1. In some instances, the hybrid nuclease molecule
includes a nuclease domain linked to a mutant Fc domain. In some instances, the hybrid
nuclease molecule includes a mutant Fc domain. In some instances, the mutant Fc domain
comprises mutations in the hinge, CH2, and/or CH3 domains. In some instances, the mutant
Fc domain comprises P238S and/or P33 IS, and may include mutations in one or more of the
                                                  82

three hinge cysteines. In some instances, the mutant Fe domain comprises P238S and/or
P33 IS, and/or mutations in the three hinge cysteines. In some instances, the mutant Fe
domain comprises P238S and/or P331S, and/or mutations in the three hinge cysteines to SSS.
In some instances, the mutant Fe domain comprises P238S and P331S and mutations in the
three hinge cysteines. In some instances, the mutant Fe domain comprises P238S and P331S
and SSS. In some instances the mutant Fe domain is shown in SEQ ID NOs 59, 60, 61. In
some instances, the hybrid nuclease molecule is shown in SEQ ID NOs. Various linker
domains (e.g., those described herein) can be used to link the Fe domains to nuclease
domains. For example, linker domains 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 or more
amino acids in length can be used. In some instances the hybrid nuclease molecule is
formulated a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some instances the molecule is
formulated as described in the pharmaceutical compositions section above. The hybrid
nuclease molecule targets RNase and/or DNase.
[00335]      Multiple rounds of doses are used where deemed useful. Effects on IFN-alpha
levels, IFN-alpha response gene levels, autoantibody titers, kidney function and pathology,
and/or circulating immune complex levels are monitored in the mammals. Similar studies are
performed with different treatment protocols and administration routes (e.g., intramuscular
administration, etc.). The effectiveness of a hybrid nuclease molecule is demonstrated by
comparing the IFN-alpha levels, IFN-alpha response gene levels, autoantibody titers, kidney
function and pathology, and/or circulating immune complex levels in mammals treated with a
hybrid nuclease molecule disclosed herein to mammals treated with control formulations.
[00336]      In an example, a human subject in need of treatment is selected or identified. The
subject can be in need of, e.g., reducing a cause or symptom of SLE. The identification of
the subject can occur in a clinical setting, or elsewhere, e.g., in the subject's home through
the subject's own use of a self-testing kit.
[00337]      At time zero, a suitable first dose of a hybrid nuclease molecule is administered to
the subject. The hybrid nuclease molecule is formulated as described herein. After a period
of time following the first dose, e.g., 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days, the subject's condition is
evaluated, e.g., by measuring IFN-alpha levels, IFN-alpha response gene levels, autoantibody
titers, kidney function and pathology, and/or circulating immune complex levels. Other
relevant criteria can also be measured. The number and strength of doses are adjusted
according to the subject's needs.
                                                  83

[00338]      After treatment, the subject's IFN-alpha levels, IFN-alpha response gene levels,
autoantibody titers, kidney function and pathology, and/or circulating immune complex
levels are lowered and/or improved relative to the levels existing prior to the treatment, or
relative to the levels measured in a similarly afflicted but untreated/control subject.
[00339]      In another example, a rodent subject in need of treatment is selected or identified.
The identification of the subject can occur in a laboratory setting or elsewhere.
[00340]      At time zero, a suitable first dose of a hybrid nuclease molecule is administered to
the subject. The hybrid nuclease molecule is formulated as described herein. After a period
of time following the first dose, e.g., 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days, the subject's condition is
evaluated, e.g., by measuring IFN-alpha levels, IFN-alpha response gene levels, autoantibody
titers, kidney function and pathology, and/or circulating immune complex levels. Other
relevant criteria can also be measured. The number and strength of doses are adjusted
according to the subject's needs.
[00341]      After treatment, the subject's IFN-alpha levels, IFN-alpha response gene levels,
autoantibody titers, kidney function and pathology, and/or circulating immune complex
levels are lowered and/or improved relative to the levels existing prior to the treatment, or
relative to the levels measured in a similarly afflicted but untreated/control subject.
