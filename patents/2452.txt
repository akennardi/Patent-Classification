ENDOSCOPIC ULTRASOUND FINE NEEDLE FIDUCIAL SYSTEM
BACKGROUND
[0001]    Radiation therapy is sometimes used to treat cancerous tissue within the human body.
During radiation therapy, a radiation source external to the body is aimed at the target tissue to
be treated within the body. Due to patient movement during the procedure, the radiation source
sometimes misses the target tissue and adversely affects surrounding, healthy tissue. To increase
the accuracy of the radiation source and to reduce damage to surrounding tissue, Image-Guided
Radiotherapy (IGRT) is sometimes used. In such procedures, the target tissue is marked, either
with a skin tattoo or an implantable fiducial marker, and the radiation source is directed towards
that marker.
[0002]    Typically, to implant a fiducial marker into a target tissue, a clinician will load the
fiducial marker into either the sharp end (distal end) or the back end (proximal end) of a hollow
needle, insert the needle into a delivery system such as an endoscope and manoeuvre the needle
to the target tissue, puncture the target tissue with the needle, and inject the fiducial marker into
the target tissue with a stylet. It is often desirable to implant two or more fiducial markers at
different locations within the target tissue so that the precise location of the target tissue can be
determined through triangulation techniques. Accordingly, after implanting the first fiducial
marker, the clinician typically must completely remove the needle from the delivery system,
manually reload the sharp end of the contaminated needle with a second fiducial marker, reinsert
the needle through the delivery system to reach a different location within the target tissue, and
then implant the second fiducial marker with the stylet. In some instances, the entire delivery
system is removed from the body each time a new fiducial marker is loaded into the needle. This
process is repeated until all of the fiducial markers are implanted.
[0003]    Repeatedly removing the needle from the delivery system and manually reloading each
of the fiducial markers into the needle one at a time may be difficult and cumbersome due to the
small size of the fiducial markers and may also increase the duration of the procedure and the
risk of injury to both the patient and the clinician. Alternatively, if the clinician instead loads
several fiducial markers into the back end of the needle at once, it may be difficult to push the
fiducial markers all the way through the needle with the stylet. If the clinician instead loads the
fiducial markers into the sharp end of the needle, there is an increased risk of accidental needle

                                                     2
stick and disease transmission to the clinician. In any case, when multiple fiducial markers are
loaded into the needle, it may be difficult for the clinician to controllably implant a single
fiducial marker at a time to achieve adequate spacing between each implanted fiducial marker
instead of accidently implanting multiple fiducial markers in one location within the target
tissue.
OBJECT
[0003a] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate
one or more of the above disadvantages.
SUMMARY
[0004]    The described features generally relate to one or more improved methods, systems, and
devices for implanting multiple fiducial markers into tissue. In accordance with one aspect of
the present invention, a device for implanting a plurality of fiducial markers into a tissue is
described. The device may include a needle having a proximal end, a distal end, and a lumen
extending therebetween and a stylet having a proximal end and a distal end. The distal end of
the stylet is sized to slide within the lumen of the needle. The device may also include a multi
stop stylet spacer having a plurality of stopping features configured to engage with the stylet to
stop the distal end of the stylet at a plurality of predetermined distances from the distal end of
the needle.

        actuating the multi-stop stylet spacer;

                                                       3
                         in a first position, a first stopping feature engages with the proximal hub
                and prevents distal movement of the stylet; and
                         in a second position, the first stopping feature disengages from the
                proximal hub and allows distal movement of the stylet until a second stopping
                feature engages with the proximal hub and prevents distal movement of the
                stylet.
[0004b] In accordance with another aspect, the present invention provides a system for
implanting a plurality of fiducial markers into a tissue, the system comprising:
                a handle member assembly having a proximal end, a distal end, and a lumen
extending therebetween;
                a sheath having a proximal end, a distal end, and a lumen extending
therebetween, the proximal end of the sheath being coupled with the distal end of the handle
member assembly forming a continuous lumen from the proximal end of the handle member to
the distal end of the sheath;
                a needle having a proximal end, a distal end, and a lumen extending therebetween
and being sized to advance through the continuous lumen of the handle member assembly and
the sheath;
                a plurality of fiducial markers housed within the lumen of the needle;
                a stylet having a proximal end, a distal end, and a proximal hub coupled with the
proximal end and sized to advance through the lumen of the needle; and
                a multi-stop stylet spacer having a plurality of stopping features configured to
engage with the proximal hub of the stylet and controllably deploy the plurality of fiducial
markers from the distal end of the needle, wherein:
                         the multi-stop stylet spacer is adjustable between a plurality of positions
        by actuating the multi-stop stylet spacer;
                         in a first position, a first stopping feature engages with the proximal hub
        and prevents distal movement of the stylet; and
                         in a second position, the first stopping feature disengages from the
        proximal hub and allows distal movement of the stylet until a second stopping feature
        engages with the proximal hub and prevents distal movement of the stylet.

                                                     4
[0005]    In certain embodiments, the multi-stop stylet spacer is adjustable between a plurality of
positions by actuating the multi-stop stylet spacer in a plane orthogonal to the proximal end of
the stylet. In such examples, the proximal end of the stylet may engage with a different stopping
feature in each of the plurality of positions.
[0006]    According to some examples, the multi-stop stylet spacer is adjustable between three
positions. In a first position the proximal end of the stylet may engage a first stopping feature to
stop the distal end of the stylet in a first location with respect to the distal end of the needle. In a
second position the proximal end of the stylet may engage a second stopping feature to stop the
distal end of the stylet in a second location located distal to the first location, and in a third
position the proximal end of the stylet may engage a third stopping feature to stop the distal end
of the stylet in a third location located distal to the second location.
[0007]    In some examples, the device includes a plurality of fiducial markers housed within the
lumen of the needle, wherein in the first position the first stopping feature prevents deployment
of any of the plurality of fiducial markers from the distal end of the needle and in the second
position the second stopping feature permits the deployment of a first of the plurality fiducial
markers while preventing the deployment of a second of the plurality of fiducial markers.
[0008]    The plurality of predetermined distances from the distal end of the needle may be based
on a number and a size of a plurality of fiducial markers housed within the lumen of the needle.
In certain examples, the plurality of stopping features of the multi-stop stylet spacer comprises a
plurality of ledges arranged in a stair-stepped configuration.
[0009]    Additionally or alternatively, the device may further include a plurality of fiducial
markers housed within the lumen of the needle separated by at least one fiducial marker spacer.
The fiducial markers may be textured or dogbone shaped. Moreover, the device may also
include a fiducial marker retention member coupled with the distal end of the needle. According
to certain examples, the fiducial marker retention member comprises bone wax, or a cap
configured to fit over the distal end of the needle, or one or more detents disposed within the
lumen of the needle, or any combination of these features. In some examples, the stylet is
tapered such that the distal end has a smaller diameter than the proximal end.

                                                    5
[0010]    In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a system for implanting a
plurality of fiducial markers into a tissue is described. The system may include a handle member
assembly having a proximal end, a distal end, and a lumen extending therebetween and a sheath
having a proximal end, a distal end, and a lumen extending therebetween where the proximal
end of the sheath is coupled with the distal end of the handle member assembly to form a
continuous lumen from the proximal end of the handle member to the distal end of the sheath.
The system may also include a needle having a proximal end, a distal end, and a lumen
extending therebetween and being sized to advance through the continuous lumen of the handle
member assembly and the sheath. A plurality of fiducial markers may be housed within the
lumen of the needle. In addition, the system may include a stylet having a proximal end and a
distal end and sized to advance through the lumen of the needle and
        a multi-stop stylet spacer having a plurality of stopping features configured to engage
with the stylet to controllably deploy the plurality of fiducial markers from the distal end of the
needle.
[0011]    According to certain examples of the system, a first of the plurality of stopping features
engages with the stylet to prevent the stylet from deploying any of the plurality of fiducial
markers from the distal end of the needle. In such examples, a second of the plurality of
stopping features may engage with the stylet to permit the stylet to deploy a first fiducial marker
from the distal end of the needle, and wherein a third of the plurality of stopping features
engages with the stylet to permit the stylet to deploy a second fiducial marker from the distal
end of the needle.
[0012]    In accordance with certain embodiments, the multi-stop stylet spacer of the system is
adjustable between a plurality of positions by actuating the multi-stop stylet spacer in a plane
orthogonal to the proximal end of the stylet. In such examples, the proximal end of the stylet
may engage with a different stopping feature in each of the plurality of positions.
[0013]    In a particular example, the multi-stop stylet spacer is adjustable between three
positions such that in a first position the proximal end of the stylet engages a first stopping
feature to stop the distal end of the stylet to prevent any of the plurality of fiducial markers from
being deployed from the distal end of the needle; in a second position the proximal end of the
stylet engages a second stopping feature to stop the distal end of the stylet to permit the
deployment of a first of the plurality fiducial markers while preventing the deployment of a

                                                   6
second of the plurality of fiducial markers; and in a third position the proximal end of the stylet
engages a third stopping feature to stop the distal end of the stylet to permit the deployment of
the second of the plurality of fiducial markers. According to some examples, the plurality of
stopping features of the multi-stop stylet spacer comprise a plurality of ledges arranged in a
stair-stepped configuration.
[0014]    In some examples, the system further includes at least one fiducial marker spacer
disposed between at least two of the plurality of fiducial markers. In addition, the system may
include a fiducial marker retention member coupled with the distal end of the needle. According
to certain aspects, the distal end of the handle member may be configured to couple with an
endoscope.
[0015]    In accordance with various examples, a method for implanting a plurality of fiducial
markers into a tissue is described. The method may include providing a fiducial marker
implantation device comprising a needle, a plurality of fiducial markers housed within the
needle, a stylet, and a multi-stop stylet spacer. The method may further include inserting the
needle into the tissue, adjusting the stylet spacer from a safety position to a first deployment
position, and deploying a first fiducial marker into the tissue by advancing the stylet distally
until the stylet spacer engages with and stops the stylet. In various examples, the method further
includes adjusting the stylet spacer from the first deployment position to a second deployment
position and deploying a second fiducial marker into the tissue by advancing the stylet distally.
In accordance with various examples, the multi-stop stylet spacer comprises a plurality of
stopping features that engage with and stop the stylet in each of the safety and first deployment
positions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0039]    The present disclosure is generally directed to devices, systems, and methods for
implanting multiple fiducial markers into diseased tissue in preparation for image-guided
radiotherapy (IGRT). In accordance with various examples, a device may include a needle, a
stylet, and a stylet spacer configured to facilitate the controlled deployment of multiple fiducial
markers into a tissue.
[0040]    Examples of the present disclosure are now described in detail with reference to the
drawings. As used herein, the term "clinician" refers to a doctor, nurse, or any other care
provider and may include support personnel. The term "proximal" will refer to the portion of the
device or component thereof that is closer to the clinician and the term 'distal" will refer to the
portion of the device or component thereof that is farther from the clinician.
[0041]    FIG. 1 illustrates a side view of a fiducial marker delivery device 100 in accordance
with various examples of the present disclosure. The fiducial marker delivery device 100
includes a needle 115, a stylet 120, a stylet hub 105, and a stylet spacer 110. In some examples,
the needle 115 is a Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) needle with a sharpened distal end 130 and an
internal lumen extending from the proximal end 125 to the distal end 130. The needle 115 may
be manufactured from a variety of metallic or polymeric materials including, but not limited to,
stainless steel or alloys thereof, nitinol or alloys thereof, poly-ether-ether ketone, polyamide,
polyethersulfone, polyurethane, ether block amide copolymers, polyacetal,
polytetrafluoroethylene, or derivatives thereof. The outer diameter of the needle 115 may range
from 0.020 inches (0.5 mm) to 0.050 inches (1.3 mm) and the diameter of the internal lumen
may range from 0.012 inches (0.30 mm) to 0.045 inches (1.14mm). The length of the needle 115
depends upon the particular application and may range from 19.7 inches (500 mm) to 98.4
inches (2500 mm). In some examples, the outer surface of the distal portion of the needle 115 is
roughened or otherwise treated to enhance the echogenicity or acoustic reflection of the distal
portion of the needle 115 under endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or similar visualization
techniques.

                                                   10
[0042]    The stylet 120 is generally a solid, flexible, metallic or polymeric rod configured to
advance through the lumen of the needle 115. According to some examples, the outer diameter
of the stylet 120 is continuous from the proximal end 135 to the distal end 140. In other
examples, the outer diameter of the stylet 120 is tapered such that the distal end 140 has a
smaller outer diameter than the proximal end 135. The stylet hub 105 is coupled with the
proximal end 135 of the stylet 120 and provides a clinician with the means to grip and
manoeuvre the stylet 120 through the needle 115. For example, the clinician may advance the
stylet 120 distally and proximally through the lumen of the needle 115 by pushing or pulling on
the stylet hub 105, respectively.
[0043]    The stylet spacer 110 generally facilitates the controlled advancement of the stylet 120
through the needle 115 in the distal direction illustrated by arrow 145. According to various
examples, the stylet spacer 110 includes a plurality of stopping features configured to engage
with the stylet 120 or the stylet hub 105 to stop the distal end 140 of the stylet 120 at one or
more predetermined distances from the distal end 130 of the needle 115. The stylet spacer 110
may also be adjustable between a plurality of positions that correspond to the plurality of
predetermined distances from the distal end 130 of the needle 115.
[0044]    For instance, with reference to FIG. 1, the stylet spacer 110 may be adjustable between
three positions, referred to as positions 0, 1, and 2. When the stylet spacer 110 is in position 0,
the stylet hub 105 is engaged with a first stopping feature of the stylet spacer 110 such that the
distal end 140 of the stylet 120 is stopped at a first predetermined distance from the distal end
130 of the needle 115, referred to as location 0. The stylet spacer 110 may then be adjusted to
position 1. According to various examples, the stylet spacer 110 is configured to provide tactile
feedback to the clinician so that the clinician can feel the adjustment of the stylet spacer 110
between positions 0 and 1. In position 1, the stylet spacer 110 permits the stylet 120 to advance
distally until the stylet hub 105 engages a second stopping feature of the stylet spacer 110,
stopping the distal end 140 of the stylet 120 at location 1 within the needle 115. The stylet
spacer 110 may also provide tactile feedback to the clinical once the stylet hub 105 engages with
the second stopping feature so that the clinician knows when the distal end 140 of the stylet 120
reaches location 1.
[0045]    The stylet spacer 110 may be further adjusted to position 2, which permits the stylet
120 to advance distally until the distal end 140 of the stylet 120 reaches location 2. Accordingly,

                                                  11
the stylet spacer 110 allows the clinician to controllably advance the stylet 120 distally through
the needle 115 while providing tactile feedback to the clinician once the stylet 120 reaches
certain predetermined locations within the needle 115. Although a stylet spacer 110 configured
for three positions is described, it may be appreciated that the stylet spacer 110 may be
configured for any number of positions corresponding to any number of predetermined locations
from the distal end 130 of the needle 115.
[0046]    Referring to FIG. 2, a side view of a fiducial marker delivery device 200 is illustrated
in accordance with various examples of the present disclosure. The fiducial marker delivery
device 200 includes a needle 115, a stylet 120, a stylet hub 105, and a stylet spacer 110, and may
be an example of the fiducial marker delivery device 100 described with reference to FIG. 1.
The fiducial marker delivery device 200 also includes one or more preloaded fiducial markers
205 housed within the needle 115 near the distal end 130. In general, the fiducial markers 205
are made from biocompatible materials that are visible under endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and
image-guided radio therapy (IGRT) and are magnetic resonance (MR) conditional. In some
examples, the fiducial markers 205 are gold cylinders, but other shapes and other biocompatible
and radio-opaque materials may be used.
[0047]    A device 200 with multiple preloaded fiducial markers 205 may advantageously reduce
or eliminate the need to manually load the needle 115 with the fiducial markers 205 during the
procedure, thereby reducing the duration of the procedure as well as the risks to the clinician
associated with manually loading a contaminated needle 115 with a fiducial marker 205 (e.g.,
accidental needle stick).
[0048]    In accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure, the fiducial marker
delivery device 200 also includes one or more fiducial marker spacers 210 disposed between
each of the preloaded fiducial markers 205. In general, the fiducial marker spacers 210 are
implantable-grade materials such as bioabsorbable resin, polypropylene, polylactic acid (PLA),
poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PGLA), polyamide, poly-vinyl alcohol (PVOH) or any other
similar biocompatible or bioabsorbable material or material blend. The fiducial marker spacers
210 are generally cylindrical in shape and may range in length from 0.079 inches (2 mm) to
0.393 inches (10 mm). Although two fiducial markers 205 are shown separated by a single
fiducial marker spacer 210, it may be appreciated that additional fiducial markers 205 and

                                                  12
fiducial marker spacers 210 may be used. For instance, six fiducial markers 205 may be
preloaded into the needle 115 separated by five fiducial marker spacers 210.
[0049]    As described with reference to FIG. 1, the stylet spacer 110 is configured to control the
distal advancement of the stylet 120 through the needle 115 by stopping the distal end 140 of the
stylet 120 at various locations distanced from the distal end 130 of the needle 115. When
preloaded with a plurality of fiducial markers 205, a clinician is able to selectively deploy the
fiducial makers 205 from the distal end 130 of the needle 115 by controllably advancing the
stylet 120 with the stylet spacer 110. To controllably deploy the fiducial markers 205 with the
stylet spacer 110, the predetermined locations within the needle 115 are based on the number
and size of the fiducial markers 205 and fiducial marker spacers 210 housed within the needle
115. In general, the distances from the distal end 130 of the needle 115 of the various locations
are selected such that a single fiducial marker 205 is deployed each time the stylet 120 is
advanced to a new location. For example, with reference to FIG. 2, when the stylet spacer 110 is
in position 0, the distal end 140 of the stylet 120 is stopped at location 0, which is distanced
from the distal end 130 of the needle 115 such that there is sufficient room for all of the
preloaded fiducial markers 205 and fiducial marker spacers 210. Accordingly, when in position
0, the stylet spacer 110 prevents any of the fiducial markers 205 or fiducial marker spacers 210
from being deployed. Position 0, then, may be referred to as the "safety" position and is used to
prevent inadvertent deployment of the fiducial markers 205 during shipping and handling of the
fiducial marker delivery device 200.
[0050]    When the stylet spacer 110 is adjusted to position 1, the distal end 140 of the stylet 120
may advance distally until reaching location 1. The distance of location 1 from the distal end
130 of the needle 115 may be selected such that only the distal-most fiducial marker 205 is
deployed from the needle 115. Position 1 may be referred to as a first deployed position.
Alternatively, the distance of location 1 may be selected such that both the distal-most fiducial
marker 205 and the distal-most fiducial marker spacer 210 is deployed. In either case, the stylet
spacer 110 is configured to deploy only a single fiducial marker 205 in each deployed position.
When the stylet spacer 110 is adjusted to position 2, the distal end 140 of the stylet 120 may
advance distally until reaching the location 2. The distance of location 2 from the distal end 130
of the needle 115 may be selected such that only the second fiducial marker 205 is deployed or
such that both the fiducial marker spacer 210 and the second fiducial marker 205 are deployed
(if the distal-most fiducial marker spacer 210 was not already deployed). It may be appreciated

                                                  13
that the stylet spacer 110 may be adapted for any number and size of fiducial markers 205 and
fiducial marker spacers 210 as the particular application may require.
[0051]    FIG. 3 illustrates a perspective view of a fiducial marker delivery device 300 in
accordance with various examples of the present disclosure. The fiducial marker delivery device
300 includes a handle assembly 305 and a needle assembly 355 (shown in detail in FIG. 4A).
The handle assembly 305 includes a proximal handle member 310, a middle handle member
315, and a distal handle member 320. The proximal, middle, and distal handle members 310,
315, 320 each include an inner lumen and are coupled together to form a continuous lumen
extending throughout the length of the handle assembly 305. The proximal handle member 310
is slidably disposed over at least a portion of the middle handle member 315, and, similarly, the
middle handle member 315 is slidably disposed over at least a portion of distal handle member
320. The distal handle member 320 may also include a threaded connector element 345
configured to securely attach to a working channel of an endoscope (not shown). The fiducial
marker delivery device 300 also includes a sheath 350 extending from the distal end of the distal
handle member 320 and configured to extend through the working channel of an attached
endoscope. The sheath 350 is generally made from a flexible polymeric material and provides a
continuous conduit through which a needle or other elements may travel between the handle
assembly 305 and the target tissue within the body. Accordingly, the length and diameter of the
sheath 350 depend upon the particular application.
[0052]    The needle assembly 355 (shown in detail in FIG. 4A) includes a needle 115-a and a
needle hub 360 coupled with the proximal end of the needle 115-a. The needle 115-a extends
from the needle hub 360, through the handle assembly 305, and into the sheath 350. The needle
hub 360 is configured to releasably couple with the handle assembly 305. For example, a portion
of the needle hub 360 may be inserted into the proximal end of the proximal handle member
310. A spring-loaded thumb latch 325 may retain the needle hub 306 in place. To release the
needle hub 360 from the handle assembly 305, the clinician may depress the thumb latch 325
and pull the needle hub 360 proximally. Accordingly, the needle assembly 355 may be inserted
into and removed from the handle assembly 305.
[0053]    The handle assembly 305 may include one or more adjustment features that limit the
sliding movement of the handle members 310, 315, 320 relative to each other. For instance, the
handle assembly 305 may include a locking ring 335 with a threaded thumbscrew 330 disposed

                                                  14
around the middle handle member 315. The locking ring 335 may be slid along the middle
handle member 315 and tightened in a desired position with the thumbscrew 330. When
tightened, the locking ring 335 limits the movement of the proximal handle member 310 in the
distal direction relative to the middle handle member 315, thereby allowing the clinician to
establish a set penetration depth of the needle 115-a beyond the distal end of the sheath 350.
Similarly, a thumbscrew 340 is configured to lock the position of the distal handle member 320
with respect to the middle handle member 320, thereby allowing the clinician to establish a set
extension depth of the sheath 350 beyond the distal end of an attached endoscope.
[0054]     The fiducial marker delivery device 300 also includes a stylet spacer 110-a (shown in
detail in FIG. 5), which may be an example of the stylet spacer 110 described with reference to
FIGs. 1-2. As shown, the stylet spacer 110-a may be coupled with the needle hub 360.
Alternatively, the stylet spacer 110-a may be coupled directly with the handle assembly 305.
Particular features and functions of the stylet spacer 110-a are described in detail with reference
to FIGs. 5-8.
[0055]     Referring to FIG. 4A, a side view of the needle assembly 355 and the stylet spacer 110
a is illustrated in accordance with various examples of the present disclosure. In some examples,
the stylet spacer 110-a is coupled with the needle assembly 355 and may be coupled directly to
the needle hub 360. For example, the stylet spacer 110-a may be coupled with a mounting post
405 extending from the proximal end of the needle hub 360. As described in greater detail
below, the connection between the stylet spacer 110-a and the mounting post 405 may facilitate
the stylet spacer 110-a to rotate around the mounting post 405 and to slide, actuate, or otherwise
move with respect to the mounting post 405 in a plane orthogonal to the mounting post 405.
Also shown in FIG. 4A is a stylet 120-a and a stylet hub 105-a coupled with the proximal end of
the stylet 120-a. The stylet 120-a extends from the stylet hub 105-a, through the mounting post
405, needle hub 360, and needle 115-a. FIG 4B illustrates a detailed view of the stylet 120-a
protruding from the distal end of the needle 115-a. As described in detail below, a clinician may
control the distal advancement of the stylet 120-a through the needle 115-a by selectively
engaging the stylet hub 105-a with one or more stopping features of the stylet spacer 110-a.
[0056]     With reference to FIG. 5, a perspective view of the stylet spacer 110-a is illustrated in
accordance with various examples of the present disclosure. The stylet spacer 110-a includes a
base portion 505 and an upright portion 510 extending orthogonal to the base portion 505. The

                                                   15
base portion 505 may include a channel 520 of removed material that extends through the entire
thickness of the base portion 505. In general, the channel 520 serves as a coupling or mounting
point between the stylet spacer 110-a and the needle assembly 355. For instance, the internal
walls of the channel 520 may include one or more grooved portions that generally conform to
the outer diameter of the mounting post 405 shown in FIG. 4A. Accordingly, the stylet spacer
110-a snaps into place when the mounting post 405 is within one of these grooved portions. The
snapping interface between the grooved portions of the channel 520 and the mounting post 405
provides tactile feedback to the clinician indicating as the stylet spacer 110-a is adjusted
between positions.
[0057]     In accordance with various examples, the stylet spacer 110-a includes a plurality of
stopping features configured to selectively engage with the stylet 120 or stylet hub 105. For
example, the stopping features may include one or more flat surfaces upon which the stylet hub
105 may abut to. Referring to FIG. 5, the flat surfaces may include the top surface 515 of the
base portion 505 and one or more ledges 525, 530 spaced at various distances from the base
portion 505. Although two ledges 525, 530 are illustrated, it may be appreciated that the stylet
spacer 110-a may include additional ledges as required by the particular application. The ledges
525, 530 may be arranged in a stair-step configuration as shown and may include various other
features to interface with the components of a stylet 120 or a stylet hub 105. For example, as
shown, the ledges 525, 530 may include a concave portion sized to conform to the outer
diameter of a portion of a stylet hub 105. Also, one or more of the ledges 525, 530 may include
a slot 535 sized to allow the stylet 120 to slide through.
[0058]     FIG. 6A illustrates a perspective view of the proximal portion of the fiducial marker
delivery system 300 described with reference to FIG. 3. In general, the stylet spacer 110-a
facilitates the controlled advancement of the stylet 120-a distally through the needle 115-a.
According to various examples, the stylet spacer 110-a is adjustable between several positions
and includes one or more stopping features configured to engage with the stylet 120-a or stylet
hub 105-a in each of the several positions. Moreover, each of the positions of the stylet spacer
110-a may correspond with a resting location of the distal end 140 of the stylet 120-a within the
needle 115-a. For example, with reference to FIG. 6A, the stylet spacer 110-a is illustrated in the
safety position (referred to as position 0 in FIGs. 1-2). In the safety position, the stylet hub 105-a
may abut with or otherwise engage with the ledge 530 of stylet spacer 110-a. The ledge 530

                                                   16
prevents the stylet hub 105-a and the stylet 120-a from advancing distally through the needle
115-a.
[0059]     Referring to FIG. 6B, when the stylet spacer 110-a is in the safety position, the distal
end 140 of the stylet 120-a is stopped at a first predetermined distance from the distal end 130 of
the needle 115-a referred to as location 0. Thus, when the stylet spacer 110-a is in the safety
position, none of the preloaded fiducial markers 205-a or fiducial marker spacers 210-a are
deployed.
[0060]     With reference to FIG. 7A, the stylet spacer 110-a is illustrated in a first deployed
position (referred to as position 1 in FIGs. 1-2). A clinician may adjust the stylet spacer 110-a
between the safety position illustrated in FIG. 6A, and the first deployed position illustrated in
FIG. 7A by pushing the stylet spacer 110-a in a direction illustrated by arrow 705. Because of
the fit between the grooved portions within the channel 520 and the mounting post 405, the
clinician will be able to feel the stylet spacer 110-a dislodge from the safety position and snap
into the first deployed position. This tactile feedback from the stylet spacer 110-a eliminates the
need to visualize the stylet spacer 110-a during fiducial marker deployment, thereby allowing
the clinician to continually monitor the distal end of the deployment device under EUS. As
shown, the stylet spacer 110-a slides relative to mounting post 405 in a plane orthogonal to the
mounting post 405. Once the stylet spacer 110-a has been adjusted from the safety position to
the first deployed position, the stylet hub 105-a is free to advance distally towards the needle
hub 306 until reaching a stopping feature such as ledge 525. The ledge 525 prevents the stylet
hub 105-a and the stylet 120-a from advancing distally while the stylet spacer 110-a is in first
deployed position.
[0061]     FIG. 7B illustrates the placement of the stylet 120-a within the needle 115-a when the
stylet spacer 110-a is in the first deployed position. As shown, the distal end 140 of the stylet
120-a is permitted to advance distally until reaching the location 1, which results in the
deployment of the distal-most fiducial marker 205-a. Alternatively, location 1 may be selected
such that both the distal-most fiducial marker 205-a and the fiducial marker spacer 210 are
deployed when the stylet spacer 110-a is in the first deployed position. It may be appreciated
that the distance between the ledge 530 and the ledge 525 corresponds to the distance travelled
by distal end 140 of the stylet 120-a. Accordingly, the distances between the stopping features of
the stylet spacer 110-a may be adjusted or calibrated to yield the desired distal displacement of

                                                  17
the stylet 120-a, which may be based on the number and size of fiducial markers 205-a and
fiducial marker spacers 210-a housed within the needle 115-a.
[0062]     Referring to FIG. 8A, the stylet spacer 110-a is illustrated in a second deployed
position (referred to as position 2 in FIGs. 1-2). The clinician may adjust the stylet spacer 110-a
from the first deployed position to the second deployed position by pushing the stylet spacer
110-a in a direction shown by arrow 805. The stylet spacer 110-a is configured to dislodge from
the first deployed position and snap into the second deployed position similar to the transition
from the safety to first deployed positions. In the second deployed position, the stylet hub 105-a
is free to advance distally towards the needle hub 360 until reaching a stopping feature such as
the top surface 515 of the base portion 505. Alternatively, the stopping feature may be the top
portion of the mounting post 405. In such examples, both the mounting post 405 and the stylet
hub 105-a may be threaded (e.g., a luer connection) so that the clinician can lock the stylet hub
105-a to the mounting post 405 while the stylet spacer 110-a is in the second deployed position
to ensure complete deployment of the second fiducial marker 205-a. In any case, as the stylet
120-a advances distally, it deploys the fiducial marker spacer 210-a and a second fiducial
marker 205-a from the distal end 130 of the needle 115-a as illustrated in FIG. 8B. Although the
described example was configured to deploy two preloaded fiducial markers 205-a, it may be
appreciated that the stylet spacer 110-a may be adapted to include additional stopping features
and/or additional positions such that additional preloaded fiducial markers 205-a may be
deployed.
[0063]     With reference to FIG. 9A, the distal portion of a fiducial marker delivery device 900-a
is illustrated in accordance with various examples of the present disclosure. The fiducial marker
delivery device 900-a includes a needle 115-b, a stylet 120-b, a plurality of fiducial markers
205-b, one or more fiducial marker spacers 210-b, and a fiducial marker retention member 905.
In general, the fiducial marker retention member 905 is configured to help prevent the fiducial
markers 205-b and spacers 210-b from inadvertently deploying from the needle 115-b while the
stylet spacer 110 is in the safety position. In some examples, the fiducial marker retention
member 905 is bone wax inserted into the distal end 130 of the needle 115-b. The bone wax 905
is deployed into the target tissue during deployment of the distal-most fiducial marker 205-b.
[0064]     FIG. 9B illustrates an alternative example of a fiducial marker retention member 905-a.
Fiducial marker retention member 905-a may be a cap placed over the distal end 130 of the

                                                  18
needle 115-b and configured to prevent the inadvertent deployed of the fiducial markers 205-b.
In some examples, the cap 905-a is made from a bio-compatible, dissolvable material. For
example, polyvinyl alcohol or other similar dissolvable polymers may be used. In such
examples, when the needle 115-b is inserted into the target tissue, the heat and/or moisture of
the tissue dissolves the cap 905-a, thereby allowing the deployment of the preloaded fiducial
markers 205-b. Alternatively, the cap 905-a may be removed just prior to the needle 115-b being
inserted into the target tissue.
[0065]    FIG 9C illustrates yet another alternative fiducial marker retention member 905-b in
accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure. The fiducial marker retention member
905-b includes one or more detent features extending inward from the lumen wall of the needle
115-b (as illustrated in detailed view 910). In general, the detent features 905-b are configured to
prevent the fiducial markers 205-b and/or the fiducial marker spacers 210-b from inadvertently
falling out of the distal end 130 of the needle 115-b by partially blocking the lumen of the
needle 115-b. The detent features 905-b may be formed by swaging the outside surface of the
needle 115-b, thereby creating small detent constrictions on the internal diameter of the lumen
of the needle 115-b. In other examples, additional material may be adhered or otherwise formed
onto the internal diameter of the lumen of the needle 115-b to form the one or more detent
features 905-b. The detent features 905-b may be permanently formed inside the needle 115-b.
In any case, the detent features 905-b are configured to provide an amount of frictional
resistance between the detent features 905-b and the fiducial markers 205-b and/or the fiducial
marker spacers 210-b that can be overcome by a clinician while advancing the stylet distally, but
that prevents the accidental fall out of the fiducial markers 205-b and/or the fiducial marker
spacers 210-b.
[0066]    In some examples, there may be one or more sets of two or more detent features 905-b
extending inwardly from equally-spaced radial locations within the needle 115-b. Although one
set of detent features 905-b is shown, it is envisioned that multiple sets of two or more detent
features 905-b may be added. For example, a set of two or more detent features 905-b may be
placed distal to each preloaded fiducial marker 205-b and/or each fiducial marker spacer 210-b.
Alternatively, instead of sets of two or more detents 905-b, there may be one or more discrete
detent features 905-b extending inwardly from the lumen of the needle 115-b. For example,
there may be a single-point detent feature 905-b located near the distal end 130 of the needle
115-b or there may be a single-point detent feature 905-b located distal to each fiducial marker

                                                   19
205-b and/or each fiducial marker spacer 210-b. In yet another example, a single detent feature
905-b may form an internal ridge completely circumscribing the internal diameter of the lumen
of the needle 115-b. In addition, combinations of these various types of detent features 905-b
may be used.
[0067]    FIGs. 10A-10C illustrate various examples of fiducial markers 205 according to certain
aspects of the present disclosure. As shown in FIG. 10A, a fiducial marker 205-c may be
cylindrical with a relatively smooth surface and may range in length from 0.12 inches (3 mm) to
0.79 inches (20 mm). In an alternative example illustrated in FIG. 1OB, the outer surface of the
fiducial marker 205-d may be roughened with a knurling, sandblasting, swaging, or other similar
technique. The roughened surface may increase the acoustic reflectivity and thereby enhance the
visibility of the fiducial marker 205-d under EUS. The roughened surface may also reduce
migration of the fiducial marker 205-d within the target tissue due to the increased friction
between the surface of the fiducial marker 205-d and the tissue.
[0068]    Additionally or alternatively, the profile of the fiducial marker may be non-cylindrical.
For example, as illustrated in FIG. 1OC, the fiducial marker 205-e may be dogbone-shaped,
which may reduce migration of the fiducial marker 205-c within the target tissue. The dogbone
shape of the fiducial marker 205-e also reduces the amount of potential surface area overlap
between the fiducial marker 205-e and the inner lumen of the needle 115, thereby reducing
friction and the corresponding deployment force needed to deploy the fiducial marker 205-e
from the needle 115.
[0069]    With reference to FIG. 11, a side view of a stylet assembly 1100 is illustrated in
accordance with various examples of the present disclosure. The stylet assembly 1100 may be
used with any of the fiducial marker deployment devices described with reference to FIGs. 1-3.
The stylet assembly 1100 includes a tapered stylet 120-c coupled at its proximal end with a
stylet hub 105-c. The tapered stylet 120-c includes a proximal portion 1105 with a first diameter
D1, a distal portion 1115 with a second diameter D2, and a tapered portion 1110 connecting the
proximal and distal portions. According to various examples, the diameter Dl of the proximal
portion 1105 is greater than the diameter D2 of the distal portion 1115. The tapered portion 1110
may be gradual as shown, or may be instead stepped between the Dl and D2. In general, the
larger diameter Dl of the proximal portion is configured to provide the necessary columnar
strength to push the one or more preloaded fiducial markers 205 and fiducial marker spacers 210

                                                  20
from the needle 115, whereas the smaller diameter D2 is configured to reduce the frictional
force between the distal portion 1115 of the stylet 120-c and the inside of the needle 115,
especially when the distal portion of the needle is tightly bent.
[0070]    FIG. 12 is a flow chart illustrating an example of a method 1200 for delivering or
implanting a plurality of fiducial markers into a tissue in accordance with various examples of
the present disclosure.
[0071]    At block 1205, the method 1200 may include providing a fiducial marker implantation
device, such as any of devices 100, 200, or 300, with a needle 115, a plurality of fiducial
markers 205 housed within the needle 115, a stylet 120, and a stylet spacer 110.
[0072]    At block 1210, the method 1200 may include inserting the needle 115 into the tissue.
According to certain aspects, the needle 115 may be percutaneously inserted into the tissue. In
other examples, the needle 115 is inserted through a natural opening in the body, such as into the
patient's mouth, through a fiducial marker delivery device that interfaces with an endoscope.
For example, the fiducial marker delivery device 300 described with reference to FIG. 3 may be
used.
[0073]    At block 1215, the method 1200 may include adjusting the stylet spacer 110 from a
safety position to a first deployment position. According to various examples, the stylet spacer
110 is adjusted from the safety position by pushing on the stylet spacer, as described with
reference to FIG. 7A.
[0074]    At block 1220, the method 1200 may include deploying a first fiducial marker 205 into
the tissue by advancing the stylet 120 distally until the stylet spacer 110 engages with and stops
the stylet 120.
[0075]    At block 1225, the method 1200 may include adjusting the stylet spacer 110 from the
first deployment position to a second deployment position. According to various examples, the
stylet spacer 110 is adjusted from the first deployment position to the second deployment
position by pushing on the stylet spacer, as described with reference to FIG. 8A.
[0076]    At block 1230, the method 1200 may include deploying a second fiducial marker 205
