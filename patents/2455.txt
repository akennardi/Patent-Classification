BACKGROUND
[0001] During intramedullary nailing (IM) surgery it is of importance (especially in a
freehand locking screw insertion procedure through large soft tissue coverage) to firmly fix
the locking screw to the screw driver to avoid dropping and mis-angulating the locking
screw.   Present solutions are self-holding screw drivers which suffer from insufficient
holding forces and susceptibility to deflexion caused by bending moment.
DEFINITION
[0002] In the present description and claims, the term "comprising" shall be understood to
have a broad meaning similar to the term "including" and will be understood to imply the
inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any
other integer or step or group of integers or steps. This definition also applies to variations
on the term "comprising" such as "comprise" and "comprises".
SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
[0003] According to one aspect of the disclosure there is provided a screw insertion system
comprising a screw having a leading end having a threaded shaft and a head at a trailing end.
The head has a first diameter at a free end and a second diameter at an end connected to the
threaded shaft. The first diameter being less than the second diameter. The head has an
outer surface with a plurality of external helical threads extending from the first to the second
end thereof. The head also has a drive element located within the first diameter open to the
free end of the head. A screw holder or sleeve is provided and has a through bore with a
trailing end. An interior surface at the leading end of the screw holder has a helically
threaded portion, the thread portion having a first diameter located towards the trailing end
of the holder and a second diameter at the leading end of the holder. The second diameter
is greater than the first diameter, the second diameter of the holder generally equal to the
second diameter of the bone screw head. A screw driver extends through the tubular screw
holder and is engageable with the drive element on the screw head.
[0004] According to another aspect of the disclosure there is provided a screw insertion
system including a screw having a threaded shaft and a head connected to the threaded shaft.

                                                2
The head has a conically tapered outer surface. The tapered surface increasing in distance
from a central longitudinal axis of the screw from a free end of the head towards a larger
diameter adjacent the connection between the head and the threaded shaft. The conically
tapered head outer surface has at least two helically extending partially rounded threads. The
screw head also has a recessed drive element open to the free end of the head. A tubular
screw holder is provided having an outer surface and internal bore extending between a
leading end and a trailing end for receiving the screw.      The leading end has a conically
tapered inner threaded portion for engaging the conically tapered outer thread of the screw
head. The tubular screw holder outer surface having a diameter less than the maximum
diameter of the conically tapered head.
[0005] According to yet another aspect of the disclosure there is provided a bone fastener
comprising: a threaded shaft at a leading end and a head connected to the shaft at a trailing
end; the head having a first diameter at a free end and a second diameter at an end connected
to the shaft, the second diameter being the maximum diameter of the bone fastener; and the
first diameter being less than the second diameter, the head having an outer surface extending
between the first and second diameter, the head outer surface comprising a plurality of
threads extending around the outer surface.
[0006] The screw head of the present disclosure in some aspects offers a conical or spherical
shape with an integrated external multiple, preferably triple thread (preferably a round
thread and left-handed thread) which eases the adaptation of an external sleeve with internal
thread. The external sleeve is guided/axially constrained by the screw driver shaft creating
firm connection between sleeve and screw. Due to the conical/spherical design the outer
diameter of the assembled screw head and sleeve construct does not exceed the maximum
outer diameter of screw head and can be used through existing tissue protection sleeve
systems. The transmission of the required torque remains utilizing the internal hex of the
screw solely.
[0007] Compared to the already existing solutions the design of the present disclosure offers
a more rigid connection under all loading conditions.
[0008] The present disclosure also provides in some aspects a system having a screw with a
threaded head, a tissue protection sleeve with an internal thread and a screw driver.
[0009] At the distal end of the screw is a threaded shaft having a first thread adapted to
extend through the nail and engage the bone surrounding the IM canal. At the proximal end

                                               3
of the screw, there is formed on a screw head an outer thread, which extends preferably only
a few millimeters along the screw head in the direction along the central axis of the screw.
This second thread is a different kind of a thread compared with the first thread, since the
second thread is adapted to engage with the tissue protection sleeve inner thread. To avoid
negative interdependencies like irritations or lesions, between the second outer thread and
tissue surrounding the bone, the outer contour of the windings may be flattened or rounded
so as to have a smooth contact area.
[0010] The second outer thread is adapted to be connected to an internal threaded tissue
protection sleeve, wherein, the sleeve is supported at the proximal end of the screw by means
of the second thread.
[0011] Furthermore, the proximal end of the screw includes an inner drive tool engagement
portion. This means that the screw is coupled with a driver having a corresponding driving
end. This driving end may be a hexagonal or a TORX* drive, wherein the driver may also
be a wrench. It is noted that the driver may also be driven by a power source including an
electric, pneumatic or other suitable mechanism.
[0012] The outer diameter of the second thread tapers outwardly from the central axis of the
screw on moving along the head toward the distal end of the screw including the first thread.
The second thread has a greater diameter than an outer diameter of the screw shaft.
Therefore, a step will be formed between the second thread at the proximal end and the first
thread of the shaft. According to that embodiment, the screw may further comprise a distally
facing annular surface between the second thread and the first thread shaft to provide a
smooth junction or shoulder between the head second thread and the shaft first thread.
Alternately, the distally facing surface may be formed as a part-spherical head portion with
the part-spherical surface facing the distal end of the screw.
[0013] For the case of an implantation of a screw into a bone, a set or system for installation
of the screw according to the disclosure comprises, beside the screw as described above, a
driving tool adapted to engage with the inner tool engagement portion of the screw, and a
hollow tissue protection sleeve adapted to engage with the second outer thread of the screw.
[0014] The tissue protection sleeve is a kind of a lengthening piece, which may be suitable
to facilitate the introduction of the screw into a bone, wherein muscles or other tissue
surrounding the bone will complicate the attachment of an augmentation tool directly at the
proximal end of the screw.

                                               4
[0015] With two separate elements, i.e. the sleeve and the driver, each engaging directly at
the proximal (head) end of the screw, it is possible to apply forces indifferent directions
precisely onto the screw, so that the screw may be positioned accurately at an appropriate
site. With the driver, forces in circumferential direction may be applied to screw in (or out
for explanation) the screw. With the sleeve, forces in an axial or a radial direction may be
applied to the screw. As another advantage, the screw may be held in place by the screw
driver while the tissue protection sleeve is loosened and removed from the proximal end of
the screw.
[0016] The screw head preferably has a conical outer shape between the first and second
diameter of the head, and the threaded portion of the interior surface of the screw holder
threaded portion has a matching conical shape. The screw head may have a part-spherical
distally facing outer shape between the first and second diameters of the head.
[0017] The external threads of the head and the interior threads of the screw holder
preferably are at least partially rounded threads. The at least partially rounded threads have
rounded roots and flattened crests. Preferably the threads on the head and on the screw
holder are left-handed threads.
[0018] The screw driver has an outer diameter small enough to be received within the bore
of the screw holder preferably with a close fit. Preferably the outer diameter of the screw
holder does not exceed the second diameter of the screw head so that a smooth transition is
formed. The drive element of the bone screw head may be an internal hex drive. The conical
outer shape of the head preferably has an opening angle of about 20'. A screw driver may
be provided extending through the base in the tubular screw holder for engaging the recessed
drive element in the screw head. Preferably, the threads on the head and on the screw holder
are left-handed threads.
[0019] The system of the present invention includes a bone fastener. Preferably the bone
fastener has a shaft at a leading end and a head connected to the shaft at a trailing end. The
head having a first diameter at a free end and a second diameter at an end connected to the
shaft. The first diameter is less than the second diameter with, the head having an outer
surface extending between the first and second diameter. The head outer surface comprising
a plurality of helical threads extending around the outer surface.

                                                5
[0020] Preferably each thread has curved flanks and a curved root intermediate the curved
flanks with the threads having a flat crest on the outer surface of the head extending between
adjacent curved flanks forming the thread.
[0021] The bone fastener shaft has a threaded portion at the leading end and the head outer
surface has a conical shape. The conical shape of the head preferably has an opening angle
of 180 to 220. Preferably the threads on the head are left-hand threads, and are double or
triple lead threads.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0032] Referring to Figure 1 there is shown the screw insertion system of the present
disclosure generally denoted as 10. The screw insertion system includes a screw 12, a sleeve
or holder 14 for connecting to screw 12, and a driver 16 with shaft 17. In the preferred
embodiment screw 12 is a bone screw, and sleeve 14 is a tissue protection sleeve used for
inserting the threaded screw into a bone plate or bone nail (not shown). Driver 16 can be

                                                6
any standard screw driver having a leading distal end with a standard screw drive 18, such
as a hex drive or a Torx® drive. Drive 18 is adapted to engage a socket or recess 20 in a head
22 of screw 12. Preferably screw 12 has a head 22 with threads 23 and a threaded shaft 25.
Head 32 is adapted engage the threads 26 of internal surface 24 at a distal end of tissue
protection sleeve 14. Threads 23 taper inwardly on moving away in a proximal direction
from the bone screw threads on shaft 25.
[0033] Referring to Figure 1A there is an enlarged view of the engagement between tissue
protection sleeve 14, screw head 22, driver 16 and socket 20. It can be seen from Figure IA
that the distal end 24 of sleeve 14 includes a plurality of threads along a threaded inner
diameter 26. At the distal end 24 inner diameter threads 26 taper outwardly from central
axis 28 of the bone screw sleeve 14 preferably in a conical manner. The distal threaded
distal end inner surface 24 of sleeve 14 preferably includes flat root areas 30 and flat crests
31 along the outwardly tapered surface of inner surface 26 of sleeve 14. Screw head 22 has
rounded roots 33 and flat crests 35. The outer diameter 27 at the leading end of the sleeve
is substantially equal to the largest thread diameter of head 22 which is located adjacent to
shaft 25. While the diameters do not have to be exactly equal a large step is to be avoided
so that surrounding tissue is not irritated during insertion.
[0034] Referring to Figures 2 and 2A, there is shown bone screw 12 with head 22 and shaft
25 with threads 32. The threads 32 of bone screw 12 include a helical thread adapted to
engage bone and may or may not have a self-drilling feature 34 adjacent a distal tip 36. The
threads 32 of bone screw 12 may be any typical threads used for bone screws. A transition
area 37 extends between the head 22 and shaft 25.
[0035] Sleeve 14 has an inner diameter 52 which receives an outer surface of driver shaft
17. These surfaces may be a close fit to permit sliding engagement.
[0036] Referring to Figure 3, there is shown an enlarged view of head 22 which tapers
outwardly from central axis 28 at an angle a. Angle a is preferably 9 to 100 thus making the
cone angle of the tapering head 18 to 200. The head 22 includes helical thread 40 which
preferably has an arcuate root-shape 33 separated by a flattened crest 35 as best shown in
Figure IA. The root 33 may have a circular shape of, for example, a radius of 0.6 to 0.8mm.
The threaded depth from the crest 35 to the bottom of the root 33 may be, for example,
.14mm.    The threads are preferably a double or triple lead thread, and are left-handed,

                                                7
whereas, the threads of the bone screw shaft are right-handed. As shown in Figure 3, the
head has an annular surface 48 facing the distal end of the screw (i.e. towards tip 36).
[0037] Referring to Figures 4 and 5, there is shown a cross-section of bone screw 12
including the bone screw shaft 25 and in particular head 22, which includes a hex socket 20
for receiving the drive end 18 of the screw driver 16. Figure 5 shows the flat sides 42 of hex
socket 20. Socket 20, as shown, is adapted to receive a standard hex drive from an Allen
wrench or screw driver. A TORX* drive or other polygonal drive could be used.
[0038] Referring to Figures 6 and 7 there is shown tissue protection sleeve 14 including
threaded distal end 24 including threaded inner diameter 26, which tapers outwardly from
centerline 28. Threaded diameter 26 tapers outwardly at the same angle that screw threads
23 are tapered inwardly towards the head free end i.e., for example, 10'. Thus, the entire
distal opening of the sleeve tapers outwardly on moving distally at an included angle of 200.
In order to more easily engage and disengage from head 22 of screw 12, the threads 26, as
shown in Figure IA, have flat crests and flat roots. The crests are spaced such that they
engage the deepest root area of circular or arcuate threads 33. These thread shapes produce
less friction so that the tissue protection sleeve may be more easily removed from the head
of the screw after implantation.
[0039] Referring to Figure 3, in the preferred embodiment, head 22 includes a distally facing
surface 37 which in Figure 4 is annular planar surface 48. Surface 48 may be connected to
screw shaft 25 by an arcuate portion 50 which, in the preferred embodiment, is concave.
However, this connection portion 50 could be convex and have a part-spherical shape around
the entire circumference of the junction between shaft 25 and screw head 22. This would
allow for polyaxial movement of the screw as, for example, when implanted in a bone plate
(not shown).
[0040] In use the surgeon threadably couples the sleeve or screw holder 14 to the head of 22
of screw 52 so that the outer diameter 27 is flush or nearly flush with the largest thread
diameter of head 22. The surgeon then inserts the driver 16 through sleeve 14 into the drive
18 of screw 12. Screw 12 is then inserted into the bone. The sleeve 14 can be removed by
rotating an exposed end of sleeve 14 in the direction of screw rotation because of the opposite
left and right threads on the bone screw head 22 and shaft 25.
[0041] The sleeve may have a smaller outer diameter (GD), for example 7 mm and have
markings near the grip which indicate when to stop turning, it may also have slotted

                                               8
structures to allow for "gripping" even when screws are inserted in a non-axial fashion. In
other words, the distal end of sleeve 14 can flex slightly when the screw axis is angled with
respect to the sleeve axis.    Such structures are shown in U.S. Patent No. 6,337,142, the
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.       Such a structure is shown in
Figures 8A and 8B which has a plurality of slots 200 spaced around the circumference of the
tissue protection sleeve.
[0042] The sleeve may have a larger OD, for example 9mm. The reason for the larger
diameter of 9mm is that especially for axially stable screws such a larger diameter increases
the contact area between the tool tip and screw head which respectively improves the tactile
sensation for the operator. This is important as the operator needs to know and feel when to
stop turning (when the screw head hits the bone surface). With the larger diameter the sleeve
distal end will be larger than the screw head diameter by I to 2mm.
[0043] Although the disclosure herein has been described with reference to particular
embodiments, it is to be understood that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the
principles and applications of the present disclosure. It is therefore to be understood that
numerous modifications may be made to the illustrative embodiments and that other
arrangements may be devised without departing from the spirit and scope of the present
disclosure as defined by the appended claims.
