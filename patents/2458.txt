                  PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS
        This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2013209862, the
entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                        TECHNICAL FIELD
        [0001]    The present inventions relate generally to compositions, kits and methods for the
reduction of cellular proliferation as, for example, in the treatment of cancer.
                                          BACKGROUND
        [0002]    According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology
and End Results (SEER) database for the year 2008, the most recent year for which incidence
data are available, 11,958,000 Americans have invasive cancers. Cancer is the second most
common cause of death in the United States, behind only heart disease, and accounts for one in
four deaths. It has been estimated that approximately 1600 Americans die of cancer each day.
In addition to the medical, emotional and psychological costs of cancer, cancer has significant
financial costs to both the individual and society. It is estimated by the National Institutes of
Health that the overall costs of cancer in 2010 was $263.8 billion. In addition, it is estimated that
another $140.1 billion is lost in productivity due to premature death.
        [0003]    Cancer treatments today include surgery, hormone therapy, radiation,
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and combinations thereof. Surgical removal of
cancer has advanced significantly; however, there remains a high chance of recurrence of the
disease. Hormone therapy using drugs such as aromatase inhibitors and luteinizing hormone
releasing hormone analogs and inhibitors has been relatively effective in treating prostate and
                                              -1 -

 WO 2013/109610                                                               PCT/US2013/021714
breast cancers. Radiation and the related techniques of conformal proton beam radiation therapy,
stereotactic radiosurgery, stereotactic radiation therapy, intraoperative radiation therapy,
chemical modifiers, and radio sensitizers are effective at killing cancerous cells, but can also kill
and alter surrounding normal tissue. Chemotherapy drugs such as aminopterin, cisplatin,
methotrexate, doxorubicin, daunorubicin and others alone and in combinations are effective at
killing cancer cells, often by altering the DNA replication process. Biological response modifier
(BRM) therapy, biologic therapy, biotherapy, or immunotherapy alter cancer cell growth or
influence the natural immune response, and involve administering biologic agents to a patient
such as an interferons, interleukins, and other cytokines and antibodies such as rituximab and
trastuzumab and even cancer vaccines such as Sipuleucel-T.
         [0005]   Recently, new targeted therapies have been developed to fight cancer. These
targeted therapies differ from chemotherapy because chemotherapy works by killing both
cancerous and normal cells, with greater effects on the cancerous cells. Targeted therapies work
by influencing the processes that control growth, division, and the spread of cancer cells and
signals that cause cancer cells to die naturally. One type of targeted therapy includes growth
signal inhibitors such as trastuzumab, gefitinib, imatinib, centuximab, dasatinib and nilotinib.
Another type of targeted therapy includes angiogenesis inhibitors such as bevacizumab that
inhibit cancers from increasing surrounding vasculature and blood supply. A final type of
targeted therapy includes apoptosis-inducing drugs that are able to induce direct cancer cell
death.
         [0006]   Although all of these treatments have been effective to one degree or another,
they all have drawbacks and limitations. In addition to many of the treatments being expensive,
they also are often too imprecise or the cancers are able to adapt to them and become resistant.
         [0007]   Thus, there is a great need for additional cancer treatments. In particular, there
is a need for treatments for cancers that have become resistant to other forms of treatment.
                                             SUMMARY
         [0008]   The present invention provides compositions, combination therapies, kits, and

             DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS
         [0009]   The present subject matter may be understood more readily by reference to the
following detailed description which forms a part of this disclosure. It is to be understood that
this invention is not limited to the specific products, methods, conditions or parameters described
and/or shown herein, and that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing
particular embodiments by way of example only and is not intended to be limiting of the claimed
invention.
         [0010]   Unless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terms used in
connection with the present application shall have the meanings that are commonly understood
by those of ordinary skill in the art. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms
shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular.
         [0011]   As employed above and throughout the disclosure, the following terms and
abbreviations, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings.
         [0012]   In the present disclosure the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include the
plural reference, and reference to a particular numerical value includes at least that particular
value, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Thus, for example, a reference to "a
compound" is a reference to one or more of such compounds and equivalents thereof known to
those skilled in the art, and so forth. The term "plurality", as used herein, means more than one.
When a range of values is expressed, another embodiment incudes from the one particular and/or
to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of
the antecedent "about," it is understood that the particular value forms another embodiment. All
ranges are inclusive and combinable.
         [0013]   As used herein, the terms "component," "composition," "composition of
compounds," "compound," "drug," "pharmacologically active agent," "active agent,"
                                                  -3 -

 WO 2013/109610                                                                 PCT/US2013/021714
"therapeutic," "therapy," "treatment," or "medicament" are used interchangeably herein to refer
to a compound or compounds or composition of matter which, when administered to a subject
(human or animal) induces a desired pharmacological and/or physiologic effect by local and/or
systemic action.
         [0014]    As used herein, the terms "treatment" or "therapy" (as well as different forms
thereof) include preventative (e.g., prophylactic), curative or palliative treatment. As used
herein, the term "treating" includes alleviating or reducing at least one adverse or negative effect
or symptom of a condition, disease or disorder. This condition, disease or disorder can be
cancer.
         [0015]    As employed above and throughout the disclosure the term "effective amount"
refers to an amount effective, at dosages, and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the
desired result with respect to the treatment of the relevant disorder, condition, or side effect. It
will be appreciated that the effective amount of components of the present invention will vary
from patient to patient not only with the particular compound, component or composition
selected, the route of administration, and the ability of the components to elicit a desired result in
the individual, but also with factors such as the disease state or severity of the condition to be
alleviated, hormone levels, age, sex, weight of the individual, the state of being of the patient,
and the severity of the pathological condition being treated, concurrent medication or special
diets then being followed by the particular patient, and other factors which those skilled in the art
will recognize, with the appropriate dosage being at the discretion of the attending physician.
Dosage regimes may be adjusted to provide the improved therapeutic response. An effective
amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the components are outweighed
by the therapeutically beneficial effects.
         [0016]     "Pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to those compounds, materials,
compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment,
suitable for contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity,
irritation, allergic response, or other problem complications commensurate with a reasonable
benefit/risk ratio.
         [0017]    Within the present invention, the disclosed compounds may be prepared in the
form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. "Pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refer to
derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making
acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not
limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts
                                                 -4-

 WO 2013/109610                                                                PCT/US2013/021714
of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts
include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent
compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such
conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric,
hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like; and the salts prepared from
organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric,
ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2
acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic,
and the like. These physiologically acceptable salts are prepared by methods known in the art,
e.g., by dissolving the free amine bases with an excess of the acid in aqueous alcohol, or
neutralizing a free carboxylic acid with an alkali metal base such as a hydroxide, or with an
amine.
         [0018]   Compounds described herein can be prepared in alternate forms. For example,
many amino-containing compounds can be used or prepared as an acid addition salt. Often such
salts improve isolation and handling properties of the compound. For example, depending on the
reagents, reaction conditions and the like, compounds as described herein can be used or
prepared, for example, as their hydrochloride or tosylate salts. Isomorphic crystalline forms, all
chiral and racemic forms, N-oxide, hydrates, solvates, and acid salt hydrates, are also
contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.
         [0019]   Certain acidic or basic compounds of the present invention may exist as
zwitterions. All forms of the compounds, including free acid, free base and zwitterions, are
contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention. It is well known in the art that
compounds containing both amino and carboxy groups often exist in equilibrium with their
zwitterionic forms. Thus, any of the compounds described herein that contain, for example, both
amino and carboxy groups, also include reference to their corresponding zwitterions.
         [0020]   The term "stereoisomers" refers to compounds that have identical chemical
constitution, but differ as regards the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.
         [0021]   The term "administering" means either directly administering a compound or
composition of the present invention, or administering a prodrug, derivative or analog which will
form an equivalent amount of the active compound or substance within the body.
         [0022]   The terms "subject," "individual," and "patient" are used interchangeably
herein, and refer to an animal, for example a human, to whom treatment, including prophylactic
treatment, with the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention, is provided.

The term "subject" as used herein refers to human and non-human animals. The terms "non
human animals" and "non-human mammals" are used interchangeably herein and include all
vertebrates, e.g., mammals, such as non-human primates, (particularly higher primates), sheep,
dog, rodent, (e.g. mouse or rat), guinea pig, goat, pig, cat, rabbits, cows, horses and non
mammals such as reptiles, amphibians, chickens, and turkeys.
         [0023]    The term "inhibitor" as used herein includes compounds that inhibit the
expression or activity of a protein, polypeptide or enzyme and does not necessarily mean
complete inhibition of expression and/or activity. Rather, the inhibition includes inhibition of
the expression and/or activity of a protein, polypeptide or enzyme to an extent, and for a time,
sufficient to produce the desired effect.
         [0024]    The term "promoter" as used herein includes compounds that promote the
expression or activity of a protein, polypeptide or enzyme and does not necessarily mean
complete promotion of expression and/or activity. Rather, the promotion includes promotion of
the expression and/or activity of a protein, polypeptide or enzyme to an extent, and for a time,
sufficient to produce the desired effect.
         [0025]    In one embodiment, the present invention provides combination therapies that
alter the defenses of cancerous cells to oxidative stress. One class of such therapies increases
free radical availability to cancerous cells. A representative subclass of such therapies involves
administration of pharmaceutical compositions comprising a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor,
melanin or a melanin promoter, a p450 3A4 promoter, a leucine aminopeptidase inhibitor, and,
optionally, a growth hormone inhibitor. Another subclass involves administration of
pharmaceutical compositions comprising melanin and either a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor.
Particular components of the pharmaceutical composition are described below.
         [0026]    While not intending to be bound by any particular mechanism of operation,
tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitors according to the present invention function by accumulating in
cancer cells and preventing them from forming a coating of either lipids or hyaluronan. By
preventing the cancer cells from forming a coating of either lipids or hyaluron, the cancer cells
are believed to be made more accessible to oxidative stress. Representative tyrosine hydroxylase
inhibitors include tyrosine derivatives, which typically are rapidly absorbed by most cancers and
inflamed tissues. Representative tyrosine derivatives include one or more of methyl (2R)-2
amino-3-(2-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl) propanoate, D-tyrosine ethyl ester hydrochloride, methyl
(2R)-2- amino-3-(2,6-dichloro-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) propanoate H-D-Tyr(TBU)-allyl ester HCl,

Boc-Tyr (3,5-1 2)-OSu, Fmoc-tyr(3-NO 2)-OH, and a-methyl-DL-tyrosine (also known as DL-2
Methyl-3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl) alanine).
         [0027]   The present invention involves the use of at least one of melanin, a melanin
promoter, or a combination thereof. Thus, melanin can be used, one or more melanin promoters
can be used, and both melanin and one or more melanin promoters can be used (either in separate
dosage forms or in the same dosage form). Melanin promoters according to the present
invention are chemical compounds that increase the production and/or the activity of melanin.
Increased melanin levels are believed to reduce inflammation (through, for example, suppression
of TNF) and exclude the sequestered lymph system. Melanin is a photo catalyst, and can
therefore promote chemical reactions that generate free radicals which, in turn, can become
accessible to cancer cells. Representative melanin promoters are methoxsalen and melanotan II.
         [0028]   In some instances, the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor is mixed with melanin in
the same dosage form. This association of melanin with the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor is
believed to facilitate uptake of melanin in cancer cells because tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitors
are more readily taken up by such cells. In certain embodiments melanin is solubilized in a
solubilizing agent and then mixed with the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor by methods known in
the art. The solubilizing agent may be removed by standard techniques, such as evaporation,
drying, etc. The solubilizing agent may be a non-toxic solubilizing agent, such as hydrogen
peroxide or other solubilizing agents commonly known in the art. The melanin and/or the
                                                 -7-

pharmaceutical composition may be further processed to optimize the pharmaceutical
composition's effect on cancer cells. In another embodiment the pharmaceutical composition
may include additional active agents and/or pharmaceutical excipients.
         [0029]   The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention also include a p450 3A4
promoter. "Cytochrome p450 3A4" (which can be abbreviated as "p450 3A4") is a member of
the cytochrome p450 superfamily of enzymes, and is a mixed-function oxidase that is involved
in the metabolism of xenobiotics in the body. It has the widest range of substrates of all of the
cytochromes. The function of a p450 3A4 promoter in the pharmaceutical compositions of the
invention is to increase the expression and/or the activity of p450 3A4. The increased p450 3A4
expression and/or activity is believed to reduce cortisone and estrogen levels in the patient.
Additionally, the increased p450 3A4 expression and/or activity also slightly decreases blood
pH, which is believed to help to preserve or enhance melanin activity. Representative p450 3A4
promoters are 5,5-diphenylhydantoin (sold commercially as, for example, Dilantin), valproic
acid, and carbamazepine, which are believed to induce expression of the p450 3A4 enzyme.
         [0030]   The instant pharmaceutical compositions further include leucine aminopeptidase
inhibitors (alternatively known as leucyl aminopeptidase inhibitors). Leucine aminopeptidases
are enzymes that preferentially catalyze the hydrolysis of leucine residues at the N-terminus of
peptides and/or proteins. Inhibiting the expression and/or activity of leucine aminopeptidases is
believed to assist in tumor reabsorption by increasing cholesterol transport to the liver.
Generally, it is believed that aminopeptidase inhibitors, including aminopeptidase inhibitors,
deplete sensitive tumor cells of specific amino acids by preventing protein recycling, thus
generating an antiproliferative effect. Representative leucine aminopeptidase inhibitors are N
[(2S,3R)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyryl]-L-leucine, and rapamycin.
         [0031]   The instant pharmaceutical compositions also optionally include a growth
hormone inhibitor. Growth hormone (such as, for example, pancreatic growth hormone) induces
cell replication. Inhibition of the expression and/or activity of growth hormone is believed to
exclude normal cells from rapid replication while allowing cancer cells to continue to rapidly
replicate and incorporate the tyrosine derivative. Representative growth hormone inhibitors are
octreotide, somatostatin, and seglitide.
         [0032]   The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can further include D-leucine.
D-leucine is a stereoisomer of the naturally occurring L-leucine, the form of leucine incorporated
into polypeptides and proteins. D-leucine cannot be incorporated into polypeptides and/or
proteins. Along with the leucine aminopeptidase inhibitor, the D-leucine is believed to create a
                                                -8-

 WO 2013/109610                                                                PCT/US2013/021714
physiological environment that mimics a leucine shortage. Thus, the presence of D-leucine
permits the use of lower doses of leucine aminopeptidase inhibitor in a pharmaceutical
composition.
         [0033]   Also provided herein are kits including a combination therapy that creates
alterations in the defenses of cancerous cells to oxidative stress. An intended suitable
embodiment is a kit that includes a combination therapy that increases free radical availability to
cancerous cells. Representative kits comprise a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, melanin and/or a
melanin promoter, a p450 3A4 promoter, a leucine aminopeptidase inhibitor and, optionally, a
growth hormone inhibitor of the type described above, together with packaging for same. The
kit can include one or more separate containers, dividers or compartments and, optionally,
informational material such as instructions for administration. For example, each inhibitor or
promoter (or the various combinations thereof) can be contained in a bottle, vial, or syringe, and
the informational material can be contained in a plastic sleeve or packet or provided in a label.
In some embodiments, the kit includes a plurality (e.g., a pack) of individual containers, each
containing one or more unit dosage forms of a compound described herein. For example, the kit
can include a plurality of syringes, ampules, foil packets, or blister packs, each containing a
single unit dose of a compound described herein or any of the various combinations thereof. The
containers of the kits can be air tight, waterproof (e.g., impermeable to changes in moisture or
evaporation), and/or light-tight. The kit optionally includes a device suitable for administration
of the composition, e.g., a syringe, inhalant, pipette, forceps, measured spoon, dropper (e.g., eye
dropper), swab (e.g., a cotton swab or wooden swab), or any such delivery device.
         [0034]   Methods of treating cancer in a subject also are provided, as are methods of
reducing undue cellular proliferation. Such methods can include administering an effective
amount of a combination therapy that creates alterations in the defenses of cancerous cells to
oxidative stress. Representative methods of treating cancer include administering an effective
amount of a combination therapy that increases free radical availability to cancerous cells.
Suitable embodiments are methods that include administering an effective amount of the above
noted tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, melanin and/or melanin promoter, p450 3A4 promoter,
leucine aminopeptidase inhibitor and, optionally, growth hormone inhibitor. Other suitable
methods include administering an effective amount of melanin and a tyrosine hydroxylase
inhibitor.
         [0035]   Suitable methods include simultaneous or at least contemporaneous
administration of at least two of the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, melanin or a melanin
                                                 -9-

 WO 2013/109610                                                               PCT/US2013/021714
promoter, p450 3A4 promoter, and leucine aminopeptidase inhibitor, at least three of them, or
each of them (in each case, optionally, with a growth hormone inhibitor). It is believed to be
desirable that an effective concentration of these moieties be in the subject's bloodstream at the
same time, and any dosing regimen that achieves this is within the scope of the present invention.
The desired number of inhibitors and promoters can be provided in a single dosage form or any

aminopeptidase inhibitor (i.e., rapamycin). These compounds were administered on each of five
days per week for a period of six weeks, with one or two days off between weekly cycles.
         [0056]    After six weeks of treatment, 12 of the 30 patients (40%) maintained the same
rating under the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-5 scale (see Oken, et al.,
Toxicity And Response Criteria Of The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, Am. J. Clin.
Oncol., 5:649-655, 1982). Fourteen (14) of 30 (46%) had 1-3 point improvement in their ECOG
rating.
         [0057]    Fourteen (14) of the 30 patients ( 4 6 %) maintained the same rating under the
European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire
Core (EORTC) 1-7 scale (see, e.g., Bergman, et al., The EORTC QLQ-LC13: a modular
supplement to the EORTC Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) for use in lung cancer
clinical trials, EORTC Study Group on Quality of Life, Eur. J. Cancer, 1994. 30A(5): p. 635-42).
Sixteen (16) of 30 (54%) had 1-5 point improvement in their EORTC rating.
         [0058]    Eleven (11) of the 30 patients gained weight of I to 9 pounds, 17 of 30 stayed
the same weight, and 2 of 30 lost 1 to 2 pounds.
         [0059]    Thirteen (13) of 30 (43%) had a reduction in pain levels. Seventeen (17) of 30
(57%) entered with minimal pain and maintained the same level. Nine (9) of 30 (30%) entered
the study on pain medication and 8 of those nine (89%) no longer needed pain medication at the
end of the cycle.
         [0060]    No disease was detected in four (4) of 30 (13%) with normal physical exam,
review of systems, and imaging. Eight (8) of 30 (27%) had significant reduction in quantity of
tumors and/or size of the largest tumor. Eight (8) of 30 (27%) exhibited reduction in quantity of
tumors and/or size of the largest tumor. Ten (10) of 30 (33%) showed no progression of disease.
         [0061]    Twenty nine (29) of the 30 patients were alive with median survival of 22
weeks. Thirteen (13) of 30 (43%) were released and went home. Seventeen (17) of 30 (57%)
continue with the treatment. All of the subjects developed hyperpigmentation.
         [0062]    Overall, the above-noted treatment was well tolerated by the subjects, with no
adverse events related to the treatment, and responses have been documented to the treatment
100%.
EXAMPLE 2
         [0063]    In one aspect, the present invention provides methods of inducing melanin
production in vivo with one or both of methoxsalen and melanotan and/or through administration
                                                 - 20 -

 WO 2013/109610                                                                 PCT/US2013/021714
of melanin. Without intending to be bound by any particular theory of operation, melanin is
believed to be beneficial because of its photocatalytic nature and its ability to convert various
wavelengths of ambient or induced electromagnetic radiation into electrical energy, thus
potentiating desirable reactions or dislocations. In some patients, either because of genetic
variation, infirmity, necessity of expedited availability, or to realize maximum effectiveness, it
has been determined that melanin preferably is combined mechanically or chemically with a
methyl-DL-tyrosine prior to administration.
         [0064]     Melanin as a photocatalyst is believed to have polarity at points in its physical
mass. It has been determined that small melanin particles may produce less electrical energy
than larger particles, and a plurality of melanin particles tend not to accumulate in polarity
specific formations. An effective method to obtain high yield of electrical energy from melanin
is to form the melanin in large, polarized particles. By implication, it is believed that
nanoparticles, regardless of quantity, are not as desirable as larger particles for cancer treatment,
and that larger particles have a greater capacity to be accepted by cancer cell membranes.
         [0065]     In accordance with certain embodiments, melanin is combined with a-methyl
DL-tyrosine in at least three ways.
                  [0066]    1)   Melanin, either naturally occurring or synthetic, is mechanically
         mixed with compressive force to adhere the melanin, which is non-water soluble and
         somewhat malleable, with the a-methyl-DL-tyrosine. Following the initial combining of
         these components, it is desirable to add additional a-methyl-DL-tyrosine until substantial
         coverage of the melanin is achieved.
                  [0067]   2)    Melanin can be solubilized by many methods as described in U.S.
         Patent No. 5,225,435, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. One
         preferred method involves mixing melanin with distilled water and hydrogen peroxide to
         achieve a melanin concentration of at least 5 weight percent, and then placing the
         resulting composition in a microwave oven until it reaches a boiling point. The dissolved
         melanin that is produced is used to infuse or saturate through the mass of a-methyl-DL
         tyrosine. The composition is then dried and the dry powder is used.
                  [0068]   3)    a-Methyl-DL-tyrosine is placed in distilled water with 5
         benzyloxy-6-methoxy-indole and sealed for up to a month. The L portion of the racemic
         a-methyl-DL-tyrosine is believed to convert to (DOPA) melanin. The size of the melanin
         particle can be controlled by controlling the time of growth period. The powder
         produced is then cleaned and dried. The ratio of the racemic mix is no longer 50/50, but
                                                  -21-

the utility of the chemically combined ingredients facilitates penetration of the melanin
even with reduced L component and appears to offer potentially sufficient benefit.
