     Description of related art
     Ground foundations of this kind are well known in the art. These are
     sometimes called ground anchors. They are often used for supporting poles
20   for signs or lights. In recent years, ground foundations of this kind have also
     often been used for supporting noise absorbing fences, for example along
     motor ways. Other applications of ground foundations are also known in the
     art.
25   A good example of one such prior art ground foundation is the one disclosed
     in EP 1613821. In this document a ground anchor is disclosed which is first
     driven into the ground, then the position of the supported element is adjusted
     by loosening the bolt in the middle of the assembly, positioning the
     supporting plate and then tightening the screw. The prior art solution however
30   has a number of drawbacks.

     Summary of the invention
     It is therefore a first object of the invention to provide a ground foundation
     element which is better than the prior art.
 5
     A second object of the invention is to provide a ground foundation assembly
     which is better than the prior art.
     This is provided via the features of the characterizing portion of claim 1.
10   Additional beneficial features are provided in the dependent claims.
     It should be emphasized that the term "comprises/comprising/comprised of"
     when used in this specification is taken to specify the presence of stated
     features, integers, steps or components but does not preclude the presence
15   or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, components or
     groups thereof. For example in the claims it is stated that the ground
     foundation comprises a first track and a second track, however, this should
     also include ground foundations with more than two tracks. For example,
     three tracks or four tracks would also be included as would more than four.
20   Another example is that in the claims it is stated that the fastening elements
     have two positions, a locked position and an unlocked position, however,
     fastening elements having more than two positions should also be included.
     For example a fastening element comprising a nut and a bolt would comprise
     a large number of positions.

     In the following, the invention will be described in greater detail with
     reference to embodiments shown by the enclosed figures. It should be
     emphasized that the embodiments shown are used for example purposes
     only and should not be used to limit the scope of the invention.

     Detailed description of the embodiments
     Figures 1-11 all show one particular embodiment 1 of a ground foundation
10   assembly according to the invention. It should however be clear to the person
     skilled in the art, that the ground foundation assembly can be arranged and
     designed in many different ways while still following the general inventive
     teaching    provided    in  this specification. Two  examples of alternative
     embodiments are shown in figures 12 and 13 and will be described later on in
15   this specification.
     In the figures the ground foundation assembly 1 comprises a ground
     foundation element 2 and a displaceable sled 3. An object 4, in this
     specification called the "supported object" is fastened to the ground
20   foundation assembly via the sled 3. In this embodiment the supported object
     is an H beam 5 used for supporting, for example, a sign (not shown). A plate
     6 is welded to the bottom of the H-beam. The plate 6 is used to connect the
     H-beam to the ground foundation assembly. In the current embodiment, the
     plate 6 is connected to the displaceable sled 3.
25
     The ground foundation 2 of the ground foundation assembly comprises an
     elongated anchor portion 10. The elongated anchor portion 10 comprises, in
     the current embodiment, an H-beam 11. The H-beam has two "end" flanges
     12, 13 and a centre flange 14 connecting the two end flanges. "Wings" 15 are
30   in the current embodiment welded to the H-Beam in order to provide more
     contact area between the ground and the elongated anchor portion once the

 WO 2014/154721                                                     PCT/EP2014/056006
                                              5
     elongated anchor portion is inserted into the ground. This provides more
     support for the ground foundation. The use of wings is well known in the art
     and will not be described in more detail here.
 5   When placing the elongated anchor portion of the current embodiment in the
     ground, the tip 16 of the H-beam is first positioned above the ground surface
     and then the elongated anchor portion is pressed into the ground along a
     direction which is parallel to the longitudinal direction of the elongated anchor
     portion. Depending on the ground in which the anchor portion is to be
10   inserted, the anchor portion could either be pressed into the ground, or
     pounded into the ground.
     It should be obvious to the person skilled in the art that the elongated anchor
     portion could be formed in many different ways. In one example, it could be
15   formed as a helix which is "screwed" into the ground. In another example, it
     could be formed as a hollow cylindrical tube. In another example, it could be
     formed as a square channel. In all embodiments, wings could be used or not.
     Many other possibilities exist.
20   In the claims it is currently specified that the elongated anchor portion is
     arranged to be "placed" into the ground. The term "placed" should be
     understood quite broadly and should cover anchors which are placed in a
     hole in the ground and then covered and it should also cover anchors which
     are "driven" into the ground. The term "driven" should be understood quite
25   broadly. The term driven should cover the actions of for example pressing,
     pounding and screwing.
     At the top of the ground foundation element 2, a displaceable sled 3 is
     provided. The function of the sled is to allow adjustment of the position of the
30   supported element with respect to the elongated anchor portion. In a perfect
     world, it would be possible to place the foundation exactly at the correct

 WO 2014/154721                                                    PCT/EP2014/056006
                                             6
     position and correct angular orientation. In this perfect world, no adjustment
     would typically be needed. However in the real world, it is difficult to place the
     foundation at the exact right location and/or angular orientation. For example,
     if there is a large rock underground in the path of the anchor portion, then the
 5   entire foundation will be shifted in position and orientation from the desired
     one.
     In order to provide the possibility of adjustment, in this embodiment two
     elongated flanges or blocks 20, 21 with through-going slots 22, 23 are
10   welded to either end flange 12, 13 of H-beam. These two blocks with slots
     form "elongated tracks". In the current embodiment, one could imagine a
     plane which went down the plane of symmetry of the H-beam and was
     perpendicular to the centre flange 14 of the H beam. In the current
     embodiment this plane is also parallel to the longitudinal centre axis of the
15   elongated anchor portion. A first elongated block 20 is then arranged on a
     first side of this plane and a second elongated block 21 is arranged on a
     second side of this plane. In each block a through-going slot 22, 23 is
     machined. This can be seen best in figure 6. The two slots 22, 23 are
     arranged parallel with respect to each other and are offset from each other.
20   In the current embodiment, the two slots are offset from each other along a
     vector which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axes of the slots, and
     perpendicular     to   the  described  plane.   Furthermore,     in  the   current
     embodiment, it can be seen that the offset distance from the described plane
     to the slots is essentially the same for both slots. It could also be said that in
25   the current embodiment the centre plane of the slots is parallel to the
     longitudinal axis of the elongated anchor portion.
     The "sled" 3 of the current embodiment comprises two slots 25,26. In the
     current embodiment the two slots 25,26 are arranged collinear. The two slots
30   of the sled are arranged such that they can be aligned with the two slots 22,
     23 in the elongated blocks 20, 21 fastened to the H beam of the elongated

                                              7
     anchor portion. A first bolt 27 can then be placed through the first slot 22 in
     the anchor portion and the first slot 25 in the sled and a second bolt 28 can
     be placed through the second slot 23 in the anchor portion and the second
     slot 26 in the sled. Due to the slots, the sled can be displaced both in a
 5   direction parallel to the axis of the slots in the anchor portion and parallel to
     the direction of the slots in the sled. Furthermore, the sled can be angled with
     respect to the anchor portion. When nuts are placed on the bolts and the nuts
     are tightened, the sled becomes locked in position with respect to the anchor
     portion. It can therefore be considered that the bolts and nuts are fastening
10   elements having two modes, a first unlocked mode where the sled can
     displace and a second locked mode where the sled cannot displace.
     In order to ensure a tight connection between the sled and the ground
     foundation portion, a "washer" plate 30 is provided. The washer plate in the
15   current embodiment is provided with two holes 31, 32 which are large
     enough for the bolts 27, 28 to pass through, but smaller than the head of the
     bolts and the nuts used with the bolts. In this way, the "washer" plate has the
     same function as a typical washer, but is stronger than a typical washer since
     the washer plate supports both bolts instead of just one bolt. The use of a
20   washer plate also permits the openings in the sled 3 to be significantly
     oversized with respect to the diameter of the bolts used to fasten the sled to
     the ground foundation element. In the current embodiment slots are used
     which have an inner width which is essentially identical to the outer diameter
     of the bolts used. However, with the use of a washer plate as shown in the
25   figures, instead of slots, one could also use holes which are much larger than
     the diameter of the bolts. In this way, adjustment would also be possible in
     multiple directions. It should be noted that depending on the geometry of the
     slots or openings in the sled, traditional washers could be used instead of a
     washer plate.

                                              8
     The sled 3 furthermore is provided with four nuts 35 which are welded onto
     the sled. A bolt 36 can then be placed in this nut and through the plate 6 of
     the supported element 4. Via the use of double nuts 37 on the bolt 36, the
     vertical position of the plate 6 with respect to the sled can be adjusted. In the
 5   current embodiment, there are four bolts which support the plate 6, and by
     adjusting the vertical offset between the plate and the sled at these four
     locations, the vertical alignment of the supported object can be adjusted. This
     form of adjustment of the alignment of the supported object is known from the
     prior art and won't be described in more detail here.
10
     In the above description, it has been assumed that the sled is provided with
     openings when delivered from the factory. However, it could also be
     imagined that the sled is provided from the factory without any openings.
     During assembly, the ground foundation element is first placed in the ground,
15   then the sled is placed on the ground foundation element and the desired
     location of the sled is determined. Markings are then made on the sled which
     identify the locations of the openings necessary to align with the slots of the
     ground foundation element. The openings are then machined into the sled. In
     this way, the openings are provided at the correct location. Depending on the
20   location where the ground foundation assemblies are to be installed, it might
     be advantageous to mark the desired locations of the openings on the sled
     and then move the sled to a separate location where machinery is provided
     to machine the openings. The machined sled can then be returned to the
     location of the installed ground foundation element and mounted thereon.
25   This might be relevant in situations where the ground foundations are to be
     installed in an environment where machining of the sled is difficult, for
     example in environments of cold temperatures or poor weather. When using
     a washer plate as described above, the openings could be machined slightly
     larger than necessary to absorb any tolerances in the precision of the
30   location markings.

     It can also be mentioned, that in one embodiment (not shown), the slots
     22,23 made in the blocks could be dimensioned such that one of the flat
     sides of the head of the bolt which is placed through the slot comes to rest
     against the side of the end flange 12,13 of the H-Beam 11. In this way, the
 5   head of the bolt is prevented from turning and a wrench or other form of
     holding tool is not necessary for holding the bolt from turning during
     tightening of the nut on the bolt. This effect could also be provided in other
     ways, for example by machining a groove (not shown) in the bottom of the
     block comprising the slot which is just wide enough to accept the head of the
10   bolt.
     Figure 12 shows a second embodiment 200 of a ground foundation
     assembly. Most of the details of the second embodiment 200 are the same
     as the first embodiment 1. The main difference is that instead of a U shaped
15   sled 3 with nuts welded into the flanges of the sled as was the case with the
     first embodiment, in the second embodiment 200, a sled is provided which is
     the form of a flat plate 201. Bolts 202 are bolted into threaded openings in the
     plate 201 or are welded into the plate 201. Or nuts 203 are welded onto the
     plate 201. As can be seen from the figures, in this embodiment instead of a
20   washer plate, traditional washers 204 are used, however a washer plate
     could also be used.
     Figure 13 shows a schematic view of a third embodiment 300 of a ground
     foundation assembly. In this embodiment, the main difference is that the
25   elongated tracks of the ground foundation element are C-channels 301, 302
     instead of flanges with through-going slots.
     Figures 14 and 15 show a fourth embodiment 400 of a ground foundation
     assembly. The fourth embodiment is very similar to the second embodiment
30   which is shown in figure 12. As with the embodiment of figure 12, the
     embodiment of figures 14 and 15 is also very similar to the first embodiment

 WO 2014/154721                                                  PCT/EP2014/056006
                                             10
     described above, and as such the fourth embodiemnt will not be described in
     great detail here.
     One feature to note in the drawings is the block 401 shown with dotted lines.
 5   This block is optional and not necessary, but can be useful in certain cases.
     The block is in one embodiment made from an elastic material which can
     absorb any motion between the foundation and the element 402 mounted on
     the foundation. This can be useful in cases where the bolts in the foundation
     are not very precise to allow the structure to absorb any tolerances in
10   geometry, or in cases where there element mounted on the foundation is
     exposed to frequent shock loading. It also allows the bolts to be prestressed
     and tightened against the elastic block.
     Further details of the fourth embodiment will not be provided here since it is
15   assumed that the person skilled in the art will be able to identify the different
     elements shown in the figures and understand their function. It should
     however be stated that the element 402 mounted on the foundation has been
     shortened to fit onto the page. In real life, the element would most likely be
     longer. Furthermore, the bottom of the ground foundation element 403 has
20   been cut off to allow the figures to fit on the page. The bottom of the ground
     foundation element can assume many different shapes and sizes as will be
     known to the person skilled in the art. One example of a suitable bottom
     portion is shown in figures 4 and 6 where a similar ground foundation
     element is shown.
25
     It should also be noted that figures 14 and 15 do not show the ground
     foundation assembly from all angles. However, the person skilled in the art
     should be able to understand the rest of the shape of the elements from his
     or her technical knowledge. For example, the ground foundation element 403
30   is comprised of a H-beam (or I-beam) 404 which is symmetric. The side of
     the H-beam which is not seen in the figures is the same as the side which is

 WO 2014/154721                                                  PCT/EP2014/056006
                                            11
     seen in the figures. Furthermore, the H-beam has an extra flange 405
     attached to it to extend the flange of the H-beam. A similar extra flange is
     also attached on the other side of the H-beam but cannot be seen due to the
     angle of the figures. In general, the ground foundation element 403 is similar
 5   to the ground foundation element 2 shown in figures 4 and 6. The main
     difference being the shape of the top part of the ground foundation element.
     In this fourth embodiment, the top portion 406 is arranged as a flat plate 407
     with two slots 408,408. The flat plate is welded onto the end of the H-beam.
10   It is to be noted that the figures and the above description have shown the
     example embodiments in a simple and schematic manner. Many of the
     specific mechanical details have not been shown since the person skilled in
     the art should be familiar with these details and they would just unnecessarily
     complicate this description. For example, the details of the welding processes
15   used and the forming operations used have not been described in detail.
     However it is maintained that the person skilled in the art would be able to
     provide these details.
