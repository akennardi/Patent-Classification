                                   Summary of the Related Art
[0003]    Tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid required for the biosynthesis of proteins,
niacin and the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin). The enzyme indoleamine 2,3
dioxygenase (also known as INDO or IDO) catalyzes the first and rate limiting step in the
degradation of L-tryptophan to N-formyl-kynurenine. In human cells, IFN-7 stimulation
induces activation of IDO, which leads to a depletion of Trp, thereby arresting the growth of
Trp-dependent intracellular pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii and Chlamydia trachomatis.
IDO activity also has an antiproliferative effect on many tumor cells, and IDO induction has
been observed in vivo during rejection of allogeneic tumors, indicating a possible role for this
enzyme in the tumor rejection process.
[0004]    It has been observed that HeLa cells co-cultured with peripheral blood lymphocytes
(PBLs) acquire an immunoinhibitory phenotype through up-regulation of IDO activity. A
reduction in PBL proliferation upon treatment with interleukin-2 (IL-2) was believed to result
from IDO released by the tumor cells in response to IFN-y secretion by the PBLs. This effect
was reversed by treatment with 1-methyl-tryptophan (IMT), a specific IDO inhibitor. It was
proposed that IDO activity in tumor cells may serve to impair antitumor responses (Logan, et
al., 2002, Immunology, 105: 478-87).
[0005]    Several lines of evidence suggest that IDO is involved in induction of immune
tolerance. Studies of mammalian pregnancy, tumor resistance, chronic infections and
autoimmune diseases have shown that cells expressing IDO can suppress T-cell responses and
promote tolerance. Accelerated Trp catabolism has been observed in diseases and

disorders associated with cellular immune activation, such as infection, malignancy,
autoimmune diseases and AIDS, as well as during pregnancy. It was proposed that IDO is
induced chronically by HIV infection, and is further increased by opportunistic infections,
and that the chronic loss of Trp initiates mechanisms responsible for cachexia, dementia and
diarrhea and possibly immunosuppression of AIDS patients (Brown, et al., 1991, Adv. Exp.
Med. Biol., 294: 425-35). To this end, it has recently been shown that IDO inhibition can
enhance the levels of virus-specific T cells and, concomitantly, reduce the number of virally
infected macrophages in a mouse model of HIV (Portula et al., 2005, Blood, 106:2382-90).
 [0006] IDO is believed to play a role in the immunosuppressive processes that prevent fetal
rejection in utero. More than 40 years ago, it was observed that, during pregnancy, the
genetically disparate mammalian conceptus survives in spite of what would be predicted by
tissue transplantation immunology (Medawar, 1953, Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 7: 320-38).
Anatomic separation of mother and fetus and antigenic immaturity of the fetus cannot fully
explain fetal allograft survival. Recent attention has focused on immunologic tolerance of the
mother. Because IDO is expressed by human syncytiotrophoblast cells and systemic
tryptophan concentration falls during normal pregnancy, it was hypothesized that IDO
expression at the maternal-fetal interface is necessary to prevent immunologic rejection of the
fetal allografts. To test this hypothesis, pregnant mice (carrying syngeneic or allogeneic
fetuses) were exposed to 1MT, and a rapid, T cell-induced rejection of all allogeneic concepti
was observed. Thus, by catabolizing tryptophan, the mammalian conceptus appears to
suppress T-cell activity and defends itself against rejection, and blocking tryptophan
catabolism during murine pregnancy allows maternal T cells to provoke fetal allograft
rejection (Munn, et al., 1998, Science 281: 1191-3).
 [0007] Further evidence for a tumoral immune resistance mechanism based on tryptophan
degradation by IDO comes from the observation that most human tumors constitutively
express IDO, and that expression of IDO by immunogenic mouse tumor cells prevents their
rejection by preimmunized mice. This effect is accompanied by a lack of accumulation of
specific T cells at the tumor site and can be partly reverted by systemic treatment of mice
with an inhibitor of IDO, in the absence of noticeable toxicity. Thus, it was suggested that the
efficacy of therapeutic vaccination of cancer patients might be improved by concomitant
administration of an IDO inhibitor (Uyttenhove et al., 2003, Nature Med., 9: 1269-74). It has
also been shown that the IDO inhibitor, 1-MT, can synergize with chemotherapeutic agents to
reduce tumor growth in mice, suggesting that IDO inhibition may also enhance the anti-tumor
activity of conventional cytotoxic therapies (Muller et al., 2005, Nature Med., 11:312-9).
                                                 2

 [0008] One mechanism contributing to immunologic unresponsiveness toward tumors may
be presentation of tumor antigens by tolerogenic host APCs. A subset of human
IDO-expressing antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that coexpressed CD123 (IL3RA) and
CCR6 and inhibited T-cell proliferation have also been described. Both mature and immature
CD123-positive dendritic cells suppressed T-cell activity, and this IDO suppressive activity
was blocked by 1MT (Munn, et al., 2002, Science 297: 1867-70). It has also been
demonstrated that mouse tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) contain a subset of
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) that constitutively express immunosuppressive levels of
IDO. Despite comprising only 0.5% of lymph node cells, in vitro, these pDCs potently
suppressed T cell responses to antigens presented by the pDCs themselves and also, in a
dominant fashion, suppressed T cell responses to third-party antigens presented by
nonsuppressive APCs. Within the population of pDCs, the majority of the functional
IDO-mediated suppressor activity segregated with a novel subset of pDCs coexpressing the
B-lineage marker CD19. Thus, it was hypothesized that IDO-mediated suppression by pDCs
in TDLNs creates a local microenvironment that is potently suppressive of host antitumor T
cell responses (Munn, et al., 2004, J. Clin. Invest., 114(2): 280-90).
 [0009] IDO degrades the indole moiety of tryptophan, serotonin and melatonin, and initiates
the production of neuroactive and immunoregulatory metabolites, collectively known as
kynurenines. By locally depleting tryptophan and increasing proapoptotic kynurenines, IDO
expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) can greatly affect T-cell proliferation and survival. IDO
induction in DCs could be a common mechanism of deletional tolerance driven by regulatory
T cells. Because such tolerogenic responses can be expected to operate in a variety of
physiopathological conditions, tryptophan metabolism and kynurenine production might
represent a crucial interface between the immune and nervous systems (Grohmann, et al.,
2003, Trends Immunol., 24: 242-8).
 [0010] Small molecule inhibitors of IDO are being developed to treat or prevent IDO-related
diseases such as those described above. For example, PCT Publication WO 99/29310 reports
methods for altering T cell-mediated immunity comprising altering local extracellular
concentrations of tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites, using an inhibitor of IDO such as
 1-methyl-DL-tryptophan, p-(3-benzofuranyl)-DL-alanine, p-[3-benzo(b)thienyl]-DL-alanine,
and 6-nitro-L-tryptophan) (Munn, 1999). Reported in WO 03/087347, also published as
European Patent 1501918, are methods of making antigen-presenting cells for enhancing or
reducing T cell tolerance (Munn, 2003). Compounds having indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase
(IDO) inhibitory activity are further reported in WO 2004/094409; and U.S. Patent
                                                3

Application Publication No. 2004/0234623 is directed to methods of treating a subject with a
cancer or an infection by the administration of an inhibitor of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase
in combination with other therapeutic modalities.
 [0011] In light of the experimental data indicating a role for IDO in immunosuppression,
tumor resistance and/or rejection, chronic infections, HIV-infection, AIDS (including its
manifestations such as cachexia, dementia and diarrhea), autoimmune diseases or disorders
(such as rheumatoid arthritis), and immunologic tolerance and prevention of fetal rejection in
utero, therapeutic agents aimed at suppression of tryptophan degradation by inhibiting IDO
activity are desirable. Inhibitors of IDO can be used to activate T cells and therefore enhance
T cell activation when the T cells are suppressed by pregnancy, malignancy or a virus such as
HIV. Inhibition of IDO may also be an important treatment strategy for patients with
neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases or disorders such as depression. The compounds,
compositions and methods herein help meet the current need for IDO modulators.

Definitions
 [0060] Terms used herein may be preceded and/or followed by a single dash, "-", or a double
dash, "=", to indicate the bond order of the bond between the named substituent and its parent
moiety; a single dash indicates a single bond and a double dash indicates a double bond or a
pair of single bonds in the case of a spiro-substituent. In the absence of a single or double
dash it is understood that a single bond is formed between the substituent and its parent
moiety; further, substituents are intended to be read "left to right" unless a dash indicates
otherwise. For example, C1-C 6alkoxycarbonyloxy and -OC(O)CI-C 6alkyl indicate the same
functionality; similarly arylalkyl, arylalkyl-, and -alkylaryl indicate the same functionality.
 [0061] Further, certain terms herein may be used as both monovalent and divalent linking
radicals as would be familiar to those skilled in the art, and by their presentation linking
between two other moieties. For example, an alkyl group can be both a monovalent radical
or divalent radical; in the latter case, it would be apparent to one skilled in the art that an
additional hydrogen atom is removed from a monovalent alkyl radical to provide a suitable
divalent moiety.
 [0062] The term "alkenyl" as used herein, means a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon
containing from 2 to 10 carbons, unless otherwise specified, and containing at least one
carbon-carbon double bond. Representative examples of alkenyl include, but are not limited
to, ethenyl, 2-propenyl, 2-methyl-2-propenyl, 3-butenyl, 4-pentenyl, 5-hexenyl, 2-heptenyl,
2-methyl-1-heptenyl, 3-decenyl, and 3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dienyl.
                                                 66

 [0063] The term "alkoxy" as used herein, means an alkyl group, as defined herein, appended
to the parent molecular moiety through an oxygen atom. Representative examples of alkoxy
include, but are not limited to, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, 2-propoxy, butoxy, tert-butoxy,
pentyloxy, and hexyloxy.
 [0064] The term "alkyl" as used herein, means a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon
containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, unless otherwise specified. Representative examples of
alkyl include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl,
iso-butyl,    tert-butyl,   n-pentyl,     isopentyl,     neopentyl,      n-hexyl,     3-methylhexyl,
2,2-dimethylpentyl, 2,3-dimethylpentyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, and n-decyl. When an
"alkyl" group is a linking group between two other moieties, then it may also be a straight or
branched     chain;   examples   include,    but     are  not    limited   to    -CH 2 -, -CH 2 CH 2-,
-CH 2CH 2CHC(CH 3)-, -CH 2CH(CH 2CH 3)CH 2-.
 [0065] The term "aryl," as used herein, means a phenyl (i.e., monocyclic aryl), or a bicyclic
ring system containing at least one phenyl ring or an aromatic bicyclic ring containing only
carbon atoms in the aromatic bicyclic ring system.            The bicyclic aryl can be azulenyl,
naphthyl, or a phenyl fused to a monocyclic cycloalkyl, a monocyclic cycloalkenyl, or a
monocyclic heterocyclyl. The bicyclic aryl is attached to the parent molecular moiety through

fused cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, or heterocyclyl ring, then the bicyclic heteroaryl group is
connected to the parent molecular moiety through any carbon or nitrogen atom contained
within the monocyclic heteroaryl portion of the bicyclic ring system. When the bicyclic
heteroaryl is a monocyclic heteroaryl fused to a phenyl ring or a monocyclic heteroaryl, then
the bicyclic heteroaryl group is connected to the parent molecular moiety through any carbon

as
 a         , where R is a spiro-cycloalkyl= group includes compounds such as                       ,
where the spiro-cyclopentyl group is the R group attached to the parent cyclohexyl ring by
two single bonds. Similarly, where R is a spiro-heterocyclyl group, such compounds include
         0

cyclohexyl ring by two single bonds.
 [0080] The term "thia" as used herein means a =S group.
 [0081] The term "unsaturated" as used herein means the referenced chemical structure
contains at least one multiple carbon-carbon bond, but is not aromatic.           For example, a
unsaturated cycloalkyl group as defined herein includes cyclohexenyl, cyclopentenyl,
cyclohexadienyl, and the like.
 [0082] As used herein, the term "cell" is meant to refer to a cell that is in vitro, ex vivo or in
vivo. In some embodiments, an ex vivo cell can be part of a tissue sample excised from an
organism such as a mammal. In some embodiments, an in vitro cell can be a cell in a cell
culture. In some embodiments, an in vivo cell is a cell living in an organism such as a
mammal.
 [0083] As used herein, the term "contacting" refers to the bringing together of indicated
moieties in an in vitro system or an in vivo system. For example, "contacting" the IDO
enzyme with a compound includes the administration of a compound described herein to an
individual or patient, such as a human, having IDO, as well as, for example, introducing a
compound into a sample containing a cellular or purified preparation containing the IDO
enzyme.
 [0084] As used herein, the term "individual" or "patient," used interchangeably, refers to any
animal, including mammals, preferably mice, rats, other rodents, rabbits, dogs, cats, swine,
cattle, sheep, horses, or primates, and most preferably humans.
 [0085] As used herein, the phrase "therapeutically effective amount" refers to the amount of
active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response that
                                               72

is being sought in a tissue, system, animal, individual or human by a researcher, veterinarian,
medical doctor or other clinician.
 [0086] In certain embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount can be an amount suitable
for (1) preventing the disease; for example, preventing a disease, condition or disorder in an
individual who may be predisposed to the disease, condition or disorder but does not yet
experience or display the pathology or symptomatology of the disease;
 [0087] (2) inhibiting the disease; for example, inhibiting a disease, condition or disorder in
an individual who is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology of the
disease, condition or disorder; or
 [0088] (3) ameliorating the disease; for example, ameliorating a disease, condition or
disorder in an individual who is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology
of the disease, condition or disorder (i.e., reversing the pathology and/or symptomatology)
such as decreasing the severity of disease.
 [0089] As used here, the terms "treatment" and "treating" means (i) ameliorating the
referenced disease state, for example, ameliorating a disease, condition or disorder in an
individual who is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology of the disease,
condition or disorder (i.e., reversing or improving the pathology and/or symptomatology)
such as decreasing the severity of disease; or (ii) eliciting the referenced biological effect
(e.g., IDO modulation or tryptophan degradation inhibition).
 [0090] Manifestation of amelioration of a disease condition with underlying IDO-mediated
immunosuppression may require the concomitant or sequential administration of additional
therapeutic agents, such as antineoplastic agents in the case of cancer, or antiretroviral agents
in the case of viral diseases. For example, administration of IDO inhibitors for the treatment
of cancer does not always produce a direct antitumor effect when used as a single agent.
However, when combined with chemotherapeutic drugs (antineoplastic) the antitumor effect
observed is higher than the sum of effects of each agent alone.
 [0091] As used herein, the terms "catalytic pocket", "catalytic site", "active site" collectively
and indistinctly refer to a region of the enzyme that contains amino acid residues responsible
for the substrate binding (charge, hydrophobicity, steric hindrance) and catalytic amino acid
residues which act as proton donors or acceptors or are responsible for binding a cofactor and
participate in the catalysis of a chemical reaction.
 [0092] As used herein, the phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to both
pharmaceutically acceptable acid and base addition salts and solvates. Such pharmaceutically
acceptable salts include salts of acids such as hydrochloric, phosphoric, hydrobromic,

maleic, hydroiodic, alkanoic such as acetic, HOOC-(CH 2)n-COOH where n is 0-4, and the
like. Non-toxic pharmaceutical base addition salts include salts of bases such as sodium,
potassium, calcium, ammonium, and the like. Those skilled in the art will recognize a wide
variety of non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts.
Methods of Use
 [0093] The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions described herein can modulate
activity of the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). The term "modulate" is meant to
refer to an ability to decrease activity of an enzyme or receptor. Accordingly, compounds
described herein can be used in methods of modulating IDO by contacting the enzyme with
any one or more of the compounds or compositions described herein. In some embodiments,
the compounds described herein can act as inhibitors of IDO. In further embodiments, the
compounds described herein can be used to modulate activity of IDO in cell or in an
individual in need of modulation of the enzyme by administering a modulating (e.g.,
inhibiting) amount of a compound described herein.
 [0094] Further provided are methods of inhibiting the degradation of tryptophan and
preventing the production of N-formylkynurenine in a system containing cells expressing
IDO such as a tissue, living organism, or cell culture. In some embodiments methods of
altering (e.g., increasing) extracellular tryptophan levels in a mammal comprise administering
an effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition provided herein.
Methods of measuring tryptophan levels and tryptophan degradation are routine in the art.
[0095] Further provided are methods of inhibiting immunosuppression such as IDO-mediated
immunosuppression in a patient by administering to the patient an effective amount of a
compound or composition recited herein. IDO-mediated immunosuppression has been
associated with, for example, cancers, tumor growth, metastasis, infectious diseases (e.g.,
viral infection), viral replication, etc.
[0096] Further provided are methods for treating tumor-specific            immunosuppression
associated with cancer in a patient by administering to the patient an effective amount of a
compound or composition recited herein. Example tumor-specific immunosuppression
associated with cancers treatable by the methods herein include immunosuppression
associated with cancer of the colon, pancreas, breast, prostate, lung, brain, ovary, cervix,
testes, renal, head and neck, lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma, and the like.
                                                 74

 [0097] For example, a patient undergoing or having completed a course of chemotherapy
and/or radiation therapy for the treatment of a disease state, such as a cancer, can benefit from
administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or composition
recited herein for inhibiting immunosuppression resulting from the disease state and/or
treatment thereof.
 [0098] Further provided are methods for treating immunosupression associated with an
infectious disease, e.g., HIV-1 infection, in a patient by administering to the patient an
effective amount of a compound or composition recited herein.
 [0099] For example, IDO-mediated immunosuppression associated with viral infection, is
associated with a viral infection selected from the group consisting of: influenza, hepatitis C
virus (HCV), human papilloma virus (HPV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV), poliovirus, varicella zoster virus, coxsackie virus, human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV).
 [00100]    Further provided are methods of treating diseases associated with activity or
expression, including abnormal activity and/or overexpression, of IDO in an individual (e.g.,
patient) by administering to the individual in need of such treatment a therapeutically
effective amount or dose of a compound described herein or a pharmaceutical composition
thereof. Example diseases can include any disease, disorder or condition that is directly or
indirectly linked to expression or activity of the IDO enzyme, such as over expression or
abnormal activity. An IDO-associated disease can also include any disease, disorder or
condition that can be prevented, ameliorated, or cured by modulating enzyme activity.
 [00101]    Examples of IDO-associated diseases include cancer, viral infection such as HIV
infection, depression, neurodegenerative disorders         such as Alzheimer's disease and
Huntington's disease, trauma, age-related cataracts, organ transplantation (e.g.,           organ
transplant rejection), and autoimmune diseases including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis,
multiple    sclerosis,  inflammatory     bowel    disease,    psoriasis   and    systemic   lupus
erythematosusor. Example cancers treatable by the methods herein include cancer of the
colon, pancreas, breast, prostate, lung, brain, ovary, cervix, testes, renal, head and neck,
lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma, and the like.
Combination Therapy
 [00102]    One or more additional pharmaceutical agents for treatment methods such as, for
example, anti-viral agents, chemotherapeutics or other anti-cancer agents, immune enhancers,
immunosuppressants, radiation, anti-tumor and anti-viral vaccines, cytokine therapy (e.g.,
                                               75

IL2, GM-CSF, etc.), and/or tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be used in combination with the
compounds       and   pharmaceutical     compositions    described     herein   for   treatment    of
IDO-associated diseases, disorders or conditions (as noted above) or for enhancing the
effectiveness of the treatment of a disease state or condition, such as cancer. The agents can
be combined with the present compounds in a single dosage form, or the agents can be
administered simultaneously or sequentially as separate dosage forms.
[00103]      Therapeutic agents that constitute the standard of care for a particular cancer type
or infectious disease are expected to benefit when combined with IDO inhibitors of the
present invention. For example, for the case of tumors, is it preferable that the tumor is
sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic agent in order to stimulate the
release of antigens that will eventually mediate an immune response that will be enhanced by
addition of IDO inhibitors to the combination treatment. A person of skill in the art will know
how to select such chemotherapeutic agent based on the clinical characteristics and known
sensititivity of each tumor to different antineoplastic agents.
[0100] Suitable antiviral agents contemplated for use in combination with the compounds
described herein can comprise nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors

Pharmaceutical Formulations and Dosage Forms
 [0112] The pharmaceutical compositions described herein generally comprise a combination
of a compound described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or
excipient. Such compositions are substantially free of non-pharmaceutically acceptable
components, i.e., contain amounts of non-pharmaceutically acceptable components lower
than permitted by US regulatory requirements at the time of filing this application. In some
embodiments of this aspect, if the compound is dissolved or suspended in water, the
composition further optionally comprises an additional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,
diluent, or excipient.     In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions described
herein are solid pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., tablet, capsules, etc.).
[0113] These compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical
art, and can be administered by a variety of routes, depending upon whether local or systemic
treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including
ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including intranasal, vaginal and rectal delivery),
pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer;
intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal), ocular, oral or parenteral. Methods for
ocular delivery can include topical administration (eye drops), subconjunctival, periocular or
intravitreal injection or introduction by balloon catheter or ophthalmic inserts surgically
placed in the conjunctival sac. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial,
subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g.,
intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. Parenteral administration can be in the form of
a single bolus dose, or may be, for example, by a continuous perfusion pump. Pharmaceutical
compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches,
ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders.
Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like
may be necessary or desirable.
[0114] Also, pharmaceutical compositions can contain, as the active ingredient, one or more
of the compounds described herein above in combination with one or more pharmaceutically
acceptable carriers. In making the compositions described herein, the active ingredient is
typically mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier in
the form of, for example, a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient
                                                78

serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle,
carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of
tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions,
syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to
 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile
injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.
 [0115] In preparing a formulation, the active compound can be milled to provide the
appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound
is substantially insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active
compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size can be adjusted by milling to
provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g. about 40 mesh.
[0116] Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol,
mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium
silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, and methyl
cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc,
magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents;
preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and
flavoring agents. The compositions described herein can be formulated so as to provide
quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient
by employing procedures known in the art.
[0117] The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing
from about 5 to about 100 mg, more usually about 10 to about 30 mg, of the active
ingredient. The term "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary
dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined
quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association
with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.
[0118] The active compound can be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally
administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the
amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician,
according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen
route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of
the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.
[0119] For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is
mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing
                                                 79

a homogeneous mixture of a compound described herein. When referring to these
preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed
evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be readily subdivided into
equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid
preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above
containing from, for example, 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of a compound
described herein.
 [0120] The tablets or pills can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form
affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an
inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over
the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist
disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the
duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric
layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of
polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.
 [0121] The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions can be incorporated for
administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups,
aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil,
sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.
 [0122] Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in
pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders.
The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients
as described supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or
nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in can be nebulized by use
of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the
nebulizing device can be attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure
breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally
or nasally from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.
 [0123] The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary
depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as
prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In
therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already suffering from
a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the
disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on the disease condition being
                                                80

treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as
the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like.
 [0124] The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical
compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional
sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use
as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier
prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and
 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that
use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of
pharmaceutical salts.
 [0125] The therapeutic dosage of the compounds can vary according to, for example, the
particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the
compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing
physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound described herein in a
pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage,
chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example,
the compounds described herein can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution
containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for parenteral administration. Some
typical dose ranges are from about 1 pg/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some
embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight
per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of
progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the
relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its
route of administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves
derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.
 [0126] The compounds described herein can also be formulated in combination with one or
more additional active ingredients which can include any pharmaceutical agent such as
anti-viral   agents,   vaccines,    antibodies,  immune     enhancers,     immune      suppressants,
anti-inflammatory agents and the like.
Labeled Compounds and Assay Methods
 [0127] Another aspect relates to fluorescent dye, spin label, heavy metal or radio-labeled
derivatives of the compounds described herein that would be useful not only in imaging but
also in assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for localizing and quantitating the IDO enzyme in
                                                 81

tissue samples, including human, and for identifying IDO enzyme ligands by inhibition
binding of a labeled compound. Accordingly, further provided are IDO enzyme assays that
contain such labeled compounds.
 [0128] Further provided are isotopically-labeled compounds of the compounds described
herein. An "isotopically" or "radio-labeled" compound is a compound described herein where
one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass
number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e.,
naturally occurring). Suitable radionuclides that may be include but are not limited to 2H
(also written as D for deuterium), 3H (also written as T for tritium), 11 C, 1 3C, 4C, 1N, 1N,
15o,0,      1O, 18F, 3S, 36Cl, 82Br, 7Br, 76 Br, 77Br, 123 124 mI and 131. The radionuclide that
is incorporated in the instant radio-labeled compounds will depend on the specific application
of that radio-labeled compound. For example, for in vitro IDO enzyme labeling and
competition assays, compounds that incorporate 3H, 4C,         82Br, 1I,    1I,   3S  or will generally
                                                          118 125    123  124   131  75   76       77
be most useful. For radio-imaging applications "C, "F,            1,     1,     1, 1, Br,    Br or    Br
will generally be most useful.
 [0129] It is understood that a "radio-labeled" or "labeled compound" is a compound that has
incorporated at least one radionuclide. In some embodiments the radionuclide is selected
from the group consisting of 3H,    14
                                       C, 1251, S and 82 Br.
[0130] Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds are
applicable to compounds described herein and are well known in the art.
[0131] A radio-labeled compound described herein can be used in a screening assay to
identify/evaluate compounds. In general terms, a newly synthesized or identified compound
(i.e., test compound) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of the radio-labeled
compound described herein to the IDO enzyme. Accordingly, the ability of a test compound
to compete with the radio-labeled compound for binding to the IDO enzyme directly
correlates to its binding affinity.
Kits
 [0132] Also included are pharmaceutical kits useful, for example, in the treatment or
prevention of IDO-associated diseases or disorders, obesity, diabetes and other diseases
referred to herein which include one or more containers containing a pharmaceutical
composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound described herein.
Such kits can further include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical
kit components, such as, for example, containers with one or more pharmaceutically
                                                  82

acceptable carriers, additional containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in
the art. Instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to
be administered, guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components,
can also be included in the kit.
 [0133] The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to
limit the disclosure in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of
noncritical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results.
The example compounds below were found to be inhibitors of IDO according to one or more
of the assays described herein.
EXAMPLES
All reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources. All commercial reagents
and solvents were used as received without further purification. The reactions were
monitored using analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) with 0.25 mm EM Science
silica gel plates (60F-254). The developed TLC plates were visualized by short wave UV
light (254 nm) or immersion in potassium permanganate solution followed by heating on a
hot plate. Flash chromatography was performed with Selecto Scientific silica gel, 32-63 Pm
particle sizes. All reactions were performed in flame or oven-dried glassware under a
nitrogen atmosphere. All reactions were stirred magnetically at ambient temperature unless
otherwise indicated. H NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker DRX400, Varian VXR400
or VXR300. H NMR spectra were reported in parts per million (6) relative to TMS (0.0),
DMSO-d 6 (2.50) or CD 30D (4.80) as an internal reference. All 1H NMR spectra were taken
in CDCl 3 unless otherwise indicated. The following starting materials were prepared
according to their literature procedures: (E)-ethyl 3-(2-iodophenyl)acrylate (Synth. Comm.
2007, 37, 2989-2994), 2-chloro-6-iodobenzaldehyde (J. Agric. Food Chem. 2008, 56, 5247
5253), 2-iodo-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (Chem. - Eur. J., 2004, 10, 5233-5242), dimethyl (2
(cyclohex- 1-en-i -yl)-2-oxoethyl)phosphonate (Phosphorus, Sulfur Silicon Relat. Elem.,
1999, 155, 67-80), dimethyl (2-cyclohexyl-2-oxo)ethylphosphonate (Patent: US5807892 Al,
1998), ethyl 1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]decane-8-carboxylate (Patent: US2008/306084 Al, 2008),
(trans)-ethyl 4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohexanecarboxylate
  (Patent: US2006/25383 Al, 2006), ethyl spiro[2.5]octane-6-carboxylate (Bioorg. Med.

[0134] The aforementioned compounds are assigned compound identification numbers 86
91 and 113-115 respectively for future reference in this patent. (4.80) as an internal reference.
All spectra are recorded in CDCl 3 unless otherwise indicated.
[0135] A variety of methods used in this patent to synthesize intermediate A are outlined
below in Scheme 1.          Palladium-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling of 4-iodo-1-trityl-1H
imidazole with phenylboronic acids gives rise to 2-(1-trityl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)benzaldehydes.
The    resulting    2-(1-trityl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)benzaldehydes              are       affected   by    aldol
condensations or Homer-Wadsworth reactions to afford intermediate A. Alternatively, the
synthesis of intermediate A can be achieved by allowing 2-iodobenzaldehydes to react with
substituted methyl ketones in the presence of a base to afford 3-(2-iodophenyl)prop-2-en-1
ones.   Negishi cross-coupling of the resulting 3-(2-iodophenyl)prop-2-en-1-ones                    with 4
iodo-1-trityl-1H-imidazole, also leads to intermediate A. Subjecting intermediate A to trityl
deprotection conditions gives rise to 2-(5H-imidazo[5,1-a]isoindol-5-yl)ethanone B, which
may be reduced to 2-(5H-imidazo[5,1-a]isoindol-5-yl)ethanol C (Scheme 2).

 [0137] To a stirred solution of 4-iodo-1-trityl-1H-imidazole         (218 mg, 0.5 mmol) in
anhydrous THF (4 mL) at rt was added EtMgBr (1.0 M in THF, 0.5 mmol, 0.5 mL) dropwise,
under an atmosphere of N 2. The resulting solution was allowed to stir for 90 min and
anhydrous ZnCl 2 (0.5 mmol, 68.2 mg) was added.           The resulting white suspension was
allowed to stir for 90 min and a solution of the appropriate aryl iodide 1, 2 or 86 (0.5 mmol)
in THF (1 mL) was added followed by the immediate addition of Pd(PPh 3)4 (56 mg, 0.05
mmol). The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at 70 C for 12 h under an atmosphere of
N 2. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was diluted with CH 2 Cl 2 (20 mL) and the
organic layer was washed with an EDTA (aq) buffer (pH = 9) (2 x 5 mL) and brine. The
organic layer was dried (Na 2SO 4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude
residue was used in next step without further purification. To a solution of the crude
imidazole from the previous step was added acetic acid (1.0 mL) and MeOH (4.0 mL). The
solution was stirred at 90 C for 3 h. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room
temperature and the pH was adjusted to ~10 with satd. K 2 CO 3 (aq). The aqueous phase was
extracted with EtOAc (3 x 20 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water,
brine and dried. The solvent was removed in vacuo to afford the crude residue, which was
purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel to afford the following compounds.

anhydrous THF (6 mL) was added EtMgBr (3.0 M in THF, 1.20 mmol, 0.40 mL) under an
atmosphere of N 2. The resulting solution was allowed to stir for 90 min and ZnCl 2 (0.5 M in

THF, 2.40 mL, 1.20 mmol) was added. The resulting white suspension was allowed to stir
for 90 min and a solution of methyl 2-bromo-3-fluorobenzoate (280 mg, 1.20 mmol) in THF
(1 mL) was added followed by the immediate addition of Pd(PPh 3)4 (58 mg, 0.05 mmol).
The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at 90 'C for 18 h under an atmosphere of N2 . After
cooling to room temperature, the solution was diluted with CH 2 Cl 2 (20 mL) and the organic
layer was washed with an EDTA (aq) buffer (pH = 9) (2 x 5 mL) and brine. The organic layer
was dried (Na2 SO 4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude residue was purified
by flash column chromatography to afford the desired product as yellow oil (190 mg, 41 %).

[0154] To a stirred solution of dimethyl methylphosphonate (3.14 g, 25.3 mmol) in 20 ml of
anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at -78 C was added dropwise a solution of n-butyl lithium (10.13
mL, 25.3 mmol, 2.5 M in hexanes) under an atmosphere of N2, and the mixture was stirred
for 30 minutes. To this reaction mixture was added dropwise a solution of the appropriate
commercially available methyl or ethyl ester or 19-26, 91 or 115-121 (12.7 mmol) as a
solution in THF (5 mL). After being stirred for 30 minutes, the reaction mixture was allowed

to warm to 0 C, and stirred for 1 h. The solvent was distilled off and the crude was diluted
with saturated NH 4 Cl (10 mL) and 10 ml of water. The mixture was extracted with ethyl
acetate (2 x 40 mL). The combined ethyl acetate layers were washed with water (1 x 20 mL),
brine (1 x 20 mL) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solution was filtered and
concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the crude product. The crude was purified by
column chromatography to afford the following compounds.

 [0155] To a suspension of 95% NaH (17.4 mg, 0.7 mmol) in THF (3 mL) at 0 C was added
the appropriate phosponate reagent 27-46, 89, 90 or 122-135 (0.75 mmol) as a solution in
THF (2 mL) and the mixture was stirred for 40 min. The appropriate 2-(1-trityl-1H-imidazol
4-yl)benzaldehyde was added as a solution in THF (3 mL) drop wise over a period of 3 min.
The reaction was allowed to warm to RT and stirred overnight. The solvent was removed
under reduced pressure and the crude was diluted with saturated NH 4 Cl (10 mL) and water
(10 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with CH 2Cl 2 (2 x 20 mL) and the combined
organic fractions were washed with brine (15 mL), dried over Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated under
reduced pressure to afford the crude product. To the crude residue was added AcOH (1 mL)
and MeOH (3 mL) and the solution was stirred at 90 C for 2 h. After cooling to rt, the
solvent was distilled off and the crude was stirred in a mixture of sat'd K 2 CO 3 (5 mL) and
EtOAc (5 mL). The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with
EtOAc (2 x 10 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water, brine and dried
(Na2 SO 4 ) and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude residue was purified
by flash column chromatography on silica gel to afford the following compounds.

Biological Example 1            Human IDO protein cloning, expression and purification
 [0198] Expression vectors for human indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase          (IDO) protein were
prepared by amplification of a 1219 bp fragment of the sequence present in vector
phIDO6His cDNA with primers 5'-ggagcatgctaATGGCACACGCTATGGAAAAC-3'                         and
5'-gagagatctACCTTCCTTCAAAAGGGATTTC-3'                  and cloning the SphI-BglII 1213 bp
fragment into pQE70 (Qiagen), to yield vector pQE70-hIDO. This construct adds 2 extra
amino acids and a 6-Histidine tag to the C-terminus of the natural human IDO protein while
preserving intact the natural start codon and N-terminus amino acid sequence. The amplified
allele of human IDO shows two polymorphisms with respect to the sequence deposited in
accession file P14902 of SwissProt database. These polymorphisms result in a P1loS and
El 19G amino acid changes.
 [0199] Plasmid pQE70-hIDO was transformed into M15(pREP4) cells (Qiagen) and clones
were selected in LB-agar plates supplemented with carbenicillin 50 pg/mL and kanamycin 30
pg/mL. Protein expression was carried out by growing an overnight culture of the
M15pREP4/pQE70-hIDO clone in 100 mL LB supplemented with 100 pg/mL carbenicillin,
50 pg/mL kanamycin and 50 pg/mL of L-tryptophan (LBCKT medium).                  40 mL of this
culture were inoculated into 750 mL of LBCKT for 4 hours at 37 'C. This culture was diluted
 1:10 into LBCKT medium and cultured for another 2 hours at 37 'C until OD600 was higher
than 0.8. At this point the cultures were inoculated with Hemin to 7 pM and L-Tryptophan to
75 pg/mL and incubated at 37 'C for 2 h. Induction of protein expression was carried out by
supplementing the cultures with IPTG to 1 mM, PMSF to 200 pM, EDTA to 1 mM and
L-tryptophan to 50 pg/mL. Incubation was continued for additional 16 h at 25 'C. Cells were
                                               173

collected by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were washed with PBS buffer supplemented
with 200 pM PMSF and 1 mM EDTA and stored at -80 'C until protein purification.
 [0200] The equivalent of 16 L of culture were processed in one batch of purification. Cell
pellets were thawed, resuspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 200 PM
PMSF, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mg/mL lysozyme to 10 mL per liter of bacterial culture and incubated
30 minutes on ice. Cells were then lysed by sonication. Cell lysates were centrifuged 20 min
at 20000 g and the supernatant was filtered through 0.45 pm filters. The filtered supernatant
was loaded onto a 60 mL phosphocellulose column equilibrated with 50 mM potassium
phosphate buffer pH 6.5 (KPB) at 1-3 mL/min. The column was washed with 3 volumes of
50 mM KPB, 3 volumes of 100 mM KPB and the protein was eluted with 15 volumes of a
linear gradient of 100-500 mM KPB. Fractions were collected and IDO activity assay was
performed by measuring kynurenine production. This was carried out by mixing 50 pL of
each fraction with 100 pL of reaction mix to yield a final concentration of 50 mM KPB
buffer, 20 mM ascorbic acid, 200 pg/mL catalase, 20 pM methylene blue and 400 pM
L-tryptophan. Fractions demonstrating IDO activity were loaded onto a Ni-NTA purification
column (15 mL). This affinity purification column was washed with 10 volumes of 250 mM
KPB, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole pH 8, and eluted with 10 volumes of buffer
containing 250 mM KPB, 150 mM NaCl and a 50 to 250 mM imidazole linear gradient.
Collected fractions were assayed by IDO enzymatic assay described above and the positive
fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration and dialyzed against a buffer
containing 250 mM KPB, 50% glycerol. This process yields ~ 8-10 mg of pure protein
(>98%) with a specific activity of 170 pmol/h/mg.
Biological Example 2          Testing of IDO inhibitory compounds by enzymatic IDO assay
 [0201] The IC50 values for each compound were determined by testing the activity of IDO in
a mixture containing 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5; 70 nM purified human
IDO protein, 200 pM L-tryptophan, 20 mM ascorbate, 20 pM methylene blue, 0.1% DMSO.
The inhibitors were initially diluted in DMSO at 100 mM and were diluted in potassium
phosphate 50 mM, added to the reaction mixture at final concentrations raging from 1 mM to
5 nM and preincubated with the enzyme for 5 min at 25 'C. The reaction was started by
addition of L-tryptophan to 200 pM and incubated 15 min at 37 'C. The reaction was stopped
by addition of 0.5 vol of 30% trichloroacetic acid and incubated 30 min at 60 'C to hydrolyze
                                               174

N-formylkynurenine to kynurenine. The reaction was centrifuged at 3400 g for 5 min to
remove precipitated protein and the supernatant was              reacted with 2% (w/v) of
                                                                                               0C
p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in acetic acid. The reaction was incubated 10 min at 25
and read at 480 nm in a spectrophotometer. Control samples with no IDO inhibitor, or with
no IDO enzyme or with the reference inhibitors 1-methyl-tryptophan (200 PM) and
menadione (1.2 pM) were used as controls to set the parameters for the non-linear regressions
necessary for determination of the IC50 for each compound. Nonlinear regressions and
determination of the IC50 values were performed using the GraphPad Prism 4 software.
Compounds with an IC50 of less than 500 pM were considered as active inhibitors in this
assay.
Biological Example 3           Determination of IDO inhibitory activity and toxicity in cell
based IDO/Kynurenine assay
[0202] 293-T-RExTM cells (Invitrogen) constitutively express a tet operator binding repressor
protein and are maintained in DMEM, 10 % FBS, IX Penicillin+Streptomycin, 2 mM
L-glutamine, 5 pg/mL blasticidin at 37 0 C with a 5% CO 2 in air atmosphere and typically
split prior to confluency. Cells were passed by splitting the culture 1/10- by removing media
by aspiration, washing IX with PBS, incubating with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA until the cells
detach, disbursing the cells in fresh growth media, and plating at 1/10 dilutions in fresh
growth media.        For long term cryopreservation, cells are detached from the plate as
described above, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in freeze medium (growth medium,
 10%DMSO), stored in 1.8 mL cyropreservation vials        (- 2-5 X 106 cells per vial), in liquid
nitrogen vapor storage tanks.
[0203] IDOl- expressing 293-T-RexTM cell lines were generated by stable transfection of
plasmid pcDNA-tetO-IDO expressing human IDO or murine IDO under the control of the
doxycycline-inducible CMV-tet promoter. Transfected cells were selected in DBZ medium
(DMEM, 10 % FBS, IX Penicillin + Streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 pg/mL blasticidin
and 25 pg/mL Zeocin) at 37 0C with a 5% CO 2 in air atmosphere. Individual clones were
isolated by limiting dilution cloning from these populations. These clones were assayed for
IDO activity and the clones that showed the highest levels of IDO activity inducible by
doxycycline were used for subsequent cell based IDO assays.
                                              175

 [0204] To setup an IDO cell based activity assay, IDO-293-T-Rex cells were harvested and
resuspended in DBZ media at 106 cells/mL, and split into poly-D-lysine coated 96-well plates
at 100,000 cells per well. 100 pL of Neutral medium (DBZ medium, 200 pM L-tryptophan)
or Induction media (Neutral medium supplemented with 5 pM doxycycline) are added to the
cells and incubated 28 h at 37 'C. After the IDO induction period, medium is removed and
replaced with Induction or Neutral medium containing different concentrations of each
inhibitor (1 mM to 0.5 nM). The cells incubated in Neutral medium serve as negative control
of the assay. The cells incubated in Induction medium and without inhibitor serve as the
positive control of the assay. The incubation is carried out for 16 h at 37 'C in a cell culture
incubator. 200 pL of medium are transferred to U-bottom polypropylene 96-well plates
containing 25 pL of 30% TCA, incubated 30 minutes at 60 'C and centrifuged at 3400 g for 5
minutes. 150 pL of the clear supernatant is transferred to a polystyrene 96-well plate
containing 50 pL of 4% (w/v) of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in acetic acid, incubated for
 10 min. Kynurenine concentration is determined by measuring the absorbance at 480 nm.
[0205] To measure the toxicity of each compound after 16 h incubation with cells, cell
viability is measured via a WST-1 assay (Roche) according to instructions from the
manufacturer. Briefly, after the incubation with each compound, medium is aspirated and
replaced with 100 mL of WST-1 reagent, and incubated 30 min at 37 'C. Absorbance at 540
nm is correlated with the number of viable cells. Determination of IC50 (Kynurenine assay) or
LD50 (WST-1 assay) is performed via non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism
software.
Biological Example 4           Reversal of IDO-Mediated Suppression of T- Cell Proliferation
by IDO Inhibitors.
[0206] Human      monocytes    were   collected   from   peripheral   mononuclear     cells   by
leukoapheresis and cultured overnight at 106 cells/well in a 96-well plate in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. Adherent cells
were retained and cultured for 7 days with 200 ng/ml IL-4, 100 ng/ml GM-CSF. Cells were
matured for 2 days with a cytokine cocktail containing TNF-t, IL-1 , IL-6 and PGE2 for
additional 2 days to induce dendritic cell maturation. At the end of maturation, loosely
adherent cells were detached by gentle aspiration and plated in V-bottom 96 well plates, at
5000 cells/well. These cells are >80% IDO+ dendritic cells.         Human allogeneic T cells
(3x10 5) from normal donors were resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100-200
                                              176

U/mL IL-2 and 100 ng/mL anti-CD3 antibody and added to the wells. Serial dilutions of IDO
compounds dissolved in phenol red -free RPMI was added to yield a final concentration of
IDOi between 500 and 1 pM. After incubation for 2-4 days, T cell proliferation was
measured by BrdU incorporation assay after an overnight pulse with BrdU labeling mix
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals). At the en of the pulse, the cells were fixed and incubated
with    100   p L/well anti-BrdU-POD antibody following the instructions           from the
manufacturer. Plates were read in a microplate reader.
 [0207] Alternatively, testing of IDO inhibitors in an in vitro mouse model of IDO-mediated
suppression of T cell proliferation is performed by the following procedure. C57bl6 mice are
inoculated with 1x10 6 B78H1-GMCSF tumor cells in the right flank. After 10-12 days, tumor
draining lymph nodes are collected and cells are stained with anti-CD1lc and anti-B220
monoclonal antibodies. Cells are sorted by high-speed fluorescence activated cell sorting and
the CDl lc+/B220+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells are collected and seeded at 2000 cells/well
in 96 well V-bottom plates. Splenocytes are collected from BM3 transgenic mice (in CBA
background) and collected by nylon wool enrichment. BM3 T cells (105 cells/well) are added
to each well in 200 p L of RPMI, 10% FCS, 50 p M P-mercaptoetanol. Alternatively, T cells
are obtained from spleens of OT-I transgenic mice and added to the culture in combination
with OVA peptide. IDO inhibitors are added dissolved in RPMI at final concentrations
ranging from 1 mM to 10 nM. After 3 days of stimulation, cells are pulsed by 16 h with BrdU
or 3H-thymidine. Cells are collected, fixed and tested for BrdU incorporation following the
instructions from the BrdU labeling kit manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). If 3 H-tymidine is
used to measure T cell proliferation, cells are harvested and dpm counts are measured in a
scintillation counter following procedures widely known in the art. Control CDll c+ cells
taken from the contralateral lymph node or CD1l c/ B220- cells (IDO- population) from the
TDLN are used as positive control for proliferation.

Biological Example 6                   In Vivo Testing of IDO Inhibitors for Antitumor Activity in
Combination with Chemotherapeutic Agents
[0211] In vivo anti-tumor efficacy can be tested using modified tumor allograft protocols. For
instance, it has been described in the literature that IDO inhibition can syngerize with
                                                          199

cytotoxic chemotherapy in immune-competent mice. Due to different susceptibilities of
different tumor cell lines to chemotherapeutic drugs and to immune mediated rejection, each
IDO inhibitor is tested alone and in combination with 2 different chemotherapeutic drugs in 4
different animal tumor models, represented by 4 different mouse tumor cell lines, of different
tissue origin (colorectal, bladder, mammary and lung carcinoma), implanted subcutaneously
in syngeneic strains of mice. These cell lines have been selected based on their known
susceptibility to chemotherapeutic drugs, their partial response to IDO inhibitors as single
agents, their presumed pattern of IDO expression according to their tissue of origin, and their
ability to elicit an immune reaction.
 [0212] For every animal tumor model, 2 different chemotherapeutic drugs are tested in
separate groups of mice according to the following list: 1] LLC tumor: cyclophosphamide
and paclitaxel; 2] EMT6 tumor: cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel; 3] CT26 tumor:
cyclophosphamide       and  doxorubicin;   and 4]   MB49     tumor:   cyclophosphamide     and
gemcitabine.
 [0213] The following chemotherapeutic drugs are used, at the indicated doses. The maximum
tolerated dose for the following chemotherapeutic agents in mice depends on the formulation,
concentration, frequency of administration, route of administration and number of doses. The
chemotherapeutic drugs administered in conjunction with each IDO inhibitor drug are:         1]
Paclitaxel: 20 mg/kg/day i.p, every 4 days, 4 times (q4dx4) (in Cremophor); 2] Doxorubicin:
5 mg/kg, once a week for 3 weeks (q7dx3); 3] Cyclophosphamide (CTX): 100 mg/kg, I.P.,
every 4 days, 4 times (q4dx4); 4] Gemcitabine: 80 mg/kg every 4 days, 4 times, i.p. (q4dx4).
 [0214] All animals receive a subcutaneous injection of a tumor forming dose of live tumor
cells (~ 50000 - 1000000 cells) suspended in 0.1 mL of PBS or saline on day 1. Subcutaneous
injection forms a localized tumor that allows monitoring tumor growth over time.
 [0215] To mimic       the effect of IDO inhibitor     drugs as therapeutic      compositions,
administration of IDO inhibitor drugs begins at day 5-8 after tumor inoculation. Dosing, route
of administration, dosing frequency varies depending on the toxicity and pharmacokinetics
profile of each drug. Duration of the treatment is 2 weeks. Most preferably, drug is
administered continuously via oral gavage or dissolution in the drinking water. Alternatively,
subcutaneous slow release pellets or osmotic pumps containing 100 mg of each drug are
implanted under the skin by surgical procedure. IDO inhibitor drug are administered at the
maximum tolerated dose or at a concentration corresponding to the LD 50 .
 [0216] An example of antitumor activity is shown in Figures 1-2 (for Cpd# 1357) and
Figures 3-4 (for Cpd# 1304). In this test, 200000 LLC murine tumor cells were injected
                                              200

subcutaneously into syngeneic C57B16 mice on day 0. Each treatement group consists of 10
mice. On day 7, once the tumor is established and IDO expression is induced in plasmacytoid
dendritic cells at the tumor draining lymph nodes, a group of 10 mice were surgically
implanted (subcutaneously and on the opposite flank to the tumor), with osmotic pumps
loaded with 200 uL of a 30 mg/mL solution of compounds                      1357 or 1304 in
cremaphor:EtOH:saline (10:10:80). These pumps release 1 uL of solution per hour for a
period of 8 days, achieveing a steady state plasma concentration of drug of ~ 0.5-3
micromolar. From days 15 to 24 compound administrations continued via two s.c. daily doses
of 1 mg each. In the case of Figures 3-4, mice were optionally treated with cyclophosphamide
 100 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection on days 9, 13 and 15 post-tumor innoculation, either
as a single agent or in combination with compound 1304. The results of these tests indicate
that compounds 1357 and 1304 have a significant antitumor effect either as a single agent or
when administered in combination with chemotherapy. The therapeutic effect is observed as
a reduced rate of tumor growth, which has an impact on median survival time and in overall
survival fraction.
 [0217] Figure 1 shows the average tumor volume over time of two groups of 10 mice each.
The control group was treated with vehicle, while the treatment groups received osmotic
pumps with compound 1357 as described above. The tumor volumes were fitted to an
exponential growth equation and the fitted parameters were compared using GraphPad
software. The data indicate a statistically significant differences between the two curves
(p<0.0001).
 [0218] Figure 2 shows the survival plot of the same groups of mice described in Figure 1.
The logrank test indicates a statistically significant difference in median survival time when
animals were treated with compound 1357 as a single agent.
 [0219] Figure 3 shows the average tumor volume over time of four groups of 10 mice each.
The control group was treated with vehicle, while the treatment groups received either
cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, osmotic pumps with compound 1304, or a combination
therapy of cyclophosphamide with compound 1304. The data shows that this tumor is very
sensitive to the effects of treatment with compound 1304 either as a single agent or in
combination with chemotherapy.
 [0220] Figure 4 shows the survival plot of the same groups of mice described in Figure 3.
The logrank test indicated a statistically significant difference in median survival time when
animals were treated with compound 1304, either as a single agent or in combination with
                                               201

cyclophosphamide. The long term survival fraction observed for treatment with 1304 is
exceptionally high, with 70-80% of the mice being tumor free after 60 days.
