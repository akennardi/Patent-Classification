FIELD
         Provided herein are methods, compounds, and compositions for reducing expression of GCCR
mRNA and protein in an animal. Such methods, compounds, and compositions are useful, for example, to
treat, prevent, delay or ameliorate diseases associated with metabolic disorders, particularly disorders
associated with diabetes.
BACKGROUND
         Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by impaired insulin secretion and/or action. In
type 2 diabetes (T2DM), insulin resistance leads to an inability of insulin to control the activity of
gluconeogenic enzymes, and many subjects also exhibit inappropriate levels of circulating glucagon (GC) in
the fasting and postprandial state. Glucagon is secreted from the a-cells of the pancreatic islets and regulates
glucose homeostasis through modulation of hepatic glucose production (Quesada et al., J. Endocrinol. 2008.
 199: 5-19). .
         Glucagon exerts its action on target tissues via the activation of glucocorticoid receptor (GCCR). The
glucocorticoid receptor is a 62 kDa protein that is a member of the class B G-protein coupled family of
receptors (Brubaker et al., Recept. Channels. 2002. 8: 179-88). GCCR activation leads to signal transduction
by G proteins (Gsa and Gq), whereby Gsa activates adenylate cyclase, which causes cAMP production,
resulting in an increase in levels of protein kinase A. GCCR signaling in the liver results in increased hepatic
glucose production by induction of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis along with inhibition of glycogenesis
(Jiang and Zhang. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003. 284: E671-E678). GCCR is also expressed in
extrahepatic tissues, which includes heart, intestinal smooth muscle, kidney, brain, and adipose tissue
(Hansen et al., Peptides. 1995. 16: 1163-1166).
         Development of GCCR inhibitors have been hampered by the unfavorable side effects associated
with systemic GCCR inhibition, including activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis.
                                                         1

Inhibition of GCCR activity in the brain can lead to an increase in circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone
due to feedback regulation and a consequent increase in secretion of adrenal steroids (Philibert et al., Front.
Horm. Res. 1991. 19: 1-17). This, in turn, can produce a myriad of negative chronic steroid-related side
effects. Other studies have demonstrated that specific inactivation of GCCR resulted in hypoglycemia upon
prolonged fasting (Opherk et al., Mol. Endocronol. 2004. 18: 1346-1353).
         It has previously been demonstrated in pre-clinical models that administration of GCCR antisense
oligonucleotides results in tissue-specific accumulation and reduced GCCR expression in liver and adipose
tissue (PCT Pub. No. W02005/071080; PCT Pub. No. W02007/035759) without affecting GCCR mRNA
levels in the CNS or adrenal glands. Thus, antisense inhibition of GCCR mRNA expression has be shown to
improve hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia without activating the HPA axis. The present invention provides
compositions and methods for modulating GCCR expression. Antisense compounds for modulating
expression of GCCR are disclosed in the aforementioned published patent applications. However, there
remains a need for additional improved compounds. The compounds and treatment methods described herein
provide significant advantages over the treatments options currently available for GCCR related disorders.

Antisense Compounds
          Oligomeric compounds include, but are not limited to, oligonucleotides, oligonucleosides,
oligonucleotide analogs, oligonucleotide mimetics, antisense compounds, antisense oligonucleotides, and
siRNAs. An oligomeric compound may be "antisense" to a target nucleic acid, meaning that is capable of
undergoing hybridization to a target nucleic acid through hydrogen bonding.
          In certain embodiments, an antisense compound has a nucleobase sequence that, when written in the
5' to 3' direction, comprises the reverse complement of the target segment of a target nucleic acid to which it
is targeted. In certain such embodiments, an antisense oligonucleotide has a nucleobase sequence that, when
written in the 5' to 3' direction, comprises the reverse complement of the target segment of a target nucleic
acid to which it is targeted.
          In certain embodiments, an antisense compound targeted to a GCCR nucleic acid is 10 to 30
nucleotides in length. In other words, antisense compounds are from 10 to 30 linked nucleobases. In other
embodiments, the antisense compound comprises a modified oligonucleotide consisting of 8 to 80, 10 to 50,
15 to 30, 18 to 21, 20 to 80, 20 to 35, 20 to 30, 20 to 29, 20 to 28, 20 to 27, 20 to 26, 20 to 25, 20 to 24, 20 to
23, 20 to 22, 20 to 21 or 20 linked nucleobases. In certain such embodiments, the antisense compound
comprises a modified oligonucleotide consisting of 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52,
53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, or 80
linked nucleobases in length, or a range defined by any two of the above values.
          In certain embodiments, the antisense compound comprises a shortened or truncated modified
oligonucleotide. The shortened or truncated modified oligonucleotide can have a single nucleoside deleted
from the 5' end (5' truncation), or alternatively from the 3' end (3' truncation). A shortened or truncated
oligonucleotide may have two nucleosides deleted from the 5' end, or alternatively may have two subunits
deleted from the 3' end. Alternatively, the deleted nucleosides may be dispersed throughout the modified
oligonucleotide, for example, in an antisense compound having one nucleoside deleted from the 5' end and
one nucleoside deleted from the 3' end.
         When a single additional nucleoside is present in a lengthened oligonucleotide, the additional
nucleoside may be located at the 5' or 3' end of the oligonucleotide. When two or more additional
nucleosides are present, the added nucleosides may be adjacent to each other, for example, in an
oligonucleotide having two nucleosides added to the 5' end (5' addition), or alternatively to the 3' end (3'
addition), of the oligonucleotide. Alternatively, the added nucleoside may be dispersed throughout the
                                                         36

      WO 2013/063313                                                                 PCT/US2012/061984
antisense compound, for example, in an oligonucleotide having one nucleoside added to the 5' end and one
subunit added to the 3' end.
         It is possible to increase or decrease the length of an antisense compound, such as an antisense
oligonucleotide, and/or introduce mismatch bases without eliminating activity. For example, in Woolf et al.
(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:7305-7309, 1992), a series of antisense oligonucleotides 13-25 nucleobases in
length were tested for their ability to induce cleavage of a target RNA in an oocyte injection model.
Antisense oligonucleotides 25 nucleobases in length with 8 or 11 mismatch bases near the ends of the
antisense oligonucleotides were able to direct specific cleavage of the target mRNA, albeit to a lesser extent
than the antisense oligonucleotides that contained no mismatches. Similarly, target specific cleavage was
achieved using 13 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides, including those with 1 or 3 mismatches.
         Gautschi et al (J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 93:463-47 1, March 2001) demonstrated the ability of an
oligonucleotide having 100% complementarity to the bcl-2 mRNA and having 3 mismatches to the bcl-xL
mRNA to reduce the expression of both bcl-2 and bcl-xL in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, this
oligonucleotide demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in vivo.
         Maher and Dolnick (Nuc. Acid. Res. 16:3341-3358,1988) tested a series of tandem 14 nucleobase
antisense oligonucleotides, and a 28 and 42 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides comprised of the sequence
of two or three of the tandem antisense oligonucleotides, respectively, for their ability to arrest translation of
human DHFR in a rabbit reticulocyte assay. Each of the three 14 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides alone
was able to inhibit translation, albeit at a more modest level than the 28 or 42 nucleobase antisense
oligonucleotides.
Antisense Compound Motifs
           In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a GCCR nucleic acid have chemically
modified subunits arranged in patterns, or motifs, to confer to the antisense compounds properties such as
enhanced inhibitory activity, increased binding affinity for a target nucleic acid, or resistance to degradation
by in vivo nucleases.
           Chimeric antisense compounds typically contain at least one region modified so as to confer
increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, increased binding affinity for the
target nucleic acid, and/or increased inhibitory activity. A second region of a chimeric antisense compound
may optionally serve as a substrate for the cellular endonuclease RNase H, which cleaves the RNA strand of
an RNA:DNA duplex.
           Antisense compounds having a gapmer motif are considered chimeric antisense compounds. In a
gapmer an internal region having a plurality of nucleotides that supports RNaseH cleavage is positioned
between external regions having a plurality of nucleotides that are chemically distinct from the nucleosides of
the internal region. In the case of an antisense oligonucleotide having a gapmer motif, the gap segment
                                                          37

      WO 2013/063313                                                                PCT/US2012/061984
generally serves as the substrate for endonuclease cleavage, while the wing segments comprise modified
nucleosides. In certain embodiments, the regions of a gapmer are differentiated by the types of sugar
moieties comprising each distinct region. The types of sugar moieties that are used to differentiate the
regions of a gapmer may in some embodiments include       D-D-ribonucleosides, f-D-deoxyribonucleosides, 2'
modified nucleosides (such 2'-modified nucleosides may include 2'-MOE and 2'-O-CH 3, among others), and
bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides (such bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides may include those having a
constrained ethyl).    In certain embodiments, wings may include several modified sugar moieties, including,
for example 2'-MOE and constrained ethyl. In certain embodiments, wings may include several modified
and unmodified sugar moieties. In certain embodiments, wings may include various combinations of 2'
MOE nucleosides, constrained ethyl nucleosides, and 2'-deoxynucleosides.
           Each distinct region may comprise uniform sugar moieties, variant, or alternating sugar moieties.
The wing-gap-wing motif is frequently described as "X-Y-Z", where "X" represents the length of the 5'
wing, "Y" represents the length of the gap, and "Z" represents the length of the 3'-wing. "X" and "Z" may
comprise uniform, variant, or alternating sugar moieties. In certain embodiments, "X" and "Y" may include
one or more 2'-deoxynucleosides."Y" may comprise 2'-deoxynucleosides. As used herein, a gapmer
described as "X-Y-Z" has a configuration such that the gap is positioned immediately adjacent to each of the
5'-wing and the 3' wing. Thus, no intervening nucleotides exist between the 5'-wing and gap, or the gap and
the 3'-wing. Any of the antisense compounds described herein can have a gapmer motif In certain
embodiments, "X" and "Z" are the same, in other embodiments they are different. In certain embodiments,
"Y" is between 8 and 15 nucleosides. X, Y, or Z can be any of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30 or more nucleosides.
         In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a GCCR nucleic acid possess a 3-14-3

         In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a GCCR nucleic acid possess a 5-10-5

          In certain embodiments, GCCR has the human sequence as set forth in any of the GENBANK
Accession Numbers: the complement of GENBANK Accession No. NT_029289.10 truncated from
nucleotides 3818000 to 3980000 (incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 1). In certain embodiments, GCCR has
the rhesus monkey sequence as set forth in the complement of GENBANK Accession No. NW_001120987.1
truncated from nucleotides 1334000 to 1491000 (incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 2)
          It is understood that the sequence set forth in each SEQ ID NO in the Examples contained herein is
independent of any modification to a sugar moiety, an internucleoside linkage, or a nucleobase. As such,
antisense compounds defined by a SEQ ID NO may comprise, independently, one or more modifications to a
sugar moiety, an internucleoside linkage, or a nucleobase. Antisense compounds described by Isis Number
(Isis No) indicate a combination of nucleobase sequence and motif.
          In certain embodiments, a target region is a structurally defined region of the target nucleic acid. For
example, a target region may encompass a 3' UTR, a 5' UTR, an exon, an intron, an exon/intron junction, a
coding region, a translation initiation region, translation termination region, or other defined nucleic acid
region. The structurally defined regions for GCCR can be obtained by accession number from sequence
databases such as NCBI and such information is incorporated herein by reference. In certain embodiments, a
target region may encompass the sequence from a 5' target site of one target segment within the target region
to a 3' target site of another target segment within the same target region.
            Targeting includes determination of at least one target segment to which an antisense compound
hybridizes, such that a desired effect occurs. In certain embodiments, the desired effect is a reduction in
mRNA target nucleic acid levels. In certain embodiments, the desired effect is reduction of levels of protein
encoded by the target nucleic acid or a phenotypic change associated with the target nucleic acid.
         A target region may contain one or more target segments. Multiple target segments within a target
region may be overlapping. Alternatively, they may be non-overlapping. In certain embodiments, target
segments within a target region are separated by no more than about 300 nucleotides. In certain emodiments,
target segments within a target region are separated by a number of nucleotides that is, is about, is no more
than, is no more than about, 250, 200, 150, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, or 10 nucleotides on the target
nucleic acid, or is a range defined by any two of the preceeding values. In certain embodiments, target
segments within a target region are separated by no more than, or no more than about, 5 nucleotides on the
target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, target segments are contiguous. Contemplated are target regions
defined by a range having a starting nucleic acid that is any of the 5' target sites or 3' target sites listed
herein.
          Suitable target segments may be found within a 5' UTR, a coding region, a 3' UTR, an intron, an
exon, or an exon/intron junction. Target segments containing a start codon or a stop codon are also suitable
target segments. A suitable target segment may specifcally exclude a certain structurally defined region such
as the start codon or stop codon.

      WO 2013/063313                                                                    PCT/US2012/061984
           The determination of suitable target segments may include a comparison of the sequence of a target
nucleic acid to other sequences throughout the genome. For example, the BLAST algorithm may be used to
identify regions of similarity amongst different nucleic acids. This comparison can prevent the selection of
antisense compound sequences that may hybridize in a non-specific manner to sequences other than a
selected target nucleic acid (i.e., non-target or off-target sequences).
           There may be variation in activity (e.g., as defined by percent reduction of target nucleic acid
levels) of the antisense compounds within an active target region. In certain embodiments, reductions in
GCCR mRNA levels are indicative of inhibition of GCCR expression. Reductions in levels of a GCCR
protein are also indicative of inhibition of target mRNA expression. Further, phenotypic changes are
indicative of inhibition of GCCR expression. In certain embodiments, reduced glucose levels, reduced lipid
levels, and reduced body weight can be indicative of inhibition of GCCR expression. In certain
embodiments, amelioration of symptoms associated with metabolic disease can be indicative of inhibition of
GCCR expression. In certain embodiments, amelioration of symptoms associated with diabetes can be
indicative of inhibition of GCCR expression. In certain embodiments, reduction of insulin resistance is
indicative of inhibition of GCCR expression. In certain embodiments, reduction of diabetes biomarkers can
be indicative of inhibition of GCCR expression.
Hybridization
         In some embodiments, hybridization occurs between an antisense compound disclosed herein and a
GCCR nucleic acid. The most common mechanism of hybridization involves hydrogen bonding (e.g.,
Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding) between complementary nucleobases of
the nucleic acid molecules.
         Hybridization can occur under varying conditions. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and
are determined by the nature and composition of the nucleic acid molecules to be hybridized.
         Methods of determining whether a sequence is specifically hybridizable to a target nucleic acid are
well known in the art. In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds provided herein are specifically
hybridizable with a GCCR nucleic acid.
Complementarity
         An antisense compound and a target nucleic acid are complementary to each other when a sufficient
number of nucleobases of the antisense compound can hydrogen bond with the corresponding nucleobases of
the target nucleic acid, such that a desired effect will occur (e.g., antisense inhibition of a target nucleic acid,
such as a GCCR nucleic acid).
                                                          40

       WO 2013/063313                                                               PCT/US2012/061984
         An antisense compound may hybridize over one or more segments of a GCCR nucleic acid such that
intervening or adjacent segments are not involved in the hybridization event (e.g., a loop structure, mismatch
or hairpin structure).
         In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds provided herein, or a specified portion thereof, are,
or are at least, 70%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%,
99%, or 100% complementary to a GCCR nucleic acid, a target region, target segment, or specified portion
thereof Percent complementarity of an antisense compound with a target nucleic acid can be determined
using routine methods.
         For example, an antisense compound in which 18 of 20 nucleobases of the antisense compound are
complementary to a target region, and would therefore specifically hybridize, would represent 90 percent
complementarity. In this example, the remaining non-complementary nucleobases may be clustered or
interspersed with complementary nucleobases and need not be contiguous to each other or to complementary
nucleobases. As such, an antisense compound which is 18 nucleobases in length having 4 (four) non
complementary nucleobases which are flanked by two regions of complete complementarity with the target
nucleic acid would have 77.8% overall complementarity with the target nucleic acid and would thus fall
within the scope of the present invention. Percent complementarity of an antisense compound with a region
of a target nucleic acid can be determined routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search
tools) and PowerBLAST programs known in the art (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990, 215, 403 410; Zhang
and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649 656). Percent homology, sequence identity or complementarity,
can be determined by, for example, the Gap program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for
Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, Madison Wis.), using default settings, which
uses the algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Adv. Appl. Math., 1981, 2, 482 489).
         In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds provided herein, or specified portions thereof, are
fully complementary (i.e. 100% complementary) to a target nucleic acid, or specified portion thereof For
example, antisense compound may be fully complementary to a GCCR nucleic acid, or a target region, or a
target segment or target sequence thereof As used herein, "fully complementary" means each nucleobase of
an antisense compound is capable of precise base pairing with the corresponding nucleobases of a target
nucleic acid. For example, a 20 nucleobase antisense compound is fully complementary to a target sequence
that is 400 nucleobases long, so long as there is a corresponding 20 nucleobase portion of the target nucleic
acid that is fully complementary to the antisense compound. Fully complementary can also be used in
reference to a specified portion of the first and /or the second nucleic acid. For example, a 20 nucleobase
portion of a 30 nucleobase antisense compound can be "fully complementary" to a target sequence that is 400
nucleobases long. The 20 nucleobase portion of the 30 nucleobase oligonucleotide is fully complementary to
the target sequence if the target sequence has a corresponding 20 nucleobase portion wherein each nucleobase
is complementary to the 20 nucleobase portion of the antisense compound. At the same time, the entire 30

Identity
         The antisense compounds provided herein may also have a defined percent identity to a particular
nucleotide sequence, SEQ ID NO, or compound represented by a specific Isis number, or portion thereof As
used herein, an antisense compound is identical to the sequence disclosed herein if it has the same nucleobase
pairing ability. For example, a RNA which contains uracil in place of thymidine in a disclosed DNA
sequence would be considered identical to the DNA sequence since both uracil and thymidine pair with
adenine. Shortened and lengthened versions of the antisense compounds described herein as well as
compounds having non-identical bases relative to the antisense compounds provided herein also are
contemplated. The non-identical bases may be adjacent to each other or dispersed throughout the antisense
compound. Percent identity of an antisense compound is calculated according to the number of bases that
have identical base pairing relative to the sequence to which it is being compared.
         In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds, or portions thereof, are at least 70%, 75%, 80%,
85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to one or more of the
antisense compounds or SEQ ID NOs, or a portion thereof, disclosed herein.
Modifications
         A nucleoside is a base-sugar combination. The nucleobase (also known as base) portion of the
nucleoside is normally a heterocyclic base moiety. Nucleotides are nucleosides that further include a
phosphate group covalently linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside. For those nucleosides that include a
pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to the 2', 3' or 5' hydroxyl moiety of the sugar.
Oligonucleotides are formed through the covalent linkage of adjacent nucleosides to one another, to form a
linear polymeric oligonucleotide. Within the oligonucleotide structure, the phosphate groups are commonly
referred to as forming the internucleoside linkages of the oligonucleotide.
         Modifications to antisense compounds encompass substitutions or changes to internucleoside
linkages, sugar moieties, or nucleobases. Modified antisense compounds are often preferred over native
forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for
nucleic acid target, increased stability in the presence of nucleases, or increased inhibitory activity.
         Chemically modified nucleosides may also be employed to increase the binding affinity of a
shortened or truncated antisense oligonucleotide for its target nucleic acid. Consequently, comparable results
can often be obtained with shorter antisense compounds that have such chemically modified nucleosides.
Modified InternucleosideLinkages
         The naturally occurring internucleoside linkage of RNA and DNA is a 3' to 5' phosphodiester
linkage. Antisense compounds having one or more modified, i.e. non-naturally occurring, internucleoside
linkages are often selected over antisense compounds having naturally occurring internucleoside linkages
                                                         43

because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for target
nucleic acids, and increased stability in the presence of nucleases.
         Oligonucleotides having modified internucleoside linkages include internucleoside linkages that
retain a phosphorus atom as well as internucleoside linkages that do not have a phosphorus atom.
Representative phosphorus containing internucleoside linkages include, but are not limited to,
phosphodiesters, phosphotriesters, methylphosphonates, phosphoramidate, and phosphorothioates. Methods
of preparation of phosphorous-containing and non-phosphorous-containing linkages are well known.
         In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a GCCR nucleic acid comprise one or more
modified internucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, the modified internucleoside linkages are
phosphorothioate linkages. In certain embodiments, each internucleoside linkage of an antisense compound
is a phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage.
Modified SugarMoieties
           Antisense compounds provided herein can optionally contain one or more nucleosides wherein the
sugar group has been modified. Such sugar modified nucleosides may impart enhanced nuclease stability,
increased binding affinity, or some other beneficial biological property to the antisense compounds. In
certain embodiments, nucleosides comprise a chemically modified ribofuranose ring moiety. Examples of
chemically modified ribofuranose rings include, without limitation, addition of substitutent groups (including
5' and 2' substituent groups); bridging of non-geminal ring atoms to form bicyclic nucleic acids (BNA);
replacement of the ribosyl ring oxygen atom with S, N(R), or C(R1)(R)2 (R = H, CI-C 1 2 alkyl or a protecting
group); and combinations thereof Examples of chemically modified sugars include, 2'-F-5'-methyl
substituted nucleoside (see, PCT International Application WO 2008/101157, published on 8/21/08 for other
disclosed 5', 2'-bis substituted nucleosides), replacement of the ribosyl ring oxygen atom with S with further
substitution at the 2'-position (see, published U.S. Patent Application US2005/0130923, published on June
16, 2005), or, alternatively, 5'-substitution of a BNA (see, PCT International Application WO 2007/134181,
published on 11/22/07, wherein LNA is substituted with, for example, a 5'-methyl or a 5'-vinyl group).
           Examples of nucleosides having modified sugar moieties include, without limitation, nucleosides
comprising 5'-vinyl, 5'-methyl (R or S), 4-S, 2'-F, 2'-OCH 3, and 2'-O(CH 2)20CH3 substituent groups. The
substituent at the 2' position can also be selected from allyl, amino, azido, thio, 0-allyl, 0-C1-Cio alkyl,
OCF 3, O(CH 2)2SCH 3, O(CH 2)2-0-N(Rm)(Rn), and O-CH 2-C(=O)-N(Rm)(Rn), where each Rm and Rn is,
independently, H or substituted or unsubstituted C1-Cio alkyl.
         As used herein, "bicyclic nucleosides" refer to modified nucleosides comprising a bicyclic sugar
moiety. Examples of bicyclic nucleosides include, without limitation, nucleosides comprising a bridge
between the 4' and the 2' ribosyl ring atoms. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds provided herein
include one or more bicyclic nucleosides wherein the bridge comprises a 4' to 2' bicyclic nucleoside.

modified nucleobases are capable of participating in hydrogen bonding. Such nucleobase modifications may
impart nuclease stability, binding affinity or some other beneficial biological property to antisense
compounds. Modified nucleobases include synthetic and natural nucleobases such as, for example, 5
methylcytosine (5-me-C). Certain nucleobase substitutions, including 5-methylcytosine substitutions, are
particularly useful for increasing the binding affinity of an antisense compound for a target nucleic acid. For
example, 5-methylcytosine substitutions have been shown to increase nucleic acid duplex stability by 0.6
 1.2'C (Sanghvi, Y.S., Crooke, S.T. and Lebleu, B., eds., Antisense Research andApplications, CRC Press,
Boca Raton, 1993, pp. 276-278).
         Additional unmodified nucleobases include 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2
aminoadenine, 6-methyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-propyl and other alkyl
derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine and 2-thiocytosine, 5-halouracil and cytosine,

substituted uracils and cytosines, 7-methylguanine and 7-methyladenine, 2-F-adenine, 2-amino-adenine, 8
azaguanine and 8-azaadenine, 7-deazaguanine and 7-deazaadenine and 3-deazaguanine and 3-deazaadenine.
         Heterocyclic base moieties may also include those in which the purine or pyrimidine base is replaced
with other heterocycles, for example 7-deaza-adenine, 7-deazaguanosine, 2-aminopyridine and 2-pyridone.
Nucleobases that are particularly useful for increasing the binding affinity of antisense compounds include 5
substituted pyrimidines, 6-azapyrimidines and N-2, N-6 and 0-6 substituted purines, including 2
aminopropyladenine, 5-propynyluracil and 5-propynylcytosine.

modified nucleobases. In certain embodiments, gap-widened antisense oligonucleotides targeted to a GCCR
nucleic acid comprise one or more modified nucleobases. In certain embodiments, the modified nucleobase
is 5-methylcytosine. In certain embodiments, each cytosine is a 5-methylcytosine.
Compositions andMethods for FormulatingPharmaceuticalCompositions
         Antisense oligonucleotides may be admixed with pharmaceutically acceptable active or inert
substance for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions or formulations. Compositions and methods for
the formulation of pharmaceutical compositions are dependent upon a number of criteria, including, but not
limited to, route of administration, extent of disease, or dose to be administered.
         Antisense compound targeted to a GCCR nucleic acid can be utilized in pharmaceutical compositions
by combining the antisense compound with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. A
pharmaceutically acceptable diluent includes phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). PBS is a diluent suitable for
use in compositions to be delivered parenterally. Accordingly, in one embodiment employed in the methods
                                                         53

      WO 2013/063313                                                                   PCT/US2012/061984
described herein, is a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antisense compound targeted to a GCCR
nucleic acid and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically
acceptable diluent is PBS. In certain embodiments, the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide.
          Pharmaceutical compositions comprising antisense compounds encompass any pharmaceutically
acceptable salts, esters, or salts of such esters, or any other oligonucleotide which, upon administration to an
animal, including a human, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) the biologically active metabolite
or residue thereof Accordingly, for example, the disclosure is also drawn to pharmaceutically acceptable
salts of antisense compounds, prodrugs, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such prodrugs, and other
bioequivalents. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, sodium and
potassium salts.
          Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein may be prepared by methods
well-known in the art. For a review of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, see Stahl and Wermuth, Handbook
of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002). Sodium
salts of antisense oligonucleotides are useful and are well accepted for therapeutic administration to humans.
Accordingly, in one embodiment the compounds described herein are in the form of a sodium salt.
         A prodrug can include the incorporation of additional nucleosides at one or both ends of an antisense
compound which are cleaved by endogenous nucleases within the body, to form the active antisense
compound.
ConjugatedAntisense Compounds
         Antisense compounds may be covalently linked to one or more moieties or conjugates which enhance
the activity, cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the resulting antisense oligonucleotides. Typical
conjugate groups include cholesterol moieties and lipid moieties. Additional conjugate groups include
carbohydrates, phospholipids, biotin, phenazine, folate, phenanthridine, anthraquinone, acridine, fluoresceins,
rhodamines, coumarins, and dyes.
         Antisense compounds can also be modified to have one or more stabilizing groups that are generally
attached to one or both termini of antisense compounds to enhance properties such as, for example, nuclease
stability. Included in stabilizing groups are cap structures. These terminal modifications protect the antisense
compound having terminal nucleic acid from exonuclease degradation, and can help in delivery and/or
localization within a cell. The cap can be present at the 5'-terminus (5'-cap), or at the 3'-terminus (3'-cap), or
can be present on both termini. Cap structures are well known in the art and include, for example, inverted
deoxy abasic caps. Further 3' and 5-stabilizing groups that can be used to cap one or both ends of an
antisense compound to impart nuclease stability include those disclosed in WO 03/004602 published on
January 16, 2003.

         The effects of antisense compounds on the level, activity or expression of GCCR nucleic acids can be
tested in vitro in a variety of cell types. Cell types used for such analyses are available from commercial
vendors (e.g. American Type Culture Collection, Manassus, VA; Zen-Bio, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC;
Clonetics Corporation, Walkersville, MD) and cells are cultured according to the vendor's instructions using
commercially available reagents (e.g. Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Illustrative cell types
include, but are not limited to, HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes.
In vitro testing ofantisense oligonucleotides
         Described herein are methods for treatment of cells with antisense oligonucleotides, which can be
modified appropriately for treatment with other antisense compounds.
         In general, cells are treated with antisense oligonucleotides when the cells reach approximately 60
80% confluence in culture.
         One reagent commonly used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells includes the
cationic lipid transfection reagent LIPOFECTIN@ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Antisense oligonucleotides
are mixed with LIPOFECTIN@ in OPTI-MEM@ 1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to achieve the desired final
concentration of antisense oligonucleotide and a LIPOFECTIN@ concentration that typically ranges 2 to 12
ug/mL per 100 nM antisense oligonucleotide.
         Another reagent used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells includes
LIPOFECTAMINE 2000@ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Antisense oligonucleotide is mixed with
LIPOFECTAMINE 2000@ in OPTI-MEM@ 1 reduced serum medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to achieve
the desired concentration of antisense oligonucleotide and a LIPOFECTAMINE@ concentration that
typically ranges 2 to 12 ug/mL per 100 nM antisense oligonucleotide.
         Another reagent used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells includes Cytofectin@
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Antisense oligonucleotide is mixed with Cytofectin@ in OPTI-MEM@ 1 reduced
serum medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to achieve the desired concentration of antisense oligonucleotide
and a Cytofectin@ concentration that typically ranges 2 to 12 ug/mL per 100 nM antisense oligonucleotide.
         Another technique used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells includes
electroporation.
         Cells are treated with antisense oligonucleotides by routine methods. Cells are typically harvested
 16-24 hours after antisense oligonucleotide treatment, at which time RNA or protein levels of target nucleic
acids are measured by methods known in the art and described herein. In general, when treatments are
performed in multiple replicates, the data are presented as the average of the replicate treatments.
         The concentration of antisense oligonucleotide used varies from cell line to cell line. Methods to
determine the optimal antisense oligonucleotide concentration for a particular cell line are well known in the
art. Antisense oligonucleotides are typically used at concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 300 nM when
                                                          55

      WO 2013/063313                                                                 PCT/US2012/061984
transfected with LIPOFECTAMINE2000@, Lipofectin or Cytofectin. Antisense oligonucleotides are used at
higher concentrations ranging from 625 to 20,000 nM when transfected using electroporation.
RNA Isolation
         RNA analysis can be performed on total cellular RNA or poly(A)+ mRNA. Methods of RNA
isolation are well known in the art. RNA is prepared using methods well known in the art, for example, using
the TRIZOL@ Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocols.
Analysis of inhibition of target levels or expression
         Inhibition of levels or expression of a GCCR nucleic acid can be assayed in a variety of ways known
in the art. For example, target nucleic acid levels can be quantitated by, e.g., Northern blot analysis,
competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or quantitative real-time PCR. RNA analysis can be
performed on total cellular RNA or poly(A)+ mRNA. Methods of RNA isolation are well known in the art.
Northern blot analysis is also routine in the art. Quantitative real-time PCR can be conveniently accomplished
using the commercially available ABI PRISM@ 7600, 7700, or 7900 Sequence Detection System, available
from PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA and used according to manufacturer's instructions.
QuantitativeReal-Time PCR Analysis of Target RNA Levels
         Quantitation of target RNA levels may be accomplished by quantitative real-time PCR using the ABI
PRISM@ 7600, 7700, or 7900 Sequence Detection System (PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
according to manufacturer's instructions. Methods of quantitative real-time PCR are well known in the art.
         Prior to real-time PCR, the isolated RNA is subjected to a reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction, which
produces complementary DNA (cDNA) that is then used as the substrate for the real-time PCR amplification.
The RT and real-time PCR reactions are performed sequentially in the same sample well. RT and real-time
PCR reagents are obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). RT, real-time-PCR reactions are carried out by
methods well known to those skilled in the art.
         Gene (or RNA) target quantities obtained by real time PCR are normalized using either the
expression level of a gene whose expression is constant, such as cyclophilin A, or by quantifying total RNA
using RIBOGREEN@ (Invitrogen, Inc. Carlsbad, CA). Cyclophilin A expression is quantified by real time
PCR, by being run simultaneously with the target, multiplexing, or separately. Total RNA is quantified using
RIBOGREEN@ RNA quantification reagent (Invitrogen, Inc. Eugene, OR). Methods of RNA quantification
by RIBOGREEN@ are taught in Jones, L.J., et al, (Analytical Biochemistry, 1998, 265, 368-374). A
CYTOFLUOR@ 4000 instrument (PE Applied Biosystems) is used to measure RIBOGREEN@ fluorescence.
         Probes and primers are designed to hybridize to a GCCR nucleic acid. Methods for designing real
time PCR probes and primers are well known in the art, and may include the use of software such as
PRIMER EXPRESS Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Analysis of ProteinLevels
         Antisense inhibition of GCCR nucleic acids can be assessed by measuring GCCR protein levels.
Protein levels of GCCR can be evaluated or quantitated in a variety of ways well known in the art, such as
immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis (immunoblotting), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA), quantitative protein assays, protein activity assays (for example, caspase activity assays),
immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Antibodies
directed to a target can be identified and obtained from a variety of sources, such as the MSRS catalog of
antibodies (Aerie Corporation, Birmingham, MI), or can be prepared via conventional monoclonal or
polyclonal antibody generation methods well known in the art. Antibodies useful for the detection of human
and rat GCCR are commercially available.
In vivo testing ofantisense compounds
         Antisense compounds, for example, antisense oligonucleotides, are tested in animals to assess their
ability to inhibit expression of GCCR and produce phenotypic changes. Testing may be performed in normal
animals, or in experimental disease models. For administration to animals, antisense oligonucleotides are
formulated in a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, such as phosphate-buffered saline. Administration
includes parenteral routes of administration. Following a period of treatment with antisense oligonucleotides,
RNA is isolated from tissue and changes in GCCR nucleic acid expression are measured. Changes in GCCR
protein levels are also measured.

          The antisense compounds provided herein can be included in a pharmaceutical composition or
formulation. The pharmaceutical composition can include any pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, or
salts of such esters, or any other compound which, upon administration to an animal, including a human, is
capable of providing (directly or indirectly) the biologically active metabolite or residue thereof.
          The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to physiologically and pharmaceutically
acceptable salts of the compounds provided herein: i.e., salts that retain the desired biological activity of the
parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological effects thereto. The term "pharmaceutically
acceptable salt" includes a salt prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids or bases, including
inorganic or organic acids and bases. For oligonucleotides, preferred examples of pharmaceutically
acceptable salts and their uses are further described in U.S. Patent 6,287,860, which is incorporated herein in
its entirety. Sodium salts have been shown to be suitable forms of oligonucleotide drugs.

         The pharmaceutical formulations described herein, which may conveniently be presented in unit
dosage form, may be prepared according to conventional techniques well known in the pharmaceutical
industry. Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the active ingredients with the
pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient(s). In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and
intimately bringing into association the active ingredients with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers
or both.
         The compositions described herein may also be formulated as suspensions in aqueous, non-aqueous
or mixed media. The suspension may also contain stabilizers.
         Pharmaceutical compositions described herein include, but are not limited to, solutions, emulsions,
and liposome-containing formulations. The pharmaceutical compositions and formulations described herein
may comprise one or more penetration enhancers, carriers, excipients or other active or inactive ingredients.
         Formulations include liposomal formulations. As used in the present invention, the term "liposome"
means a vesicle composed of amphiphilic lipids arranged in a spherical bilayer or bilayers. Liposomes are
unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles which have a membrane formed from a lipophilic material and an
aqueous interior that contains the composition to be delivered. Cationic liposomes are positively charged
liposomes which are believed to interact with negatively charged DNA molecules to form a stable complex.
Liposomes that are pH-sensitive or negatively-charged are believed to entrap DNA rather than complex with
it. Both cationic and noncationic liposomes have been used to deliver DNA to cells.
         Liposomes also include "sterically stabilized" liposomes, a term which, as used herein, refers to
liposomes comprising one or more specialized lipids that, when incorporated into liposomes, result in
enhanced circulation lifetimes relative to liposomes lacking such specialized lipids. Liposomes and their uses
are further described in U.S. Patent 6,287,860, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.
         In another embodiment, formulations include saline formulations. In certain embodiments, a
formulation consists of the compounds described herein and saline. In certain embodiments, a formulation
consists essentially of the compounds described herein and saline. In certain embodiments, the saline is
pharmaceutically acceptable grade saline. In certain embodiments, the saline is buffered saline. In certain
embodiments, the saline is phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
         In certain embodiments, a formulation excludes liposomes. In certain embodiments, the formulation
excludes sterically stabilized liposomes. In certain embodiments, a formulation excludes phospholipids. In

         In one embodiment, the present invention employs various penetration enhancers to affect the
efficient delivery of nucleic acids, particularly oligonucleotides. Penetration enhancers and their uses are
further described in U.S. Patent 6,287,860, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.
          Compositions and formulations for parenteral administration, including intravenous, subcutaneous
and intramuscular injection or infusion may include sterile aqueous solutions which may also contain buffers,
diluents and other suitable additives such as, but not limited to, penetration enhancers, carrier compounds and
other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.
         In another related embodiment, compositions provided herein may contain one or more antisense
compounds, particularly oligonucleotides, targeted to a first nucleic acid and one or more additional antisense
compounds targeted to a second nucleic acid target. Alternatively, compositions provided herein may contain
two or more antisense compounds targeted to different regions of the same nucleic acid target. Numerous
examples of antisense compounds are known in the art. Two or more combined compounds may be used
together or sequentially.
Dosing
         Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease state to be treated, with the course
of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of the
disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug
accumulation in the body of the patient. Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of
individual oligonucleotides, and can generally be estimated based on EC50s found to be effective in in vitro
and in vivo animal models. In general, dosage is from 0.01 ig to 100 g per kg of body weight, and may be
given once or more daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, or at desired intervals. Following successful treatment,
it may be desirable to have the patient undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease
state, wherein the oligonucleotide is administered in maintenance doses, ranging from 0.01 ig to 100 g per kg
of body weight, once or more daily.
         While the present invention has been described with specificity in accordance with certain of its
preferred embodiments, the following examples serve only to illustrate the invention and are not intended to

CertainCompounds
           About seven hundred and sixty newly designed and previously disclosed antisense compounds of
various lengths, motifs and backbone composition were tested for their effect on human GCCR mRNA in
vitro in several cell types (Examples 1 and 2). The new compounds were compared with previously designed
compounds, including ISIS 377131, ISIS 361137, ISIS 361141, ISIS 361151, ISIS 361155, and ISIS 361156
                                                         64

       WO 2013/063313                                                                        PCT/US2012/061984
which have previously been determined to be some of the most potent antisense compounds in vitro (see e.g.,
PCT Pub. No. WO 2007/035759). Of the about seven hundred and sixty newly designed and previously
designed antisense compounds, only those compounds which were selected for further study based on in vitro
activity are presented.
          Fifteen of these compounds were selected and additional new compounds were designed based on
these compounds. The 317 new compounds were designed by creating compounds shifted slightly upstream
and downstream (i.e. microwalk) of the original compounds. The new and original compounds were tested
using electroporation for transfection and separately using lipofectin as the transfection reagent (Example 3).
Of the 332 compounds tested, only those compounds which were selected for further study based on in vitro
activity are presented. The 72 compounds selected for dose response assay were tested by individually using
electroporation and lipofectin as the transfection reagents (Example 4). In the dose response assays described
in Examples 4 and 5, several exemplary compounds were found to be more potent than the benchmark
compound, ISIS 377131. Twenty nine compounds were selected for a dose response assay with
electroporation as the transfection reagent (Example 5), from which twelve oligonucleotides were selected for
in vivo rodent tolerability studies.
          Twelve compounds, ISIS 420470 (SEQ ID NO: 6), ISIS 420476 (SEQ ID NO: 7), ISIS 426115 (SEQ
ID NO: 36), ISIS 426130 (SEQ ID NO: 33), ISIS 426168 (SEQ ID NO: 39), ISIS 426172 (SEQ ID NO: 42),
ISIS 426183 (SEQ ID NO: 10), ISIS 426246 (SEQ ID NO: 11), ISIS 426261 (SEQ ID NO: 10), ISIS 426262
(SEQ ID NO: 35), ISIS 426267 (SEQ ID NO: 43), and ISIS 426325 (SEQ ID NO: 42), were tested for
tolerability in a CD1 mouse model, as well as a Sprague-Dawley rat model. The compound ISIS 377131
(SEQ ID NO: 4) was carried forward as a benchmark. The compounds are complementary to the regions
57825-57844, 59956-59975, 63677-63696, 65938-65957, 65939-65958, 65940-65959, 76224-76243, 76229
76248, 76255-76274, and 95513-95532 of SEQ ID NO: 1.
          Liver function markers, such as alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and bilirubin, and
kidney function markers, such as BUN and creatinine, as well as markers of inflammation were measured
(Examples 6 and 7). The 13 compounds were also assayed for long-term effects on tolerability in a CD/1GS
rat model for 12 weeks (Example 8). Liver function markers, such as alanine transaminase and aspartate
transaminase, and kidney function markers, such as urine protein to creatinine were measured.
          Final evaluation of these rodent tolerability studies (Examples 6-8) led to the selection of all twelve
of the compounds for additional studies.
          Due to having advantageous properties including in vitro potency and in vivo tolerability, in certain
embodiments the compounds provided herein have a nucleobase sequence containing a portion of at least an
8, at least a 9, at least a 10, at least an 11, at least a 12, at least a 14, at least a 15, at least a 16, at least a 17, at
least a 18, at least a 19 or at least a 20 contiguous nucleobases of one of SEQ ID NOs: 6, 7, 36, 33, 39, 42, 10,
 11, 35 and 43. In certain embodiments, the compounds have a nucleobase sequence containing a portion of at
                                                              65

least an 8, at least a 9, at least a 10, at least an 11, at least a 12, at least a 14, at least a 15, at least a 16, at
least a 17, at least a 18, at least a 19 or at least a 20 contiguous nucleobases complementary to an equal length
portion of one of the regions 57825-57844, 59956-59975, 63677-63696, 65938-65957, 65939-65958, 65940
65959, 76224-76243, 76225-76244, 76229-76248, and 95513-95532 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In certain
embodiments, the compounds targeting the listed regions or having a nucleobase portion of a sequence
recited in the listed SEQ ID NOs can be of various length, as further described herein, and can have one of
various motifs, as further described herein. In certain embodiments, a compound has the specific length and
motif, as indicated by the ISIS NOs: 420470, 426476, 426115, 426130, 426168, 426172, 426183, 426246,
426261, 426262, 426267, and 426325.
         These twelve compounds were tested for activity, pharmacokinetic profile and tolerability in
cynomolgus monkeys (Example 9). Treatment with some of the compounds caused reduction of GCCR
mRNA expression in liver tissue. Specifically, treatment with ISIS 420476, ISIS 426115, and ISIS 426325
caused significant reduction of GCCR mRNA expression in liver tissue, compared to the PBS control.
         Tolerability studies in cynomolgus monkeys (Example 9) were also performed, with measurements
of body and organ weights; measurements of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels to assess
liver function; measurements of BUN and creatinine levels to assess renal function; measurements of CRP
and immune cell counts to assess inflammation status; and measurement of oligonucleotide concentrations in
the liver and kidney to assess pharmacokinetics of the compounds. Treatment with ISIS 426115 was well
tolerated, as indicated by baseline values of all the parameters listed above.
         Viscosity of ISIS 420476, ISIS 426115 and ISIS 426325 was also measured (Example 10) and found
to be optimal in all three cases.
         Accordingly, provided herein are antisense compounds with any one or more of the improved
characteristics. In a certain embodiments, the compounds as described herein are efficacious by virtue of
having at least one of an in vitro IC 50 in a human cell of less than 3 iM, less than 2.5 iM, less than 2 iM,
less than 1.5 pM, less than 1 pM, when delivered to a HepG2 cell line using electroporation, as described in
Examples 4 and 5. In certain embodiments, the compounds as described herein are efficacious by virtue of
having at least one of an in vitro IC 50 in a human cell of less than 50 nM, less than 45 nM less than 40 nM,
less than 35 nM less than 30 nM, less than 25 nM less than 20 nM, when delivered to a HepG2 cell line using
lipofectin reagent, as described in Example 4. In certain embodiments, the compounds as described herein are
highly tolerable, as demonstrated by having at least one of an increase of ALT or AST value of no more than
50 fold, no more than 40 fold, no more than 30 fold, no more than 20 fold, no more than 10 fold, no more
than 5 fold, no more than, no more than 4 fold, no more than 3 fold, or no more than 2 fold over saline treated
animals; or an increase in liver, spleen or kidney weight of no more than 30%, no more than 20%, no more
than 15%, no more than 12%, no more than 10%, 5 no more than % or no more than 2%.

While certain compounds, compositions and methods described herein have been described with specificity
in accordance with certain embodiments, the following examples serve only to illustrate the compounds
described herein and are not intended to limit the same. Each of the references recited in the present
application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Example 1: Antisense inhibition of human glucocorticoid receptor (GCCR) in HepG2 cells
          Antisense oligonucleotides were designed to target a human GCCR nucleic acid and were tested for
their effects on GCCR mRNA in vitro. ISIS 377131, previously described in PCT Pub No. W02005/071080,
was also included in the assay. Cultured HepG2 cells at a density of 10,000 cells per well were transfected
using lipofectin reagent with 120 nM antisense oligonucleotide. After a treatment period of approximately 24
hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and GCCR mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time
PCR using human primer probe set RTS 1408 (forward sequence
GGAGATCATATAGACAATCAAGTGCAA, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 58; reverse sequence
GGGTAGAGTCATTCTCTGCTCATTAA, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 29; probe sequence
CTGTGTTTTGCTCCTGATCTGAT, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 60). GCCR mRNA levels were
adjusted according to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN@. Results are presented as percent
inhibition of GCCR, relative to untreated control cells. Of the 460 oligonucleotides tested, only those selected
for further studies are presented.
         The newly designed chimeric antisense oligonucleotides in Table 1 were designed as 5-10-5 MOE
gapmers. The gapmers are 20 nucleosides in length, wherein the central gap segment comprises of ten 2'
deoxynucleosides and is flanked on both sides (in the 5' and 3' directions) by wings comprising five
nucleosides each. Each nucleoside in the 5' wing segment and each nucleoside in the 3' wing segment has a
2'-MOE modification. The internucleoside linkages throughout each gapmer are phosphorothioate (P=S)
linkages. All cytosine residues throughout each gapmer are 5-methylcytosines. "Human Target start site"
indicates the 5'-most nucleoside to which the gapmer is targeted in the human gene sequence. The gapmers
were targeted to intronic sequences or intron-exon junctions of the human GCCR genomic sequence,
designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 1 (the complement of GENBANK Accession No. NT_029289.10 truncated
from nucleotides 3818000 to 3980000). The data indicates that antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the
intronic regions of SEQ ID NO: 1 significantly reduce GCCR mRNA levels.

377131, ISIS 361143, and ISIS 361155, previously described in PCT Pub No. WO2005/071080, were also
included in the assay. Cultured HepG2 cells at a density of 10,000 cells per well were transfected using
lipofectin reagent with 120 nM antisense oligonucleotide. After a treatment period of approximately 24
hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and GCCR mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time
PCR using human primer probe set RTS 1408. GCCR mRNA levels were adjusted according to total RNA

         Additional gapmers were designed based on the gapmers presented in Tables 1 and 2. These gapmers
were designed by creating gapmers shifted slightly upstream and downstream (i.e. "microwalk") of the
original gapmers from Tables 1 and 2. Gapmers were also created with various motifs, e.g. 5-10-5 MOE, 3
14-3 MOE, and 2-13-5 MOE motifs. These gapmers were tested in vitro. Cultured HepG2 cells at a density
of 20,000 cells per well were transfected using electroporation with 2,000 nM antisense oligonucleotide.
After a treatment period of approximately 24 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and GCCR mRNA
levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The human primer probe set RTS 1408 was used to
measure GCCR mRNA levels. GCCR mRNA levels were adjusted according to total RNA content, as
measured by RIBOGREEN*. Results are presented as percent inhibition of GCCR, relative to untreated
control cells. The results are presented in Table 3.
         The gapmers were also tested for their activity using lipofectin as the transfection reagent. Cultured
HepG2 cells at a density of 10,000 cells per well were transfected using lipofectin with 50 nM antisense
oligonucleotide. After a treatment period of approximately 24 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and
GCCR mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The human primer probe set RTS 1408
was used to measure GCCR mRNA levels. GCCR mRNA levels were adjusted according to total RNA
content, as measured by RIBOGREEN*. Results are presented as percent inhibition of GCCR, relative to
untreated control cells. The results are also presented in Table 3.
         The chimeric antisense oligonucleotides in Table 3 were designed as 5-10-5 MOE, 3-14-3 MOE, or
2-13-5 MOE gapmers. The gapmers designated with an asterisk (*) in Table 3 are the original gapmers from
                                                        69

which gapmers, ISIS 426106-426405, were designed via microwalk. ISIS 377131 was included in this assay
and the activity of the newly designed gapmers was compared to the activity of ISIS 377131. The 5-10-5
gapmers are 20 nucleosides in length, wherein the central gap segment is comprised of ten 2'
deoxynucleosides and is flanked on both sides (in the 5' and 3' directions) by wings comprising five
nucleosides each. The 3-14-3 gapmers are 20 nucleosides in length, wherein the central gap segment is
comprised of fourteen 2'-deoxynucleosides and is flanked on both sides (in the 5' and 3' directions) by wings
comprising three nucleosides each. The 2-13-5 gapmers are 20 nucleosides in length, wherein the central gap
segment is comprised of thirteen 2'-deoxynucleosides and is flanked on the 5' and the 3' directions with
wings comprising two and five nucleosides respectively. For each of the motifs (5-10-5, 3-14-3, and 2-113
5), each nucleoside in the 5' wing segment and each nucleoside in the 3' wing segment has a 2'-MOE
modification. The internucleoside linkages throughout each gapmer are phosphorothioate (P=S) linkages.
All cytosine residues throughout each gapmer are 5-methylcytosines. "Target start site" indicates the 5'-most
nucleoside to which the gapmer is targeted. Each gapmer listed in Table 3 is targeted to SEQ ID NO: 1 (the
complement of GENBANK Accession No. NT_029289.10 truncated from nucleotides 3818000 to 3980000).
Only those gapmers which were selected for further studies are presented.

Example 4: Dose-dependent antisense inhibition of human GCCR in HepG2 cells
         Gapmers from Example 3 exhibiting significant in vitro inhibition of human GCCR were tested under
various conditions in HepG2 cells. Cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells per well and transfected
using electroporation with 0.8 pM, 1.5 pM, 3.0 pM, or 6.0 pM concentrations of antisense oligonucleotide,
as specified in Table 4. After a treatment period of approximately 16 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells
and GCCR mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Human GCCR primer probe set
RTS 1408 was used to measure mRNA levels. GCCR mRNA levels were adjusted according to total RNA
content, as measured by RIBOGREEN*. Results are presented as percent inhibition of GCCR, relative to
untreated control cells.

         The gapmers were also tested at various doses in HepG2 cells using the transfection reagent,
lipofectin. Cells were plated at a density of 10,000 cells per well and transfected using lipofectin reagent with
17.5 nM, 35 nM, 70 nM or 140 nM concentrations of antisense oligonucleotide, as specified in Table 5.
After a treatment period of approximately 16 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and GCCR mRNA
levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Human GCCR primer probe set RTS 1408 was used to
measure mRNA levels. GCCR mRNA levels were adjusted according to total RNA content, as measured by
RIBOGREEN*. Results are presented as percent inhibition of GCCR, relative to untreated control cells.
         The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 5 0 ) of each oligonucleotide is also presented in Tables 4
and 5, and was calculated by plotting the concentrations of oligonucleotides used versus the percent inhibition
of GCCR mRNA expression achieved at each concentration, and noting the concentration of oligonucleotide
at which 50% inhibition of GCCR mRNA expression was achieved compared to the control. As illustrated in
Tables 4 and 5, GCCR mRNA levels were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner in antisense
oligonucleotide treated cells. Certain exemplary compounds demonstrated greater potency than the
benchmark, ISIS 377131.

Example 5: Dose-dependent antisense inhibition of human GCCR in HepG2 cells
         Gapmers selected from Example 4 were tested at various doses in HepG2 cells. Cells were plated at
a density of 20,000 cells per well and transfected using electroporation with 0.5 iM, 1.0 pM, 2.0 pM, 4.0
pM or 8.0 pM concentrations of antisense oligonucleotide, as specified in Table 6. After a treatment period
of approximately 16 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and GCCR mRNA levels were measured by
quantitative real-time PCR. Human GCCR primer probe set RTS 1408 was used to measure mRNA levels.
GCCR mRNA levels were adjusted according to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN*. Results
are presented as percent inhibition of GCCR, relative to untreated control cells. As illustrated in Table 6,
GCCR mRNA levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner in antisense oligonucleotide treated cells.
Certain exemplary compounds demonstrated greater potency than the benchmark ISIS 377131.

Example 6: Tolerability of antisense oligonucleotides targeting human GCCR in CD1 mice
         CD1@ mice (Charles River, MA) are a multipurpose model of mice frequently utilized for safety and
efficacy testing. The mice were treated with ISIS antisense oligonucleotides selected from the study described
in Example 5, and evaluated for changes in the levels of various markers.
Treatment
         Eight-week old male CD 1 mice were maintained at a 12-hour light/dark cycle and fed Purina mouse
chow 5001 ad libitum. The mice were acclimated for at least 7 days in the research facility before initiation of
the experiment. Groups of four CD 1 mice each were injected subcutaneously twice a week for 4 weeks with
50 mg/kg of ISIS 377131, ISIS 420470, ISIS 420476, ISIS 426115, ISIS 426130, ISIS 426168, ISIS 426172,
ISIS 426183, ISIS 426246, ISIS 426261, ISIS 426262, ISIS 426267, or ISIS 426325. Blood samples were
collected via tail snip prior to dosing and at weeks 2, 3, and 4 after dosing. Three days after the last dose at
each time point, mice were euthanized and organs and plasma were harvested for further analysis. Mice
treated with ISIS 426267 died before the end of the study. Therefore, samples from mice treated with ISIS
426267 was not included in any assay
Plasma chemistry
         To evaluate the effect of ISIS oligonucleotides on liver and kidney function, plasma levels of
transaminases, cholesterol, glucose, and triglycerides were measured using an automated clinical chemistry
analyzer (Hitachi Olympus AU400e, Melville, NY).          Plasma levels of ALT (alanine transaminase) and AST
(aspartate transaminase) were measured and the results are presented in Tables 7 and 8 expressed in IU/L.
Plasma levels of cholesterol, glucose and triglycerides were also measured using the same clinical chemistry
analyzer and the results are also presented in Tables 9, 10, and 11.

Example 7: Tolerability of antisense oligonucleotides targeting human GCCR in Sprague-Dawley rats
       Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with ISIS antisense oligonucleotides from the study described in
Example 6 and evaluated for changes in the levels of various markers.
Treatment

         Eight week-old male rats were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and fed Purina normal rat
chow ad libitum. Animals were acclimated at least 7 days in the research facility before the initiation of the
experiment. Groups of four Sprague-Dawley rats each were injected subcutaneously twice a week with 50
mg/kg of ISIS 377131, ISIS 420470, ISIS 420476, ISIS 426115, ISIS 426130, ISIS 426168, ISIS 426172,
ISIS 426183, ISIS 426246, ISIS 426261, ISIS 426262, ISIS 426267, or ISIS 426325. Blood samples were
collected via tail snip prior to dosing and at weeks 2, 3, and 4 after dosing. Three days after the last dose at
each time point, rats were euthanized and organs and plasma were harvested for further analysis.
Plasmachemistry
         To evaluate the effect of ISIS oligonucleotides on liver and kidney function, plasma levels of
transaminases, cholesterol, glucose, and triglycerides were measured using an automated clinical chemistry
analyzer (Hitachi Olympus AU400e, Melville, NY).         Plasma levels of ALT (alanine transaminase) and AST
(aspartate transaminase) were measured and the results are presented in Tables 12 and 13, expressed in IU/L.
Plasma levels of cholesterol, glucose and triglycerides were also measured using the same clinical chemistry
analyzer and the results are also presented in Tables 14-16, expressed in mg/dL. 'n/a' indicates that the
plasma chemistry marker for that particular time point had not been measured.

Example 8: Long-term tolerability of antisense oligonucleotides targeting human GCCR in CD/1GS
rats
         CD/1GS rats were treated for 12 weeks with ISIS antisense oligonucleotides selected from the studies
described in Examples 6 and 7, and evaluated for changes in the levels of various markers.
Treatment
         Eight week-old male rats were placed in metabolic cages, maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle
and fed Purina normal rat chow ad libitum. Animals were acclimated at least 7 days in the research facility
before the initiation of the experiment. Groups of four rats each were injected subcutaneously twice a week
for 12 weeks with 30 mg/kg of ISIS 377131, ISIS 420470, ISIS 420476, ISIS 426115, ISIS 426130, ISIS
426168, ISIS 426172, ISIS 426183, ISIS 426246, ISIS 426261, ISIS 426262, ISIS 426267, or ISIS 426325.
Blood samples were collected via tail snip prior to dosing and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 after dosing.

Three days after the last dose at each time point, rats were euthanized and organs and plasma were harvested
for further analysis. Rats treated with ISIS 426267 died before the end of the study. Therefore, ISIS 426267
was not included in any further studies.
Liver function
         To evaluate the effect of ISIS oligonucleotides on liver function, plasma levels of transaminases,
cholesterol, glucose, and triglycerides were measured using an automated clinical chemistry analyzer (Hitachi
Olympus AU400e, Melville, NY). The plasma levels of ALT and AST taken at week 12 are presented in
Table 17, expressed as fold increase over the values of the PBS control. None of the antisense
oligonucleotides caused any changes in any plasma chemistry markers outside the expected range for
antisense oligonucleotides.

ratio taken at week 12. Those antisense oligonucleotides that did not cause any changes in any renal
metabolic marker outside the expected range for antisense oligonucleotides were selected for further study.

         The results of both the mouse and rat studies indicated that ISIS 426115 was the most well tolerated
antisense oligonucleotide targeting GCCR.
Example 9: Tolerability of ISIS antisense oligonucleotides targeting human GCCR in cynomolgus
monkeys
         Cynomolgus monkeys were treated with ISIS antisense oligonucleotides from studies described in
Examples 6, 7, and 8. Antisense oligonucleotide activity and tolerability was evaluated.
         The human oligonucleotides selected are fully cross-reactive with rhesus monkey gene sequences.
The greater the complementarity between the human oligonucleotide and the rhesus monkey sequence, the
more likely the human oligonucleotide can cross-react with the rhesus monkey sequence. The human
oligonucleotides were compared to the rhesus monkey genomic sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2; the complement of
GENBANK Accession No. NW_001120987.1 truncated from nucleotides 1334000 to 1491000), based on
similarity to human exons, and the results are displayed in Table 19. "Rhesus start site" indicates the 5'-most
nucleotide to which the gapmer is targeted in the rhesus monkey gene sequence.

Treatment
         The study was conducted at WuXi PharmaTech testing facility, People's Republic of China. Male 2-5
year-old cynomolgous monkeys were tested twice for tuberculosis before being used for the study and were
quarantined for at least 14 days prior to the initiation of dosing. Twenty four groups of five randomly
assigned male cynomolgus monkeys each were injected subcutaneously thrice per week for the first week,
and subsequently once a week for the next 11 weeks, with either 8 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg of ISIS 420470, ISIS
420476, ISIS 426115, ISIS 426130, ISIS 426168, ISIS 426172, ISIS 426183, ISIS 426246, ISIS 426261, ISIS
426262, ISIS 426267, or ISIS 426325. A control group of 16 cynomolgus monkeys was injected with PBS
subcutaneously thrice per week for the first week, and subsequently once a week for the next 11 weeks.
         During the study period, the monkeys were observed daily for signs of illness or distress. Any animal
showing adverse effects to the treatment was removed and referred to the veterinarian and Study Director.
Clinical observations and mortality checks were performed pre-dose and at least once a day during the dosing
regimen. Body weights were measured once a week. Blood samples were collected 5 days before the
treatment as well as on various days of the study period and analyzed. The animals were fasted for at least 13
hours (overnight) prior to blood collection. Blood was collected by venipuncture from a peripheral vein from
restrained, conscious animals. Terminal sacrifices of all groups were conducted on day 86, which was 48
hours after the last dose.

Protein analysis
         Approximately 1 mL of blood was collected from all available animals at week 11 and placed in
tubes containing the potassium salt of EDTA. The tubes were centrifuged (3000 rpm for 10 min at room
temperature) to obtain plasma. GCCR protein levels were measured in the plasma by western analysis using
Santa Cruz sc-1003 rabbit polyclonal antibody. The results are presented in Table 21, expressed as percentage
inhibition compared to the PBS control levels. The results indicate that ISIS 426325, ISIS 420476, and ISIS
426115 significantly reduced GCCR protein levels.

Liver function
         To evaluate the effect of ISIS oligonucleotides on hepatic function, blood samples were collected
from all the study groups on week 11. Approximately 3 mL of blood was collected from fasted animals and
placed in tubes for serum separation. Serum was obtained by stabilization of the tubes at room temperature
for 30-80 min followed by centrifugation (2,000 g x 15 minutes at room temperature). Levels of
transaminases were measured using a Hitachi-917/911 chemistry analyzer. Plasma levels of ALT and AST
were measured and the results are presented in Table 23, expressed in IU/L. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
which is synthesized in increased amounts by damaged liver cells and is also a marker of liver disease, was
similarly measured. The data is also presented in Table 23. Bilirubin is also a liver metabolic marker and was
similarly measured. and the data is also presented in Table 23, expressed in mg/dL. None of the ISIS
oligonucleotides caused any change in these liver function markers outside the expected range for antisense
oligonucleotides.

Kidney function
          To evaluate the effect of ISIS oligonucleotides on renal function, blood samples were collected from
all the study groups on week 11. Approximately 3 mL of blood was collected from fasted animals and placed
in tubes for serum separation. Serum was obtained by stabilization of the tubes at room temperature for 30-80
min followed by centrifugation (2,000 g x 15 minutes at room temperature). Concentrations of BUN and
creatinine were measured at week 11 using a Hitachi-917/911 chemistry analyzer. Results are presented in
Table 24, expressed in mg/dL. None of the ISIS oligonucleotides caused any change in these renal function
markers outside the expected range for antisense oligonucleotides.

Markers of inflammation
         To evaluate any inflammatory effect of ISIS oligonucleotides in cynomolgus monkeys, blood
samples were taken at week 11. C-reactive protein (CRP), which is synthesized in the liver and which serves
as a marker of inflammation, was also similarly measured on week 11 using a Hitachi-917/911 chemistry
analyzer. The results are presented in Table 25. Treatment with ISIS 426172 and ISIS 420470 caused increase
in CRP levels. Treatment with the remaining ISIS oligonucleotides did not cause any change outside the
expected range for antisense oligonucleotides.
         Approximately 1.3 mL blood was collected in a tube treated with EDTA and used for the
measurement of hematology parameter. Samples were analyzed for red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood
cells (WBC) count, individual white blood cell percentages, such as that of monocytes, neutrophils,
lymphocytes, as well as for platelet count and hematocrit (%), using an ADVIA120 hematology analyzer
(Bayer, USA). The data is presented in Table 26. Treatment with ISIS 426168 and ISIS 420476 caused
increase in lymphocyte counts. Treatment with ISSI 426325, ISIS 426172, ISIS 426262, and ISIS 420470
caused increase in neutrophil counts. Treatment with the remaining ISIS oligonucleotides did not cause any
significant pro-inflammatory response beyond that expected for antisense oligonucleotides.

Measurement of oligonucleotide concentration
         The concentration of the full-length oligonucleotide, as well as the total oligonucleotide
concentration (including the degraded form), was measured at week 12. The method used is a modification of
previously published methods (Leeds et al., 1996; Geary et al., 1999) which consist of a phenol-chloroform
(liquid-liquid) extraction followed by a solid phase extraction. An internal standard (ISIS 355868, a 27-mer

calculated using calibration curves, with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of approximately 1.14 ig/g.
The ratio of the concentrations in the kidney versus the liver was calculated. The results are presented in
Tables 27 and 28, expressed as ig/g tissue.

Example 10: Measurement of viscosity of ISIS antisense oligonucleotides targeting human GCCR
         The viscosity of three of the antisense oligonucleotides tested in the monkey study described in
Example 9 was measured with the aim of screening out antisense oligonucleotides which have a viscosity
more than 40 cP. Oligonucleotides having a viscosity greater than 40 cP would be too viscous to be
administered to any subject.
         ISIS oligonucleotides (32-35 mg) were weighed into a glass vial, 120 .L of water was added and the
antisense oligonucleotide was dissolved into solution by heating the vial at 50 0C. Part of (75 .L) the pre
heated sample was pipetted to a micro-viscometer (Cambridge). The temperature of the micro-viscometer
was set to 25 0C and the viscosity of the sample was measured. Another part (20 .L) of the pre-heated sample
was pipetted into 10 mL of water for UV reading at 260 nM at 85 0C (Cary UV instrument). The results are
presented in Table 29 and indicate that all the antisense oligonucleotides solutions are optimal in their
viscosity under the criterion stated above.

Example 11: Dose response confirmation of antisense oligonucleotides targeting human GCCR in
rhesus monkey LLC-MK2 cells
         Select gapmers from the monkey study described in Example 9 were tested at various doses in LLC
MK2 cells. The ISIS oligonucleotides tested are cross-reactive with rhesus monkey GCCR gene (SEQ ID
NO: 2; the complement of GENBANK Accession No. NW_001120987.1 truncated from nucleotides
1334000 to 1491000).
         Cells were plated at a density of 25,000 cells per well and transfected using electroporation with 0.09
 iM, 0.19 nM, 0.38 iM, 0.75 iM 1.50 iM, 3.00 iM, 6.00 pM or 12.00 IM concentrations of antisense
oligonucleotide, as specified in Table 32. After a treatment period of approximately 16 hours, RNA was
isolated from the cells and GCCR mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Human
GCCR primer probe set RTS 1408 was used to measure mRNA levels. GCCR mRNA levels were adjusted
according to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN*. Results are presented as percent inhibition
of GCCR, relative to untreated control cells. As illustrated in Table 30, GCCR mRNA levels were reduced in
a dose-dependent manner in LLC-MK2 cells treated with the ISIS oligonucleotides tested.

         Since ISIS 426115 was demonstrated by the study above to be both a highly potent and tolerable
antisense oligonucleotide, it was selected for a second cynomolgus monkey study.
Treatment

          Prior to the study, the monkeys were kept in quarantine for a 5-week period, during which the
animals were observed daily for general health. The monkeys were 2-3 years old and weighed between 2 and
5 kg. One group of five randomly assigned male cynomolgus monkeys was injected subcutaneously with
ISIS 426115 using a stainless steel dosing needle and syringe of appropriate size into the intracapsular region
and outer thigh of the monkeys. The monkeys were dosed four times a week for the first week (days 1, 3, 5,
and 7) as loading doses, and subsequently once a week for weeks 2-13, with 40 mg/kg of ISIS 426115. A
control group of 8 cynomolgus monkeys was injected with PBS subcutaneously thrice four times a week for
the first week (days 1, 3, 5, and 7), and subsequently once a week for weeks 2-13.
          During the study period, the monkeys were observed twice daily for signs of illness or distress. Any
animal experiencing more than momentary or slight pain or distress due to the treatment, injury or illness was
treated by the veterinary staff with approved analgesics or agents to relieve the pain after consultation with
the Study Director. Any animal in poor health or in a possible moribund condition was identified for further
monitoring and possible euthanasia. Scheduled euthanasia of the animals was conducted on day 93 by
exsanguination after ketamine/xylazine-induced anesthesia and administration of sodium pentobarbital. The
protocols described in the Example were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC).
Tolerability studies
Liver function
          To evaluate the effect of ISIS oligonucleotides on hepatic function, blood samples were collected
from all groups. The blood samples were collected via femoral venipuncture on day 95, 48 hrs post-dosing.
The monkeys were fasted overnight prior to blood collection. Blood was collected in tubes containing K 2
EDTA anticoagulant, which were centrifuged to obtain plasma. Levels of various liver function markers were
measured using a Toshiba 200FR NEO chemistry analyzer (Toshiba Co., Japan). Plasma levels of ALT and
AST were measured and the results are presented in Table 31, expressed in IU/L. Bilirubin, a liver function
marker, was similarly measured and is presented in Table 31, expressed in mg/dL. Treatment with ISIS
426115 was well tolerated in terms of the liver function in monkeys.
