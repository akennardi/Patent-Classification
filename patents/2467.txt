                                                   -1
                           Method of producing a packed food product
The invention relates to a method of producing a packed food product, in which a food prod
uct is cooked, dried and packaged in an atmosphere of superheated steam, and also to a pack
aged food product produced using the method.
A method of this kind is known from, for example, DE 102 007 037 606 Al, the food product
being conventionally dried as a rule down to an a, value (active water content) of about 0.60
or 0.65. The reason for such relatively extensive drying is that it has so far always been as
sumed that if the a, values were higher, uncontrolled growth of any microorganisms remain
ing in the product, such as bacteria, fungi, yeasts etc., would be unavoidable if the product
were not subsequently sterilised.
More recent systematic studies on the growth of different categories of microorganisms have,
however, shown that substantially less extensive drying of moist starting products may still be
sufficient, under certain circumstances, to obtain packaged products with satisfactory long
term storage stability. When a food product is dried in an atmosphere of superheated steam
containing less than 3 % 02 and at a temperature of at least 120' C to an am value of only 0.92
at most, preferably no more than 0.90, microorganisms are already killed off to a considerable
extent, and it has been found that while some spores may be able to survive the drying pro
cess, they are nevertheless unable to grow any further at am values of no more than 0.94, espe
cially less than 0.92, 0.90 or 0.86, provided the product is hermetically packaged while it is
still in the atmosphere of superheated steam with an oxygen content of no more than 3 % by
volume.

                                               -2
On the other hand, whereas certain microorganisms such as moulds and yeasts may still
exhibit growth at aw values of 0.80 and more, in some cases even 0.60 and more, they are
killed in the course of drying the product in the atmosphere of superheated steam and there
fore are likewise no longer relevant in the finished packed product.
The object of the invention is thus achieved by a method of producing a packed food product
in accordance with claim 1.
Advantageous embodiments of the invention are described in the dependent claims.
The invention also relates to a food product which is packed in a package that is impermeable
to oxygen in accordance with claim 15. Advantageous further developments of the invention
are described in the other dependent claims.
The invention will now be explained by describing worked embodiments, reference being
made to a drawing, in which
Fig. 1 schematically shows an apparatus for carrying out the method of the invention in
accordance with a first embodiment, and
Fig. 2 shows a variant of the apparatus according to Fig. 1.
The key parameters of the production method of the invention are cooking at at least 1000 C,
introducing the cooked food product into an atmosphere of superheated steam or an atmo
sphere of superheated steam consisting of water vapour and residual air and containing less
than 3 % oxygen and having a temperature of at least 120' C, and drying the product in the

                                               -3
atmosphere of superheated steam to an a, value ranging from 0.70 to 0.92, the a, value pref
erably being at least 0.86, and packaging the product within the atmosphere of superheated
steam.
Fig. 1 shows an apparatus which is suitable for carrying out such a method, where the ap
paratus consists of a cooking apparatus 2 and a drying and packaging apparatus 4, which
communicate with one another by means of a lock 6.
In the example illustrated, the cooking apparatus 2 takes the form of a cooking tube, within
which an atmosphere of saturated steam at atmospheric pressure or at an overpressure is
created. In the cooking tube, there is a water supply 8 with a free surface 10, which is heated
by a heating apparatus 12, in this case a steam line. Above the free surface 10 of the water
supply 8, there is a conveyor belt 16 that can be driven in a transport direction 14, with a
receiving end 18 above which is disposed a delivery means 20 for a food product to be
cooked, and a discharge end 22 located above the lock 6 and above which there may be a
processing apparatus 24 for cooked food product, such as a cutting apparatus for example.
In operation, the cooking apparatus 2 can be controlled such that inside the cooking apparatus
2, an atmosphere can be generated that is largely or virtually completely free of air and oxy
gen, at a temperature of at least 1000 C. A conveying speed of the conveyor belt 16 can be
adjusted such that the food product requires a predetermined dwell time on the conveyor belt
for its transportation from the receiving end 18 to the discharge end 22, during which it is
cooked in the steam atmosphere. Depending on the nature and greatest cross-sectional area of
the product to be cooked, the dwell time can be at least 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute or 2
minutes, and it can be up to 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes or 5 minutes.
The drying and packaging apparatus 4 has a housing 30, which is closed on all sides and on
the top side 32 of which an opening 34 is provided for connecting the lock 6.

                                                -4
On an underside 36 of the housing 30, there are an entry port 38 and an exit port 40 for the
entry and exit of a container conveying means 42. The container conveying means 42 conveys
a continuous series of containers 44 (pouches, jars, cans ... ) into and out of the housing 30.
Above the container conveying means 42 there is a delivery belt 46, with a receiving end 48
beneath the lock 6 and a discharge end 50 above a filling apparatus 52.
The delivery belt 46 serves for the purpose of drying and acting as a buffer and storage loca
tion for cooked product delivered via the lock 6 before it reaches the filling apparatus 52. In
addition, a funnel-shaped buffer 54 can be provided above the filling apparatus 52.
The delivery belt 46 is controlled in such a way that a particular dwell time (minimum dwell
time and/or maximum dwell time) of the cooked products in the atmosphere of superheated
steam inside the housing 30 is ensured, such as at least 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds,
40 seconds, 50 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 5 minutes or even 10 minutes. It may
also be contemplated that the cooked food product is pasteurised during a predetermined
dwell time, such as over at least 3 minutes, 5 minutes, or 10 minutes.
The filling apparatus 52 has a filler with metering means 56 and a lid sealer 58 in order to fill
individual containers 44 one after the other with metered amounts and then to seal them. Seal
ing is performed hermetically, i.e. so that the sealed containers 44 are sealed so as to be im
permeable to oxygen.
Upstream or downstream of the filling apparatus 52, there may be at least one further delivery
means, for example for flowable ingredients such as gravy, a container 60 and a metering
means 62 for gravy being illustrated, or for chunky or granular ingredients.

                                                 -5
In addition, an apparatus for introducing an inert protective gas such as C02 or N 2 into the
container 44 may be provided upstream of the lid sealer 58, in order to fill any part of the
volume inside a container 44 which is not taken up by food product with a protective gas
before the container 44 is sealed.
After entering the housing 30, the containers 44 pass through a conveying region 70, in which
they adopt a reversed position, in which a container opening 44a points downwards vertically
or at least at an angle, so that any ambient air in the containers 44 can be automatically
replaced by the atmosphere of superheated steam inside the housing 30. For this purpose, a
first redirecting means 72 is provided for redirecting the container conveying means 42,
especially about a horizontal axis running transversely to the direction of transport, after
which the container openings 44a point downwards at an angle or vertically. After the con
veying region 70, the containers are moved to a filling position, in which the container open
ings 44a are pointing upwards at an angle or vertically, for example by means of a second
redirecting means 74.
After being filled and sealed, the containers 44 preferably remain in their filling position, as is
illustrated in Fig. 1. For this purpose, it may be contemplated that the containers 44 are kept
adjustable relative to the container conveying means 42 or pivotable about a horizontal axis
running transversely to the direction of transport of the container conveying means 42, in
order to ensure that the containers 44 continue to adopt their filling position downstream of a
corresponding redirection of the container conveying means 42, which is not shown in Fig. 1.
Inside the housing 30, an atmosphere of superheated steam is provided, which contains water
vapour and less than 3 % oxygen and has a temperature of at least 1200 C. In order to main
tain these conditions, a heat exchanger 80 and a fan 82 are provided, which are connected to
the housing 30 via a steam line 84. An outlet end 86 of the steam line 84 is preferably located
at the top side 32 of the housing, while an inlet end 88 is located in a region close to the
underside 36 of the housing. The inlet end 88 is preferably located beneath a middle of a

                                                 -6
housing height H (vertical distance between the opening 34 and an entry or exit port 38, 40),
roughly between 10 and 30 % of H.
In addition, there may be a steam supply line present (not shown), in order to ensure that there
is an adequate steam content at a sufficient temperature inside the housing 30 during the start
up phase, or also during operation of the apparatus, and in order to prevent too much ambient
air and hence oxygen from entering the housing 30 as the empty containers 44 are carried in.
In operation, the cooked food product delivered via the lock 6 falls onto the delivery belt 46
and into the buffer 54, from where it passes into the filler and metering unit 56 and into a con
tainer 44 to be filled. After being filled, the container 44 is sealed by the lid sealer 58 and
conveyed out of the housing 30.
The method of the invention contemplates that the food product is dried in the atmosphere of
superheated steam to an a, value of no more than 0.92, preferably reaching an a, value of at
least 0.86, e.g. 0.87, 0.88, 0.89 or 0.90.
Instead of the food product's being delivered via the cooking apparatus 2, it may be contem
plated that the food product is extruded directly onto the delivery belt 46 by means of an ex
truder (not shown), which leads into the housing 30 above the receiving end 48 of the delivery
belt 46 and in which the food product is cooked at at least 1000 C.
Fig. 2 shows a variant of the apparatus according to Fig. 1, in which two modifications are
contained. The cooking apparatus 2 has a water bath 90, a conveyor belt 92 extending beneath
a free surface 94 of the water bath 90, and food product supplied via a delivery means 20 be
ing cooked in the water bath 90. A heating means for heating the water bath 90 is not shown.

                                               -7
Inside the cooking apparatus 2, there may be atmospheric pressure or an overpressure, so that
the temperature of the water bath 90 is at least 100' C, such as 1100 C or 120' C.
The conveying means 92 has a portion 96 leading upwards and out of the free surface 94 of
the water bath 90, with a discharge end 98, from which the cooked food products enter a
pneumatic conveyor line 100. The conveyor line 100 leads to a separator 102, e. g. a cyclone
separator, which feeds the products into the lock 6. A return line 104, in which are disposed a
fan 106 and a heat exchanger 108, runs from the separator 102 back to the cooking apparatus
2. In operation, the portion inside the cooking apparatus 2 above the free surface 94, the
conveyor line 100, the separator 102 and the return line 104 are filled with steam, preferably
with superheated steam or saturated steam at a temperature of at least 1000 C and with an
oxygen content of less than 3 %.
Surplus steam can be discharged via a branch line 110 and a branch valve 112. In quantity,
the surplus steam corresponds to the amount of water withdrawn from the product to be dried.
The branch valve 112 can be controlled by a pressure sensor 114. When the pressure sensor
114 detects a pressure above a predetermined value within the system comprising the cooking
apparatus 2 and the conveyor lines 100, 104, the branch valve 112 is opened.
In both embodiments according to Figs. 1 and 2, the cooking apparatus 2 is connected to the
drying and packaging apparatus 4 or its housing 30 in a gas-tight manner via the lock 6, so
that no ambient air can penetrate inside the housing.
Inside the drying and packaging apparatus 4, the cooked food product is dried gently in an
atmosphere of superheated steam and with oxygen substantially excluded, and is filled into a
container immediately after drying, still inside the atmosphere of superheated steam, which
container is hermetically sealed, likewise inside the atmosphere of superheated steam, either
immediately after being filled or after the addition of a protective gas, essentially as described
with reference to Fig. 1.

                                                -8
Inside the atmosphere of superheated steam, vegetative microorganisms, including vegetative
bacteria, fungi and yeasts, are killed off completely. All microbial spoilage organisms and
pathogenic microorganisms such as salmonellae are reliably killed.
Certain heat-resistant bacterial spores, e.g. those of Geobacillus thermophilus, are not com
pletely eliminated. Germination of any spores that might survive is, however, prevented by
the a, values of no more than 0.92 in the product, such as 0.90 or 0.86. If the product is dried
to an a, value of 0.86, the growth of Staphylococcus aureus is also precluded.
