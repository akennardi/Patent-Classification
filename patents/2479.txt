     SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PACKAGING HIGH DENSITY SSDS
                                 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [0001]     Information technology is in the throes of a dramatic transformation. Virtualization
   is giving way to cloud computing; the ubiquity of powerful handheld devices is creating new
   paradigms in mobility and social interaction; the massive profusion of information generation
 5 is leading to powerful new opportunities for Big Data analytics. Cloud computing has been
   called "a disruptive force" with the potential for long-term impact on most industries.
   [0002]     Additionally, nowhere is this need for next-generation performance and capacity
   more critical than in enterprise storage solutions. Organizations are creating more data than
   ever before and data generation is growing at a staggering rate.
10 [0003]     It's not just storage capacity that's a challenge to computing's new paradigm: Speed
   and performance are equally crucial. Organizations must be able to access their most
   important data as quickly as possible to act upon it effectively. They need solutions that
   minimize latency, maximize input/output operations per second (IOPS) and deliver maximum
   capacity and performance in a cost-efficient manner. Otherwise the cost of delivering
15 sufficient storage capacity and performance will cripple this new computing paradigm before
   it ever gets its sealegs.
   [0004]     The storage industry has made great strides in adapting technology to deliver more
   capacity and better performance without congruent increases in costs. Solutions such as
   compression, deduplication and intelligent tiering have made today's disk storage systems far
20 more efficient and have enabled the widespread proliferation of virtualization that has set the
   stage for the transition to cloud computing.
   [0005]     But those solutions go just so far: Spinning disk storage has practical limitations in
   speed and performance. The real promise for next-generation performance has always been
   in solid-state technology. Solid-state technology employs non-volatile flash memory so there
25 are no moving parts, meaning solid-state solutions operate much faster than traditional disk
   drives in reading and writing data. A single enterprise-grade solid-state solution can handle a
                                                      1

     WO 2015/077563                                                            PCT/US2014/066815
   transaction workload of 100 traditional hard drives - with more reliability and less power
   consumption in a much smaller physical space.
   [0006]    Most of the leading enterprise storage vendors incorporate solid-state technology as
   part of their overall solutions, but in limited capacities usually targeted for specific, storage
 5 intensive production applications that require very high levels of performance: Video editing,
   computer-aided design and high-end online transaction processing systems (OLTPs) are some
   of the obvious choices.
   [0007]    The challenge in deploying solid-state technology more ubiquitously across the
   enterprise - for all enterprise applications - has been one of cost. Although NAND Flash
10 solutions could deliver 100 times the performance of traditional spinning disks - at one tenth
   the power consumption - they have also been about 10 times more expensive to deploy.
   [0008]    Simply, the cost of deploying robust enterprise-grade solid-state technology has
   been too high for widespread deployment across all enterprise applications. However, that
   excuse will not suffice for the future, as the performance level ensured by solid-state
15 technology becomes even more critical for all applications across all types of businesses.
   [0009]    The reality is that the capacity and performance of solid-state technology will be a
   necessary part of next-generation data center infrastructures if these infrastructures are to
   deliver on the promise of cloud computing, Big Data and all of the other critical aspects of
   computing's next era. Enterprise-grade solid-state technology will be crucial to the
20 underlying storage infrastructure - driving all enterprise applications - to meet ever-changing
   requirements for performance, speed, capacity, and agility.
   [0010]    Next-generation solid-state technology for the enterprise must be robust, reliable,
   fully featured, and cost-efficient: It must go beyond what is available in solid-state today,
   particularly when IT decision-makers think about typical solid-state drives (SSDs) that use
25 HDD protocols to speak to the rest of the world. This deployment of solid-state technology
   has been useful in their initial applications, such as in laptop computing, but is nowhere near
   the right design for true enterprise-grade solid-state storage. The challenge to the storage
   industry has been to figure out how to deliver enterprise-grade performance and reliability in
   solid-state technology at a reasonable cost for widespread enterprise appeal.

   of solid-state storage units, some of which may be discussed herein. Additionally, what is

   [0034]    Introduction
20 [0035]    FIG. 1 is a diagram of high-density solid-state storage unit 100 having a base and a
   cassette in one embodiment according to the present invention. High-density solid-state
   storage unit 100 may be embodied as an all-Flash enterprise solid-state storage system.
   Examples of high-density solid-state storage unit 100 can be embodied similar to products
   provided by Skyera Inc. of San Jose, California.

     WO 2015/077563                                                           PCT/US2014/066815
   constructed from steel, aluminum, plastics, or other alloys and materials typically used in
   consumer or enterprise grade hardware.
   [0037]    Solid-state storage unit 100 may be embodied similar to conventional server storage
   units that include hard-drive based or similar storage devices. Solid-state storage unit 100
 5 may be configured for installation into one or more server racks. Server rack generally can
   hold multiple pieces of rack-mountable units that are designed to fit in the server rack. Each
   rack-mountable unit can generally be one of several standard dimensions measured in terms
   or a 'rack unit.' A rack unit, U or RU is a unit of measure used to describe the height of
   equipment intended for mounting in a 19-inch rack or a 23-inch rack. The 19-inch (48.26
10 cm) or 23-inch (58.42 cm) dimension refers to the width of the equipment mounting frame in
   the rack, i.e. the width of the equipment that can be mounted inside the rack. One rack unit
   (1U) is 1.75 inches (44.45 mm) high. The size of a piece of rack-mounted equipment is
   frequently described as a number in "U". For example, one rack unit is often referred to as
   "1U", 2 rack units as "2U" and so on.
15 [0038]    High-density solid-state storage 100 may also be embodied as any computing
   device, such as a personal computer (PC), a workstation, a mini-computer, a mainframe, a
   cluster or farm of computing devices, a laptop, a notebook, a netbook, a PDA, a smartphone,
   a consumer electronic device, a gaming console, or the like.

20 solid-state storage unit 100 with respect to external access to data stored in cassette section
    120. In various embodiment, base section 110 may include one or more central processing
   units (CPUs), memories, and interfaces. Base section 110 includes hardware and/or software
   elements configured for performing logic operations and calculations, input/output
   operations, machine communications, or the like. Base section 110 may include familiar
25 computer components, such as one or more data processors, one or more graphics processors
   or graphical processing units (GPUs), one or more memory subsystems, one or more storage
   subsystems, one or more input/output (I/O) interfaces, communications interfaces, or the like.
   Base section 110 can include one or more systems interconnecting components and providing
   functionality, such connectivity and inter-device communication.
30 [0040]    In various embodiments, base section 110 may include software that enables
   communications over a network, such as a local area network or the Internet, using one or
   more communications protocols, such as the HTTP, TCP/IP, RTP/RTSP protocols, or the
                                                   7

   like. In some embodiments, other communications software and/or transfer protocols may
   also be used, for example IPX, UDP or the like, for communicating with hosts over the
   network or with a device directly or indirectly connected to base section 110. In further
   embodiments, base section 110 may include software that enables network attached storage
 5 (NAS) communications, direct attached storage (DAS) communications, storage area
   network (SAN) communications, or the like. In some embodiments, other data storage
   software, transfer protocols, or interconnets may also be used, for example ATA over
   Ethernet (AoE) mapping of ATA over Ethernet, Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) mapping of
   SCSI over Fibre Channel, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), ESCON over Fibre Channel
10 (FICON), HyperSCSI mapping of SCSI over Ethernet, iFCP or SANoIP mapping of FCP
   over IP, iSCSI mapping of SCSI over TCP/IP, iSCSI Extensions for RDMA (iSER) mapping
   of iSCSI over InfiniBand, storage networks may also be built using SAS and SATA
   technologies, or the like.
   [0041]    In some embodiments, base section 110 may maintain a variety of temperature
15 zones using one or more techniques described in detail below.
   [0042]    In general, cassette section 120 is configured to manage access to data stored in a
   plurality of storage modules located within cassette section 120. Cassette section 120 may
   include one or more central processing units (CPUs), memories, and interfaces. Cassette
   section 120 may include hardware and/or software elements configured for performing logic
20 operations and calculations, input/output operations, machine communications, or the like.
   Cassette section 120 may include familiar computer components, such as one or more data
   processors, one or more graphics processors or graphical processing units (GPUs), one or
   more memory subsystems, one or more storage subsystems, one or more input/output (I/O)
   interfaces, communications interfaces, or the like. Cassette section 120 can include one or
25 more systems interconnecting components and providing functionality, such connectivity and
   inter-device communication.
   [0043]    In various embodiments, cassette section 120 is configured to be removably
   attached to base section 110. This allows cassette section 120 to be physically removed from
   base section 110 to provide enhanced data security. Cassette section 120 can be physically
30 secured to further prevent unauthorized access to the data stored thereon. Cassette section
    120 may be configured to be insertable only in corresponding base section 110 or cassette
   section 120 may be configured to be insertable into any compatible base section. In some
                                                    8

     WO 2015/077563                                                          PCT/US2014/066815
   embodiments, cassette section 120 is configured to rely upon or otherwise utilize hardware
   and/or software elements of base section 110 that are configured for performing logic
   operations and calculations, input/output operations, machine communications, or the like.
   [0044]     Cassette section 120 typically includes multiple storage modules. A plurality of
 5 storage modules may be arranged side-by-side. The plurality of storage modules may be
   arranged in a vertical orientation extending from a shared circuit board. Each storage module
   preferably includes solid-state memory that can provide between 8 and 10 terabytes of
   storage capacity. One skilled in the art will realize that the amount of storage capacity on
   each storage module is primarily limited by the available capacity of memory devices.
10 Advances in solid-state memory technology will result in a single memory device being able
   to hold terabytes of data in the near future. At such time, the storage capacity of each
   memory module can be greatly enhanced by using such high-capacity memory devices.
   Therefore, the memory capacity numbers described above are based on the technology
   available today. These numbers are provided merely as an example and should not be
15 construed as limiting the claimed invention in any manner. One skilled in the art will realize
   that the storage capacity can be increased further using the concepts described in this
   application as newer technology is available in the future.

   to blow air inwards into cassette section 110, for example, to support cooling of internal
25 electronics and the multiple storage modules.
   [0046]     Cassette section 120 may include one or more physical mechanisms for being
   physically secured, connected, or coupled to base section 110. For example, FIG. 2A
   illustrates one or more screws for securing cassette section 120 to base section 110. Cassette
   section 120 may include one or more guides, rails, tracks, of other features that facilitate how
30 cassette section 120 is secured to base section 110. In some aspects, an interface between
   cassette section 120 and base section of a securing mechanism may serve multiple purposes,

   such as providing an electrical connection as well as providing energy transfer for reducing or
   dampening vibration in cassette section 120.
   [0047]     FIG. 2B depicts a back view of high-density solid-state storage unit 100 opposing
   the front view of FIG. 2A. As can be seen, base section 110 includes one or more vents at
 5 which one or more fans may be mounted to blow air outwards from base section 110. Base
   section 110 may include one or more interfaces, such as ethernet, universal serial bus (USB),
   monitor ports, and the like that facilitate connections to external components. Base section
    110 may further include one or more power supplies in a variety of known configurations.
   [0048]     FIG. 2C depicts a left view of high-density solid-state storage unit 100. Base
10 section 110 may include one or more openings, interfaces, and the like that allow base section
    110 to be secured to a rack or cabinet for operation. FIG. 2D depicts a right view of high
   density solid-state storage unit 100. FIG. 2E depicts a top view of high-density solid-state
   storage unit 100. FIG. 2F depicts a bottom view of high-density solid-state storage unit 100.
   [0049]     In these example, it is more clearly illustrated to removable nature of cassette
15 section 120 from base section 110. Allowing cassette section 120 to be easily removed from
   base section 110 provides a variety of advantages. Traditionally, hard drives provide the
   medium for removable storage. However, even though the density of hard drives has
   increased, their volume or form factor has remained the same. Cassette section 120 provides
   high density storage with the benefit of removability for the added protection of the data
20 stored thereon.
   [0050]     Removability of cassette section 120 from base section 110 also provides challenges
   some of which are discussed in further detail below. For example, there is a need to provide
   electrical and physical coupling between base section 110 and cassette section 120. The
   electrical and physical coupling needs to be strong enough to withstand a product lifetime of
25 insertion and removal cycles. In yet further example, an insertion should be relatively easy to
   perform and secure. In another example, there is a need to reduce noise and vibrations that
   may occur.
   [0051]     Cassette Packaging
   [0052]     In various embodiments, cassette section 120 includes one or more features directed
30 to packaging the multiple storage modules. One feature provides an electrical and physical
   coupling between base section 110 and cassette section 120 while further providing energy
                                                    10

     WO 2015/077563                                                           PCT/US2014/066815
   transfer there between. Another feature provides a relatively easy insertion utilizing a tapered
   guide. To reduce noise and vibrations that may occur, as well as account from manufacturing
   process variation, cassette section 120 may include features that fill gaps or insulate
   components.
 5 [0053]     FIG. 3 is a diagram of cassette section 120 of high-density solid-state storage unit
    100 of FIG. 1 in one embodiment according to the present invention. In various
   embodiments, cassette section 120 includes one or more features for providing access to and
   security of data stored within the multiple storage modules. Some of these features relate to
   the packaging of cassette section 120, such as how the data can be physically secured through
10 removal of cassette section 120 from base section 110. For example, cassette section 120 can
   be physically removed from base section 110 may secured in a safe location, such as a vault
   or safe. In one aspect, cassette section 120 includes all data and metadata necessary to
   resume operation when re-inserted into base section 110.
   [0054]     Some of these features relate to the packaging of cassette section 120, such as how
15 the multiple storage modules and other hardware elements of cassette section 120 remain
   undamaged during option of high-density solid-state storage unit 100. Mechanical motion of
   fans, thermal expansion and contraction, and other energy pollutions can damage sensitive
   components, electrical connections, or corrupt data. In one aspect, cassette section 120
   includes one or more points at which heat and vibration may be transferred to base section
20  110 allowing components of cassette section 120 to operate within optimal conditions.
   [0055]     In various embodiments, some of these features relate to the security of data stored
   within cassette section 120, such as how cassette section 120 incorporates a trusted platform
   model that enables access to encrypted data stored within. Even with cassette section 120
   physically removed from base section 110 and secured in a safe location, a user may still
25 further remove the trusted platform module (or key) and store the key in a separate location.
   Because cassette section 120 may include all data and metadata necessary to resume
   operation when inserted into base section 110, a combination of the key and cassette section
    120 are required.
   [0056]     Accordingly, cassette section 120 may be packaged to secure the data by providing
30 an optimal environment at which elements may operate. Furthermore, cassette section 120
   may be physically removed from base section 110 to secure the data from theft, fire, or other
   physical damage. Additionally, the key to cassette section 120 may be physically removed
                                                    11

     WO 2015/077563                                                          PCT/US2014/066815
   allowing cassette 120 to remain in base section 110 which securing the data from
   unauthorized access.
   [0057]    Referring again to FIG. 3, cassette section 120 may include top plate 310 and a
   bottom plate (not shown) that can be removed to allow access to internal components. In
 5 various embodiments, cassette section 120 includes a layer of gap filling material between the
   internal components and the top plate. Some examples of the gap filling material include
   foam or other vibration/acoustic dampening materials. Cassette section 120 may also include
   a layer of gap filling material between the internal components and the bottom plate. The gap
   filling material can further account for process variation in the manufacturing process while
10 isolating components and/or structural elements from one another. The gap filling material
   may further provide for vibration compensation of internal components of cassette section
    120, such as fans and the like, that are required for optimal operation. Cassette section 120
   further may include other traditional elements, such as screws, buttons, latches, access ports,
   and the like that serve one or more purposes. Cassette section 120 may further include one or
15 more tamper resistant or temper evident features.
   [0058]    FIGS. 4A-4D are different views illustrating cassette section 120 of FIG. 3 in one
   embodiment according to the present invention. For example, FIG. 4A depicts a front view
   of cassette section 120. Cassette section 110 includes one or more vents at which one or
   more fans may be mounted to blow air inwards into cassette section 110. FIG. 4A illustrates
20 one or more screws for securing cassette section 120 to base section 110 as well as one or
   more screws for securing a front plate to cassette section 120.
   [0059]    FIG. 4A also depicts one embodiment of a trusted platform module (TPM) (also
   referred to as a "key" in this disclosure). The TPM or key may be used to secure the data
   stored within a plurality of high-density flash-based storage modules. The key may take a
25 variety of forms. In this example, the key is depecited as a universial serial bus (USB) style
   thumb drive or fob. There are several types of USB connectors, including some that have
   been added while USB specifications have progressed. The original USB specification
   details Standard-A and Standard-B plugs and receptacles. The USB 2.0 specification added
   Mini-B plugs and receptacles.
30 [0060]    The TPM or key may utilize a standard of custom pin configuration of the USB
   style connectors. In general, a USB 2.0 Standard-A type of USB plug is a flattened rectangle
                                                    12

   that inserts into a USB 2.0 Standard-A type receptacle. A Standard-B plug has a square
   shape with bevelled exterior corners.
   [0061]     FIG. 4B depicts a back view of high-density solid-state storage unit 100 opposing
   the front view of FIG. 4A. As can be seen, cassette section 110 includes one or more vents
 5 through which air is transferred from cassette section 120 to base section 110. Cassette
   section 120 may include one or more interfaces that facilitate connections (both structural and
   electrical) to base section 110. FIG. 4C depicts a left view of cassette section 120. Cassette
   section 120 may include one or more openings, interfaces, and the like. FIG. 4D depicts a
   right view of cassette section 120. In these examples, cassette section 120 includes one or
10 more mechanisms, such as guides and posts, that facilitate the interconnection with base
   section 110.
   [0062]     FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating the packaging of various internal elements of
   cassette section 120 of FIG. 1 in one embodiment according to the present invention. FIG. 5
   depicts a top view of cassette section 120 with top plate 310 removed. Cassette section 120
15 typically includes multiple storage modules 510 arranged side-by-side in a vertical
   orientation.
   [0063]     Storage modules 510 can be used with high-density solid-state storage unit 100. For
   example, storage modules 510 may include a flash controller and one or more flash modules.
   The flash controller is representative of one or more processors, FPGAs, ASICs, or other
20 microcontrollers that include hardware and/or software elements configured for executing
   logic or program code or for providing application-specific functionality. Flash modules are
   representative of flash memory modules or other solid-state devices (SSDs). Some examples
   of storage modules 510 are provided by Skyera, Inc. of San Jose, CA.
   [0064]     To maximize the packaging of storage modules 510, cassette section 120 includes
25 bridge board 520. Bridge board 520 is configured to provide an electrical power connection
   between front section 530 of cassette section 120 and rear section 540 of cassette section 120
   utilizing substantially the same form factor as one of storage modules 510. Front section 530
   may include components configured to interface with the TMP or key as well as to operate
   one or more fans, buttons, switches, and the like accessible to a user when interacting with
30 the front of high-density solid-state storage unit 100. Rear section 540 may include
   components that configured to interface with components of base section 110. Rear section
   540 may further extend as a circuit board that has receptacle interfaces for each of storage
                                                    13

     WO 2015/077563                                                            PCT/US2014/066815
   modules 510 and bridge board 520. Bridge board 520 may further be configured to provide
   communication lines between front section 530 of cassette section 120 and rear section 540
   of cassette section 120.
   [0065]     FIGS. 6A-6B are diagrams illustrating elements of cassette section 120 of FIG. 3
 5 that provide security and vibration reduction in one embodiment of the present invention. In
   this example, FIG. 6A depicts interface 610 that may provide a physical connection point for
   receiving a connection from base section 110. Interface 620 may provide both a physical and
   an electrical connection to base section 110. Interface 620 is further configured to transfer
   vibrations or other harmonics associated with cassette section 120 into base section 110.
10 Interface 620 thus reduces stress on components of cassette section 110, protects interface
   connectors, and physically secures cassette section 120 to base section 110.
   [0066]     FIG. 6A further depicts one or more guides 630A and 630B. Guides 630A and
   630B are configured to facilitate the insertion and removal of cassette section 120 into base
   section 110. Guides 630A and 630B may further provide energy transfer from cassette
15 section 120 to base section 110. FIG. 6B further depicts guide 630B. Guide 630B is tapered
   in areas 640 to allow cassette station 120 to pull itself into base station 110. Areas 640
   located opposite each other form wedge receptors for receiving guide components of base
   section 110. Furthermore, guide 630B is rounded to form an upper and lower channel from
   front to back to self-guide as well as provide a better fit. Traditional guides are merely
20 blocked at right angles and do not account for process variation. Thus, which the guides may
   fit into their receptors, they may not be entirely secure. In contrast, guides 630A and 630B
   provide a taper that ensures a secure fit. The secure fit provides protection against backing
   out as well as providing additional surface area through which energy and vibration transfer
   may occur.
25 [0067]     As discussed above, cassette section 120 includes features in various aspects for
   providing security of data stored within. For example, cassette section 120 can be physically
   removed from base section 110 may secured in a safe location. In one aspect, cassette section
    120 includes all data and metadata necessary to resume operation when inserted into base
   section 110. In another example, cassette section 120 includes one or more points at which
30 heat and vibration may be transferred to base section 110 allowing components of cassette
   section 120 to operate within optimal conditions.
   [0068]     Dual Temperature Option
                                                    14

     WO 2015/077563                                                            PCT/US2014/066815
   [0069]    Cassette section 120 may implement a cooling system that draws air into the front
   of cassette section 120 and blows it across critical components such as storage modules 520
   before exhausting the air out of the back of cassette section 120. Because the back of cassette
   section 120 vents into a portion of base section 110, one or more features may be provided
 5 for a plurality of environmental zones. These features may minimize interference between
   separate zones as well as consolidate the area needed for exhaust.
   [0070]    FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating a cross section of cassette section 120 of FIG. 3
   having dual temperature zones in one embodiment of the present invention. In this example,
   base station 110 is outfitted with one or more features to provide dual environmental zones.
10 The need for multiple environmental zones may be based on requirements for optimal
   operation of certain components. Accordingly, some components may be able to operate
   under different conditions and these considerations may be used to design a more compact
   and efficient enclosure.
   [0071]    In this example, structure 710 of FIG. 7 is configured to separate airflow exiting
15 cassette section 120 and airflow exiting base section 110. In this embodiment, structure 710
   forms a ramp separating the two airflows into zone 720 and zone 730. Structure 710 may
   include one or more deformations, ramps, wings, blockages, enclosures, and the like that
   separate a space into a plurality of zones or partitions.
   [0072]    Therefore, components of cassette section 120 may be able to operate under
20 different conditions from components of base section 110. Thus the cooling strategy of
   cassette section 110 may be different from the cooling strategy of base section 110 without
   incurring substantial interference with or comprising efficiency of another zone.
   Incorporating separate zones where at least one zone is designated for a removal cassette also
   allows for a more compact and efficient enclosure design, both of cassette 120 and base
25 section 110.
   [0073]    Data Security
   [0074]    As discussed above, high-density solid-state storage unit 100 includes one or more
   features for securing the data stored within cassette 120, both physically and
   cryptographically. In one embodiment, high-density solid-state storage unit 100 utilizes a
30 Trusted Platform Module (TPM). In various embodiments, the TPM or key is a specialized
   removable module utilizing a USB-style connector. The key includes hardware and/or
   information necessary for accessing data stored in storage modules 520 under its protection.
                                                   15

     WO 2015/077563                                                            PCT/US2014/066815
   The key can store encryption keys specific to cassette station 120. The key can also provide
   for platform integrity in that attest that high-density solid-state storage unit 100 has a
   specified hardware setup and is using specified software.
   [0075]     FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating a data security feature of cassette station 120 of FIG.
 5 3 in one embodiment of the present invention. In this example, TPM chip 800 contains a key
   pair called the Endorsement Key (EK). The pair is maintained inside TPM chip 800 and
   cannot be accessed by software. The Storage Root Key (SRK) is created when a user or
   administrator takes ownership of the system. This key pair may be generated by TPM chip
   800 based on the Endorsement Key and an owner-specified password. A second key, called
10 an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) may be used to protect cassette station 120 against
   unauthorized firmware and software modification.
   [0076]     Accordingly, even if cassette section 120 is physically removed from base section
    110 all data and metadata necessary to resume operation when inserted into base section 110
   remains secured by TPM chip 800. Simply removing TPM chip 800 from cassette station
15  120 further preserves the security if the data even if physical access is later obtained to the
   storage modules within.
   [0077]     Thus, in various embodiments, data stored within cassette section 120 can be
   secured by removing TPM chip 800. Cassette 120 may be left within base section 110 while
   preventing unauthorized access. Even with cassette section 120 physically removed from
20 base section 110, TPM chip 800 may be removed further stored in a separate location. Even
   if an unauthorized use reconnects cassette section 110 to base section 120, data stored within
   cassette section 120 remains encrypted and otherwise secured. In one aspect, cassette section
    120 and base section 110 may refuse to operate without the presence of TPM chip 800.
   When cassette section 120 includes all data and metadata necessary to resume operation
25 when inserted into base section 110, a combination of TPM chip 800and cassette section 120
   are required.
   [0078]     TPM chip 800 may take a variety of forms. In this example, TPM chip 800 is
   depecited as USB-style thumb drive or fob. TPM chip 800 includes a USB 2.0 Standard-A
   type of USB plug with a flattened rectangle that inserts into a USB 2.0 Standard-A type
30 receptacle of cassette section 120. Most hardware-based security device that addresses boot
   process integrity or data protection are typically modules that connect to a system using a
   proprietary interface designed by the manufacture. Additionally, the modules are often
                                                    16

     WO 2015/077563                                                          PCT/US2014/066815
   constructed as small daughter board style cards or modules connected with tamper-evident or
   tamper resistant fasteners within the system's enclosures. TPM chip 800 provides a
   connector utilizing a well-known standard of construction. TPM chip 800 when embodied as
   a USB-style thumb drive or fob further provides something familiar to users.
