         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5       The present invention relates to a method for preparing a pharmaceutical
   intermediate which belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates
   to vitamin E acetate intermediates 2,3,5-trimethylbenzoquinone synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
10       Vitamin E acetate plays a role of preventing the cell membrane and intracellular
   unsaturated fatty acids and other antioxidants oxidized in metabolic process of the
   body, so as to protect the integrity of the cell membrane and thus prevent aging in the
   body. Vitamin E has a strong reduction, it can be used as antioxidants, eliminating free
   radicals in the body, reducing the damage to the human body. It can be used for skin
15 care, hair care and so on. As a pharmaceutical intermediates of vitamin E acetate, the
   synthesis method of 2,3,5-trimethylbenzoquinone is of great significance. Most of the
   existing synthetic methods are using the            method that  1,2,4-trimethylbenzene
   sulfonated with concentrated sulfuric acid to produce 2,4,5-trimethylbenzenesulfonic
   acid, and then nitrated with potassium nitrate and concentrated sulfuric acid to
20 produce 2,4,5-trimethyl-3,6-dinitrate benzenesulfonic acid potassium, the latter is
   restored to 2,3,5-trimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, and then obtained
   the products that oxidated by sulfuric acid and sodium dichromate. However, this
   method requires concentrated sulfuric acid and sodium dichromate as reactants, the
   operation process is very dangerous, environment-friendly coefficient of using
25 concentrated sulfuric acid and sodium dichromate is low, and the synthesis process is
   more complex. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new synthetic method.
