             FORMULATIONS OF DEOXYCHOLIC ACID AND SALTS THEREOF
                                     FIELD OF THE INVENTION
    [0001]    This invention relates to aqueous pharmaceutical formulations containing very low
 5  concentrations of a salt of deoxycholic acid ("DCA"), wherein the formulation is maintained
    at a pH such that precipitation of DCA is substantially inhibited. In a preferred embodiment,
    the pharmaceutical composition is buffered to maintain a physiologically acceptable pH such
    that the composition is suitable for injection.
                                             BACKGROUND
 0  [0002]    Recently published literature reports that the aqueous solutions of DCA has fat
    removing properties when injected into fatty deposits in vivo (See, WO 2005/117900 and WO
    2005/112942, US2005/0261258; US2005/0267080; US2006/127468; and US2006/0154906).
    DCA injected into fat tissue degrades fat cells via a cytolytic mechanism to provide the
    desired aesthetic results.
 5  [0003]    Notwithstanding the benefits of aqueous formulations of DCA, it has been found
    that at low concentrations of DCA (i.e., less than or about 2% w/v;) in aqueous solutions
    which optionally contain benzyl alcohol, forms a precipitate after storage over a period of
    time. Surprisingly, it has been found that the lower the concentration DCA, the higher is the
    rate of precipitation notwithstanding any significant change in the pH of the solution. This
 '0 precipitation at very low concentrations is a problem for commercialization as a precipitate is
    counter-indicated for subcutaneous injections of DCA.
    [0004]    In each treatment regimen, the current clinical trials of aqueous formulations of
    DCA employ multiple injections of small amounts of the aqueous formulation into different
    sites defining the fat deposit to be treated.
25  [0005]    As is apparent, aqueous formulations of DCA used in such treatments overlap with
    the problems arising from precipitation of the DCA. That is to say that an initially clear
    aqueous solution of DCA when stored for a period of time, will form a precipitate at
    commercially relevant concentrations of DCA notwithstanding the fact that the pH of these
    solutions are between about 7.50 and about 8.0 which are substantially above the pKa of
30  deoxycholic acid.
                                                     1

    [0006]     Thus, there is a need for stabilizing the low concentration aqueous solutions of
    deoxycholic acid or a salt thereof against precipitation during a shelf life of at least 2 months.
                                   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
    [0007]     It has been surprisingly found that aqueous solutions of a salt of deoxycholic acid at
 5  concentrations of from about 0.4% w/v to less than about 2% w/v can be stabilized by
    adjusting the pH of the solution to above about 8 and preferably from a physiologically
    acceptable pH from about 8.1 to about 8.5. The pH is preferably maintained within this range
    by using buffers.
    [0008]     Accordingly, in one of its composition aspects, this invention is directed to aqueous
 0  formulations consisting essentially of a salt of deoxycholic acid at a concentration of from
    about 0.4% w/v to less than about 2% w/v and optionally a preservative effective amount of
    benzyl alcohol which formulations are stabilized against precipitation by adjusting the pH of
    the initially formed clear solution to a pH of from about 8.1 to about 8.5. In another
    embodiment, this invention is directed to an aqueous formulation consisting essentially of a
 5  salt of deoxycholic acid at a concentration of from about 0.5% w/v to about 1% w/v and
    optionally a preservative effective amount of benzyl alcohol which formulations are
    stabilized against precipitation by adjusting the pH of the initially formed clear solution to a
    pH of from about 8.1 to about 8.5.
    [0009]     In another embodiment, this invention is directed to an aqueous formulation
 '0 consisting essentially of:
             a sterile aqueous solution buffered to a pH of about 8.3;
             about 0.5% w/v or about 1% w/v of a salt of deoxycholic acid;
             optionally a preservative effective amount of benzyl alcohol; and
             about 1% w/v of sodium chloride,
25  wherein the composition is stable against precipitation.
    [0010]     Also disclosed herein is a method for stabilizing an aqueous composition of a salt of
    deoxycholic acid against precipitation during storage wherein the concentration of the
    deoxycholic acid salt is an amount effective to lyse fat cells provided that the amount of the
    deoxycholic acid salt ranges from about 0.4% w/v to less than 2% w/v, which method
30  comprises:
                                                       2

            forming an aqueous solution of a deoxycholic acid salt at an initial pH above its pKa;
            adjusting the pH of the aqueous solution to a pH of from about 8.1 to about 8.5; and
            optionally including a sufficient amount of buffer to maintain the pH at from about
            8.1 to about 8.5.
 5 [0011]     Also disclosed herein is a method to lyse a fat cell comprising administering to said
   cell a composition according to this invention.

   [0017]     All numerical designations, e.g., pH, temperature, time, concentration, and
   molecular weight, including ranges, are approximations which are varied (+ ) or (- ) by
25 increments of 0.1. It is to be understood, although not always explicitly stated that all
   numerical designations are preceded by the term "about". The term "about" also includes the
   exact value "X" in addition to minor increments of "X" such as "X + 0.1" or "X - 0.1." It

 5 furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation,
   treatment, or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or any function of the human
   body. Thus, for example, a composition consisting essentially of the elements as defined
   herein would not exclude trace contaminants from the isolation and purification method and
   pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as phosphate buffered saline, preservatives, and
 0 the like but would exclude enzymes such as phosphatases, and proteins. Non-limiting
   examples of such proteins are heparin, albumin, and the like
   [0020]    "Consisting of' shall mean excluding more than trace elements of other ingredients
   and substantial method steps for administering the compositions of this invention.
   Embodiments defined by each of these transition terms are within the scope of this invention.
 5 [0021]    As used herein, the term "salt of deoxycholic acid" or "a salt thereof' refers to

    added to it. Buffer solutions are used as a means of keeping pH at a nearly constant value in
    a wide variety of chemical applications. Examples of suitable buffers include phosphate
    buffers and those known in the literature (see, for example, Troy, D.B., ed. (2005)

 5  bicarbonates, for example sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, zinc
    carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and the like; and metal hydroxides, for example sodium
    hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and the like, such as those known in the literature (see, for
    example, Troy, D.B., ed. (2005) Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21't ed.,
    Lippincott Williams & Wilkins).

   [0030]    As used herein, the term "benzyl alcohol" refers to the compound                    .
   [0031]    As used herein, the term "precipitation" refers to the formation of a solid in a
   solution and is readily differentiated from gel formation.
   [0032]    As used herein, the term "solution" refers to a substantially homogeneous mixture
 5 comprising two or more substances dissolved in a solvent.
   [0033]    As used herein, the terms "substantially inhibit precipitation" and "inhibits
   precipitation" means to inhibit most or all visible precipitation so as to maintain homogeneity
   for a period of time ranging from at least 1 month to at least 1 year.
   [0034]    As used herein, the term "relative standard deviation for homogeneity" or "HE"
 0 refers to the value obtained by dividing the standard deviation of the homogeneity by the
   absolute value of the mean. An HE less than 10 indicates very good homogeneity.
                                              Formulations
   [0035]    Knowledge about the chemical and physical stability of a drug composition in the
   desired media for delivery is valuable. In the longer term, the stability of the composition
 5 will dictate the shelf life of the marketed product. It is preferable that the active ingredient in
   a pharmaceutical composition be at the required concentration when administered to a
   patient.
   [0036]    In the discussion below, sodium deoxycholate is recited for illustrative purposes
   only and it is understood that other pharmaceutically acceptable salts of deoxycholic acid can
20 be used interchangeably with the sodium salt.
   [0037]    Current clinical methods for the administration of a sodium deoxycholate to a
   patient to dissolve fat include the administration via subcutaneous injections of a low
   concentration (i.e., <2% w/v) of an aqueous solution of the salt of deoxycholic acid where the
   amount of the salt of deoxycholic acid is sufficient to lyse fat cells (about 0.4% w/v and
25 higher). At such concentrations, as it has been shown that the low concentration is beneficial
   for the effective and safe removal of fat deposits in the body. However, it has been observed
   that a precipitate forms at such relatively low concentrations of sodium deoxycholate in
   aqueous media. This precipitation results in a limited shelf life of aqueous solutions of
                                                    6

    sodium deoxycholate, even at cold temperatures (3-5 C). In one embodiment, the sodium
    salt can be replaced by another alkali metal salt.
    [0038]    This instability of aqueous solutions of sodium deoxycholate can be circumvented
    by the preparation of an aqueous solution of sodium deoxycholate at a concentration of about
 5  5% to about 16% w/v, and having the practitioner dilute the pharmaceutical composition of
    the sodium deoxycholate solution just prior to use. Whereas this dilution method is effective
    to allow for both storage stability and effective patient dosing, it is not ideal as a method for
    routine use especially if a sterile injectable solution of no more than about 2 mL is required.
    Moreover, current clinical plans include up to 50 injections per treatment session.
 0  [0039]    It has been found that aqueous formulations of sodium deoxycholate at
    concentrations ranging from about 0.4% w/v to less than about 2% w/v can be stabilized by
    adjusting the pH of the solution. This invention is directed to an aqueous formulation
    consisting essentially of a salt of deoxycholic acid at a concentration ranging from about
    0.4% w/v to less than about 2% w/v and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient
 5  such as a preservative effective amount of benzyl alcohol and/or a pH adjusting buffer,
    wherein said formulation is maintained at a pH of about 8.1 to about 8.5.
    [0040]    In another embodiment, the aqueous formulation is lyophilized to provide for a
    stable composition which is ready to be reconstituted by addition of the appropriate amount
    of water. In this embodiment, this invention comprises lyophilized compositions as described
 '0 above which optionally further contain a lyophilization aid.
    [0041]    In one embodiment, the aqueous formulation contains about 0.5% w/v of a salt of
    deoxycholic acid. In another embodiment, the aqueous formulation contains about 1%w/v of
    a salt of deoxycholic acid.
    [0042]    In a further embodiment, the water employed in the aqueous formulation is sterile
25  water. In still a further embodiment, the preservative effective amount of benzyl alcohol is
    about 0.9% w/v benzyl alcohol and the pH of the formulation is about 8.3. In one
    embodiment, said salt is an alkali metal salt. In another embodiment, said salt is a sodium
    salt.
                                                      7

    [0043]    In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulations disclosed herein are suitable
    for injection into a human. The method of injection can be any type of injection, such as
    subcutaneous injection, as well as other forms of injection.
    [0044]    In one preferred aspect of this invention, the precipitation of the salt of deoxycholic
 5  acid in the aqueous formulation is inhibited for a period of at least about six months. In
    another aspect, the precipitation is inhibited for a period of at least about one year. In yet
    another aspect, the precipitation is inhibited for a period of at least about two years.

    or cold temperatures, the formulation can have an increased shelf life. In certain
 0  embodiments, the composition is stored at a temperature of from about 17 'C to about 27 'C.
    In some embodiments, the temperature of the formulation is increased to a temperature of
    about 25 'C to about 37 'C. In other embodiments, the formulation is stored at a temperature

    preferred embodiment, the pH of the formulation is about 8.3.
    [0047]    In one embodiment, the pH is established by the use of a base. It is contemplated
    that any base can be used to increase the pH of the composition provided that it does not react
 '0 with the sodium deoxycholate and will not cause harm to the patient. In some embodiments,
    the base is selected from the group consisting of metal carbonates, metal bicarbonates, metal
    hydroxides, or a mixture thereof. Examples of bases include, but are not limited to, a base
    selected from the group consisting of sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium
    carbonate, zinc carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide
25  or a mixture thereof. In one embodiment, the base is sodium hydroxide.
    [0048]    In certain cases, the pH of the composition may be maintained at the desired pH
    during storage with the use of a buffer. Various buffers are known in the art and it is
    contemplated that any buffer having buffering capacity at the desired pH can be used in the
    formulations disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the buffer is a phosphate buffer. The
30  amount of phosphate in the composition can be determined to provide a desired pH and salt
                                                      8

   buffer. In a preferred embodiment, the composition comprises about 10 mM dibasic sodium
   phosphate buffer.
   [0049]    In some embodiments, the composition comprises at least one excipient to aid in
 5 achieving a composition with desired properties, such as increased solubility, preservability
   or to provide an isotonic solution. Such excipients are known in the art. In one embodiment,
   the composition comprises about 1% w/v sodium chloride. In another embodiment, the
   composition comprises about 0.9% w/v benzyl alcohol. In some embodiments, the
   composition comprises about 0.9% w/v benzyl alcohol and about 1% w/v sodium chloride.
 0 [0050]    In some embodiments, the pH of the composition is established by use of a base and
   optionally maintained by use of a buffer.
   [0051]    In a preferred embodiment, this invention provides a stabilized composition
   comprising:

           about 1% w/v of sodium chloride,
   wherein the composition is stabilized against precipitation.
   [0052]    In a further embodiment, the phosphate buffer is 10 mM dibasic sodium phosphate
20 buffer.
   [0053]    In one embodiment, the preservative effective amount of benzyl alcohol is about

   2% w/v of a salt of deoxycholic acid in water maintained at a pH sufficient to substantially
25 inhibit precipitation of the salt of deoxycholic acid. The amount of precipitation or
   homogeneity of the composition can be measured using various methods. For example, it can
   be measured quantitatively using light scattering by illuminating the composition with a
   spectrophotometer. Or alternatively, the homogeneity can be measured qualitatively by
   observing the visual clarity of the solution with the eye. In some embodiments, the
                                                    9

    composition has a relative standard deviation for homogeneity of less than about 5%.
    Alternatively, the composition has a relative standard deviation for homogeneity of less than
    about 4%, or alternatively, about 30%, or alternatively, about 2%, or alternatively, about 1%.

    some embodiments, a solution is in a container that contains up to 500 mL of solution. Such
    container can be a syringe or syringe-loadable container.
    [0059]    In some embodiments, the formulations further comprise a molecule known to cause
30  fat to die by an orthogonal mechanism. Such molecules include neuropeptide Y (NPY)

    antagonists including, but not limited to, NPY receptor antagonists, such as BIBP-3226
    (Amgen), BIBO-3304 (Boehringer Ingleheim), BMS-192548 and AR-H040922 (Bristol
    Myers Squibb), LY-357897 (Eli Lilly), 1229U91 and GW438014S (GlaxoSmithKline), JNJ

    SR-120819A, BIIE0246, and S.A.0204 (Sanofi Aventis), S-2367 (Shiongli), dihydropyridine
    and dihydropyridine derivatives that are NPY receptor antagonists, bicyclic compounds that
    are NPY receptor antagonists, carbazole NPY receptor antagonists, and tricyclic compounds
    that are NPY receptor antagonists (See, e.g., WO 2006/133160 and U.S. 6,313,128). Also
 0  contemplated are fat selective pro-apoptotic peptides such as the CKGGRAKDC peptide that
    homes to white fat vasculature (See, Kolonin M.G. et al., Nat. Med., 2004, 10(6): 625-32).
    [0060]    Another aspect of the invention relates to mixing adipo-ablative bile acids, such as,
    deoxycholic acid (DCA) with agents that kill fat cells. In one aspect, this invention
    contemplates a means to enhance the aesthetic effects of deoxycholate injections by mixing
 5  into the deoxycholate injectate a molecule that causes fat to die by an orthogonal mechanism.
    Examples of such candidate molecules include, but are not limited to, neuropeptide Y (NPY)
    antagonists and fat selective pro-apoptotic peptides. Since fat cell killing may be required to
    mediate the desired effects, the effects of an agent with fat killing ability can be enhanced via
    the addition of a molecule with potent fat cell killing effects. Additionally, molecules that
 '0 require access to the vasculature to kill (such as certain pro-apoptotic peptides that bind to
    proteins expressed on the luminal side of capillaries) can gain access to these proteins
    because deoxycholate may cause vascular leakage. Thus, such agents can be synergistic with
    deoxycholate potentially creating a more potent means to mediate body contouring in fewer
    therapeutic sessions.

    [0063]     Sodium deoxycholate or sodium (4R)-4-((3R,5R,10S,12S,13R,17R)-3,12-dihydroxy
    10,13 -dimethylhexadecahydro- 1H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren- 17-yl)pentanoate can be
    prepared according to the methods disclosed in PCT/US2010/061150 titled "Methods for the
    Purification of Deoxycholic Acid," filed on December 17, 2010. Other salts of deoxycholic
  0 acid can be prepared likewise by the skilled artisan.
                                                  Methods
    [0064]     Disclosed herein are methods for stabilizing an aqueous formulation of deoxycholic
    acid salt against precipitation during storage wherein the concentration of or a salt thereof is
    an amount effective to lyse fat cells provided that the amount of salt ranges from about 0.4%
  5 w/v to about less than 2% w/v, which method comprises:
             forming an aqueous solution of the salt of deoxycholic acid at an initial pH above its
             pKa;
             adjusting the pH of the aqueous solution to a pH of from about 8.1 to about 8.5; and
             optionally including a sufficient amount of buffer to maintain the pH at from about
'20          8.1 to about 8.5.
    [0065]     In one aspect of this invention, methods disclosed herein substantially stabilize the
    formulation of deoxycholic acid salt against precipitation over a period of time preferably for
    at least about six months. In another aspect, the methods stabilize the formulation of
    deoxycholic acid salt against precipitation for a period of at least about one year. In yet
25  another aspect, the methods stabilize the formulation of deoxycholic acid salt against
    precipitation for a period of at least about two years.
    [0066]     It has been found that the pH of the solution can inhibit the precipitation of
    deoxycholic acid or a salt thereof at concentrations of from about 0.4% w/v to less than about
    2% w/v in water to allow deoxycholic acid or a salt thereof, to be maintained in solution. In
30  one embodiment, the pH is established by the use of a base. It is contemplated that any base
                                                     12

    can be used to increase the pH of the composition provided that it does not react with
    deoxycholic acid or a salt thereof. In some embodiments, the base is selected from the group
    consisting of metal carbonates, metal bicarbonates, and metal hydroxides, or a mixture
    thereof. Examples of bases include, but are not limited to, a base selected from the group
 5  consisting of sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, zinc carbonate,
    sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide or a mixture thereof. In one
    embodiment, the base is sodium hydroxide.
    [0067]    In certain embodiments, the pH ranges from about 8.1 to about 8.5. In one
    embodiment, the pH of the composition is about 8.1, or alternatively, about 8.2, or
 0  alternatively, about 8.3, or alternatively, about 8.4, or alternatively, about 8.5. In a preferred
    embodiment, the pH of the aqueous solution is about 8.3.
    [0068]    In certain cases, the pH of the composition may need to be maintained with the use
    of a buffer. Various buffers are know in the art and it is contemplated that any buffer having
    buffering capacity at the desired pH can be used in the formulations disclosed herein. In one
 5  embodiment, the buffer is a phosphate buffer. The amount of phosphate required to provide a
    desired pH and salt concentration can be calculated using methods well known in the art. In
    one embodiment, the composition comprises about 10 mM phosphate buffer. In another
    embodiment, the phosphate buffer is 10 mM dibasic sodium phosphate buffer.
    [0069]    In certain cases, the pH is established by use of a base and optionally maintained by
 '0 use of a buffer.
    [0070]    In one embodiment, the methods disclosed herein provide formulations which are
    suitable for injection into a human. The method of injection can be any type of injection,
    such as subcutaneous injection, as well as other forms of injection. Therefore, in some
    embodiments, the aqueous solution comprises sterile water or water for injection (WFI).
25  [0071]    In one aspect, it may be that one or more excipients are used to maintain the
    solubility, or increase the preservability of deoxycholic acid salt present in the formulation.
    In one embodiment, the method comprises adding about 1%w/v benzyl alcohol. In some
    embodiments, the formulation also comprises at least one excipient to aid in achieving an
    isotonic solution. Such excipients are known in the art. In one embodiment, the method
30  comprises adding about 1%w/v sodium chloride. In some embodiments, the method
                                                     13

    comprises adding both 1% w/v benzyl alcohol and 1%w/v sodium chloride. In some
    embodiments, the method comprises adding both 0.9% w/v benzyl alcohol and 0.9% w/v
    sodium chloride. Using the methods disclosed herein, an aqueous solution comprising less
    than about 2% w/v of deoxycholic acid salt is maintained at a pH sufficient to substantially
 5  inhibit precipitation of deoxycholic acid salt. The amount of precipitation or homogeneity of
    the composition can be measured using various methods. For example, it can be measured
    quantitatively by measuring the light scattering via illumination by a spectrophotometer. Or
    alternatively, the homogeneity can be measured qualitatively by simply observing the visual
    clarity of the solution with the eye. In some embodiments, the method provides a
 0  pharmaceutical composition having a relative standard deviation for homogeneity of less than
    about 5%. Alternatively, the relative standard deviation for homogeneity of less than about
    4%, or alternatively, about 3%, or alternatively, about 2%, or alternatively, about 1%.
    [0072]     The storage temperature can assist in maintaining the solubility of deoxycholic acid
    salt in the formulation. In certain embodiments, the storage temperature is from about 17 'C
 5  to about 27 'C. In some embodiments, the storage temperature is about 25 'C to about 37 'C.
    In other embodiments, the storage temperature is from about 2 'C to about 8 'C.
    [0073]     It is contemplated that the concentration of the salt of deoxycholic acid in the
    formulation is about 0.5% w/v, or alternatively about 0.7% w/v, or alternatively about 1%
    w/v, or alternatively about 1.2% w/v, or alternatively about 1.4% w/v, or alternatively less
 '0 than about 2% w/v. In a preferred embodiment, the salt of deoxycholic acid is sodium
    deoxycholate. In another preferred embodiment, the composition comprises 0.5% w/v of
    sodium deoxycholate. In another preferred embodiment, the composition comprises 1%w/v
    of sodium deoxycholate.
    [0074]     In one embodiment, the aqueous formulation is split into a plurality of individual
25  solutions which are separately administered to the fat cells. For example, the aqueous
    formulation is split into 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 separate solutions and, in some cases, up to 50
    separate solutions.
    [0075]     In a preferred embodiment, the salt of deoxycholic acid is sodium deoxycholate. As
    the methods of this invention include subcutaneous injections, there is also provided a syringe
30  comprising a chamber, a plunger and an injection needle wherein the chamber comprises a
                                                     14

   formulation of this invention. Preferably, the chamber is sufficient to hold at least 2 mL and
   preferably no more than 4 mL of the formulation.

   [0077]       The 9-a,17-0 hydroxyl groups of commercially available 9-U,17--dihydroxy-5-a
   androstan-3-one are differentially protected with hydroxyl protecting groups which can be
10 removed under conditions where one of the hydroxyl groups is regenerated while the other
   hydroxyl group remains protected. Such differential protection is referred to as orthogonal
   protection and uses well known reagents and reaction conditions. In one example, one
   hydroxy group is protected as an acetyl group, whereas the other hydroxy group is protected
   as a benzyl group. Each group can be selectively removed under reaction conditions that
15 retain the other hydroxyl protecting group intact.
                                                              15

    [0078]    It is contemplated that the relatively sterically protected 9-a-hydroxyl group may not
    need to be protected as the reactions contemplated prior to elimination of that group are likely
    inhibited at this position due to steric hindrance. Regardless, protection of this hydroxyl
    group adequately insures that the group remains intact until elimination of the hydroxyl group
 5  via dehydration is desired.
    [0079]    The 3-one group of orthogonally protected 9-a, 17--dihydroxy-5 -a-androstan-3
    one, compound 1, is reduced with conventional reducing agent such as sodium borohydride
    to provide the 3-a-hydroxy derivative which is then protected with yet another orthogonal
    protecting group to provide compound 2.
 0  [0080]    The hydroxyl protecting group at the 17-position of compound 2 is then selectively
    removed and the hydroxyl group so regenerated is then oxidized with a suitable oxidation
    reagent such as Cr0 3 to provide the 17-keto derivative, compound 3. The 17-keto group in
    compound 3 is protected as a ketal under standard ketalization conditions such as reaction
    with 1,2-dihydroxyethane or 1,3-dihydroxypropane to give compound 4 (which illustrates
 5  ketal formation with the 1,2-dihydroxyethane for illustrative purposes only).
    [0081]    Deprotection of the 9-a-hydroxyl as necessary is followed by dehydration of that
    hydroxyl group under conditions such as acid-catalyzed elimination provides the 9,10
    unsaturated derivative, compound 5. Generation of a 12-keto group is accomplished by
    allylic oxidation of compound 5 with oxidation reagents such as chromic acid or TBHP (tert
 '0 butyl hydroperoxide) and NaOCl to provide compound 6. See, for example, U.S. Patent
    Application Serial No. 61/348,686. Alternatively, the allylic oxidation is accomplished by
    using about 2 to 5 equivalents of TBHP and about 0.3 to 0.5 equivalents of Cul as a catalyst.
    The reaction is carried out in a solvent such as acetonitrile at 40 'C for about 40-55 hours.
    The slow portionwise addition of TBHP results in more efficient oxidation. The product
25  formed contains a mixture of compound 6 and the corresponding allylic alcohol. The product
    mixture is then oxidized with PCC to give compound 6.
    [0082]    Hydrogenation of compound 6 under standard conditions such as 10% Pd/C and H 2
    provides compound 7. Reduction of the 12-keto group in compound 7 with reagents such as
    LiAl(OBu) 3H provides the 12-hydroxy derivative, compound 8. Olefination of compound 8
30  under standard Wittig conditions such as using ethyltriphenylphosphonium bromide in
    presence of a base such as potassium tert-butoxide provides compound 9. Addition of an
    alkyl acrylate such as methyl acrylate in presence of a Lewis acid provides compound 10,
                                                     16

    wherein R is an alkyl group such as methyl. Reduction of the double bond in compound 10
    again proceeds under standard hydrogenation conditions such as Pd/C and H2 to provide
    compound 11. Deprotection of the 3-OR 3 followed by hydrolysis with a base such as LiOH
    provides DCA, compound 12.

    recrystallized from ethanol. It was diluted with 2 mol% MeOH in CH 2 Cl 2 (25 vol) and
    heated to 35-37 'C for 1 hour. The slurry was allowed to cool to 28-30 'C and filtered. The
    filter cake was washed with CH 2 Cl 2 (5 vol) and dried under vacuum at 40 'C to afford DCA.
    [0084]     DCA was dissolved in 10% DI water/ EtOH (12 vol), polish filtered over celite and
 0  washed with 10% DI water/ EtOH (3 vol). The resulting 15 volume filtrate was added to DI
    water (30 vol) and a thin white slurry was afforded. The slurry was held for 24 hours,
    filtered, washed with DI water (20 vol) and dried under vacuum at 40 'C to afford DCA.
    [0085]     Conversion of DCA to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt such as sodium
    deoxycholate proceeds via conventional conditions. Alternatively, conversion of a
 5  pharmaceutically acceptable salt of DCA such as sodium deoxycholate to DCA also proceeds
    via conventional conditions.

                                                 Example 1
        Concentration dependent precipitation from a solution of sodium deoxycholate
   [0090]     Solutions of sodium deoxycholate at different concentration were evaluated for
   precipitate formation after 1 week of storage. The results are depicted in Figs. 1-4, and
 0 demonstrate that at about 0.5% and at about 1 % (w/v) concentration of sodium deoxycholate
   in an aqueous solution containing only water and 0.9 % w/v benzyl alcohol, a significant
   amount of precipitate is formed such that it would inhibit use of the solution as a composition
   for subcutaneous injections. By visual inspection of Figs. 1-4, the amount of precipitation
   can be rated as tabulated below.

   [0091]    The precipitation rating estimates that "0" refers a clear solution and that "10" refers
   to a mixture exhibiting substantial precipitation readily visible to the naked eye.
   [0092]     Such an observation demonstrates that in the concentration ranges tested, the
   precipitation phenomena was substantially affected by deoxycholate concentration. To
 5 ascertain pH's effect on precipitation, the pH of the solutions were measured, as provided in
   Table 2, which demonstrates that the pH of the solutions were substantially the same,
   especially for the 1% and the 2% solutions. The inverse aqueous solubility of sodium
   deoxycholate, where a more dilute solution (0.50% or 1%) provides more precipitation than a
   more concentrated solution (2%), is a surprising observation and also evidences that the
 0 precipitation phenomena is not directly related to pH, because the pH of the solutions were
   substantially the same again, especially for the 1% and 2% solutions.

   [0093]    Accordingly, this invention provides that the surprising precipitation from dilute,
   0.4% to less than 2% (w/v), salt of deoxycholic acid solutions are inhibited, to the extent that
15 such solutions are useful for subcutaneous injections, by increasing the solution pH.
                                              Example 2
            Sodium deoxycholate (API) formulations with and without benzyl alcohol
   1.      A composition of sodium deoxycholate (0.5% and 1% ) was prepared comprising
   sodium phosphate (10 mM), sodium chloride (75-90 mM), benzyl alcohol (0.9%),
20 deoxycholic acid, pH 8.3.
   2.      An isotonic composition of sodium deoxycholate without benzyl alcohol was
   prepared using the free acid form, namely, deoxycholic acid, as follows.
                                                   19

            a.       Preparation of 100 mL isotonic batches at 10 mg/mL
    [0094]     1.0 g of the deoxycholic acid (DCA) added to the solution only after a basic solution
    was made with 70 mL water, 142 mg anhydrous dibasic sodium phosphate and 267 gL 10M
    NaOH. It took about 20 minutes for the API to go into solution. The pH of the solution was
 5  11.1. The rapid addition of HCl was known to cause some precipitation, so 225 gL of 1M
    HCl was slowly added to bring the solution to pH 8.3. The solution was allowed to mix for
    an additional 15 minutes. After bringing the volume up to 100 mL with water, the osmolality
    was found to be 51 mOsm. Addition of 859 mg of NaCl brought the osmolality up to 305
    mOsm.
 0  [0095]     The solution so prepared could optionally be lyophilized to provide for a lyophilized
    product which could be reconstituted by addition of the appropriate amount of sterile water.
    Accordingly, this invention also provides for lyophilized products of the solutions disclosed
    herein.
            b.       Preparation of 1000 mL isotonic batches at 10 mg/mL
 5  [0096]     The results from section a (above) did not scale up perfectly when multiplied ten
    fold. To 900 mL of water, 1.4g anhydrous dibasic sodium phosphate, 8.6 g NaCl, and 2.7 mL
    10 M NaOH were added. 10.0 g of DCA was then added and allowed to mix to clarity for 30
    minutes. The pH of the solution was 10.4. 1.5 mL 1 M HCl was slowly added and allowed to
    mix for 5 minutes. The final pH was 8.1. An additional 20 gL of 1GM NaOH had to be
 '0 added to bring the pH to 8.3. After bringing the volume up to 1000 mL with water, the
    osmolality was 314 mOsm.
    [0097]     Based on observations of the pH change during the addition of 1 M HCl, it was
    determined that for 1000 mL batches at 10 mg/mL API, just 1.0 mL of IM HCl should be
    immediately added and then slowly titrated with small volumes of the acid. The suggested
25  order of addition for 1000 mL of 10 mg/mL API is outlined in Table 3.
            c.       Preparation of 100 mL isotonic batches at 5 mg/mL
    [0098]     0.50 g of deoxycholic acid (DCA) was added to the solution only after a basic
    solution was made with 70 mL water, 142 mg anhydrous dibasic sodium phosphate and 134
    gL 1GM NaOH. It took about 20 minutes for the API to go into solution. The pH was 10.7.
30  The rapid addition of HCl was known to cause some precipitation, so 115 gL of 1 M HCl was
                                                    20

  slowly added to bring the solution to pH 8.3. The solution was allowed to mix for an
  additional 15 minutes. After bringing the volume up to 100 mL with water, the osmolality
  was found to be 39 mOsm. Addition of 859 mg of NaCl brought the osmolality up to 294
  mOsm.
5         d.     Preparation of 1000 mL isotonic batches at 5 mg/mL
  [0099]    The results from section c (above) did not scale up perfectly when multiplied ten
  fold. To 900 mL of water, 1.4g anhydrous dibasic sodium phosphate, 8.6 g NaCl, and 1.3 mL
  10M NaOH were added. 5.0 g of DCA was then added and allowed to mix to clarity for 30
  minutes. The pH was 8.6. After adding just 350 gL IM HCl, the pH dropped to 8.0. An
0 additional 25 gL of 10M NaOH had to be added to bring the pH to 8.4. After bringing the
  volume up to 1000 mL with water, the osmolality was 305 mOsm. Based on observations of
  the pH change during the addition of 1 M HCl, it was determined that for 1000 mL batches at
  5 mg/mL API, that the solution should be slowly titrated with small volumes of IM HCl.
  The suggested order of addition for 1000 mL of 5 mg/mL is outlined in Table 3.
