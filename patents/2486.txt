                               ABSTRACT
         A display body includes a first display part, which
displays     first information, and a second display part, which
displays     second information of a larger display size than the
first information.      The second display part includes the
entire first display part as a part of the second display
part.     The  first display part has a plasmon structure.  The
plasmon structure includes an interface between a metal layer
and a dielectric layer, which transmits light, and is
configured so that surface plasmons are excited in the
interface to change irradiation light with which the
interface is irradiated to transmitted light having a color
different     from that of the irradiation light.  The first
information is displayed with the transmitted light.

            DISPLAY BODY AND OBSERVING METHOD       FOR DISPLAY BODY
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]             The technology of the present disclosure relates
to a display body using surface plasmons and a method for
observing a display body.
BACKGROUND ART
[0002]             In order to protect,     from other persons, values or
information of products such as valuable securities,
certificates, brand-name products, high price products,
electronic devices, and personal authentication media, it is
desirable that the products be difficult to counterfeit.
Therefore, in some cases, such a product may be attached with
a display body that is difficult to counterfeit.
[0003]           As a display body that is difficult to counterfeit,
there is known a display body for displaying image
information by using a plurality of cells formed by
diffraction        grating.     With respect  to such a  display body,
there is also known a display body having a micro-image that
corresponds to a bitmap pattern having two or more values
inside a specific cell among a plurality of cells and can be
observed by using a microscope             (refer to, for example, Patent
Document       1).

SUMMARY OF        THE    INVENTION
Problems that the Invention is to Solve
                                         1
3467613vl

[0005]         However, a micro-image corresponding to a bitmap
pattern having two or more values displays an image by two or
more height     differences.        For this    reason,    for example, when
dust or a stain having the same size as the height difference
constituting the micro-image overlaps with a part of the
micro-image, there is a possibility that an observer of a
display body falsely recognizes the dust or stain as a part
of the micro-image.
[0006]         The technology of the present disclosure is to
provide a display body capable of restraining information
false recognition of an observer and a method for observing a
display body.
Means for Solving the Problems
[0007]         To achieve the foregoing objective and in
accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a
display body is provided that includes a first display part,
which displays        first information,       and a second display part,
which displays        second information having a display size
greater   than that        of the  first    information.     The second
display part includes the entire              first display part as a part
of the second display part.              The first display part includes a
plasmon structure.           The plasmon structure      is   configured to
include an interface between a metal layer and a dielectric
layer that transmits light, excite surface plasmons in the
interface to change irradiation light with which the
interface is irradiated to transmitted light having a color
different   from that of the irradiation light, and display the
first information with the transmitted light.
[0008]         In accordance with another aspect of the present
invention, a method for observing a display body is provided.
The display body includes a first              display part, which
displays   first information, and a second display part, which
displays   second information having a display size greater
than that of the first information.                The second display part
                                           2
3467613vl

includes the entire first display part as a part of the
second display part.          The first display part includes a
plasmon structure.        The plasmon structure      is  configured to
include an interface between a metal layer and a dielectric
layer that transmits light, excite surface plasmons in the
interface to change irradiation light with which the
interface is irradiated to transmitted light having a color
different     from that of the irradiation light, and display the
first information with the transmitted light.              The method
includes irradiating the interface of the display body with
the irradiation light and observing the display body
irradiated with the irradiation light in a magnifying manner.
[0009]          In accordance with one aspect of the display body
according to the technology of the present disclosure, since
the first display part included in the second display part
displays the first information with the transmitted light
having a predetermined color, the observer of the display
body can recognize the first            information by using the
difference between the light having a predetermined color and
the other parts.      Therefore, the difference between a part for
the first     information and the other parts         can be easily
recognized.      As a result,     false    recognition of information  by
the observer is restrained.

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION
[0011]          A display body and a method for observing the
display body according to one embodiment of the present
disclosure will now be described with reference to Figs.               1 to
7.    Hereinafter, the overall configuration of a display body,
the configuration of a micro-display part included in the
display body, the configuration of a display element,
functions of the micro-display part, and a method for
observing the display body will be sequentially described.
[0012]
[Overall Configuration of Display Body]            An overall
configuration of a display body will now be described with
reference to Fig. 1A and Fig. 1B.           Fig. 1B is a diagram
illustrating a part surrounded by a circle indicated by a
long dashed short dashed line of Fig. 1A in a magnified
manner.
[0013]          As illustrated in Fig. 1A, a display body 10 is
configured to include a substrate 11,           a display part 12
located on one surface of the substrate 11,             and a plurality
of micro-display parts located on one surface of the
substrate     11.  The  substrate    11 has,   for example,   a
rectangular plate      shape.     However,  if  the substrate   has an
area where the display part 12          can be located, the shape
thereof is not      limited to the rectangular plate shape, but
                                       5
3467613vl

the substrate may have other shapes such as a circular plate
shape or a rectangular parallelepiped shape.
[0014]         The display part   12 is an example of a second
display part and displays      second information, which is
predetermined     information.   Information    displayed by the
display part     12 is, for example, an image, and as illustrated
in Fig. 1A, a shape in which two adjacent          circles among three
circles are continuous with each other is an example of the
image.    The  image, as information displayed by the display
part 12,    is not limited to figures such as design patterns or
shapes, but the image may be characters, symbols, and
numerals or may be a combination of at least two of figures,
characters, symbols,     and numerals.    In   addition,  the
information displayed by the display part 12 is not limited
to an image, but the information may be color information
such as the ratio of a specific color to the entire display
part 12,    a color arrangement of the display part 12,         or the
existence of a color, or may be position information             such as
a position where a specific color is arranged or a position
where a color is added in the display part 12.
[0015]         As illustrated in Fig. 1B, the display part 12
includes the entirety of each micro-display part 13 as a part
of the    display part  12.  That is,  the display part       12 is
larger than each micro-display part 13         and has a size capable
of including the micro-display parts         13 as a part.
[0016]         For example, the display part 12 may be a part
displaying information by using light diffraction by a
diffraction grating structure or may be a part of a metal
layer formed on the surface of the substrate          11 having a
predetermined shape that is formed by, for example, an
etching method, in which information is displayed by light
reflection or diffusion on the metal layer.
[0017]         Each micro-display part 13 is an example of a
first display part.      The micro-display part 13 has a plasmon
structure of exciting surface plasmons to change irradiation
                                    6
3467613vl

light with which the micro-display part 13     is irradiated to
transmitted light having a color different from that of the
irradiation light.     The micro-display parts  13 are located
within the display part 12.     The display body 10   does not
necessarily need to include the micro-display parts 13, but
it may include only one micro-display part 13.
[0018]        Each micro-display part 13 displays first
information, which is predetermined information and has a
display size    smaller than that of the second information
displayed by the display part 12,    by the aforementioned
transmitted light.     That is, the display size of the second
information displayed by the display part 12 may be greater
than that of the first information displayed by the micro
display part    13, and the size of the display part 12 may be
equal to the display size of the second information.       For
example, in a case in which the display part      12 displays a
three-dimensional image, the size of the display part may be
greater or smaller than the display size of the second
information.     The size of the micro-display part 13 may also
be equal to the display size of the first     information or may
be larger or smaller than the display size of the first
information.
[0019]        The first  information is, for example, a
predetermined character line as an example of the image.       The
character line in which a Roman letter 0 and a Roman letter K
are continuous, illustrated by Fig. 1B,     is an example of the
first information.     Similarly to the above-described second
information, the first information displayed by the micro
display part    13 may be an image, color information, or
position information.
[0020]        The entirety of each micro-display part 13    is
included as a part of the display part 12.      That is,  the
micro-display part 13 is smaller than the display part 12       and
has a size capable of being included within the display part
12.    The micro-display parts 13 may be arranged regularly or
                                  7
3467613vl

irregularly within the display part 12.
[0021]
 [Configuration of Micro-Display Part]
          A more detailed configuration of the micro-display part
13 will now be described with reference to Fig. 2.
          As illustrated in Fig. 2, the micro-display part 13 is
configured to include a plurality of display elements          21
arranged in a matrix shape.         Each display element 21 is a
region having, for example, a rectangular shape defined
inside the display part 12.         The display element 21 is not
limited to the rectangular shape, but it may be a region
having, for example, various polygon shapes other than the
rectangular shape, such as a triangular shape or a pentagonal
shape.       The  first information displayed by the micro-display
part 13 is configured with a plurality of information
elements, and the micro-display part         13 is configured to
include display elements 21 for respective information
elements.
[0022]            The length Li of one  side of each display element
21 is,      for example, 200 nm or more and 3000 nm or less.       If
the length Li of one        side of the display element 21 is 200 nm
or more and 3000 nm or less, the size of the display element
21 is a preferred size so that the micro-display part 13 is
difficult to visually recognize and the micro-display part 13
can be observed at a magnification ratio settable in an
optical microscope.
[0023]            For example, the display elements   21 are arranged
along a row direction R as one direction and are arranged
along a column direction C perpendicular to the row direction
R.    The number of display elements      21 arranged in the row
direction R is,        for example, 10 or more and 100 or less, and
the number of display elements 21 arranged in the column
direction C is,        for example, 10 or more and 100 or less.     In
this case,       one micro-display part 13 is configured to include
100 or more and 10000 or less of the display elements          21.
                                      8
3467613vl

[0024]          When the length Li       of one  side of each display
element 21 is included within the aforementioned range, if
the number of display elements 21 constituting one micro
display part      13 is 100 or more and 10000 or less, the size of
the micro-display part 13          is a preferred size in terms of the
following point.       That is,     the size of the micro-display part
13 is a preferred size so that the micro-display part 13 is
difficult to visually recognize and the micro-display part 13
can be observed at a magnification ratio settable in an
optical microscope.
[0025]          The first    information displayed by each micro
display part      13 includes a plurality of information elements
including a first       information element       representing a first
color and a second information element representing a second
color different      from the    first   color.    The display elements  21
constituting the micro-display part 13             include a first
display element 22       corresponding to the first        information
element representing the first color and a second display
element 23 corresponding to the second information element
representing the second color.             The plasmon structure included
in the first display element           22 and the plasmon    structure
included in the second display element 23 transmit light
having different colors.
[0026]          In each micro-display part 13,         for example, the
first display elements 22 display a Roman letter 0,              and the
second display elements 23 display a Roman letter K.               For
example, when the first display elements 22              correspond to the
first information elements representing red as the first
color, the micro-display part 13 displays a red Roman letter
O as a part     of the first    information.       On the other hand,  when
the second display elements 23 correspond to the second
information elements representing blue as the second color,
the micro-display part 13 displays a blue Roman letter K as a
part of the first       information.
[0027]          Each micro-display part 13 further includes a
                                         9
3467613vl

plurality of peripheral elements 24 including a part between
the first display elements 22 and the second display elements
23,   a part surrounded by the first display elements 22,        or a
part surrounded by the second display elements 23.          Each of
the peripheral elements 24 may be a part that transmits the
irradiation light with which the micro-display part 13 is
irradiated without change in color of the irradiation light,
may be a part that does not transmit the irradiation          light,
or may be a part that transmits light having a color
different     from those of the first     display element 22 and the
second display element 23.       Each micro-display part 13 does
not necessarily need to include the peripheral elements 24.
[0028]
 [Configuration of Display element]
          A detailed configuration of the display element 21 will
now be     described with reference    to  Figs. 3 to  5. Hereinafter,
among the display elements 21, the display elements 21 having
plasmon structures like the first         display element 22 and the
second display element 23 will now be described.
[0029]          As illustrated in Fig. 3, the display element 21
has a plasmon structure configured to include a metal layer
31,   a dielectric layer 32,    which transmits light, and an
interface 33 between the metal layer 31 and the dielectric
layer 32.      The plasmon structure of the display element 21
excites surface plasmons in an interface 33 by the
irradiation light with which the interface between the
dielectric layer 32 and the metal layer 31         is irradiated to
change the irradiation light to light having a color
different     from that of the irradiation light.
[0030]          The dielectric layer 32 includes,     for example, a
base body 41 having a base surface 41a as one surface, and
the base body 41 includes a plurality of protrusions 42,
which protrude from the base       surface 41a.    The base surface
41a is a formation surface on which the protrusions 42          are
formed.      The dielectric layer 32 may have a multi-layered
                                    10
3467613vl

structure including layers other than the base body 41.                In
each protrusion 42,      a surface farther from the base surface
41a is a top surface 42a, and a surface including the top
surfaces 42a of all the protrusions 42             is an imaginary plane
42b.     The base  surface 41a of the base body 41 and the
imaginary plane 42b are substantially parallel to each other.
The distance D between the base surface 41a and the imaginary
plane 42b is preferably, for example, 30 nm or more and 500
nm or less.
[0031]          The plasmon structure included in the display
element 21 preferably has at         least one interface 33 between
the metal     layer 31  and the  dielectric       layer 32.   Therefore,
the plasmon structure excites          surface plasmons in the
interface 33 by the irradiation light with which the
interface 33 is irradiated to change the irradiation               light to
transmitted light having a color different from that of the
irradiation light.       The plasmon structure included in one
display element 21 preferably has            a configuration in which
one display element 21 transmits transmitted light having a
predetermined color and in which the plasmon structure
includes two or more protrusions 42 and a metal layer 31
covering at least the top surface 42a of each protrusion 42.
[0032]          Each protrusion 42 has,        for example, a rectangular
pillar shape.      However, each protrusion may have a polygonal
pillar shape other than the rectangular pillar shape such as
a trigonal pillar shape or a pentagonal pillar shape, may
have a cylindrical shape or an elliptic cylindrical shape, or
may have a conical shape such as a cone shape or a polygonal
pyramid shape.      When each protrusion 42 has a polygonal pillar
shape, each of the corners of the polygonal pillar shape may
have a curvature.      Furthermore, each protrusion 42 may have a
plurality of step differences at a side surface connecting
the top surface 42a and the base            surface 41a.    The side
surface of each protrusion 42 may have a shape in which, in a
step difference surface including a surface substantially
                                      11
3467613vl

parallel to the imaginary plane 42b and in a cross section
along a direction of the thickness T of the metal layer 31         of
each protrusion 42,    a width thereof in a direction
perpendicular to an extension direction of the protrusion 42
is increased for every step difference from the top surface
42a toward the base surface 41a.      In such a configuration, the
metal layer 31 may be located on each surface substantially
parallel to the imaginary plane 42b in the side         surface.
[0033]        The material for forming the dielectric layer 32
is,   for example,  quartz.  As the material     for forming the
dielectric layer 32,    an inorganic material transmitting
visible light other than quartz,     for example, a titanium
oxide or a magnesium fluoride may be used, or an organic
material transmitting visible light, for example, various
plastics may be used.
[0034]        When the material for forming the dielectric layer
32 is an inorganic material, the dielectric layer 32
including the base body 41 and the protrusions 42         included in
the base body 41 is formed, for example, by applying a
chemical etching process, a physical etching process, or the
like on a substrate formed by each material.         When the
material for forming the dielectric layer 32 is a plastic,
the dielectric layer 32 including the base body 41 and the
protrusions 42    included in the base body 41 is formed, for
example, by transferring an original plate to a layer formed
with the plastic.
[0035]        The dielectric layer 32 constitutes a part of the
substrate 11 in the display body 10.         The entire substrate  11
may be formed with the same material as the material for
forming the dielectric layer 32,     or the substrate 11 may
include the dielectric layer 32 and a portion formed with a
material different from the material for forming the
dielectric layer 32.
[0036]        The metal layer 31 may be formed, for example, on
the entire part in which the protrusions 42 are not formed on
                                  12
3467613vl

the base    surface 41a, and on the top surfaces 42a of the
protrusions 42.      The metal layer 31 may be formed on a part of
the base    surface 41a, may be formed on a part of each top
surface 42a, may be formed only on the base surface 41a, or
may be only on the top surface 42a.        Therefore, the interface
33 between the dielectric layer 32       and the metal layer 31     is
formed.     In the configuration in which the plasmon structure
transmits light having a predetermined color by the surface
plasmons in the interface 33,      the thickness T of the metal
layer 31 is,     for example, 20 nm or more and 100 nm or less,
preferably, 40     nm or more and 60 nm or less.
[0037]         The material for forming the metal layer 31 is,
for example, aluminum.       The material for forming the metal
layer 31 may be gold, silver, a titanium nitride, or the like,
and the real part of the complex dielectric constant of the
forming material in a visible light range preferably has a
negative value.      When the material for forming the metal layer
31 has    such characteristics, the light transmitted by the
excitation of the surface plasmons is reliably included in
the visible light range.       For this reason, an observer can
reliably recognize the information displayed by the display
body 10.
[0038]         The metal layer 31   is formed, for example, by a
physical vapor deposition method such as a vacuum vapor
deposition method or a sputtering method.          When the metal
layer 31 is formed by a vacuum vapor deposition method, a
fine uneven structure is formed on the surface of the metal
layer 31.     However,   the fine uneven structure    formed by the
vacuum vapor deposition method has a size to such an extent
that the fine uneven structure does not influence the state
of the surface plasmons formed in the interface 33 between
the metal layer 31      and the dielectric layer 32.     For this
reason, the metal layer 31 may have such an uneven structure,
that is,    surface roughness, to the extent that the uneven
structure is formed by the vacuum vapor deposition method.
                                   13
3467613vl

[0039]          As illustrated in Fig. 4, a plurality of
protrusions 42      are, for example, arranged to be spaced at an
equal interval G in an X direction as one direction and
arranged to be spaced at the equal interval G in a Y
direction     perpendicular      to  the X direction.       That is,  a
plurality of protrusions 42 is arranged regularly in a
tetragonal lattice shape on the base               surface 41a of the base
body 41.      Fig. 3 illustrated above illustrates a cross
sectional structure taken along line 3-3 of Fig. 4.
[0040]          As illustrated in Fig. 5,           in the protrusions    42,
the interval G between the protrusions 42 adjacent to each
other in the X direction is equal to the interval G between
the protrusions 42       adjacent to each other in the Y direction.
As viewed from the plane facing the base body 41,                 that is,
the base     surface 41a in the dielectric layer 32,            the length
L2    of one  side of each protrusion 42 is,            for example, equal
to the interval G,       and when the sum of the interval G and the
length L2 is one period P, the period P is preferably, for
example,     100 nm or more and 600 nm or less.             The period P is   a
distance, that is,       an inter-center distance between centers
of the protrusions 42          in the protrusions 42 adjacent to each
other as viewed from a plane facing the base                surface 41a.
[0041]          On the other hand, in the protrusions 42,             the
distance between the protrusions 42 adjacent to each other in
the direction intersecting the X direction is greater than
the period P.       For this reason, the protrusions 42 arranged in
a tetragonal lattice         shape include parts in which the
distance between the adjacent protrusions 42 is the period P
and parts     in which the distance between the adjacent
protrusions      42 is greater      than the period P.       Therefore,   in
the display element 21 including the protrusions 42 arranged
in a tetragonal lattice shape, the state of the surface
plasmons formed in the interface 33 in the part in which the
distance between two of the protrusions 42                is the period P
and the state of the surface plasmons formed in the interface
                                        14
3467613vl

33 in the part in which the distance between two of the
protrusions 42   is greater than the period P are different
from each other.
[0042]       On the assumption that the material for forming
the dielectric layer 32 is the same and the period P           is the
same, the color of light transmitted by the plasmon structure
is changed by changing the fill factor, which is the ratio of
the length L2 of one   side of the protrusion 42,         to the period
P.
[0043]
[Operation of Micro-Display part]          As described above, each
micro-display part 13 includes the first display element 22
and the second display element      23.     Each of the  first  display
element 22  and the second display element 23 has a plasmon
structure including the interface 33 between the metal layer
31 and the dielectric layer 32 to transmit light having a
color different from that of the irradiation light by the
surface plasmons excited in the interface 33.
[0044]       The color of light transmitted by each first
display element 22   and the color of light transmitted by each
second display element 23 are determined according to the
state of the   surface plasmons   formed in the plasmon        structure.
Between the two interfaces 33,     the states of the surface
plasmons formed in the two interfaces 33 are different from
each other when at least one of the following conditions is
different  therebetween.   That is,     if   at least  one of the
period P of the dielectric layer 32,         the distance D between
the base  surface 41a and the imaginary plane         42b in the
dielectric layer 32,   the arrangement       state of the protrusions
42 on the base surface 41a, the thickness T of the metal
layer 31,  and the material for forming the metal layer 31              is
different between the two interfaces 33,          the state of the
surface plasmons is different between the two interfaces 33.
[0045]       For this reason, at least one of the conditions
described above is different between the plasmon structure
                                 15
3467613vl

included in the first display element              22 and the plasmon
structure included in the second display element 23.
Therefore, the state of the surface plasmons excited is
different between the first display element 22                  and the second
display element 23,      so that the color of the light
transmitted by the first display element 22                is different from
the color of the light transmitted by the second display
element 23.
[0046]         In this manner, each micro-display part 13
displays the first information by the light having a
predetermined color generated by the excitation of the
surface plasmons.      Since the micro-display part 13 included in
the display part     12 displays the first information by the
transmitted light having a predetermined color, the observer
of the display body 10       can recognize the first information by
using the difference between the light having a predetermined
color and the other part.         Therefore,      the difference       between
the part    for the first information and the other part can be
easily    recognized.    As a  result,     false    recognition     of
information by the observer is restrained.
[0047]         In comparison with a configuration in which the
first display element 22 and the second display element 23
transmit the light having the same color, the display body 10
can display more complicated information.
[Method for Observing Display Body]                   A method for
observing the display body 10 will now be described with
reference to Figs.      6 and 7.
[0048]         As illustrated in Fig.          6, the method for observing
the    display body 10    includes an      irradiation process         (step Sl)
and an observation process          (S12).     In the irradiation process,
in the display body 10,       the interface between the dielectric
layer 32 and the metal layer 31 included in the micro-display
part 13 is irradiated with the irradiation light.                   In the
observation process, the display body 10 irradiated with the
irradiation light is observed in a magnified manner.                    The
                                       16
3467613vl

observation of the display body 10 may be performed visually
by a person, or it may be performed by an apparatus capable
of detecting the transmitted light of the display body 10.
[0049]            As illustrated in Fig. 7, the above-described
display body 10 is attached to an object-to-be-authenticated
50.    At the time of observing the display body 10 attached to
the object-to-be-authenticated 50,             the display body 10 is
irradiated with light, for example, from the dielectric layer
32 toward the metal layer 31             included in in the display body
10.    Therefore, the interface 33 between the dielectric layer
32 and the metal layer 31            is irradiated with light.         In this
case, the object-to-be-authenticated 50 is a substrate or the
like that allows light to reach the display body 10 through
the object-to-be-authenticated             50.  Alternatively,       when the
display body 10 is attached to the object-to-be-authenticated
50,   the display body 10 may be attached in the state that the
display body 10 is directly irradiated with light.                    The
display body 10 may be irradiated with the light from the
metal layer 31          toward the dielectric layer 32          included in the
display body 10,            so that the interface 33 between the
dielectric layer 32 and the metal layer 31                   is irradiated with
the light.        Also in this case,       it is possible to obtain the
same advantage as that of the case in which the display body
is irradiated with light from the dielectric layer 32 toward
the metal layer 31.
[0050]            Hereinafter, a front       surface of the display body
10 is a surface on which the metal layer 31 of each display
element 21 is exposed, and a back surface of the display body
10 is a surface that is opposite to the surface on which the
metal layer 31          of each display element 21 is exposed and on
which the dielectric layer 32             is exposed.
[0051]            In the irradiation process, for example, a light
source LS emitting white light as irradiation light IL
irradiates the back surface of the display body 10 with the
irradiation light IL.             At this time, in the state that the
                                          17
3467613vl

observer OB visually observes the display body 10, the
observer OB can observe only the second information displayed
by the display part 12        in the information displayed by the
display body      10.   On the other hand,  in  the  state     that    the
observer OB observes the display body 10 through an optical
microscope LM, the observer OB can observe the first
information displayed by the micro-display part              13 as the
transmitted light TL having a color different from that of
the irradiation light IL in the information displayed by the
display body 10.
[0052]          In this manner, the display body 10 can provide
different     information to the observer OB in each of the two
steps of the magnification ratio magnifying the display body
10.    For this reason, the observer OB can determine
authenticity of the object-to-be-authenticated 50,                 for
example, by determining whether or not         the display body 10
has the micro-display part 13 or by determining whether or
not image, color information, or position information
displayed by the micro-display part 13         is correct.
[0053]          As described heretofore, according to the above
described embodiment,        it is possible to obtain the advantages
listed below.
          (1) Since the micro-display part     13 displays the first
information by the transmitted light having a predetermined
color, the observer OB of the display body 10 can recognize
the first     information by using the difference between light
having a predetermined color and the other parts.                 Therefore,
the difference between the part for the first             information and
the other parts       can be easily  recognized.    As a    result,      false
recognition of information by the observer OB is restrained.
[0054]           (2) Since the display elements 21 include the
display elements 21 transmitting the transmitted light TL
having different colors, the difference between the display
elements can be easily recognized by the observer OB of the
display body 10 in comparison with the configuration in which
                                     18
3467613vl

the display body 10 transmits only one color.
[0055]          (3) Each of the number of the display elements 21
arranged in the row direction R and the number of the display
elements 21 arranged in the column direction C is 10 or more
and 100 or less.       For this reason, the first information has a
size that almost cannot be visually recognized and has a size
which can be visually recognized through magnification of an
optical microscope.
[0056]         The above-described embodiment may be implemented
through appropriate modifications         as follows.
 [Configuration of Metal Layer]
         A modification of the metal layer 31 will now be
described with reference to Figs. 8 to 12.
[0057]         As illustrated in Fig. 8, the metal layer 31
includes a base surface metal layer 61 located on base
surface 41a and a top surface metal layer 62 located on the
top surface 42a, the thickness of the base surface metal
layer 61 is a base surface thickness Ti,          and the thickness of
the top surface metal layer 62 is a top surface thickness T2.
When the metal layer 31 is formed by the above-described
physical vapor deposition method, for example, a vacuum vapor
deposition method, particles       constituting the metal layer 31
easily reach the top surface 42a of each protrusion 42           in
comparison with the base surface 41a.          For this reason,
typically, the top surface thickness T2 is equal to or
greater than the base surface thickness T1.
[0058]         As viewed from the plane facing the base body 41,
the top surface metal layer 62 includes a flat portion           62a
located along the shape of the top surface 42a and a curved
peripheral surface portion       62b, which is provided around the
flat    portion 62a and curved to     protrude  from the  flat portion
62a toward the      outside.  That is,   the curved peripheral
surface portion      62b has a curved surface shape which

62b is preferably       (T2/2) or more and     (4  x T2) or less, more
preferably      (T2/2) or more and   (2  x  T2)   or less.
[0059]          A part between the protrusions 42        adjacent to each
other in the Y direction in the base           surface metal layer 61
is configured by a curved surface in which a substantial
center between the two protrusions 42 protrudes in the
direction away from the base       surface 41a.       A part between the
protrusions 42      adjacent to each other in the X direction in
the base     surface metal layer 61 is configured by a curved
surface in which a substantial center between the two
protrusions 42 protrudes in the direction away from the base
surface 41a.       The radius of curvature in these portions is
preferably      (T1/2) or more and   (4  x  Ti)   or less, more
preferably      (T1/2) or more and   (2  x  Ti)   or less.
[0060]          The parts not between the two protrusions 42 in
both of the X and Y directions in the base surface metal
layer 61 are configured with substantially flat             surfaces
because the flying angle of the particles            for forming the
metal layer 31 which reach the base surface 41a is not
limited.
[0061]          According to the configuration in which the each
of the base surface metal layer 61 and the top surface metal
layer 62 has a curved surface, it is possible to obtain the
advantages listed below.
          (4) The metal layer 31   can be easily formed according
to a physical vapor deposition method such as a vacuum vapor
deposition method or a sputtering method.
[0062]          As illustrated in Fig.     9, as viewed from the plane
facing the base body 41,       the flat portion 62a in the top
surface metal layer 62 formed on the top surface 42a of each
protrusion     42 may be located on     a part of the top surface      42a.
[0063]          As illustrated in Fig. 10,       each protrusion 42
include a side surface 42c connecting the top surface 42a and
the base     surface 41a, and the metal layer 31 may also be
located on the side surface 42c.          The part of the metal layer
                                    20
3467613vl

31 located on the side surface 42c is a side            surface metal
layer 63,     and the thickness of the side surface metal layer
63 is a side      surface thickness T3.       The side surface thickness
T3 is less than the base surface thickness T1 and is less
than the top surface thickness T2.
[0064]          When the metal layer 31 is formed by the above
described physical vapor deposition method, the particles for
forming the metal layer 31 have difficulty reaching the side
surface 42c of each protrusion 42           in comparison with the top
surface 42a of each protrusion 42           and the parts in which the
protrusions 42       are not formed in the base surfaces 41a of the
base body 41.       For this  reason,    according  to the physical
vapor deposition method, the metal layer 31 is easily formed
in which the side surface thickness T3 is less than each of
the base     surface thickness T1 and the top surface thickness
T2.
[0065]          As illustrated in Fig. 10,       the side surface metal
layer 63 does not necessarily need to be formed over the
entire side surface 42c of each protrusion 42,            or it may be
formed in at least a part of the side surface.             The side
surface metal layer 63 does not necessarily need to be formed
on all of the protrusions 42,         but it may be formed on some of
the plurality of protrusions 42.
[0066]          According to such a configuration, it is possible
to obtain the advantages listed below.
          (5) In comparison with the configuration in which the
metal layer 31       covers only the base surface 41a and the top
surface 42a, the state of the surface plasmons excited in the
micro-display part 13 is changed.            Therefore, the micro
display part      13 can transmit light having colors different
from that of the light transmitted in the configuration in
which the metal layer 31 covers only the base surface 41a and
the top surface 42a.
[0067]           (6) Since the side surface thickness T3 of the
metal layer 31       is less than each of the top surface thickness
                                      21
3467613vl

T2   and the base surface thickness Ti,   transmittance of the
micro-display part 13 is increased in comparison with the
configuration in which the side surface thickness T3      is equal
to or greater than each of the top surface thickness T2 and
the base   surface thickness T1.
[0068]        In Fig. 10,  if light with which the display body
10 is irradiated from the dielectric layer 32 toward the
metal layer 31    is transmitted to the outside of the micro
display part    13, the side surface thickness T3 may be equal
to or greater than each of the top surface thickness T2 and
the base   surface thickness T1.
[0069]        As illustrated in Fig. 11,   when the metal layer 31
is configured with the side surface metal layer 63,      the top
surface metal layer 62 may have the configuration illustrated
in Fig. 8,   and the base surface metal layer 61 may have the
configuration illustrated in Fig. 8.      At this time, the side
surface thickness T3 of the side     surface metal layer 63 may
be, for example, configured to become less as the distance to
the top surface 42a decreases and to become greater as the
distance to the base    surface 41a decreases.   The thickness of
the side   surface metal layer 63 may be substantially the same
over the entire side    surface metal layer 63.
[0070]        As illustrated in Fig. 12,   when the metal layer 31
is configured with the side surface metal layer 63,      the top
surface metal layer 62 may have the configuration illustrated
in Fig.   9, and the base surface metal layer 61 may have the
configuration illustrated in Fig. 9.      At this time, the side
surface thickness T3 of the side     surface metal layer 63 may
be, for example, configured to become less as the distance to
the top surface 42a decreases and to become greater as the
distance to the base    surface 41a decreases.   The thickness of
the side   surface metal layer 63 may be substantially the same
over the entire side    surface metal layer 63.

 [Configuration of Dielectric Layer]
                                  22
3467613vl

          A modification of the dielectric        layer 32 will now be
described with reference to Figs. 13 and 14.
          The protrusions 42      included in the dielectric layer 32
do not necessarily need to be arranged in a tetragonal
lattice shape.
[0072]             For example, as illustrated in Fig. 13,        the
protrusions 42 may be arranged in a hexagonal lattice shape.
As illustrated in Fig. 14,          when the protrusions     42 are
arranged in a hexagonal lattice shape, distances between one
protrusion 42 and six protrusions 42 located around the one
protrusion        42 are equal  to  each other.    That is,   all  of the
protrusions 42         are arranged in the state that the adjacent
protrusions 42         are separated from each other by a period P as
an equal interval.
[0073]             In this manner, when the protrusions 42 are
arranged in a hexagonal lattice shape, since all the
protrusions         42 are arranged to be spaced at an equal interval,
the states of the surface plasmons formed in the interfaces
33 between the metal layers 31 and the dielectric layers 32
are substantially         the same.   For this  reason,   in  comparison
with the configuration in which the protrusions              42 are
arranged in a tetragonal lattice           shape, adjustment of color
of the transmitted light of each display element 21 can be
easily performed.
[0074]             The protrusions 42   included in the dielectric
layer 32 are not limited to the tetragonal lattice shape or
the hexagonal lattice shape, the protrusions may be arranged
in a trigonal lattice shape.
[Configuration of Micro-Display part]               A modification of the
micro-display part 13 will now be described with reference to
Fig. 15.
[0075]             The first display elements 22     included in the
micro-display part 13 may include two or more plasmon
structures having different colors in transmitted light, and
the second display element 23 may include two or more plasmon
                                       23
3467613vl

structures having different colors in transmitted light.
[0076]       That is,  as illustrated in Fig. 15,        the first
display element 22   includes two first portions 71 and two
second portions 72,   and each first portion 71 and each second
portion 72  are configured with plasmon structures
transmitting light having different colors.           In the first
display elements 22,   the first portions 71        and the second
portions 72 are,   for example, arranged alternately in the
column direction C and arranged alternately in the row
direction R.
[0077]      According to the first display elements 22,           the
light transmitted by the first display element 22 has a mixed
color of the color of the light transmitted by each of the
first portions 71 and the color of the light transmitted by
each of the second portions    72.   For this     reason,   it is
possible to increase the number of colors which can be
displayed by the micro-display part 13.
[0078]       In the first display elements        22,  the first
portions 71 and the second portions 72        do not necessarily
need to be arranged alternately in the column direction C or
the row direction R,   and the number of first portions 71
included in the first display element       22 may be different
from the number of the    second portions     72.    However,  in the
first display elements 22,    if the first portions        71 and the
second portions 72   are configured to be arranged alternately
in each of the column direction C and the row direction R and
the number of first portions 71 included in the first display
element 22  is configured to be equal to the number of second
portions 72,   deviation in color of the first display elements
22 can be eliminated.    For this reason, the first display
elements 22  can be easily recognized as the display element
21 displaying one color.
[0079]       On the other hand, the second display element 23
includes a plurality of first portions 73 and a plurality of
second portions 74,   and the first portions 73 and the second
                                  24
3467613vl

portions 74 transmit light having different colors.                The first
portion 73       included in the second display element 23 may
include a plasmon structure transmitting the light having the
same color as that of any one of the first portion 71 or the
second portion 72          included in the first display element 22.
The second portion 74          included in the second display element
23 may include a plasmon structure transmitting the light
having the same color as that of any one of the first portion
71 and the second portion 72           included in the first display
element 22.
[0080]            Similarly to the first display elements 22,            in the
second display elements 23,           the first portions 73 and the
second portions 74          are, for example, arranged alternately in
the column direction C and arranged alternately in the row
direction      R.   In  the second display      elements  23,  the first
portions 73 and the second portions 74              do not necessarily
need to be arranged alternately in the column direction C or
the row direction R.
[0081]            In the configuration in which each of the first
display elements 22          and each of the second display elements
23 transmit light having a mixed color, instead of the
configuration in which the first display elements 22                include
the first portions 71 or the second portions               72 as a set of
the plasmon structures, it is preferable that the plasmon
structures transmitting light having different colors be
located in a mixed manner inside the first display elements
22.      Such a configuration is also preferred in the second
display element        23.    Therefore,    deviation  in color displayed
by each display element can be further restrained.
[0082]            According to such a configuration, it is possible
to obtain the advantages listed below.
           (7) Since each display element 21 includes a plurality
of plasmon structures having transmitted light having
different      colors, one display element         21 can transmit light
having a mixed color of multiple             colors.   Therefore,  it    is
                                         25
3467613vl

possible to increase the number of colors which can be
displayed by the micro-display part 13.
[0083]
 [Other Modifications]
          The size of the display part   12 does not necessarily
need to be such a size that the display size of the second
information displayed by the display part 12 can be visually
recognized.       If the display part 12 has  a size capable of
including at least one micro-display part 13,        the display
part 12 may have a size to an extent that the display part 12
can be observed by an optical microscope.
[0084]           The display element 21 may have a configuration of
transmitting white light.        In such a configuration, in the
display element 21,       for example, by configuring the periods P
of a plurality of protrusions 42 to be irregular or
configuring the heights of the protrusions        42 to be irregular,
the states of the surface plasmons formed in minimum units of
the plasmon structures become different from each other,         so
that the display element 21 transmits white light.         In the
configuration in which the periods P of the protrusions 42
are irregular, that is,       in the configuration in which the
protrusions 42       are arranged irregularly, the surface plasmons
having different states can be easily excited inside the
display element 21.        For this reason, the light transmitted by
the display element 21 becomes mixed light of a plurality of
light beams having different wavelengths.
[0085]           The light irradiated in the irradiation process
does not necessarily need to be white light.        Even in  such a
configuration, if the irradiation light includes light of
which the color can be changed by the plasmon structure
included in the micro-display part 13,       it is possible to
obtain the advantage in accordance with the above-described
advantage      (1).
[0086]           In the display elements 21 constituting one micro
display part       13, the number of display elements 21 arranged
                                    26
3467613vl

in the row direction R and the number of display elements       21
arranged in the column direction C may be less than 10 or may
be more than 100.      Even in such a configuration, the size of
one micro-display part 13 may be such a size that the micro
display part     13 is included in the display part  12 as a part
of the display part 12.      As long as the micro-display part 13
includes the plasmon structure, it is possible to obtain the
advantage in accordance with the above-described advantage
 (1).
[0087]         The length Li of one  side of the display element
21 may be less than 200 nm or may be greater than 3000 nm.
Even in such a configuration, the size of the micro-display
part 13 may be a size that the micro-display part 13      is
included in the display part     12 as a part of the display part
12.
[0088]        All of the display elements 21 constituting the
micro-display part 13 may transmit light having the same
color.    Even in such a configuration, as long as each display
element 21 includes the plasmon structure, it is possible to
obtain the advantage in accordance with the above-described
advantage    (1).
[0089]         In the base surface 41a of the base body 41,   the
period P of the formation of the protrusions      42 may be less
than 100 nm or may be greater than      600 nm as long as surface
plasmons are excited in the interface 33 between the metal
layer 31 and the dielectric layer 32 to change the
irradiation light to transmitted light having a color
different    from that of the irradiation light.
[0090]         In the material for forming the metal layer 31,
the real part of the complex dielectric constant in a visible
light range may be 0 or more.      Even in such a configuration,
if the micro-display part 13     includes the plasmon structure
including the interface 33 between the metal layer 31 and the
dielectric layer 32,     the plasmon structure can be embodied as
a structure transmitting light having any one of wavelengths
                                  27
3467613vl

included in the visible light range.
[0091]          The thickness of the metal layer 31 may be less
than 20 nm or may be greater than 100 nm.        Even in such a
configuration, if the micro-display part       13 includes the
plasmon structure including the interface 33 between the
metal layer 31      and the dielectric layer 32,  the irradiation
light can be changed to the transmitted light having a color
different     from that of the irradiation light by the surface
plasmons excited in the plasmon structure.
[0092]          In the dielectric layer 32,  the distance between
the base     surface 41a and the imaginary plane    42b may be less
than 30 nm or may be greater than 500 nm.        Even in such a
configuration, if the micro-display part       13 includes the
plasmon structure including the interface 33 between the
metal layer 31      and the dielectric layer 32,  the irradiation
light can be changed to the transmitted light having a color
different     from that of the irradiation light by the surface
plasmons excited by the plasmon structure.
[0093]          In the dielectric layer 32,  the base   surface 41a
of the base body 41 and the imaginary plane 42b including the
top surface 42a of each of the protrusions 42 do not
necessarily need to be substantially parallel to each other,
but for example, the base surface 41a and the imaginary plane
42b may be crossed at a predetermined angle.         Even in such a
configuration, if the micro-display part       13 includes the
plasmon structure including the interface 33 between the
metal layer 31      and the dielectric layer 32,  the irradiation
light can be changed to the transmitted light having a color
different     from that of the irradiation light by the surface
plasmons excited by the plasmon structure.
[0094]
 [Print Layer]
          The display body 10 may include a print layer as
described hereinafter with reference to Figs.        16 to 19.
[0095]          As illustrated in Fig. 16, the display body 10
                                   28
3467613vl

includes a print layer 81,             and the print layer 81 is
configured with a plurality of print portions 82 having a
wavy line shape.            The print portions 82       are arranged on the
substrate 11 to be spaced at a predetermined interval                    in one
direction.
[0096]             As viewed from the direction facing the display
part 12,      a part of the print portions 82 does not overlap
with the display part 12,             and another part of the print
portions 82 overlaps with the display part 12.                   As viewed from
the direction facing the display part 12,                  at least a part of
the print portions 82 overlapping with the display part 12
overlaps with at least one of the micro-display parts 13.
Furthermore, as viewed from the direction facing the display
part 12,      each print portion 82 may be arranged at a position
which overlaps with the display part                 12 and does not overlap
with the micro-display part 13.
[0097]             The print    layer 81     forms an example of a colored
figure pattern as a pattern formed with a plurality of wavy
line    shapes.        However,   the print    layer   81 may form a   colored
figure pattern formed with a plurality of circular arc shapes
or a colored figure pattern formed with a plurality of
circular shapes.            The print layer 81 may form a colored figure
pattern formed by combining two or more of the shapes of the
wavy line shape, the circular arc shape, and the circular
shape.      Alternatively,        the print    layer   81 may form a pattern
formed with geometric shapes other than the wavy line                    shape,
the circular          arc  shape,   and the circular      shape.   That is,  the
image as information displayed by the print layer 81 may be a
predetermined design pattern.
[0098]             As illustrated in Fig. 17,          a print layer 91
included in the display body 10 does not necessarily need to
be in the form of the above-described predetermined design
pattern, but it may form individual information                   such as a
card number and a lot number as information including at
least     one of characters         and numerals.      That  is, the  image as
                                            29
3467613vl

information displayed by the print layer 91 may include at
least one of predetermined characters and numerals.
[0099]        The print     layer 91 is configured with a plurality
of print portions 92,       and the print portions             92 are arranged
in the substrate 11 in a predetermined direction.                    Each print
portion 92 displays,       for example, one numeral, and the print
portions 92 display a numeral "1",            a numeral "2",        and a
numeral "3"    in the order from the print portion                92 located in
the shortest distance from the one end of the substrate 11.
[0100]        As viewed from the direction facing the display
part 12,   a part of each print portion 92 overlaps with the
display part    12.    As viewed from the direction facing the
display part    12,  at least a part of the print portion 92
overlapping with the display part 12 overlaps with at least
one of the micro-display        parts    13.   Furthermore,        as viewed
from the direction facing the display part 12,                   each print
portion 92 may be arranged at a position which overlaps with
the display part      12 and does not overlap with the micro
display part    13.
[0101]        The image as information displayed by the print
layers 81 and 91 is not limited to the aforementioned design
patterns, characters, and numerals, but the image may be
figures or symbols or may be a combination of at least two of
design patterns, characters, numerals, figures, and symbols.
[0102]        Next, a cross-sectional structure of the display
body 10 will now be described with reference to Figs.                    18 and
19.    Although the display body 10 described with reference to
Fig. 16 and the display body 10 described with reference to
Fig. 17 are different from each other in terms of the image
displayed by the print layer, the part where the print layer
is arranged in the display body 10 is common to the two
display bodies    10.    For this     reason,   hereinafter,        the cross
sectional structure of the display body 10                   described with
reference to Fig. 16 is described, and the description of the
cross-sectional structure of the display body 10 described
                                        30

with reference to Fig. 17            is omitted.
[0103]           An example in which the display part                    12 is formed
by a metal layer formed on the substrate 11 will now be
described.
          As illustrated in Fig. 18,          the substrate 11 includes
the    dielectric layer 32         included in the micro-display part                     13,
and among the surfaces of the substrate 11,                     a surface
including the base surface 41a of the dielectric layer 32                              is
a front surface 11a and a surface which is opposite to the
front surface 11a in the substrate 11                    is a back surface lb.
[0104]           The display part       12 formed with the metal layer
may be arranged on the front             surface 11a of the substrate 11,
and the display part         12 may be formed with a metal layer
common to the metal layer 31             included in the micro-display
part 13 or may be formed with a metal layer different from
the metal layer 31       included in the micro-display part 13.
[0105]           The print portions 82          constituting the print layer
81 are formed on the back surface lb of the substrate 11.
The print portions 82 are portions formed, for example, by
ink or the like containing predetermined dye or pigment and
portions formed by using various printing methods, for
example,     a  gravure  printing      method,       an offset       printing     method,
a screen printing method, and the like.
[0106]           The print    layer 81 may be formed in portions other
than the back surface          lb of the       substrate       11.     That   is,   as
illustrated in Fig. 19,           a transparent plastic layer 101
covering the display part 12 and the micro-display part 13                              is
formed on the front surface 11a of the substrate                          11.   The
transparent plastic layer 101 is a layer formed by a plastic
capable of transmitting light.               In the transparent plastic
layer 101,      a surface which is opposite to the surface being
in contact with the front            surface 11a of the substrate 11                   is
a front surface 101a, and the print portions                       82 are formed on
the front      surface 101a.
[0107]           The transparent plastic layer 101 may be a layer
                                          31
3467613vl

having adhesiveness for attaching the display body 10 to a
product such as an object-to-be-authenticated, and the layer
having adhesiveness may be formed on the front surface 101a
of the transparent plastic layer 101 or the back surface lb
of the substrate 11 separately from the transparent plastic
layer 101.
[0108]          In the configuration in which the display body 10
includes the transparent plastic layer 101,        the print layers
81 may be formed on both of the front        surface 101a of the
transparent plastic layer 101 and the back surface lb of the
substrate 11.
          In the configuration in which the display body 10
includes the above-described print layer 81 and the print
layer 81 is arranged on the back surface lb of the substrate
11, when the display body 10       is visually recognized from the
side of the back surface lb of the substrate 11,         a part of
the display part      12, that is, a part of the second
information displayed by the display part 12 can be concealed
from the observer by the print layer 81.
[0109]          In the display body 10,   in the configuration in
which the print layer 81 is arranged on the front        surface
101a of the transparent plastic layer 101, when the display
body 10 is visually recognized from the side of the front
surface 101a of the transparent plastic layer 101,        a part of
the display part      12, that is, a part of the second
information displayed by the display part 12 can be concealed
from the observer by the print layer 81.
[0110]          Therefore, when the observer faces the display
body 10, that is, as viewed from the direction normal to the
display part      12, the information displayed by the print layer
81 is visually recognized.       On the other hand, when the
observer observes the display body 10        in a slanted direction,
as viewed from the direction facing the display part 12,         a
part of the display part 12 overlapping with the print layer
81 is visually recognized.
                                    32
3467613vl

[0111]       In this manner, according to the display body 10
including the print layer 81,      by changing the angle at which
the observer observes the display body 10,      the information
displayed by the print layer 81 and the part of the second
information concealed by the print layer 81 can be
individually observed.      Since the print layer 81   is a layer
formed by ink as described above and the display part 12 is a
layer formed with the metal layer, the print layer 81 has
optical effects different from those of the display part        12,
so that the second information can be easily recognized.
[0112]      As described above, as viewed from the direction
facing the display part 12,      the print layer 81  and the
display part   12 may be configured to be located to be
separated from each other, that is,      the print  layer 81 may be
configured not   to conceal the display part 12 and the second
information displayed by the display part 12.
[0113]      According to such a configuration, by a
combination of the print layer 81      and the display part 12,
characters, symbols,     figures, design patterns or the like
having optical effects different from the optical effects
obtained by only the print layer 81 or only the display part
12 can be formed.
[0114]      By changing the angle at which the observer
observes the display body 10,      the information displayed by
the print layer 81   and the second information displayed by
the display part   12 can be individually observed.      Since the
print layer 81   has optical effects different from those of
the display part   12,  the second information can be easily
recognized.
[0115]      Furthermore, as viewed from the direction facing
the display part   12,  the print layer 81 conceals at least one
of the micro-display parts 13,      that is, at least one piece of
first information.     According to such a configuration, the
region where the first information is displayed can be
restricted by the print layer 81,      so that the position where
                                   33
3467613vl

the first    information is arranged can be inconspicuous.
[0116]        As described above, as viewed from the direction
facing the display part 12,     the print  layer 81  and the
display part     12 can be configured to be located to be
separated from each other, that is,      the print  layer 81 can be
configured not     to conceal the first information displayed by
the micro-display part 13.
[0117]        According to such a configuration, when the
observer of the display body 10 observes the second
information, the observer focuses attention on the second
information and the information displayed by the print layer
81.    It is thus difficult to notice that information other
than the second information and the information displayed by
the print    layer 81  can be displayed by the display body 10.
Therefore, in the display body 10,      it is possible to make it
more difficult to notice the first information.
[0118]         When the first information is observed, in the
display body 10,     since the light amount of the transmitted
light in the part other than the micro-display parts       13 can
be reduced by the print layer 81,      the contrast between the
first information and the periphery of the first information
is increased, so that the first information can be more
easily recognized.      This advantage can be obtained from any
one of the configuration in which the print layer 81       is
formed on the back surface lb of the substrate 11 and the
configuration in which the print      layer 81 is formed on the
front surface 101a of the transparent plastic layer 101.        This
advantage can be obtained from both the case in which the
display body 10 is visually recognized from the side of the
front surface 11a of the substrate 11 and the case in which
the display body 10 is visually recognized from the back
surface lb.
[0119]         The same advantages as those obtained by the print
layer 81 can also be obtained by the display body 10
including a print     layer 91 illustrated in Fig. 19.
                                  34

          As illustrated in Fig. 20,   in the configuration in
which the display body 10      includes the print layer 81
displaying a pattern configured with geometric shapes such as
the above-described colored figure pattern, an object-to-be
authenticated 50 attached with the display body 10 may have a
print layer 51.      The print layer 51 is configured to include a
plurality of print portions 52,       and as viewed from the
direction facing the display part 12,       each of the print
portions 52 is connected to one of the print portions 82
formed in the display body 10.        That is, the print layer 81
included in the display body 10 and the print        layer 51
included in the object-to-be-authenticated 50 display one
colored figure pattern.
