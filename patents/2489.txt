        MEDICAMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM AND METHOD
[0001]    This    application claims     the  benefit   of  U.S.  Provisional
Application No. 61/732,753 filed on December 3, 2012, as well as the U.S.
Non-Provisional Application No. 13/907,028 filed on May 31, 2013, the
entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
                              TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]    Various    exemplary     embodiments     disclosed   herein    relate
 generally to administration of medicaments.
                                 BACKGROUND
[0003]    Some people suffer from medical conditions such as severe
allergies that may result in anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis may be treated by
administration of epinephrine. Patients may be prescribed an auto-injector
of epinephrine to treat sudden anaphylaxis.
[0004]    Anaphylaxis, however, often leads to an emergency situation
wherein epinephrine or other medication should be administered as soon
as possible to prevent loss of life or other complications. Proper use of the
auto-injector to treat anaphylaxis is therefore important. Patients with
 medical conditions that may result in anaphylaxis are often inexperienced
at providing medical treatment. Use of an auto-injector may also be
intimidating    for some patients.     Moreover,   an emergency      situation
requiring treatment may arise at unexpected times or after a significant
time from receiving the auto-injector and instructions for use from a

                                     -2
 doctor or pharmacist. Additionally, due to the unpredictable use of the
 auto-injector, the medicament may expire before the auto-injector is used.
An expired medicament may not effectively treat anaphylaxis in an
emergency situation.
                                   SUMMARY

[0056]    FIG. 3 illustrates a flowchart showing an exemplary method 300
performed by a mobile device 220. Mobile device 220 may include an
application configured to cause the processor and other components of
 mobile device 220 to perform the steps of the method 300. The method 300
 may begin at step 305 and proceed to step 310.
[0057]    In step 310, the mobile device 220 may read medicament
information from the medicament device 100. In various embodiments, the
mobile device 220 may use a camera to take a picture of medicament
 device 100 or the packaging thereof. For example, a user may take a
photograph of the expiration date, lot number, and serialization number,
or take a photograph of a QR code. The mobile device 220 may analyze the
 photograph to determine medicament information. The mobile device 220
 may also forward the photograph to an application server 250 for analysis.

                                    -20
In various embodiments, the mobile device 220 may read the medicament
information from the memory 130.
[0058]     In step 315, the mobile device 220 may determine whether a user
wishes to register the medicament device 100. The mobile device 220 may
present a user interface providing an explanation of the benefits of
registration an option to register. The user interface may also provide the
ability for the user to enter contact information or to manually enter
medicament information. If the user chooses to register the medicament
 device 100, the method 300 may proceed to step 320. If the user chooses
not to register the medicament device 100, the method 300 may proceed to
 step 350.
[0059]     In step 320, the mobile device 220 may send medicament
information to the server. The mobile device 220 may send medicament
information read from the medicament device 100, packaging, and/or
memory 130. The mobile device 220 may also send user information
entered by the user. In various embodiments, the user may update an
existing registration with a new medicament device 100. Accordingly, the
 server 150 may already have user information and only a user identifier
may be sent with the medicament information. In various embodiments,
the mobile device 220 may send the medicament information to medical
 server 240 in addition to application server        250. For example, a
 government      health   agency   may   collect medicament    information.

                                     - 21
Application server 250 may also forward the medicament information to
medical server 240.
[0060]      In step 325, the mobile device 220 may determine whether the
user wishes to register for a location tracking service. As will be described
in further detail below, the location tracking service may monitor the
location of the medicament device 100 and help a user find the device 100
if it is lost or activated. The mobile device 220 may prompt a user to enter
additional information useful for tracking the location of the medicament
 device 100 such as a phone number of an additional mobile device 220 that
may be used to track the medicament device 100. The additional mobile
 device 220 may be, for example, a mobile device usually carried by a child
who has been prescribed the medicament device 100. If the user enables
location tracking, the method 300 may proceed to step 330. If the user opts
out of location tracking, the method 300 may proceed to step 340.
[0061]      In step 330, the mobile device 220 may check for the presence of
the medicament device. In various embodiments, the mobile device 220
may use a short-range wireless communication protocol such as Bluetooth
to poll the medicament device. If the medicament device 100 is present,
the mobile device 220 may establish a connection with the medicament
 device 100 and receive additional information.
[0062]      In step 335, the mobile device 220 may report the location of the
medicament device 100 to the server 150. If the mobile device 220 detected

                                   - 22
the presence of the medicament device 100 in step 330, the mobile device
may report the location of the mobile device 220 as the location of the
medicament device 100. If the medicament device 100 is not detected, the
mobile device 220 may report a missing medicament device having no
known location or report the last known location of the medicament device
 100.
[0063]    In step 340, the mobile device 220 may determine whether a user
wishes to receive reminders regarding the medicament device 220. The
mobile device 220 may present a user interface displaying information
regarding available reminders. The user of the mobile device may select
those reminders he or she would like to receive. Exemplary reminders
regarding a medicament device may include a reminder to replace an
expired medicament device, a reminder to review instructions, a reminder
to obtain a new prescription, a reminder to perform a medical test, and a
reminder to take a periodic dose from the medicament device. The mobile
 device 220 may send the selected reminders to server 150, which may
monitor for events related to the reminders. In step 345, the mobile device
220 may receive a reminder from the server 150 based on medicament
information. In various embodiments, the reminder may be received via
 simple messaging service (SMS), email, or an application based messaging
 system.

                                    -23
[0064]    In step 350, the mobile device 220 may determine whether the
user wishes to receive instructions. The user may indicate a desire to
receive instructions by selecting a button within the application. In
various embodiments, the mobile device 220 may automatically request
instructions based on the user scanning a QR code or taking a picture of
the medicament device. If the user desires to receive instructions, the
method 300 may proceed to step 355. If the user does not desire to receive
instructions, the method 300 may proceed to step 360. In step 355, the
mobile device 220 may request the instructions from the server 250. The
request may include information identifying the medicament device 100.
In various embodiments, the request may include only a name or identifier
of the medicament device 100 and not particular information such as a lot
 number, product serialization number, or expiration date. In step 355, the
mobile   device 220 may receive instructions from           server 250. The
instructions may be in the form of a video streamed from the application
 server  240.  The   instructions   may   also include     audio  or written
instructions.
[0065]    In step 360, the mobile device 220 may determine whether the
user wishes to receive news regarding the medicament device 100. The
user may indicate a desire to receive news by selecting a button within the
application. If the user desires to receive news, the method 300 may
proceed to step 365. If the user does not desire to receive news, the method

                                   -24
300 may proceed to step 370. In step 365, the mobile device 220 may
receive news updates from the server 250. The news updates may be
pushed to the mobile device 220 based on the identified medicament
 device.
[00661    In step 370, the mobile device 220 may determine whether the
user desires to track a medicament device 100. The tracking service may
 require registration of the medicament device with server 250. The user
may indicate a desire to track a medicament device by selecting a button
within the application. In various embodiments, tracking a medicament
 device 100 may be initiated by an application server 250 in response to an
event concerning the device. For example, use of a registered medicament
 device 100 may be reported to the application server 250 by a patient's
mobile device. The application server 250 may then push a notification to
another user device 220, such as a device of a parent or other emergency
contact, and provide tracking information. If the user desires to track a
medicament device 100, the method 300 may proceed to step 375. If the
user does not desire to track a medicament device, the method 300 may
proceed to step 390, where the method 300 ends.
[0067]    In step 375, the mobile device 220 may retrieve information
regarding    registered   medicament    devices   100    including  location
information. The mobile device 220 may require the user to enter a
password    or perform    other security operations   to   ensure  only the

                                     -25
registered user has access to the medicament device information. The
mobile device 220 may present a list of medicament devices 100 registered
to  the   user   or   may   request   information   regarding all  registered
medicament devices. The application server 250 may receive the request
and    extract  medicament     device   information   from  a database.   The
application server 250 may also attempt to update the medicament device
locations by polling other mobile devices         associated with registered
medicament devices for current medicament device information.
[0068]    The mobile device 220 may receive the medicament information
from the server 250. The medicament information may include a location,
which may be, for example, longitude and latitude coordinates or a street
address. The medicament information may also include information such
as the current temperature of the medicament device, the time of the last
use of the medicament device, and a number of doses remaining in the
medicament device. In step 380, the mobile device 220 may present the
medicament device information to the user as a map. The map may
indicate the current location of the medicament device 100 as well as the
current location of the mobile device 220.
[0069]     FIG. 4 illustrates a flowchart showing an exemplary method 400
of monitoring a medicament. The method 400 may be performed by a
mobile device 220 in communication with an electronic medicament device

                                   -26
 100. The method 400 may be performed as step 330 of method 300
 illustrated in FIG. 3.
[0070]     The method 400 may begin at step 405 and proceed to step 410.
In step 410, the mobile device 220 may determine its location. In various
embodiments,      mobile device 220 may use the location to determine
whether to proceed with the method. For example, the mobile device 220
may discontinue the method if the mobile device is in a designated
location, or the mobile device may delay the method until a change in
location is detected.
[0071]      In step 415, the mobile device 220 may detect any electronic
medicament devices nearby. Mobile device 220 may use RFID, NFC,
 Bluetooth or another close range protocol to poll nearby tags 120 on a
medicament device. Mobile device 220 may be configured to poll one or
more specific electronic medicament devices with identifiers known by
mobile device 220. In step 420, mobile device 220 may determine whether
an electronic medicament device 100 is present. If no medicament device is
present, the method may proceed to step 425. If a medicament device is
 detected, the method may proceed to step 430.
[0072]     In step 425, the mobile device 220 may generate an alarm. The
alarm may indicate any particular medicament device that was not
 detected. The alarm may include a message identifying the medicament
 device by name or by a condition that it treats. If the mobile device

                                    -27
performs method 400 frequently, it may be likely that the medicament
 device is nearby, although out of range of the short range wireless
protocol. Accordingly, a user may be reminded to retrieve the medicament
 device. The mobile device 220 may also generate a message to another
 mobile device. For example, the mobile device 220 may send an SMS
message or email to a parent, guardian, or other emergency contact
indicating that the medicament device 100 has been separated from the
 mobile device 220. The method 400 may then proceed to step 460, where
the method ends.
[0073]    In step 430, the mobile device 220 may receive data from the
medicament device. Mobile device 220 may send a read command to read
 data from memory 130. In various embodiments, mobile device 220 may
receive data from the electronic medicament device 100 when sensor 110
 determines that the device 100 has been activated. In step 435, mobile
 device 220 may determine whether the medicament device 100 has been
used. Mobile device 220 may determine the status of sensor 110 or parse
 data received in step 430. If the medicament device has been used, the
 method may proceed to step 440. If the medicament device has not been
used, the method may proceed to step 450.
[0074]    In step 440, mobile device 220 may document the current location
of the mobile device. The location of the mobile device may be used to
identify the location of device usage. In step 445, the mobile device may

                                    -28
notify emergency contacts. Mobile device 220 may contact emergency
 services, for example, by dialing 911. The mobile device 220 may turn on a
 speaker phone to allow a user, who may be suffering from anaphylaxis or
another medical condition to speak to an emergency dispatcher. If mobile
 device 220 does not receive any voice input, mobile device 220 may play a
recorded message indicating that the electronic medicament device has
been activated at the stored location. Mobile device 220 may also contact
other people. For example, mobile device 220 may call, email, or message
emergency contacts stored in mobile device 220 or memory 130.
[0075]     In step 450, mobile device 220 may determine whether the
electronic medicament device 100 is expired. Mobile device 220 may
compare an expiration date received from the electronic medicament
 device 100 to the current date. In various embodiments, the mobile device
220 may also have the ability to read the quality of the medicament. For
example, mobile device 220 may read information from a sensor 110 in
medicament      device  100.   The sensor   110 may determine     that the
medicament has expired early if, for example, the medicament device 100
was stored at an inappropriate temperature or has changed properties
 such as colors. In various embodiments, the mobile device 220 may be able
to determine the quality of the product. For example, the camera of the
mobile device may act as a spectrophotometer to measure the color of the
medicament. Alternatively, the mobile device 220 may transmit a picture

                                    -29
of the medicament device to application server 250 for spectrophotometric
 analysis. The medicament device 100 may include a transparent window
and colored markings to assist with the spectrophotometric analysis. The
 mobile device 220 may determine that the medicament has expired early if
the medicament exhibits a certain property. If the medicament device is
expired, the method may proceed to step 455. If the medicament device is
 not expired, the method may proceed to step 450.
[0076]     In step 455, the mobile device 455 may initiate an order for a
refill or replacement electronic medicament device. Mobile device 220 may
 send an order to control center 250 and/or medical server 240. The method
may then proceed to step 460.
[0077]     In step 460, the mobile device 220 may update an application
 server 250 with information regarding the medicament device 220. The
application server 250 may use the updated information to provide up to
 date information to other users associated with a registered medicament
 device. For example, the updated information may be used to provide the
tracking service described above. The updated information may also be
used by the application server 250 to generate notifications regarding local
conditions such as allergy and asthma alerts. The application server 250
may provide such alerts as news to users who have registered medicament
 devices for treating the same condition. The method may proceed to step
 470, where the method may end.

                                    -30
[0078]    According to the foregoing,     various exemplary embodiments
provide for systems      and  methods for     distributing  medicaments.    In
