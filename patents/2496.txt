                                    INTERNAL DOOR SYSTEM
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]       The present invention relates to doors, and in particular, to internal residential doors.
BACKGROUND ART
[0002]       During construction or renovation of a residential building, internal door frames are
generally made on site. This is generally a time consuming process, and requires a wide range of
tools and consumables, such as a saw, drill/driver, chisel, tape measure, block plane, glue, nails,
screws, hinges, timber and paint.
[0003]       Furthermore, the process of making an internal door frame on site is complex, and
generally requires a skilled carpenter. This is in turn costly and inconvenient. Further again, as
the door frames are built in a sub-optimal environment (i.e. in a construction zone), typically
with other workers, the quality is often not ideal.
[0004]      As such, there is clearly a need for an improved internal door system.
[0005]       It will be clearly understood that, if a prior art publication is referred to herein, this
reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms part of the common general
knowledge in the art in Australia or in any other country.

[0033]        Preferred features, embodiments and variations of the invention may be discerned
from the following Detailed Description which provides sufficient information for those skilled
in the art to perform the invention. The Detailed Description is not to be regarded as limiting the
scope of the preceding Summary of the Invention in any way.
DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0034]        Figure 1 illustrates a front perspective view of an internal door system 100,
according to an embodiment of the present invention. The internal door system 100 is
configured to be transported in an assembled configuration, which simplifies installation on site.
[0035]        The internal door system 100 includes an internal door 105 that is pre-hung in a door
frame 110. The frame 110 comprises rebated side jambs 115, and a rebated top jamb 120 that
extends between the side jambs 115.
[0036]        Figure 2 illustrates an exploded view of the internal door system 100, according to an
embodiment of the present invention. The top jamb 120 attached to the rebated side jambs 115
by a plurality of screws 125, and glue (not illustrated). The door 105 is attached to the frame
110, and in particular one of the rebated side jambs 115 by a plurality of hinges 130, that allow
the door 105 to open and close relative to the frame 110. The hinges 130 are rebated into the
side jamb 115.
[0037]        The internal door system 100 further includes a temporary brace 135, which extends
between lower ends of the rebated side jambs 115. The temporary brace 135 is attached to the
rebated side jambs 115 by tacks 140, and is configured to provide support to the door frame
during transport. The temporary brace 135 is to be removed prior to installation.
[0038]        The door 105 includes a bore 145 configured to receive a handle and latch. The door
105 may, for example, be 60mm back set, and thus be configured to receive a standard 60mm
back set latch.
[0039]        In use, the door system 100 is constructed off-site, e.g. in a factory, and transported
on site for installation (i.e. to a residential building). Figure 3 illustrates an aperture 305 in a

building configured to receive the door system 100, and Figure 4 illustrates the door system 100
installed in the aperture 305. Figure 5 illustrates an enlarged portion of area A of Figure 4.
[0040]        In preparation for the door system 100, the aperture 305 is generated in an internal
wall 310 of the building. The aperture 305 is substantially rectangular in shape and is slightly
larger than an outer area of the door system 100. The aperture 305 extends upwardly from a
floor of the building 315, as is well known in the art.
[0041]        The door system 100 is placed in the aperture 305, and aligned (or squared up) using
a spirit level and one or more shims 405 between the door frame 110 and an inner edge of the
aperture 305. Nails 505 are then driven from an inside of the door frame 110, through the shims
405, and into studs 510 of the wall 310 that surround the aperture 305, to thereby attach the door
system 100 to the wall 310 in the aperture 305.
[0042]        During this process, the door system 100 may be periodically checked and adjusted
to compensate for movement as the nails 505 are driven in. Furthermore, after the door system
100 is installed, trim (architrave) may be installed around the door system to provide a neat
finish.
[0043]        The door jambs 115 and top jamb 120 may be of any suitable size, and configured to
receive any sized door.
[0044]        Figure 6 illustrates a cross sectional view of a side jamb 115 of the door system 100.
The side jamb 115 includes a rebate that is 40mm, and is overall 92mm deep. The total
thickness of the side jamb 115 is 30mm, and the rebated portion is 18mm thick. The side jamb
115 is particularly configured to receive a door that is about 35mm deep.
[0045]        Figure 7 illustrates a cross sectional view of a side jamb 700 of a door system,
according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. The side jamb 700 is similar to
the side jamb 115, and includes a rebate that is 40mm deep, but is overall 112mm deep. Similar
to the side jamb 115, the total thickness of the side jamb 700 is 30mm, the rebated portion is
18mm thick, and the side jamb 115 is particularly configured to receive a door that is about
35mm deep.
[0046]        Figure 8 illustrates a perspective view of an inside corner of a door frame 800 of a
door system, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The door frame 800 is
similar to the door frame 110, and includes side jambs 115 and a top jamb 200. The side jamb
115 is, however, cut, such that the rebated portion thereof extends along an end thereof, enabling

the top jamb 200 to sit flush against the rebate. Such configuration provides an aesthetically
pleasing corner.
[0047]       The frame and door may be pre-painted, which greatly simplifies installation thereof.
As in illustrative example, the frame and/or door may be pre-painted with a primer or undercoat,
such that the door and frame simply need to be painted in a final coat once installed.
[0048]       The door systems described above may save time and money on installation.
Furthermore, the end product may be of a better finish and quality, as it may be made in a
controlled environment, such as a workshop or factory, rather than on site. In some
circumstances, the door systems may be installed in about 5 minutes, which is significantly faster
than manufacturing the doors on site.
[0049]       In the present specification and claims (if any), the word 'comprising' and its
derivatives including 'comprises' and 'comprise' include each of the stated integers but does not
exclude the inclusion of one or more further integers.
[0050]       Reference throughout this specification to 'one embodiment' or 'an embodiment'
means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the
embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the
appearance of the phrases 'in one embodiment' or 'in an embodiment' in various places
throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.
Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any
suitable manner in one or more combinations.
[0051]       In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or
less specific to structural or methodical features. It is to be understood that the invention is not
limited to specific features shown or described since the means herein described comprises
preferred forms of putting the invention into effect. The invention is, therefore, claimed in any
of its forms or modifications within the proper scope of the appended claims (if any)
appropriately interpreted by those skilled in the art.
