   Abstract
   The present disclosure provides a reference     standard for
   use in validating measurements of at least one of a
 5 percentage moisture value or LOI value of an ore. The
   reference standard comprises a sample of ore, a container
   within which the sample of ore is stored. The container is
   formed from a material that is substantially impervious to
   water vapour and sealing the sample of the ore
10 substantially hermetically. At least one value of percent
   moisture and/or LOI are associated with the sample of ore
   stored within the container.

   FIELD OF INVENTION
 5 This invention is in the field of assaying and chemical
   analysis of ore samples, and more particularly, the
   production of reference       standards for use in assaying and
   chemical analysis of ore       samples.
10 BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
   The mining and production of ore typically requires
   continuous   sampling and analysis of extracted ore to
   ensure that the ore       sold and/or processed is of a grade
15 satisfactory to customer and/or processing requirements.
   Many ores contain water in the form of        free water and
   bound water.       Free water is water which is on the surface
   of ore particles or trapped within the porous structure of
20 the mineral, and is not chemically bound to the mineral.
   Free water is distinct from chemically bound water.                         Free
   water is hereinafter referred to as percentage               (%)
   moisture.
25 Bound water is water that is chemically bound within the
   mineral in question, and is hereineafter referred to as
   "combined water"       (CW).  For example, Goethite is a type of
   iron ore with chemically bound water.        Goethite has a
   chemical composition of a-(FeO(OH))       and decomposes to
30 Hematite  (Fe 2 0 3 ) upon heating.
   Measurement of the % moisture content of an ore sample is
   preferably undertaken so as to drive off all             free water,
                                                   9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                               - 2
   but not to affect combined water.    The measurement of %
   moisture is intrinsically difficult because of the
   capacity of water to evaporate under a range of climatic
   conditions.   From the point where  samples are taken, to
 5 the beginning of the measurement of % moisture, it is
   preferable that any loss of moisture from the sample in
   question be kept to a minimum and that preferably no loss
   of moisture occur.
10 Loss on Ignition  (LOI) is the term used to describe the
   percentage mass changes that occur when an ore is heated
   to 1000 0C.   The major part of the LOI is usually the loss
   of the combined water.
15 Free water  (moisture) and combined water represent an
   energy penalty in the refining of an ore as the energy
   required to drive off the water is additional to the
   energy required to reduce the ore to its metallic state
   and hence both measurements are important factors in
20 deriving the economic value of the ore.
   When assaying multiple ore samples   from a mine, a
   laboratory will typically assay certified reference
   samples at the same time using the same assaying process
25 and equipment as it uses for assaying the ore samples.
   Certified reference  samples are samples of ore that are
   produced in a laboratory so as to have a known and
   certified chemical composition.    By assaying certified
30 reference  samples at the same time as assaying ore
   samples, and by using the same assaying process and
   equipment to do this, the laboratory can identify if there
   is an issue with calibration or operation of the testing
                                              9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                               - 3
   processes and/or equipment.   Certified reference materials
   are used to determine the "trueness" of an assay result.
   Traded ore is usually sold on a dollar value for a dry
 5 unit of the element of interest.    Hence for example to
   determine the value of an iron ore the assay must include
   a true value for percentage iron   (%Fe) and percentage
   moisture. Because a number of ores particularly iron ores
   contain free and combined water it is essential that the
10 determination of both are independent of each other. Hence
   the measurement of moisture must include all        free water
   but exclude all combined water.
15 It has hitherto not been possible to produce reference
   standards that are both economical in cost and that have a
   stable amount of bound and free water.    Typically, the
   amount of free water within a reference   standard reduces
   when the standard is stored for an extended period of
20 time.

        determined in accordance with the second aspect of
        the present invention.
20 In one embodiment the measurement of at least one of

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   Referring now to Figure  la there is provided a schematic
   representation of a reference   standard 100 comprising
25 container 105, which has a sealed opening 110 and contains
   a sample of ore 115.
   Container 105 is configured so that the container walls
   are substantially impervious to the transmission of water
30 vapour.  In one embodiment container 105 is configured to
   have a water vapour permeability, both into and out of the
   container, of less than 0.2% by weight moisture loss from
   inside the container when sealed and held at a temperature
                                               9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                              - 10
   600 Celsius for a period of 3 months.
   Aluminium laminate bags, such as those made by Protective
   Packaging Limited of Cheshire in the United Kingdom have
 5 been found to have a moisture loss of less than 0.05% by
   weight of moisture when held at 600 Celsius      for a three
   month period.
   Container 105 may be sealed by welding or other
10 application of heat, including use of a standard heat
   sealing device operated for about two seconds at a heat of
   180 to 200 *C
   Referring now to Figure lb which depicts an alternate form
15 for container 105, namely a plastic tub 120.         The opening
   of the tub 120 may be hermetically sealed by an aluminium
   foil 125 or ring pull arrangement.  The sealed container
   130 should be substantially impervious to water vapour so
   that free water within the mineral sample is not lost to
20 the atmosphere during storage and transportation.
   Specifically, less than 0.2% by weight of moisture within
   the tub 120 when sealed by foil 125 should be lost when
   the container is held at a temperature in the range 0 -                      80
   *C for a period of between 1 and 6 months, and preferably
25 10 months.
   Referring now to Figure 1c, there is depicted an alternate
   form for container 105, namely a tray 140 with multiple
   compartments 145 which store respectively individual
30 samples of ore.  The tray may be hermetically sealed by a
   top sheet 150.
   Each compartment of the tray is preferably sealed by
                                             9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                               -  11
   individual seals 155 so that samples do not get mixed
   between compartments during transport and handling of the
   trays.
 5 Each compartment and associated sample of ore may be
   individually hermetically sealed.     Hermetically sealing
   the compartments individually allows the compartments to
   be individually opened and the reference samples to be
   used at different times.
10
   As for Figures  la and lb, the hermetically sealed tray
   should be substantially impervious to water vapour so that
   less than 0.2% by weight of moisture within the
   hermetically sealed tray should be lost when held at a
15 temperature in the range 0 -    80 0C for a period of between
   1 and 6 months, and preferably 10 months.
   Air within container 105 may be replaced by an inert gas
   such as nitrogen or argon to stop oxidative changes to the
20 contained mineral sample.     This may be particularly
   beneficial for sulphur based minerals.     The container 105
   may be sealed in an environment of substantially inert
   gas.   Alternately, the container 105 may be flushed by an
   inert gas prior to, and possibly during, the process for
25 sealing the container.
   Referring now to Figure 2 there is provided a flow diagram
   which details a process 2000 in accordance with one
   embodiment for producing reference    standards, such as
30 reference  standard 100 of Figure 1,   for iron ore           samples.
   Process 2000 commences at step 2005 where a 3000kg sample
   of iron ore is obtained.   At step 2010 a rotary divider is
                                               9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                               - 12
   used to divided the 3000kg sample into ten 300kg sub
   samples.  The  300kg sub-samples are placed into 200 litre
   drums.
 5 The process 2000 splits at step 2010 and continues in
   parallel to steps 2015 and 2025.    At step 2025, the mass
   of each 200 litre drum is recorded.    Step 2025 proceeds to
   step 2045, which is described later.
10 At step 2015 the 200 litre drums are sealed using cling
   film, the lids are placed on the drums and they are stored
   in a cool room at 100  Celsius so as to minimise the amount
   of free water that is expelled from the samples during
   storage and prior to measurement of the LOI of the sample.
15
   Following step 2015, the process proceeds to step 2020
   where each of the 300kg samples   (in the 200 litre drums)
   are divided into ten 30kg samples that are stored in 20
   litre drums.   Accordingly, at the step 2020, there are                     100
20 30kg samples.
   Following step 2020, the process proceeds to step 2030
   where the mass of the sample in each 20 litre drum is
   recorded.   Accordingly, mass data for the 100 separate
25 samples is recorded.
   The process splits at step 2030 and continues in parallel
   to steps 2035 and 2040.   At step 2040 the total mass of
   the samples in the one hundred 20 litre drums is
30 calculated.   At step 2045, the mass of the 100 30kg
   samples is compared to the total mass of the samples
   recorded at step 2025 for the ten 300kg samples in the 200
   litre drums.   Any loss of mass between the two
                                              9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                                -  13
   measurements is identified and recorded.       If there is a
   substantial difference the process steps may be repeated.
   At step 2035 each of the 30kg samples is further divided
 5 into ten 3kg samples using a rotary divider.            Once all
   30kg samples have been divided, there is one thousand 3kg
   samples.   The process 2000 then moves to step 2050 where
   each of the one thousand 3kg samples are split into two
   samples of 1.5kg each.    This provides two thousand 1.5kg
10 samples of ore.   These samples are placed into containers,
   such as container 105 from Figure     1, at step 2065.
   The containers used at step 2065 are prepared at               step
   2055.  In particular, two thousand containers           105 are
15 prepared to receive the two thousand 1.5kg samples of ore.
   This includes pre-weighing the containers 105            (ie. before
   being loaded with the samples) and allocating a serial
   number to each container 105.      At step 2060 each container
   105 is coded with its mass     (when empty) as measured at
20 step 2055.
   At step 2065, the two thousand 1.5kg samples are placed
   into individual ones of the two thousand containers 105
   (which were prepared in accordance with steps 2055 and
25 2060 above).   At step 2070, the containers 105 are sealed.
   At step 2075 each container 105 is marked with the mass of
   the ore sample that it contains.
   At step 2080 5% of the two thousand sealed containers                       105,
30 namely one hundred containers     105, are selected.              At step
   2080 the process 2000 proceeds in parallel to step 2085
   and step 2090.   At step 2085 the one thousand nine hundred
   remaining containers  105  (i.e. those not   selected at step
                                                9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                              - 14
   2080) are stored in a cool room at 100  Celsius.
   At step 2090 the samples in the one hundred containers
   selected at step 2080 are processed to determine their
 5 moisture content on a percent weight basis. The process
   2000 proceeds in parallel at  step 2090 to steps 2095 and
   2120.  At step 2120 the percent weight moisture data for
   the one hundred samples from step 2090 is recorded.
10 At step 2095 the one hundred samples from step 2080 are
   processed to identify their particle size distribution.
   The process 2000 proceeds in parallel at step 2095 to step
   2100 and step 2105.  At step 2100 the particle size
   distribution for each sample is recorded.
15
   At step 2105 a set of analytical pulps are prepared for
   each of the one hundred samples selected at      step 2080.
   These pulps are prepared by reducing the particle size of
   the ore to less than 160 micron or 100 micron dependent on
20 the ore type being processed.
   Following step 2105, the process 2000 proceeds to step
   2110 where each pulp is subdivided into ten sub-samples.
   The process 2000 then proceeds to step 2115 where each of
25 the ten sub-samples are distributed to a number of
   different laboratories, typically ten different
   laboratories.
   Following step 2115, the process 2000 proceeds to step
30 2125 where each laboratory extracts four test portions
   from the pulps and analyses the pulps in quadruplicate,
   two on one day and two on the next day.
                                             9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                               - 15
   Following step 2125, the process 2000 proceeds to step
   2130 where data from each of the laboratories that tested
   the different pulp samples for % LOI and other chemical
   composition are collated and at step 2135 statistical
 5 analysis of the data is undertaken to arrive at a final
   LOI value with associated statistical parameters             such as
   mean and variance. The % LOI may be determined at
   intermediate temperature values as well as the final which
   is determined at 10000C.   The total % LOI is the sum of
10 these.
   Referring now to Figure  3 there is provided a flow diagram
   of a laboratory process 3000 for using reference             standards
   produced in accordance with the embodiment in Figure 2 to
15 verify measurements of the moisture loss on ignition                   (LOI)
   and other chemical composition values of iron ore               samples
   from a mine or shipping port.
   The process 3000 commences at step 3025 where reference
20 standards, such as reference   standard 100 which has been
   produced in accordance with the process in Figure 2,                   are
   incorporated within a set of ore samples obtained from a
   from a drilling programme or mine production or shipping
   port.  A typical practice is to incorporate one reference
25 standard for each 100 samples analysed at a mine, and at
   least one  for each shipment at a port.
   The process 3000 progresses from step 3025 to step 3010
   where the samples of ore  from the mine or drilling program
30 (along with the reference standards) are dried to remove
   surface water.   The process 3000 proceeds in parallel at
   step 3010 to three steps, namely step 3005,       step 3040 and
   step 3015.
                                              9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                               -  16
   At step 3005,  the samples,   including the reference
   standards, are documented after they have been dried of
   surface water.
 5 At step 3040 the weight percent     (%wt) moisture of the
   samples is calculated and recorded.      At step 3050 a
   statistical process control chart on the wt% moisture
   measurement of each of the samples is prepared and at                       step
   3055 a statistical process control report on the wt%
10 moisture of the samples is prepared.
   At step 3015 the samples   (including the reference
   standards) are individually crushed and at step 3020 the
   crushed samples   (including the reference standards) are
15 individually pulverised so as to have a mean particle size
   of 160 microns or less.
   AT step 3045 additional reference     standards     (with known
   chemical content but without moisture content data) may be
20 introduced into the sample set.      At step 3030 the samples
   from step 3020 and step 3045 are sub-sampled.
   The process 3000 at step 3030 proceeds in parallel to step
   3065 and 3035.   At step 3035 thermo gravimetric testing of
25 the sub-samples from step 3030 is undertaken.             The process
   3000 at step 3035 proceeds to step 3060 where the loss on
   ignition value for each sample as measured by the thermo
   gravimetric process at step 3035 is recorded.
30 At step 3065,  sub-samples from step 3030 that were not
   used in step 3035 are fused.     The process 3000 proceeds
   from step 3065 to step 3070 where the fused sub-samples
   undergo XRF  (x-ray fluorescence) elemental analysis.
                                                9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                              - 17
   At step 3075 the elemental analysis from step 3070 is
   recorded and at step 3080 statistical control charts for
   elemental analysis at step 3070 and the LOI at step 3060
   are prepared and incorporated into the statistical process
 5 control report of step 3055.
   Referring now to Figure 4 there is provided a flow diagram
   which details a process 4000 in accordance with an
   alternate embodiment for producing reference      standards,
10 such as reference standard 100 of Figure 1,     for iron ore
   samples.
   The alternate embodiment of Figure 4 may be used to verify
   the accuracy of % moisture measurements of iron ore at a
15 ship loader or other export or product delivery point.
   Measurements of % moisture of the ore loaded at a delivery
   point is important, for example, when iron ore is sold on
   a dry weight basis.  Knowing what the % moisture
20 measurement of the ore is at the delivery point allows the
   dry weight of ore delivered to be determined with
   accuracy.
   Most delivery point infrastructure includes ore sampling
25 and assaying facilities that are used to verify the
   composition and % moisture of ore being loaded onto a
   ship.  To ensure that measurements of % moisture and
   composition of ore is accurate, it is important to verify
   the accuracy of the assaying equipment.
30
   Figure 4 illustrates a method for producing a reference
   standard that may be used for verifying the % moisture
   measurement of assaying equipment in delivery point
                                            9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                               - 18
   facilities.   To produce such a reference standard, the
   process 4000 of Figure 4 commences at step 4002.
   At step 4002 a reference number is assigned to the
 5 reference standard that is to be produced by process 4000.
   At step 4004,  the mass of the reference   standard that is
   being produced is selected.    The mass of the reference
   standard is typically less than 10kg.
10
   At step 4006, twice the amount of material required for
   producing the reference  standard is obtained from a bulk
   sample of ore.   For example, if it is determined that the
   mass of the reference sample is to be 10kg, than 20kg of
15 material is obtained from a bulk sample.      The mass of the
   sample is weighed in kilograms to an accuracy of
   preferably two decimals places.    At step 4008, the mass
   measured in step 4006 is recorded, preferably into a data
   base, log or register of some form.
20
   Following step 4008, the process moves to step 4010 where
   segments of a rotary sample divider    (RSD) are cleaned and
   then dried.   At step 4012 the segments are weighed and the
   mass of the clean and dry segments are recorded,
25 preferably into a data base, log or register of some form.
   Following step 4012 the process moves to step 4014 where
   the RSD referred to in steps   4010 and 4012 is used to
   divide the sample into multiple sub-samples of
30 substantially equal volumes.    Preferably no fewer than
   eight sub-samples are produced.    At step 4016 the rotation
   time and mass of each segment is recorded into a data
   base, log or register of some form.
                                               9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                                - 19
   Following step 4016 the process moves to step 4018 where
   half of the sub-samples,   for example, the odd numbered
   segments from the RSD, are placed into a moisture
   retention container, such as the bag depicted 105 in
 5 Figure la, or the containers    120 and 140 of Figures lb and
   1c respectively.   The containers 105,   120 or 140 are
   sealed so that the moisture content of the sample is
   sealed into the container 105,    120 or 140 in question.                      At
   Step 4020 each container 105,    120 or 140 from step 4018 is
10 labelled with relevant information such as date of
   manufacture and contents.
   If the ore sealed in the containers    105, 120 or 140 is
   likely to oxidise in the presence of air and/or moisture
15 trapped within the container, then at step 4021, the air
   in the container is replaced by an inert gas         such as
   nitrogen, before the container is sealed.
   Following step 4020   (and step 4021 if required) the
20 process moves to step 4022 where the remaining sub-samples
   of ore  (i.e. the sub-samples not used at step 4018) are
   each removed from the RSD segment in which they are
   located and are placed into separate drying pans that will
   be used for drying the samples.
25
   At step 4022 the process splits into parallel processes.
   The first of the parallel processes deals with the
   segments from the RSD.    The second of the parallel
   processes deals with the sub-samples that have been
30 located into drying pans.
   The first of the parallel processes stemming from step
   4022 commences at step 4024 where the empty segments from
                                               9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                               - 20
   the RSD are reweighed.   The process then moves to step
   4026 where the empty segments are then dried. t step 4028
   the dry masses of the empty segments of the RSD are
   recorded.
 5
   At step 4030 the amount of moisture retained in each
   segment is calculated by subtracting the dry weight at
   step 4026 from the wet weight at step 4024.        The amount of
   moisture retained in then converted into a percentage
10 amount of the mass of the corresponding sample that was
   located into a drying pan at   step 4022. This moisture
   content is recorded at step 4032.
   The process moves to step 4034 from step 4032.           Step 4034
15 is a decision point.   The process determines at step 4034
   whether the amount moisture retained in the segment of the
   RSD device is greater or less than 0.2% of the mass of the
   sample located into a drying pan at step 4022.           If the
   amount of moisture retained in the segment of the RSD is
20 greater than 0.2% of the mass of the sample located in the
   drying pan, the process moves to step 4036.        At step 4036
   the process terminates and all of the samples are
   discarded.
25 If at step 4034 the moisture retained in the segment of
   the RSD is determined to be less than 0.2%    of the mass of
   the sample located in the drying pan, the process moves to
   step 4038.
30 Step 4038 is the start of the second parallel processes
   stemming from step 4022.   At step 4038 the samples that
   that were placed onto a drying pan at step 4022 are placed
   into a drying oven.  The drying oven is preferably heated
                                             9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                               -  21
   to 1050C and the samples are kept in the oven at this
   temperature for 24 hours.    Once step 4038 is complete, the
   process moves to step 4040 where the dried samples are
   weighed.  The difference in weight between the mass
 5 measured for the sample at steps 4016 and 4038 provides a
   measure of the amount of free moisture in the sample
   before drying.   This amount of moisture is expressed as a
   percentage of the mass of the wet sample.       At step 4042
   the total mass of the moisture removed from each sample
10 and the % moisture of each sample is recorded, such as in
   a data base, log or register of some form.
   Once step 4042 is complete, the process moves to step 4046
   where the % moisture measurements    for each of the samples
15 calculated at  step 4040 are compared.    If the results for
   all of the samples are the same to within 0.1% then the
   process moves to step 4048.     If the results are not within
   0.1% of each other, then the process moves to step 4036
   and all of the samples are discarded.
20
   At step 4048 the process splits into two parallel paths.
   The first of these paths, which commences at step 4050,
   determines the size distribution of the ore particles in
   the sample.   The second of these paths, which commences at
25 Step 4054, performs a chemical assay of the sample.
   At step 4050 size determination of the sample is carried
   out in accordance with a pre-determined standard, such as
   ISO-4701.   At step 4052 all size determinations are
30 recorded along with other statistical data such as
   averages and standard deviations.     This path then proceeds
   to step 4066 where the size data is entered into a
   certificate of analysis.
                                               9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                              - 22
   At step 4054 the samples are individually pulverised,
   using suitably sized equipment, into particles with a top
   size of either 160 microns or 100 microns.
 5 After step 4054 the process moves to step 4056 where each
   pulverised sample is divided into at least eight sub
   samples using an RSD.  At step 4058 each of the sub
   samples is labelled with the reference number from step
   4002 and with a sub-sample number.  This allows each sub
10 sample to be uniquely identified.
   Following step 4058 the process moves to step 4060 where
   duplicate analysis of the eight sub-samples      for each of
   the samples referred to at step 4022 is performed.
15 Preferably, the eight sub-samples are analysed by separate
   laboratories.  Alternately, at least two laboratories may
   each analyse four of the eight sub-samples.        This
   possibility is indicated at step 4062.
20 Following step 4060 the process moves to step 4064 where
   the results of the chemical analysis at steps 4060 and
   4062 are recorded along with statistical data such as
   averages, standard deviations and confidence level.                   This
   data is then recorded onto a certificate of analysis at
25 step 4066, along with size determination data from step
   4052.
   A reference standard produced in accordance with process
   4000 may be included within a sample set analysed by
30 assaying equipment at delivery point infrastructure, such
   as a ship loader.  By comparing the results of the
   analysis of the reference standard at the delivery point
   infrastructure with the expected results from the analysis
                                             9661091_1 (GHMatters) P104258.AU.2 9/11/17

                               -  23
   in process 4000,  it is possible to determine whether the
   assay equipment  is accurate to within an acceptable margin
   or whether it requires calibration.     This is particularly
   helpful for measurements of % moisture as this quantity is
 5 highly variable throughout the process of mining,
   processing and stockpiling the ore before it is loaded
   onto a ship at a delivery point.     This variability arises
   from climactic conditions,    dust suppression water spray
   and the length of time that the ore is left to stand in a
10 stock pile before it is loaded onto a ship.
