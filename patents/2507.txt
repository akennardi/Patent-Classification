       AQUEOUS OPHTHALMIC SOLUTIONS OF PHENTOLAMINE AND MEDICAL

                       CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
   [0001]      This application claims the benefit of and priority to United States Provisional
   Patent Application serial number 61/759,530, filed February 1, 2013, the contents of which are
   hereby incorporated by reference.
                                      FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   [0002]      The invention relates to aqueous ophthalmic solutions of phentolamine or
 5 pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, medical kits, and methods for using such solutions to
   improve visual performance in a patient.
                                             BACKGROUND
   [0003]      Deficient visual performance can have a significant negative impact on a patient's
   quality of life, affecting, for example, ability to perform normal daily tasks, perform at school,
   and perform at work. One type of vision problem experienced by a substantial number of
10 patients is poor night vision. The inability to see clearly under such low light conditions can
   make it difficult and/or dangerous for a patient to operate a motor vehicle at nighttime. Patients
   that are more likely to experience night vision problems include those suffering from night
   myopia, those with an equatorial cortical cataract, and those who have had surgery to insert an
   intraocular lens and/or underwent LASIK surgery. Exemplary symptoms of poor night vision
15 include glare, halos, starburst, ghosting patterns, and/or poor depth perception.
   [0004]      Certain therapies have been described for improving visual performance. For
   example, the Bernstein Center for Visual Performance offers programs that utilize visual aids,
   such as puzzles, stereoscopes, and eye glasses, designed to improve visual performance. U.S.
   Patent Nos. 6,730,065; 6,515,006; 6,420,407; and 6,291,498 describe the use of phentolamine
20 to, for example, optimize pupil size in a patient. However, the need exists for additional
   compositions and methods that provide improvement in visual performance.

   WO 2014/121027                                                                PCT/US2014/014067
                                                  -2
   [0005]      Despite this need, it is difficult to prepare stable, aqueous formulations of
   phentolamine salt forms without the use of a chelating agent, such as, disodium
   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). U.S. Patent No. 7,229,630 describes test results of
   various aqueous formulations containing phentolamine mesylate and states, for example, that
 5 the presence of a metal chelator is believed to be necessary to maintain stability of the
   formulation.
   [0006]      In view of the need for better formulations for administering phentolamine or a
   pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to the eye of a patient, research has been performed
   and the present patent application describes the surprising discovery of stable, aqueous
10 ophthalmic solutions free of a chelating agent. The aqueous ophthalmic solutions free of a
   chelating agent can be used to administer phentolamine mesylate to the eye of a patient, and the
   aqueous ophthalmic solutions have demonstrated good stability upon storage.
   [0007]      Accordingly, the present invention addresses the aforementioned need for improved
   formulations that can be administered to the eye of a patient for improving visual performance,
15 and the invention provides other related advantages.
                                                SUMMARY
   [0008]      The invention provides aqueous ophthalmic solutions of phentolamine or
   pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, medical kits, and methods for using such solutions to
   improve visual performance in a patient. One of the benefits of the aqueous ophthalmic
   solutions is they have surprisingly been found to be stable to extended storage, even though
20 they do not have a chelating agent. Another benefit of the aqueous ophthalmic solutions is that
   they are well-suited for administration to the eye of a patient in the form of an eye drop. For
   example, the aqueous ophthalmic solutions avoid or minimize any burning or stinging
   sensation often associated with certain phentolamine mesylate solutions described in the
   literature. Various aspects and embodiments of the invention are described in further detail
25 below.
   [0009]      Accordingly, one aspect of the invention provides an aqueous ophthalmic solution
   free of a chelating agent, comprising: (a) about 0.1% (w/v) to about 4% (w/v) of phentolamine
   or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; (b) about 1% (w/v) to about 6% (w/v) of at least
   one polyol compound having a molecular weight less than 250 g/mol; (c) about 0.1 mM to

   WO 2014/121027                                                                PCT/US2014/014067
                                                -3
   about 10 mM of at least one buffer; and (d) water; wherein the solution has a pH in the range of
   4.0 to 7.5 and does not contain a chelating agent.
   [0010]       Another aspect of the invention provides a method of improving visual performance
   in a patient. The method comprises administering to the eye of a patient in need thereof an
 5 effective amount of an aqueous ophthalmic solution described herein to improve visual
   performance in the patient. In certain embodiments, the improvement in visual performance is
   improved visual acuity, such as an improvement in visual acuity under scotopic conditions,
   mesopic conditions, and/or photopic conditions.
   [0011]       Another aspect of the invention provides a method of reducing pupil diameter in a
10 patient. The method comprises administering to the eye of a patient in need thereof an
   effective amount of an aqueous ophthalmic solution described herein to reduce pupil diameter
   in a patient. In certain embodiments, the reduction in pupil diameter under mesopic conditions
   is at least 5% compared to the pupil diameter of the patient under the same mesopic conditions
   but not having received said aqueous ophthalmic solution.
15 [0012]       Another aspect of the invention provides a method of reducing an aberrant focus of
   scattered light rays in a patient's eye. The method comprises administering to the eye of a
   patient in need thereof an effective amount of an aqueous ophthalmic solution described herein
   to reduce aberrant focus of scattered light rays in the patient's eye.

25 [0028]      The invention provides aqueous ophthalmic solutions of phentolamine or
   pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, medical kits, and methods for using such solutions to
   improve visual performance in a patient. The aqueous ophthalmic solutions have surprisingly
   been found to be stable to extended storage, even though they do not have a chelating agent.
   The aqueous ophthalmic solutions described herein offer the additional benefit that they are

   well-suited for administration to the eye of a patient in the form of an eye drop. For example,
   the aqueous ophthalmic solutions avoid or minimize any burning or stinging sensation often
   associated with certain phentolamine mesylate solutions described in the literature. The
   practice of the present invention employs, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques
 5 of organic chemistry and pharmacology. Various aspects of the invention are set forth below in
   sections; however, aspects of the invention described in one particular section are not to be
   limited to any particular section.
   I. DEFINITIONS
   [0029]      To facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a number of terms and
10 phrases are defined below.
   [0030]      The terms "a" and "an" as used herein mean "one or more" and include the plural
   unless the context is inappropriate.
   [0031]      The term "alkyl" as used herein refers to a saturated straight or branched
   hydrocarbon, such as a straight or branched group of 1-12, 1-10, or 1-6 carbon atoms, referred
15 to herein as C1-Cl 2 alkyl, C1-Cioalkyl, and CI-C 6 alkyl, respectively. Exemplary alkyl groups
   include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, 2-methyl-I-propyl, 2-methyl-2
   propyl, 2-methyl-1-butyl, 3-methyl-1-butyl, 2-methyl-3-butyl, 2,2-dimethyl-1-propyl, 2
   methyl-1-pentyl, 3-methyl-1-pentyl, 4-methyl-1-pentyl, 2-methyl-2-pentyl, 3-methyl-2-pentyl,
   4-methyl-2-pentyl, 2,2-dimethyl-1-butyl, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butyl, 2-ethyl-i -butyl, butyl, isobutyl,
20 t-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, etc.
   [0032]      The term "Dextran 70" is art-recognized and refers to dextran having a weight
   average molecular weight of about 70,000 g/mol.
   [0033]      The abbreviation "q.s." is art-recognized and refers to "quantity sufficient,"
   meaning the amount of material necessary to bring the solution to the total volume.
25 [0034]      The compounds of the disclosure may contain one or more chiral centers and/or
   double bonds and, therefore, exist as stereoisomers, such as geometric isomers, enantiomers or
   diastereomers. The term "stereoisomers" when used herein consist of all geometric isomers,
   enantiomers or diastereomers. These compounds may be designated by the symbols "R" or
   "S," depending on the configuration of substituents around the stereogenic carbon atom. The
30 present invention encompasses various stereoisomers of these compounds and mixtures thereof.

   WO 2014/121027                                                                  PCT/US2014/014067
                                                  -7
   Stereoisomers include enantiomers and diastereomers. Mixtures of enantiomers or
   diastereomers may be designated "(±)" in nomenclature, but the skilled artisan will recognize
   that a structure may denote a chiral center implicitly.
   [0035]       Individual stereoisomers of compounds of the present invention can be prepared
 5 synthetically from commercially available starting materials that contain asymmetric or
   stereogenic centers, or by preparation of racemic mixtures followed by resolution methods well
   known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These methods of resolution are exemplified by
   (1) attachment of a mixture of enantiomers to a chiral auxiliary, separation of the resulting
   mixture of diastereomers by recrystallization or chromatography and liberation of the optically
10 pure product from the auxiliary, (2) salt formation employing an optically active resolving
   agent, or (3) direct separation of the mixture of optical enantiomers on chiral chromatographic
   columns. Stereoisomeric mixtures can also be resolved into their component stereoisomers by
   well known methods, such as chiral-phase gas chromatography, chiral-phase high performance
   liquid chromatography, crystallizing the compound as a chiral salt complex, or crystallizing the
15 compound in a chiral solvent. Stereoisomers can also be obtained from stereomerically-pure
   intermediates, reagents, and catalysts by well-known asymmetric synthetic methods.
   [0036]       Geometric isomers can also exist in the compounds of the present invention. The
   present invention encompasses the various geometric isomers and mixtures thereof resulting
   from the arrangement of substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond or arrangement of
20 substituents around a carbocyclic ring. Substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond are
   designated as being in the "Z' or "E"configuration wherein the terms "Z' and "E' are used in
   accordance with IUPAC standards.
   [0037]       The invention also embraces isotopically labeled compounds of the invention which
   are identical to those recited herein, except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom
25 having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually
   found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the
   invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine and
   chlorine, such as 2 H, 3H, 1C, 4C, 1N, is0,       0, 3P, 3P, 3S,    "F, and 36Cl, respectively.
   [0038]       Certain isotopically-labeled disclosed compounds (e.g., those labeled with 3H and
   14
30   C) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., 3H) and
                     14
   carbon-14 (i.e.,     C) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and

                                                 -8
   detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2 H) may afford
   certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo
   half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.
   [0039]       As used herein, the terms "subject" and "patient" refer to organisms to be treated by
 5 the methods of the present invention. Such organisms are preferably mammals (e.g., murines,
   simians, equines, bovines, porcines, canines, felines, and the like), and more preferably
   humans.
   [0040]       As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to the amount of a compound or
   aqueous ophthalmic solution sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results. An effective
10 amount can be administered in one or more administrations, applications or dosages and is not
   intended to be limited to a particular formulation or administration route. As used herein, the
   term "treating" includes any effect, e.g., lessening, reducing, modulating, ameliorating or
   eliminating, that results in the improvement of the condition, disease, disorder, and the like, or
   ameliorating a symptom thereof.
15 [0041]       As used herein, the term "pharmaceutical composition" refers to the combination of
   an active agent with a carrier, inert or active, making the composition especially suitable for
   diagnostic or therapeutic use in vivo or ex vivo.
   [0042]       As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to any of the
   standard pharmaceutical carriers, such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions
20 (e.g., such as an oil/water or water/oil emulsions), and various types of wetting agents. The
   compositions also can include stabilizers and preservatives. For examples of carriers,
   stabilizers and adjuvants, see Martin in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 15th Ed., Mack
   Publ. Co., Easton, PA [1975].
   [0043]       As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to any
25 pharmaceutically acceptable salt (e.g., acid or base) of a compound of the present invention
   which, upon administration to a subject, is capable of providing a compound of this invention
   or an active metabolite or residue thereof. As is known to those of skill in the art, "salts" of the
   compounds of the present invention may be derived from inorganic or organic acids and bases.
   Examples of acids include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric,
30 perchloric, fumaric, maleic, phosphoric, glycolic, lactic, salicylic, succinic, toluene-p-sulfonic,
   tartaric, acetic, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, formic, benzoic, malonic, naphthalene-

   2-sulfonic, benzenesulfonic acid, and the like. Other acids, such as oxalic, while not in
   themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed in the preparation of salts useful as
   intermediates in obtaining the compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically
   acceptable acid addition salts.
 5 [0044]        Examples of bases include, but are not limited to, alkali metal (e.g., sodium)
   hydroxides, alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium) hydroxides, ammonia, and compounds of
   formula NW 4 +, wherein W is C 1 4 alkyl, and the like.

   II. AQUEOUS OPHTHALMIC SOLUTIONS OF PHENTOLAMINE AND
       PHARMACEUTICALLY ACCEPTABLE SALTS THEREOF
   [0052]      One aspect of the invention provides aqueous ophthalmic solutions free of a
15 chelating agent. The aqueous ophthalmic solutions comprise (a) phentolamine or a
   pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; (b) at least one polyol compound, such as a polyol
   compound having a molecular weight less than 250 g/mol; (c) at least one buffer; and (d) water;
   wherein the solution does not contain a chelating agent. One of the benefits of the aqueous
   ophthalmic solutions is they have surprisingly been found to be stable to extended storage, even
20 though they do not have a chelating agent. In addition, another benefit of the aqueous
   ophthalmic solutions is they avoid or minimize any burning or stinging sensation often
   associated with certain phentolamine mesylate solutions described in the literature. The
   amount of ingredients in the aqueous ophthalmic solutions may be selected in order to achieve
   particular performance properties, such as stability to storage, minimize irritation to the eye of a
25 patient, and enhance penetration of phentolamine into the eye of a patient.
   [0053]      One exemplary preferred solution is an aqueous ophthalmic solution free of a
   chelating agent comprising: (a) about 0.1% (w/v) to about 4% (w/v) of phentolamine or a
   pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; (b) about 1% (w/v) to about 6% (w/v) of at least one
   polyol compound having a molecular weight less than 250 g/mol; (c) about 0.1 mM to about 10
30 mM of at least one buffer; and (d) water; wherein the solution has a pH in the range of 4.0 to
   7.5 and does not contain a chelating agent.

   WO 2014/121027                                                              PCT/US2014/014067
                                              - 11
   [0054]       Exemplary components and features of the aqueous ophthalmic solution are
   described in more detail below.
   Phentolamine& PharmaceuticallyAcceptable Salts
   [0055]       The aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises phentolamine or a pharmaceutically
 5 acceptable salt of phentolamine. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, for
   example, the hydrochloric acid salt and mesylate salt. Accordingly, in certain embodiments,
   the solution comprises phentolamine (i.e., as the free base). In certain other embodiments, the
   solution comprises phentolamine hydrochloride. In certain yet other embodiments, the solution
   comprises phentolamine mesylate.
10 [0056]       The amount of phentolamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the
   aqueous ophthalmic solution may be adjusted in order to achieve desired performance
   properties. For example, where is it desired to provide a larger amount of phentolamine (or
   pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) to the patient in a single administration of the aqueous
   ophthalmic solution, the concentration of phentolamine (or pharmaceutically acceptable salt
15 thereof) is increased in the aqueous ophthalmic solution. Single administration of aqueous
   ophthalmic solutions having a higher concentration of phentolamine (or pharmaceutically
   acceptable salt thereof) may provide the patient with improved visual performance for a longer
   duration of time because more phentolamine (or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is
   administered to the patient.
20 [0057]       Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises
   from about 0.1% (w/v) to about 2% (w/v) of phentolamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable
   salt thereof. In certain embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises from about
   0. 2 5 % (w/v) to about 2% (w/v) of phentolamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
   In certain other embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises from about 0.5%
25 (w/v) to about 2% (w/v) of phentolamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In
   certain other embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises from about 0.25% (w/v)
   to about 1% (w/v) of phentolamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In certain
   other embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises about 1% (w/v) of
   phentolamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In certain other embodiments, the
30 aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises from about 0.1% (w/v) to about 4% (w/v) of
   phentolamine mesylate. In certain other embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution

   WO 2014/121027                                                               PCT/US2014/014067
                                               - 12
   comprises from about 0.1% (w/v) to about 2% (w/v) of phentolamine mesylate. In certain
   other embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises from about 0.25% (w/v) to
   about 2% (w/v) of phentolamine mesylate. In certain other embodiments, the aqueous
   ophthalmic solution comprises from about 0.5% (w/v) to about 2 % (w/v) of phentolamine
 5 mesylate. In certain other embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises from
   about 0. 2 5 % (w/v) to about 1% (w/v) of phentolamine mesylate. In certain other embodiments,
   the aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises about 1% (w/v) of phentolamine mesylate. In
   certain other embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises about 0.25% (w/v) or
   about 0.5% (w/v) of phentolamine mesylate.
10 Polvol Compounds
   [0058]       The aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises one or more polyol compounds. The
   polyol compound is an organic compound having at least two hydroxyl groups (e.g., from 2 to
   about 6 hydroxyl groups). The polyol compound is beneficial to the aqueous ophthalmic
   solution because, for example, it can increase the stability of the aqueous ophthalmic solution
15 to storage and/or modify the tonicity of the aqueous ophthalmic solution. Exemplary polyol
   compounds include, for example, mannitol, glycerol, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol,
   sorbitol, and xylitol.
   [0059]       The aqueous ophthalmic solution may contain a single polyol compound or a
   mixture of one or more polyol compounds. In other words, the aqueous ophthalmic solution
20 comprises at least one polyol compound. In certain embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic
   solution comprises at least one polyol compound that is mannitol, glycerol, propylene glycol,
   ethylene glycol, sorbitol, or xylitol. In certain other embodiments, the at least one polyol
   compound is mannitol. In certain other embodiments, the at least one polyol compound is
   glycerol. In certain other embodiments, the at least one polyol compound is propylene glycol.
25 In certain other embodiments, the at least one polyol compound is mannitol, and the solution
   further comprises glycerol. In certain other embodiments, the at least one polyol compound is
   mannitol, and the solution further comprises propylene glycol. In certain other embodiments,
   the at least one polyol compound is glycerol, and the solution further comprises propylene
   glycol. In certain other embodiments, the mannitol described in embodiments above is D
30 mannitol.

   WO 2014/121027                                                               PCT/US2014/014067
                                               - 13
   [0060]      The amount of the at least one polyol compound in the aqueous ophthalmic solution
   may be selected in order to achieve desired performance properties for the solution. The polyol
   compound may, for example, increase the stability of the solution to storage and/or modify the
   tonicity of the solution to make it more suitable for administration to the eye of a patient. In
 5 certain embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises from about 2% (w/v) to about
   5% (w/v) of the at least one polyol compound. In certain other embodiments, the aqueous
   ophthalmic solution comprises from about 3 .5 % (w/v) to about 4.5% (w/v) of the at least one
   polyol compound. In certain other embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises
   about 4% (w/v) of the at least one polyol compound. In certain other embodiments, the
10 aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises from about 2% (w/v) to about 3% (w/v) mannitol, and
   about 0.5% (w/v) to about 1.5% (w/v) glycerin. In certain other embodiments, the mannitol
   described in embodiments above is D-mannitol.
   [0061]      In certain embodiments, the amount of polyol may be selected based on the amount
   of phentolamine (or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), such that there is an inverse
15 relationship between the amount of phentolamine (or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof)
   and the polyol in order to achieve isotonicity with the eye. For example, in embodiments
   where the aqueous ophthalmic solution contains about 2% (w/v) phentolamine, mannitol is
   present in the solution at a concentration of about 3% (w/v). In embodiments where the
   aqueous ophthalmic solution contains about 1% (w/v) phentolamine, mannitol is present in the
20 solution at a concentration of about 4% (w/v). To further illustrate this principle, in
   embodiments where the aqueous ophthalmic solution contains about 0.5% (w/v) phentolamine,
   mannitol may be present in the solution at a concentration of about 4.5% (w/v). In certain
   embodiments, the mannitol described in embodiments above is D-mannitol.
   [0062]      It is appreciated that the aqueous ophthalmic solution can contain additional
25 ingredients described herein, such as various polymer materials. One such embodiment is an
   aqueous ophthalmic solution comprising, for example, at least one polyol compound that is
   propylene glycol, and further comprising polypropylene glycol, such as polypropylene glycol
   having a weight average molecular weight in the range of about 5,000 g/mol to about 100,000
   g/mol.

   WO 2014/121027                                                            PCT/US2014/014067

   PolY(Cualkvlene      lycol Polymer
   [0063]      The aqueous ophthalmic solution may optionally comprise a poly(C 2
   4 alkylene)glycol polymer. An exemplary poly(C 2_4alkylene)glycol polymer is polypropylene
   glycol, such as a polypropylene glycol having a weight average molecular weight in the range
 5 of about 5,000 g/mol to about 100,000 g/mol, about 10,000 g/mol to about 50,000 g/mol, or
   about 50,000 g/mol to about 100,000 g/mol.
   Dextran
   [0064]      The aqueous ophthalmic solution may optionally comprise dextran. Dextran is a
   commercially available, branched polysaccharide comprising glucose molecules. The amount
10 of dextran in the aqueous ophthalmic solution may be selected to achieve certain performance
   properties. In certain embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises from about
   0.01% (w/v) to about 2% (w/v) dextran. In certain other embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic
   solution comprises from about 0.01% (w/v) to about 1% (w/v) dextran.
   [0065]      The dextran may be further characterized according to its weight average molecular
15 weight. In certain embodiments, the dextran has a weight average molecular weight in the
   range of about 65,000 g/mol to about 75,000 g/mol. In certain other embodiments, the dextran
   has a weight average molecular weight of about 70,000 g/mol. In yet other embodiments, the
   dextran has a weight average molecular weight in the range of about 5,000 g/mol to about
    100,000 g/mol, about 10,000 g/mol to about 50,000 g/mol, or about 50,000 g/mol to about
20  100,000 g/mol.
   Cellulose Agent
   [0066]      The aqueous ophthalmic solution may optionally comprise a cellulose agent.
   Exemplary cellulose agents include, for example, cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose,
   hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxpropylcellulose, and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. In certain
25 embodiments, the cellulose agent is hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. In certain other
   embodiments, the cellulose agent is cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose,
   or hydroxpropylcellulose. The amount of cellulose agent in the aqueous ophthalmic solution
   may be selected in order to achieve desired performance properties. For example, in certain
   embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises from about 0.01% (w/v) to about 2 %
30 (w/v) cellulose agent.

   WO 2014/121027                                                                  PCT/US2014/014067
                                                 - 15
   [0067]       The cellulose agent may be further characterized according to its weight average
   molecular weight. In certain embodiments, the cellulose agent has a weight average molecular
   weight in the range of about 5,000 g/mol to about 100,000 g/mol, about 10,000 g/mol to about
   50,000 g/mol, or about 50,000 g/mol to about 100,000 g/mol.
 5 Buffer
   [0068]       The aqueous ophthalmic solution comprises at least one buffer. The buffer imparts
   to the solution a buffering capacity, that is, the capacity to neutralize, within limits, either acids
   or bases (alkali) with relatively little or no change in the original pH. The buffer may be an
   acid, a base, or a combination of an acid and a base. The buffer may be organic, inorganic, or a
10 combination of organic and inorganic components. It should be understood that the buffer at
   least partially dissociates in aqueous solution to form a mixture of, e.g., an acid and conjugate
   base or a base and conjugate acid. For example, the buffer may be a combination of a
   carboxylic acid and its carboxylate salt. In another embodiment, the buffer may be a
   combination of an acid and a base, where the acid and the base are not conjugates. For
15 example, the acid may be boric acid and the base may be tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
   (TRIS).
   [0069]       Exemplary buffers include organic acids (e.g., acetic acid, sorbic acid, and oxalic
   acid), a borate salt, a hydrogen carbonate salt, a carbonate salt, a gluconate salt, a lactate salt, a
   phosphate salt, a propionate salt, a perborate salt, tris-(hydroxymethyl)amineomethane (TRIS),
20 bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-imino-tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminoalcohol         (bis-tris), N-[2-hydroxy-1,1
   bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine (tricene), N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine,
   3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid, N-(carbamoylmethyl)taurine (ACES), an amino acid,
   salts thereof, and combinations thereof. It should be understood that the salt form of a buffer
   may comprise any suitable counterion. For example, the salt form of an acid may comprise an
25 alkali or alkaline earth metal counterion.
   [0070]       The buffer can be characterized according to its strength, i.e., the buffering capacity.
   The buffering capacity can be tested, for example, by determining the millimoles (mM) of
   strong acid or base (or respectively, hydrogen or hydroxide ions) required to change the pH of a
   buffer solution by one unit when added to one liter (a standard unit) of the buffer solution. The
30 buffering capacity generally depends on the type and concentration of the buffer components
   and can be greater in particular pH ranges. For example, a buffer may have an optimal

   WO 2014/121027                                                              PCT/US2014/014067
                                              - 16
   buffering capacity in a pH range near the pKa of the buffer, e.g., within about 1 pH unit or
   within about 2 pH units of the pKa the buffer. In certain embodiments, the buffer is a weak
   buffer, such as an alkali metal carboxylate (e.g., sodium acetate).
   [0071]      In certain embodiments, the buffer is a weak acid buffer having one or more of the
 5 following characteristics: (a) a pKa of between about 4.0 and about 6.0; more preferably,
   between about 4.5 and about 5.5; and (b) a lipophilicity value Log P of from about -0.50 to
   about 1.5; more preferably, from about -0.25 to about 1.35.
   [0072]      The amount of buffer can be adjusted in order to achieve desired performance
   properties for the aqueous ophthalmic solution. For example, in certain embodiments, the
10 buffer may be present at a concentration of less than about 10 mM, less than about 7 mM, less
   than about 5 mM, less than about 3 mM, or less than about 2 mM. In some embodiments, the
   buffer may be present at a concentration of from about 1 mM to about 10 mM, from about 1
   mM to about 7 mM, from about 1 mM to about 5 mM, from about 1 mM to about 3 mM, from
   about 1 mM to about 2 mM, from about 2 mM to about 5 mM, or from about 2 mM to about 3
15 mM. In yet other embodiments, the buffer is present at a concentration of about 3 mM.
   [0073]      The amount and identity of the buffer may be selected in order to achieve certain
   performance properties for the aqueous ophthalmic solution. For example, the amount of
   buffer may impact the quantity of acid that may be neutralized before there is substantial
   change in the pH of the aqueous ophthalmic solution. Also, the amount of buffer may impact
20 the tonicity of the aqueous ophthalmic solution. Desirably, the quantity and identity of the
   buffer should be selected in order to minimize any irritation that may be caused by
   administration of the aqueous ophthalmic solution to the eye of a patient. Accordingly, in
   certain embodiments, the buffer is present at a concentration in the range of about 2 mM to
   about 4 mM. In yet other embodiments, the buffer is present at a concentration of about 3 mM.
25 In certain embodiments, the buffer comprises an alkali metal alkylcarboxylate. In certain other
   embodiments, the buffer comprises an alkali metal acetate. In yet other embodiments, the
   buffer comprises sodium acetate.
   Solution pH
   [0074]      The aqueous ophthalmic solution may be characterized according to the pH of the
30 solution. Desirably, the aqueous ophthalmic solution has a pH in the range of 4.0 to 7.5. In
   certain embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution has a pH in the range of 4.5 to 7.5. In

   WO 2014/121027                                                               PCT/US2014/014067
                                                 - 17
   certain embodiments, the solution has a pH in the range of 4.5 to 6.0. In certain other
   embodiments, the solution has a pH in the range of 4.5 to 5.5. In yet other embodiments, the
   solution has a pH in the range of 4.7 to 5.1.
   AdditionalMaterials for Aqueous Ophthalmic Solutions
 5 [0075]      The aqueous ophthalmic solutions may contain additional materials in order to make
   the composition more suitable for administration to the eye of a patient. Exemplary additional
   materials are described below and include, for example, a tonicity modifier, preservative,
   antioxidant, viscosity modifying agent, stabilizing agent, corneal permeation enhancing agent,
   and surfactants.
10         A. Tonicitv Modifier
   [0076]      The aqueous ophthalmic solution may optionally comprise one or more tonicity
   modifiers. The tonicity modifier may be ionic or non-ionic. In certain embodiments, the
   tonicity modifier may be a salt, a carbohydrate, or a polyol. Exemplary tonicity modifiers
   include alkali metal or alkaline earth metal halides (such as LiBr, LiCl, LiI, KBr, KCl, KI,
15 NaBr, NaCl, Nal, CaCl 2, and MgCl 2), boric acid, dextran (e.g., Dextran 70), cyclodextrin,
   dextrose, mannitol, glycerin, urea, sorbitol, propylene glycol, or a combination thereof.
   [0077]      It is appreciated that the tonicity modifier may be added to the aqueous ophthalmic
   solution in an amount sufficient to provide a desired osmolality. In certain embodiments, the
   tonicity modifier is present in the aqueous ophthalmic solution in an amount sufficient so that
20 the aqueous ophthalmic solution has an osmolality ranging from about 50 to about 1000
   mOsm/kg, from about 100 to about 400 mOsm/kg, from about 200 to about 400 mOsm/kg, or
   from about 280 to about 380 mOsm/kg. In certain embodiments, a tonicity modifier may be
   present in an amount ranging from about 0.010%(w/v) to about 7% (w/v), about 0.010% (w/v) to
   about 5% (w/v), about 0.010%(w/v) to about 1% (w/v), about 0.10%(w/v) to about 1% (w/v),
25 about 0.05% (w/v) to about 5% (w/v), about 0.05% (w/v) to about 0.5% (w/v), about 1% (w/v)
   to about 3 % (w/v), or about   2
                                    % (w/v) to about 4 % (w/v), of the aqueous ophthalmic solution.
           B. Preservative
   [0078]      The aqueous ophthalmic solution may optionally comprise one or more
   preservatives in order to, for example, reduce or prevent microbial contamination. Exemplary
30 preservatives include quaternary ammonium salts such as polyquaternium-1, cetrimide,

   III. THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS
   [0116]      The invention provides methods of improving vision in a patient using the aqueous
   ophthalmic solutions described herein.
   Methods ofImproving Visual Performance
20 [0117]      One aspect of the invention provides a method of improving visual performance in a
   patient. The method comprises administering to the eye of a patient in need thereof an
   effective amount of an aqueous ophthalmic solutions described herein, such as an aqueous
   ophthalmic solution described in Section II, to improve visual performance in the patient.
   [0118]      Visual performance pertains to the patient's overall vision quality and includes a
25 patient's ability to see clearly, as well as ability to distinguish between an object and its
   background. One aspect of visual performance is visual acuity. Visual acuity is a measure of a
   patient's ability to see clearly. Visual acuity can be measured using, for example, a Snellen
   chart, and the visual acuity measurement can be taken under conditions that test low-contrast
   visual acuity or under conditions that test high-contrast visual acuity. Further, the visual acuity
30 measurement can be taken under scotopic conditions, mesopic conditions, and/or photopic
   conditions. Another aspect of visual performance is contrast sensitivity. Contrast sensitivity is

   WO 2014/121027                                                              PCT/US2014/014067
                                               - 30
   a measure of the patient's ability to distinguish between an object and its background. Contrast
   sensitivity can be measured using, for example, a Holladay Automated Contrast Sensitivity
   System. The contrast sensitivity can be measured under various light conditions, including, for
   example, photopic conditions, mesopic conditions, and scotopic conditions, each either with or
 5 without glare. In certain embodiments, the contrast sensitivity is measured under mesopic
   conditions either with or without glare.
   [0119]      In certain embodiments, the improvement in visual performance provided by the
   method is improved visual acuity. In certain embodiments, the improvement in visual
   performance provided by the method is improved visual acuity under scotopic conditions. In
10 certain embodiments, the improvement in visual performance provided by the method is
   improved visual acuity under mesopic conditions. In certain embodiments, the improvement in
   visual performance provided by the method is improved visual acuity under photopic
   conditions. In certain embodiments, the improvement in visual acuity is a two-line
   improvement in the patient's vision as measured using the Snellen chart. In certain other
15 embodiments, the improvement in visual acuity is a one-line improvement in the patient's
   vision as measured using the Snellen chart.
   [0120]      In certain embodiments, the improvement in visual performance provided by the
   method is improved contrast sensitivity. The improvement in contrast sensitivity can be
   measured under various light conditions, such as photopic conditions, mesopic conditions, and
20 scotopic conditions. In certain embodiments, the improvement in visual performance provided
   by the method is improved contrast sensitivity under photopic conditions. In certain
   embodiments, the improvement in visual performance provided by the method is improved
   contrast sensitivity under mesopic conditions. In certain embodiments, the improvement in
   visual performance provided by the method is improved contrast sensitivity under scotopic
25 conditions. Further, contrast sensitivity can be measured in the presence of glare or the absence
   of glare. All combinations of light conditions and glare are contemplated.
   [0121]      Results achieved by the therapeutic methods can be characterized according to the
   patient's improvement in contrast sensitivity. For example, in certain embodiments, the
   improvement in contrast sensitivity is a 10% (or 20%, 30%, 50%, 60%, or 70%) improvement
30 measured under mesopic conditions using the Holladay Automated Contrast Sensitivity
   System. In certain embodiments, the improvement in contrast sensitivity is a 10% (or 20%,

   30%, 50%, 60%, or 70%) improvement measured under photopic conditions using the
   Holladay Automated Contrast Sensitivity System. In certain other embodiments, the
   improvement in contrast sensitivity is at least a 10% (or 20%, 30%, 50%, 60%, or 70%)
   improvement measured under mesopic conditions or scotopic conditions using the Holladay
 5 Automated Contrast Sensitivity System.
   [0122]      In certain other embodiments, the improvement in visual performance provided by
   the method is both (i) improved visual acuity (such as under scotopic conditions, mesopic
   conditions, and/or photopic conditions) and (ii) improved contrast sensitivity (such as under
   scotopic conditions, mesopic conditions, and/or photopic conditions).
10 Methods of Reducing PupilDiameter
   [0123]      One aspect of the invention provides a method of reducing pupil diameter in a
   patient. The method comprises administering to the eye of a patient in need thereof an
   effective amount of an aqueous ophthalmic solution described herein, such as an aqueous
   ophthalmic solution described in Section II, to reduce pupil diameter in a patient.
15 [0124]      The reduction in pupil diameter can be characterized according to, for example, the
   percent reduction in pupil diameter and size of the pupil measured under certain light
   conditions. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the reduction in pupil diameter under

   embodiments, the patient's pupil is reduced to a diameter of about 3 mm to about 5 mm, about
   3 mm to about 6 mm, about 4 mm to about 5 mm, about 4 mm to about 6 mm, or about 4 mm
   to about 7 mm under mesopic conditions due to the aqueous ophthalmic solution. In certain
 5 embodiments, the patient's pupil is reduced to a diameter of about 4 mm to about 6 mm under
   mesopic conditions due to the aqueous ophthalmic solution.
   [0125]      In certain other embodiments, the reduction in pupil diameter under scotopic
   conditions is at least 5% compared to the pupil diameter of the patient under the same scotopic
   conditions but not having received the aqueous ophthalmic solution. In certain other
10 embodiments, the reduction in pupil diameter under scotopic conditions is at least 10%
   compared to the pupil diameter of the patient under the same scotopic conditions but not having
   received the aqueous ophthalmic solution. In certain other embodiments, the patient
   experiences a reduction in pupil diameter of at least 0.5 mm when measured under scotopic
   conditions relative to the diameter of the patient's pupil under the same scotopic conditions but
15 not having received the aqueous ophthalmic solution. In certain other embodiments, the patient
   experiences a reduction in pupil diameter ranging from about 0.6 mm to about 3 mm, about 0.6
   mm to about 2.5 mm, or about 0.6 mm to about 2 mm when measured under scotopic
   conditions relative to the diameter of the patient's pupil under the same scotopic conditions but
   not having received the aqueous ophthalmic solution. In certain other embodiments, the patient
20 experiences a reduction in pupil diameter ranging from about 0.6 mm to about 1.2 mm when
   measured under scotopic conditions relative to the diameter of the patient's pupil under the
   same scotopic conditions but not having received the aqueous ophthalmic solution. In yet other
   embodiments, the patient's pupil is reduced to a diameter of about 3 mm to about 5 mm, about
   3 mm to about 6 mm, about 4 mm to about 5 mm, about 4 mm to about 6 mm, or about 4 mm
25 to about 7 mm under scotopic conditions due to the aqueous ophthalmic solution. In certain
   embodiments, the patient's pupil is reduced to a diameter of about 4 mm to about 6 mm under
   scotopic conditions due to the aqueous ophthalmic solution.
   Methods of Reducing Aberrant Focus of Scattered Light Ravs
   [0126]      One aspect of the invention provides a method of reducing an aberrant focus of
30 scattered light rays in a patient's eye. The method comprises administering to the eye of a
   patient in need thereof an effective amount of an aqueous ophthalmic solution, such as an

   WO 2014/121027                                                               PCT/US2014/014067
                                              - 33
   aqueous ophthalmic solution described in Section II, to reduce aberrant focus of scattered light
   rays in the patient's eye.
   General Considerationsfor Therapeutic Methods
   [0127]      The aqueous ophthalmic solution can be administered according to a dosing
 5 regimen.    For example, in certain embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution is
   administered at the bedtime of the patient.
   [0128]      The therapeutic method can be further characterized according to the incidence and
   severity of any adverse side effects associated with administration of the aqueous ophthalmic
   solution to the patient. Desirably the aqueous ophthalmic solution provides a therapeutic
10 benefit (e.g., improvement in visual performance) while minimizing the impact and/or
   occurrence of any adverse side effects, such as eye redness sometimes associated with
   administration of the aqueous ophthalmic solution to the eye of a patient. The degree of eye
   redness can be evaluated and characterized using procedures described in the literature, such as
   the Cornea and Contact Lens Research Unit (CCLRU) Redness Grading Scale developed by
15 the School of Optometry, University of New South Wales. See, for example, Terry et al. in
   Optom. Vis. Sci. (1993) vol. 70, pages 234-243; and Pult et al. in Ophthal. Physiol. Opt. (2008)
   vol. 28, pages 13-20. The CCLRU Redness Grading Scale evaluates eye redness on a four
   point scale: (0) no eye redness, (1) very slight eye redness, (2) slight eye redness, (3) moderate
   eye redness, and (4) severe eye redness.
20 [0129]      In certain embodiments, the method results in an increase in eye redness of no more
   than two grades measured by the CCLRU Redness Grading Scale. In certain embodiments, the
   method results in an increase in eye redness of no more than three grades measured by the
   CCLRU Redness Grading Scale. In certain embodiments, the method results in an increase in
   eye redness of no more than one grade when measured using the CCLRU Redness Grading
25 Scale eight hours after administration of the aqueous ophthalmic solution. In certain
   embodiments, the method results in an increase in eye redness of no more than one grade when
   measured using the CCLRU Redness Grading Scale six hours after administration of the
   aqueous ophthalmic solution. In certain embodiments, the method results in an increase in eye
   redness of no more than two grades when measured using CCLRU Redness Grading Scale two
30 hours after administration of the aqueous ophthalmic solution. In certain other embodiments,
   any eye redness in the patient due to administration of the aqueous ophthalmic solution has

   subsided within eight hours after administration of the aqueous ophthalmic solution to the
   patient. In certain other embodiments, any eye redness in the patient due to administration of
   the aqueous ophthalmic solution has subsided within six hours after administration of the
   aqueous ophthalmic solution to the patient.
 5 [0130]       The therapeutic method can also be characterized according to the magnitude of the
   improvement in visual acuity afforded by the aqueous ophthalmic solution. For example, in
   certain embodiments, the method results in an improvement in visual acuity characterized by at
   least a two-line improvement in the patient's vision measured using a Snellen chart.
   [0131]       In certain embodiments, the patient is a human.
10 [0132]       In certain embodiments, the aqueous ophthalmic solution is one of the generic or
   specific aqueous ophthalmic solutions described in Section II.
   [0133]       The description above describes multiple embodiments relating to therapeutic
   methods using aqueous ophthalmic solution. The patent application specifically contemplates
   all combinations of the embodiments. For example, the invention contemplates improving
15 visual acuity under scotopic conditions using an aqueous ophthalmic solution comprising
   phentolamine mesylate.
   Additional Considerations
   [0134]       Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the aqueous ophthalmic solution of
   this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is
20 effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and
   mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient.
   [0135]       The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the
   activity of the aqueous ophthalmic solution of the present invention employed or salt thereof,
   the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion or metabolism of
25 the particular compound being employed, the rate and extent of absorption, the duration of the
   treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the aqueous
   ophthalmic solution employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical
   history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.
   [0136]       A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine
30 and prescribe the effective amount of the aqueous ophthalmic solution required. For example,

   WO 2014/121027                                                               PCT/US2014/014067
                                                 - 35
   the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the aqueous ophthalmic solution at levels
   lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase
   the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.
   [0137]       If desired, the effective daily dose of the aqueous ophthalmic solution may be
 5 administered as one or two sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals
   throughout the day (or week), optionally, in unit dosage forms.
   IV. KITS FOR USE IN MEDICAL APPLICATIONS
   [0138]       Another aspect of the invention provides a kit for medical therapy The kit
   comprises: i) instructions for improving vision in a patient, such as improving visual
10 performance); and ii) an aqueous ophthalmic solution described herein. The kit may comprise
   one or more unit dosage forms containing an amount of the aqueous ophthalmic solution
   described herein effective for improving vision in the patient.
   [0139]       The description above describes multiple aspects and embodiments of the invention,
   including aqueous ophthalmic solutions, methods of using the aqueous ophthalmic solutions,
15 and kits. The patent application specifically contemplates all combinations and permutations of
   the aspects and embodiments.

   [0140]       The invention now being generally described, will be more readily understood by
   reference to the following example, which is included merely for purposes of illustration of
   certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and is not intended to limit the
20 invention.
   EXAMPLE 1 - STABILITY ANALYSIS OF AQUEOUS SOLUTION CONTAINING 1% (W/V)
   PHENTOLAMINE MESYLATE
   [0141]       The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the stability of aqueous solutions
   containing phentolamine mesylate over a range of temperatures.
25 Experimental Design
   [0142]       Phentolamine mesylate (1.0 % w/v) was obtained from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals.
   The HPLC analytical method for analysis of the formulations was developed by Newport
   Scientific, Inc.

   WO 2014/121027                                                            PCT/US2014/014067
                                               - 36
   [0143]      The assay for API, impurities and degradants was performed using Atlantis HILIC
   4.6 mm x 250 mm x 5 pm column. The injection volume was 10 pL. Mobile phase A: 10 mM
   HCOONH 4 in water (12%). HCOONH 4 (10 mmol, 630 mg) was dissolved in 950 mL water.
   The pH was adjusted to 3.0 by addition of formic acid. The volume was then completed to IL
 5 by adding water (50 mL). Mobile phase B: Acetonitrile (88%). The temperature was 35 'C,
   the flow rate was 1 mL/min, the injection volume was 10 pL, and the sample/standard
   concentration was 100 pg/mL.
   [0144]      Each sample was well shaken and then 0.5 to 1.0 mL were transferred into a clear
   test tube and physical appearance recorded.
10 [0145]      Bottles containing 5.0 mL of 1.0% w/v phentolamine mesylate ophthalmic solution
   were stored at 2-8 'C, 25 'C, 40 'C, and 60 'C. For each tested time point, two bottles were
   used. Before testing, all samples were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature.
   Immediately prior to conducting each test, each sample was vigorously shaken. Then, assay for
   API, impurities and degradants was performed according to the method described above and
15 the physical appearance of the sample was determined. Also, the pH of the sample was
   determined and measured in duplicate to ensure that there is no drift.
   [0146]      A final report was generated upon completion of the protocol.
   [0147]      Phentolamine mesylate (1.0 % w/v) was tested for stability in water over the course
   of four weeks at the following temperatures: 2-8 'C, 25 'C, 40 'C, and 60 'C.

   IN WATER
   [0150]       The purpose of this experiment was to examine stability of an aqueous solution
   containing phentolamine mesylate (1.0 % w/v) and mannitol (5% w/v) at three temperatures:
 5 2-8 'C, 25'C, and 40 'C. For clarity, the solutions tested in this example did not contain a
   buffer.
   Experimental Design and Methods
   [0151]       Phentolamine mesylate (1.0 % w/v) was obtained from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals.
   The HPLC analytical method for analysis of the formulations was developed by Newport

   disodium EDTA, 5% w/v d-mannitol, 10 mM sodium acetate, and water. Data points for the
   Nova Formulation were taken from Tables VII-IX of the '630 patent.

   [0159]       The terms "Phentolamine Area Percent" and "area percent" refer to an HPLC
   method of determining purity of the recovered phentolamine at each given time point by
   calculating the peak area. It is well known in the art how to calculate area percent.

   containing phentolamine mesylate, mannitol, and EDTA stored at 25 'C.
25 [0163]       As the data in Tables 2A-2F and Figures lA-1B indicated, the solution containing
    1% (w/v) phentolamine mesylate and 5% mannitol is very stable over time as measured by both
   percent initial concentration and area percent. In fact, the formulation has superior stability
   than conventional Nova 25C formulation containing a metal chelator (EDTA). The absence of
   EDTA in the inventive formulation did not have a negative effect on either percentage of initial
30 concentration of phentolamine mesylate or area percent of phentolamine.

   EXAMPLE 3 - STABILITY OF       0.01% W/V AND 2.0% w/V PHENTOLAMINE MESYLATE AND 5%
   w/V MANNITOL IN WATER
 5 [0165]      The purpose of this experiment was to examine the stability of aqueous solutions
   containing 0.01% w/v or 2.0% w/v phentolamine mesylate and 5% w/v mannitol (without a
   buffer) at two temperatures (25 'C and 40 C) to determine if the concentration of
   phentolamine mesylate effects stability.
   Experimental Design and Methods
10 [0166]      Aqueous solutions containing phentolamine mesylate (0.01% or 2 .0% w/v) and
   mannitol (5% w/v) were tested for stability over the course of twelve months at 25 'C and 40
   OC.
   [0167]      The experimental design and methods were substantially similar to those of the
   experiment described in Examples 1 and 2 above.

   solutions tested: (1) solution containing phentolamine mesylate (0.01% w/v) and mannitol
   (abbreviated 0.01% P) stored at 25 'C; (2) solution containing phentolamine mesylate (0.01%
   w/v) and mannitol (abbreviated 0.1% P) stored at 40 'C; (3) solution containing phentolamine

   phentolamine mesylate (2% w/v) and mannitol (abbreviated 2% P) stored at 40 'C.
   [0170]      As the data in Tables 3A-3D and Figures 2A-2B show, there is no significant
   difference in the stability profile between the solutions tested containing 0.01% w/v and 2 .0%
   w/v phentolamine mesylate. The data in Figure 2C shows that the pH of the solutions at 25 'C
10 and 40 'C declined slightly over time. These tested solutions did not include a buffer.
   EXAMPLE 4 - STABILITY OF 1% (W/V) PHENTOLAMINE MESYLATE, 4% (W/V) MANNITOL
   AND 3 mM SODIUM ACETATE BUFFER IN WATER
   [0171]      The purpose of this experiment was to examine whether adding a weak buffer
   further stabilizes the phentolamine mesylate / mannitol solution by preventing or reducing the
15 slight decline in pH over time as observed in non-buffered solutions (See, Examples 2 and 3
   above). Sodium acetate was used as a weak buffer at a concentration of 3 mM. In one tested
   solution, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) was added to the solution. Stability of the
   solutions was tested at three temperatures: 2-8 'C, 25 'C, and 40 'C.
   Experimental Design and Methods
20 [0172]      An aqueous solution containing phentolamine mesylate (1.0 % w/v), mannitol (4 %
   w/v), and sodium acetate buffer (3 mM) with and without HPMC was tested for stability over
   the course of six months at the following temperatures: 2-8 'C, 25 'C, and 40 'C.
   [0173]      The experimental design and methods were substantially similar to those of the
   experiment described in Examples 1 and 2 above.

   conventional Nova formulation at 2-8 'C, 25 'C, and 40 'C. Further, the pH of both buffered
   solutions declines only slightly over time.
   [0180]      In addition, a mildly buffered solution at pH of about 4.8 is closer to the physiologic
   pH of the eye than the strongly buffered Nova formulation (pH of about 3.7-3.8). The
 5 inventive formulations are also more comfortable because the mild buffer permits the rapid
   equilibration of pH in the cornea and does not promote stinging or watering of the eye upon
   application. In contrast, applying a more strongly buffered solution at a pH of about 3.7-3.8
   would cause significant stinging and would not be comfortable for the subject receiving the
   solution.

   mM) and either 0% w/v, 0.5% w/v, or 1% w/v phentolamine mesylate where stored for up to
   twenty-four months at (i) 5 C at ambient relative humidity or (ii) 25 C at 40% relative
   humidity. The ophthalmic solutions were analyzed for appearance, pH, osmolality,
   phentolamine mesylate potency, amount of phentolamine mesylate related substances, amount
15 of particulates, weight loss, and sterility. Experimental results are described below, where the
   abbreviation "RH" refers to relative humidity. The experimental results show that the
   phentolamine mesylate solutions have good stability upon storage for twenty-four months at
   both (i) 5 C at ambient relative humidity and (ii) 25 C at 40% relative humidity.
        A. Appearance
20 [0185]       The appearance of the aqueous ophthalmic solutions and the appearance of the
   containers containing the aqueous ophthalmic solutions were analyzed at time points 1, 3, 6, 9,
    12, 18, and 24 months after the start of the experiment. Except as noted below, the aqueous
   ophthalmic solutions were observed to be clear and colorless at each time point measured:

           40% relative humidity, the solution was clear but slightly brown colored at time points
           18 months and 24 months.
       *   For the 1.0% w/v phentolamine mesylate aqueous ophthalmic solution stored at 25 C at
 5         40% relative humidity, the solution was clear but contained a small brown fleck at the
           12 month time point due to spillage on the neck of the bottle during filing operations
           that fell into the bottle during opening, and thus not indicative of product or container
           failure.
   [0186]        Except as noted below, the container was observed to be intact, with no evidence
10 of leaking or crusting, at each time point measured:
       *   For the 1.0% w/v phentolamine mesylate aqueous ophthalmic solution stored at 25 C at
           40% relative humidity, the container was intact but brown crusting on the bottle was
           observed due to spillage on the neck of the bottle during prior filing operations.
