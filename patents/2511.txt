    AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHING DIFFERENT ASPIRATION LEVELS
                       AND/OR PUMPS TO AN OCULAR PROBE
   [0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Application No. 61/198,626 filed on
   November 7, 2008, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
 5                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   [00021 The present invention relates generally to the field of surgery, and more specifically to
   devices, systems, and methods for treatment of an eye. Exemplary embodiments allow
   enhanced treatment to structures within an eye-by at-leastonce (though more commonly_
   repeatedly or even cyclically) applying different levels and/or types of aspiration to an ocular
10 probe, often such that the aspiration changes during a treatment of a particular eye.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [0003] The present invention is generally related to methods, devices, and systems for
   controlling surgical fluid flows, particularly during treatment of an eye. In exemplary
   embodiments, the invention removes material from within the eye in part by a displacement
15 induced aspiration flow (such as that caused by a peristaltic or other positive displacement
   pump), and in part by a vacuum-induced aspiration flow (such as that caused by a venturi
   pump). Optionally, the aspiration flow may switch between a displacement pump and a
   venturi pump while material is being fragmented and removed from within the eye. While
   the system operator will typically have control over the overall mode of operation throughout
20 a procedure, switching between these two different types of aspiration flow may occur "on
   the-fly" without halting of a corresponding irrigation flow, and without awaiting input from
   the system operator regarding that particular flow change. The material may be removed
   from an anterior or posterior chamber of the eye, such as for phacoemulsification of cataracts,
   treatment of retinal diseases, vitrectomy, and the like.
25 [0004] The optical elements of the eye include both a cornea (at the front of the eye) and a
   lens within the eye. The lens and cornea work together to focus light onto the retina at the
   back of the eye. The lens also changes in shape, adjusting the focus of the eye to vary
   between viewing near objects and far objects. The lens is found just behind the pupil, and
   within a capsular bag. This capsular bag is a thin, relatively delicate structure which
30 separates the eye into anterior and posterior chambers.
                                                    1

   [0005] With age, clouding of the lens or cataracts is fairly common. Cataracts may form in
   the hard central nucleus of the lens, in the softer peripheral cortical portion of the lens, or at
   the back of the lens near the capsular bag.
   [0006] Cataracts can be treated by the replacement of the cloudy lens with an artificial lens.
 5 Phacoemulsification systems often use ultrasound energy to fragment the lens and aspirate
   the lens material from within the capsular bag. This may allow the remaining capsular bag to
   be used for positioning of the artificial lens, and maintains the separation between the anterior
   portion of the eye and the vitreous humour in the posterior chamber of the eye.
   [0007] During cataract surgery and other therapies of the-eye, accurate-control-over the
10 volume of fluid within the eye is highly beneficial. For example, while ultrasound energy
   breaks up the lens and allows it to be drawn into a treatment probe with an aspiration flow, a
   corresponding irrigation flow may be introduced into the eye so that the total volume of fluid
   in the eye does not change excessively. If the total volume of fluid in the eye is allowed to
   get too low at any time during the procedure, the eye may collapse and cause significant
15 tissue damage. Similarly, excessive pressure within the eye may strain and injure tissues of
   the eye.
   [0008] While a variety of specific fluid transport mechanisms have been used in
   phacoemulsification and other treatment systems for the eyes, aspiration flow systems can
   generally be classified in two categories: 1) volumetric-based aspiration flow systems using
20 positive displacement pumps; and 2) vacuum-based aspiration systems using a vacuum
   source, typically applied to the aspiration flow through an ai-liquid interface. Among
   positive displacement aspiration systems, peristaltic pumps (which use rotating rollers that
   press against a flexible tubing to induce flow) are commonly employed. Such pumps provide
   accurate control over the flow volume. The pressure of the flow, however, is less accurately
25 controlled and the variations in vacuum may result in the feel or traction of the handpiece
   varying during a procedure. Peristaltic and other displacement pump systems may also be
   somewhat slow for some procedures. Vacuum rise times tend to be slower for peristaltic
   systems than venturi systems. This may result in an overall sluggish feel to the surgeon.
   Moreover, the ultrasonic vibrations of a phacoemulsification tip may (despite peristaltic
30 aspiration flow into the tip) inhibit the desired fragmentation-inducing engagement between
   the tip and tissue particles.
                                                     2

   [00091 Vacuum-based aspiration systems provide accurate control over the fluid pressure
   within the eye, particularly when combined with gravity-fed irrigation systems. While
   vacuum-based systems can (in some circumstances) result in excessive fluid flows, they may
   have advantages when, for example, it is desired to bring tissue fragments to the probe, or
 5 when removing a relatively large quantity of the viscous vitreous humour from the posterior
   chamber of the eye. Unfortunately, venturi pump and other vacuum-based aspiration flow
   systems are subject to pressure surges during occlusion of the treatment probe, and such
   pressure surges may decrease the surgeon's control over the eye treatment procedure.
   Displacement pump systems are similarly subject to vacuum spikes during and immediately
10 following occlusion of the probe.
   [0010] While there have been prior proposals for multiple pump systems which make use of
   either a positive displacement pump or a vacuum source, the previously proposed systems
   have not been ideal. Hence, to provide surgeons with the benefits of both vacuum-based and
   displacement-based aspiration flows, still further improvements appear desirable. In
15 particular, interrupting a procedure to switch between aspiration systems may be
   inconvenient, and it may be difficult or even impossible to take full advantage (for example)
   of the full potential of combining both vacuum-based and displacement-based aspiration
   flows using prior eye treatment systems.
   {0011] In light of the above, it would be advantageous to provide improved devices, systems,
20 and methods for eye surgery. It would be particularly advantageous if these improvements
   allowed system users to maintain the benefits of vacuum and/or displacement fluid control
   systems when appropriate, and without having to interrupt the procedure to manually switch
   pumps, change handpieces or other system components, or the like. Ideally, these improved
   systems would provide benefits beyond those of peristaltic or venturi systems alone, such as
25 combination peristaltic/venturi systems, without delaying the procedure or increasing the
   complexity of the operation to the system operator.
                              BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

   irrigation port of the probe while applying the low flow-rate aspiration, transitioning from the
25 low flow rate aspiration to a high flow-rate aspiration from a second pump to the aspiration
   port, and transitioning from the low flow-rate irrigation to a high flow-rate irrigation while
   transitioning from the low flow-rate aspiration to the high flow-rate aspiration.

   the irrigation rate according to the pump rates. The pump system may comprise multiple
   pumps, including a first pump and second pump.
 5  [0017] Yet another embodiment of the invention may include a method for applying
   aspiration to a probe. The method may be computer implemented. The method may include
   applying a aspiration flow-rate first pump to a probe to achieve a first level flow-rate,
   tracking a vacuum level to control aspiration of probe, setting a threshold vacuum level,
   switching from the first level flow-rate to a second level flow-rate from a second pump, and
1o tracking now rate to conroi ine aspiration oi tme proe wuen       Mtnresnoiu vacuum 1eve1 Is

   maintaining the same flow-rate.
    [0018] Yet another embodiment of the invention may include a system for removing material
    from within an eye. The system may include a probe having a distal tip insertable into the
15  eye, wherein the tip comprises an aspiration port, and a console coupled with/to the port
    along an aspiration pathway, wherein the console comprises a processor and a pump system
    for providing a first pump rate and a second pump rate higher than the first pump rate.
    Further, the processor is configured to automatically switch from the first pump rate to the
    second pump rate and control aspiration of the probe by tracking a vacuum level up to a
20 threshold, and control aspiration of the probe by tracking a flow rate of the probe when the
    threshold has been passed. The pump system may comprise multiple pumps, including a first
    pump and a second pump.
    [0019] Yet another embodiment of the invention may a include a phacoemulsification

                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   [0035] FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary phacoemulsification/vitrectomy system 100 in a
15 functional block diagram to show the components and interfaces for a safety critical medical
   instrument system that may be employed in accordance with an aspect of the present
   invention. A serial communication cable 103 connects GUI host 101 module and instrument
   host 102 module for the purposes of controlling the surgical instrument host 102 by the GUI
   host 101. GUI host 101 and instrument host 102, as well as any other component of system
20 100, may be connected wirelessly. Instrument host 102 may be considered a computational
   device in the arrangement shown, but other arrangements are possible. An interface
   communications cable 120 is connected to instrument host 102 module for distributing
   instrument sensor data 121, and may include distribution of instrument settings and
   parameters information, to other systems, subsystems and modules within and external to
25 instrument host 102 module. Although shown connected to the instrument host 102 module,
   interface communications cable 120 may be connected or realized on any other subsystem
   (not shown) that could accommodate such an interface device able to distribute the respective
   data.
    [0036] A switch module associated with foot pedal 104 may transmit control signals relating
30 internal physical and virtual switch position information as input to the instrument host 102
   over serial communications cable 105 (although foot pedal 104 may be connected wireless,
                                                   7

   e.g. Bluetooth, IR). Instrument host 102 may provide a database file system for storing
   configuration parameter values, programs, and other data saved in a storage device (not
   shown). In addition, the database file system may be realized on the GUI host 101 or any
   other subsystem (not shown) that could accommodate such a file system. The foot pedal
 5 system (104) can be configured as dual linear. In this configuration, the surgeon can dictate
   the system to operate with the peristaltic pump in the traditional pitch and add the venturi
   vacuum with the yaw mechanism. This will allow a surgeon the control of peristaltic
   operation with the added efficiency of venturi operation. The foot pedal 104 can also
   combine longitudinal cutting modes with a certain pump and non-longitudinal cutting modes
10     transversaltorsionyetcwith a differentpum-p fortanpl;theftpedalpitblid
   (U:5;
   control a peristaltic pump with longitudinal ultrasonic cutting, and the yaw could control the
   venturi pump with non-longitudinal cutting. The foot pedal can also be configured to operate
   using a certain pump by yawing to the left and operate a second pump by yawing to the right.
   This gives the user the ability to switch-on-the-fly without accessing the user interface which
15 may be timely and cumbersome. Control of one or more pumps may be programmed to the
   pitch and/or yaw directional movement of a treadle of foot pedal 104 and/or to any switch
   located on foot pedal 104
   [0037] The phacoemulsification/vitrectomy system 100 has a handpiece 110 that includes a
   needle and electrical means, typically a piezoelectric crystal, for ultrasonically vibrating the
20 needle. The instrument host 102 supplies power on line 111 to a
   phacoemulsification/vitrectomy handpiece 1 10. An irrigation fluid source 112 can be fluidly
   coupled with/to handpiece 110 through line 113. The irrigation fluid and ultrasonic power
   are applied by handpiece 110 to an eye, or affected area or region, indicated diagrammatically
   by block 114. Alternatively, the irrigation source may be routed to eye 114 through a
25 separate pathway independent of the handpiece. Aspiration is provided to eye 114 by one or
   more pumps (not shown), such as a peristaltic pump, via the instrument host 102, through
   lines 115 and 116. A surgeon/operator may select an amplitude of electrical pulses either
   using the handpiece, foot pedal, via the instrument host and/or GUI host, and/or by voice
   command.
30 [0038] The instrument host 102 generally comprises at least one processor board. Instrument
   host 102 may include many of the components of a personal computer, such as a data bus, a
   memory, input and/or output devices (including a touch screen (not shown)), and the like.
   Instrument host 102 will often include both hardware and software, with the software
                                                    8

   typically comprising machine readable code or programming instructions for implementing
   one, some, or all of the methods described herein. The code may be embodied by a tangible
   media such as a memory, a magnetic recording media, an optical recording media, or the like.
   A controller (not shown) may have (or be coupled with/to) a recording media reader, or the
 5 code may be transmitted to instrument host 102 by a network connection such as an internet,
   an intranet, an Ethernet, a wireless network, or the like. Along with programming code,
   instrument host 102 may include stored data for implementing the methods described herein,
   and may generate and/or store data that records parameters reflecting the treatment of one or
   more patients.
10 [0039} In combination with phacoemulsiflcation system 100, the present system enables
   aspiration, venting, or reflux functionality in or with the phacoemulsification system and may
   comprise components including, but not limited to, a flow selector valve, two or more pumps,
   a reservoir, and a collector, such as a collection bag or a device having similar functionality.
   The collector in the present design collects aspirant from the ocular surgical procedure.
15  [0040] FIG. 2A illustrates an exemplary surgical cassette system in a functional block
   diagram that shows the components and interfaces that may be employed in accordance with
    an aspect of the present design. An irrigation source 46 of, and/or controlled by, instrument
   host 102 optionally provides irrigation fluid pressure control via an irrigation line 51 by
   relying at least in part on a gravity pressure head that varies with a height of an irrigation
20  fluid bag or the like. An irrigation on/off pinch valve 48 may generally include a short
    segment of a flexible conduit of cassette 16A, which can be engaged and actuated by an
    actuator of the instrument host 102, with a surface of the cassette body often being disposed
    opposite the actuator to facilitate closure of the conduit lumen. Alternative irrigation flow
    systems may include positive displacement pumps, alternative fluid pressurization drive
25  systems, fluid pressure or flow modulating valves, and/or the like.
     [0041] In certain embodiments, irrigation fluid is alternatively or additionally provided to a
    separate handpiece (not shown). The aspiration flow network 50 generally provides an
    aspiration flow path 52 that can couple an aspiration port in the tip of handpiece 110 to either
    a peristaltic pump 54, formed by engagement of cassette 16A with instrument host 102,
30  and/or a holding tank 56. Fluid aspirated through the handpiece 110 may be contained in
    holding tank 56 regardless of whether the aspiration flow is induced by peristaltic pump 54 or
    the vacuum applied to the holding tank 56 via pump 57. When pinch valve 58 is closed and
                                                      9

   peristaltic pump 54 is in operation, pumping of the aspiration flow may generally be directed
   by the peristaltic pump 54, independent of the pressure in the holding tank 56. Conversely,
   when peristaltic pump 54 is off, flow through the peristaltic pump may be halted by pinching
   of the elastomeric tubing arc of the peristaltic pump by one or more of the individual rollers
 5 of the peristaltic pump rotor. Hence, any aspiration fluid drawn into the aspiration network
   when peristaltic pump 54 is off will typically be effected by opening of a pinch valve 58 so
   that the aspiration port of the probe is in fluid communication with the holding tank.
   Regardless, the pressure within tank 56 may be maintained at a controlled vacuum level,
   often at a fixed vacuum level, by a vacuum system 59 of instrument host 102.
10 [0042] Vacuum system 59 may comprise a Venturi pump 57, a rotary vane pump, a vacuum
   source, a vent valve 44, a filter and/or the like. Aspiration flow fluid that drains into holding
   tank 56 may be removed by a peristaltic drain pump 60 and directed to a disposal fluid
   collection bag 62. Vacuum pressure at the surgical handpiece 110 may be maintained within
   a desired range through control of the fluid level in the holding tank. In particular, peristaltic
15 drain pump 60 enables the holding tank 56 to be drained including, while vacuum-based
   aspiration continues using vacuum system 59. In more detail, the operation of aspiration flow
   network 50 can be understood by first considering the flow when pinch valve 58 is closed. In
   this mode, peristaltic pump 54 draws fluid directly from handpiece 110, with a positive
   displacement peristaltic pump flow rate being controlled by a system controller. To
20 determine the appropriate flow rate, the level of vacuum within the aspiration flow network
   may be identified in part with reference to a vacuum sensor 64 with three ports disposed
   along the aspiration flow network 50 between peristaltic pump 54, handpiece 110, and pinch
   valve 58. This allows the system to detect and adjust for temporary occlusions of the
   handpiece 110 and the like. Venting or reflux of the handpiece 110 in this state may be
25  achieved by reversing the rotation of peristaltic pump 54 or by opening pinch valve 58 to
    equalize fluid pressures. Pinch valve 58 may be configured as a variable restrictor to regulate
    the amount of fluid that is vented and/or refluxed from the high pressure side of peristaltic
    pump 54 to the low pressure side. In this mode, while the aspiration material flows through
    holding tank 56 and eventually into collection bag 62, the holding tank pressure may have
30  little or no effect on the flow rate. When peristaltic pump 54 is not in operation, rotation of
    the peristaltic pump may be inhibited and the rotors of the peristaltic pump generally pinch
    the arcuate resilient tubing of the probe so as to block aspiration flow. Material may then be
    drawn into the aspiration port of handpiece 110 by opening pinch valve 58 and engagement
                                                     10

   or operation of the vacuum system 59. When valve 58 is open, the aspiration port draws fluid
   therein based on the pressure differential between holding tank 56 and the chamber of the eye
   in which the fluid port is disposed, with the pressure differential being reduced by the total
   pressure loss of the aspiration flow along the aspiration path between the tank and port. In
 5 this mode, venting or reflux of the handpiece 110 may be accomplished by opening the
   solenoid vent valve 44, which pressurizes the holding tank 56 to increase the tank pressure
   and push fluid back towards (i.e., "vents") the tubing and/or handpiece 110.
   [0043] In some embodiments, the vent valve 44 may be used to increase the pressure inside
   the tank 56 to at or near atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, venting of the handpiece 110
10 may be accomplished in this mode by closing pinch valve 58, and by rotation peristaltic
   pump 54 in reverse (e.g., clockwise in FIG. 2A). Accordingly, aspiration network 50 allows
   system 100 to operate in either flow-based (e.g. peristaltic) and/or vacuum-based (e.g.
   Venturi) pumping modes and to incorporate three different venting modes. In some
   embodiments, an additional valve is added that may be used to fluidly couple the irrigation
15 line 51 to the aspiration flow network 50, thus providing an addition option for venting or
   refluxing the handpiece 110.
   [0044] FIG. 2B illustrates another exemplary surgical cassette system in a functional block
   diagram that shows the components and interfaces that may be employed in accordance with
   an aspect of the present design.
20 [0045] The present design effectively splits the aspiration line from handpiece 110 into at
   least two separate fluid pathways where one is connected to collector 206 and the other to the
   air/fluid reservoir 204, which is also connected to collector 206. Splitting the fluid pathways
   in this way allows one line designated for vacuum regulated aspiration, venting, and/or reflux
   and the other line designated for peristaltic aspiration, venting, and/or reflux. However, the
25 aspiration line, or the at least two separate fluid pathways may be connected with air/fluid
   reservoir 204. The vacuum regulated aspiration line 226 connects to reservoir 204, wherein
   fluid may be aspirated, vented, and/or refluxed to or from reservoir 204 through the line 226.
   The peristaltic line connects directly to the collector and aspirates, vents, and/or refluxes
   through the aspiration line 223, 225 without requiring a connection to reservoir 204.
30 [0046] Surgical cassette venting system 200 may include a fluid vacuum sensor 201, flow
   selector valve 202, reservoir 204, collector 206, and fluid pathways, such as interconnecting
   surgical tubing, as shown in FIG. 2B. The cassette arrangement 250 may include connections
                                                     11

   to facilitate easy attachment to and removal from the instrument host 102 as well as
   handpiece t 10 and vacuum pump arrangement 207. The present design contemplates two or
   more pumps, where the surgical cassette arrangement may operate with fluid pathways or
   other appropriate fluid interconnections interfacing with the two or more pumps.
 5 [0047] Cassette arrangement 250 is illustrated in FIG. 2B to simply show components that
   may be enclosed within the cassette. The size and shape of cassette 250 is not to scale nor
   accurately sized, and note that certain components, notably peristaltic pump 203, interface
   with the cassette but in actuality form part of the device which the cassette attaches to,
   Further, more or fewer components may be included in the cassette than are shown in FIG.
10 2A and 2B depending on the circumstances and implementation of the cassette arrangement
   250.
   [0048] Referring to FIG. 2B, handpiece 110 is connected to the input side of fluid vacuum
   sensor 201, typically by fluid pathways such as fluid pathway 220. The output side of fluid
   vacuum sensor 201 is connected to flow selector valve 202 within cassette arrangement 250
15 via fluid pathway 221. The present design may configure flow selector valve 202 to interface
   between handpiece 110, balanced saline solution (BSS) fluid bottle 112, pump 203, which is
   shown as a peristaltic pump but may be another type of pump, and reservoir 204. In this
   configuration, the system may operate flow selector valve 202 to connect handpiece I10 with
   BSS fluid bottle 112, reservoir 204 or with pump 203 based on signals received from
20 instrument host 102 resulting from the surgeon's input to GUI host 101.
   [00491 The flow selector valve 202 illustrated in FIG. 2B provides a single input port and
   may connect port '0' to one of three available ports numbered '1', '2', and '3'. The present
   design is not limited to one flow selector valve, and may be realized using two flow selector
   valves each having at least two output ports, possibly connected together to provide the
25 functionality described herein. For example, a pair of two output port valves may be
   configured in a daisy chain arrangement, where the output port of a first valve is directly
   connected to the input port of a second valve. The instrument host may operate both valves
   together to provide three different flow configurations. For example, using two valves, valve
   one and valve two, valve one may use output port one, which is the supply for valve two.
30 Valve two may connect to one of two ports providing two separate paths. When valve one
   connects its input port to its second output port rather than the output port that directs flow to
   the second valve, a third path is provided.
                                                    12

   [0050] Thus while a single flow selector valve 202 is illustrated in FIG. 2B, it is to be
   understood that this illustration represents a flow selector valve arrangement, including one
   or more flow selector valves performing the functionality described herein, and is not limited
   to a single device or a single flow selector valve. It is also contemplated that flow selector
 5 valve 202 may be a pinch valve or multiple pinch valves as shown in figure 2A, and for
   example as shown in co-assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 11/937,456, the entirety of
   which is incorporated by reference herein. It is also contemplated that flow selector valve
   202 and fluid vacuum sensor 201 may be a single unit, e.g. fluid vacuum sensor 201 may
   comprise or be a part of flow selector valve 202.
10 [0051] It is also envisioned that flow selector valve 202 may be or comprise one or more
   pinch valves. The one or more pinch valves may be located along fluid pathway 221 and/or
   223, or any other fluid pathway as discussed herein. Further, there may be one or more fluid
   pathways couples with handpiece 110 and extending to various components of cassette
   arrangement 250, including a first fluid pathway from fluid vacuum sensor 201 to collector
15 206 via pump 203 and/or a second fluid pathway to reservoir 204. In another embodiment,
   fluid pathway 220 is a single fluid pathway that couples with fluid vacuum sensor 20 1. From
   fluid vacuum sensor 201, the single fluid pathway 220 may divide into two fluid pathways,
   one to collector 206 via pump 203 and one to reservoir 204. Further, one or more pinch
   valves and/or flow selector valve 202 may be located along the fluid pathway between fluid
20 vacuum sensor 201 and collector 206 and/or between fluid vacuum sensor 201 and reservoir
   204.
   [0052] The present design's fluid vacuum sensor 201, for example a strain gauge or other
   suitable component, may communicate or signal information to instrument host 102 to
   provide the amount of vacuum sensed in the handpiece fluid pathway 220. Instrument host
25 102 may determine the actual amount of vacuum present based on the communicated
   information.
   [0053] Fluid vacuum sensor 201 monitors vacuum in the line, and can be used to determine
   when flow should be reversed, such as encountering a certain pressure level (e.g. in the
   presence of an occlusion), and based on values obtained from the fluid vacuum sensor 201,
30 the system may control selector valve 202 and the pumps illustrated or open the line to reflux
   from irrigation. It is to be understood that while components presented in FIG. 2B and other
   drawings of the present application are not shown connected to other system components,
                                                    13

   such as instrument host 102, but are in fact connected for the purpose of monitoring and
   control of the components illustrated. Flow selector valve 202 and fluid vacuum sensor 201
   may also exist as a single unit.
   [0054] With respect to fluid vacuum sensor 201, emergency conditions such as a dramatic
 5 drop or rise in pressure may result in a type of fail-safe operation. The present design
   employs fluid vacuum sensor 201 to monitor the vacuum conditions and provide signals
   representing vacuum conditions to the system such as via instrument host 102 for the purpose
   of controlling components shown including, but not limited to flow selector valve 202 and
   the pumps shown. Alternative embodiments may include flow sensors (not shown).
10 [0055] Multiple aspiration and ventilation options are available in the design of FIG. 2B. In
   the arrangement where the selector valve 202 connects handpiece 110 with BSS bottle 112,
   the present design allows for venting of fluid from BSS bottle 112 to eye 114 as indicated by
   directional flow arrow 'Z' 236 and arrow 'A' 222 in FIG. 2B. In the arrangement where the
   flow selector valve 202 connects handpiece 110 with peristaltic pump 203, the present design
15 may allow for aspiration from eye 114 directly to collector 206 as indicated by flow indicated
   in the directions of 'X' 238, arrow B 242, and arrow E at 232 as illustrated in FIG. 2B.
   Reversing direction of pump 203 can result in venting and/or refluxing.
   [0056] In the arrangement where the cassette system flow selector valve 202 connects
   handpiece 110 with reservoir 204, the present design allows for aspiration from eye 114
20 directly to reservoir 204 as indicated by directional flow arrow 'X' 238, and arrow C 240 in
   FIG. 2B. Arrows/directions 238, 242, and 232 illustrate the flow of fluid for peristaltic
   pumping. Arrow 224 indicates the direction of operation for peristaltic pump 203 where fluid
   originating at handpiece 110 is pumped through line 223 toward line 225 during aspiration.
   Arrows/directions 238 and 240 illustrate the flow of fluid for venturi pumping.
25 [0057] Although venting is shown from BSS bottle 112, venting and/or irrigation is not
   represented in FIG. 2B via the pumps. However, the present design may allow for venting
   and/or reflux using the pumps associated with the cassette where the arrows in FIG. 2B are
   reversed; for example, indicating pump 203 is reversed or operates in a counter-clockwise
   direction. In this arrangement, the design may effectively split the aspiration line from the
30 handpiece into two distinct lines, one arranged for peristaltic operation and the second line
   arranged for vacuum regulated operation via an air/fluid reservoir.
                                                   14

   [00581 Reservoir 204 may contain air in section 211 and fluid in section 212. Surgical
   cassette system 200 may connect reservoir 204 with collector 206 using fluid pathways, such
   as surgical tubing or similar items. In this arrangement, pump 205 may operate in a
   clockwise direction in the direction of arrow 228 to remove fluid from the reservoir 204
 5 through fluid pathway 227 and deliver the fluid to collector 206 using fluid pathway 229.
   The present design illustrates a peristaltic pump as pump 205, a component within instrument
   host 102, but other types of pumps may be employed. This configuration may enable the
   surgical cassette 200 to remove unwanted fluid and/or material from reservoir 204.
   [0059] The fluid pathways or flow segments of surgical cassette system 200 may include the
10 fluid connections, for example flexible tubing, between each component represented with
   solid lines in FIG. 2B.
   [00601 Vacuum pump arrangement 207 is typically a component within instrument host 102,
   and may be connected with reservoir 204 via fluid pathway or flow segment 230. In the
   configuration shown, vacuum pump arrangement 207 includes a pump 208, such as a venturi
15 pump and an optional pressure regulator 209 (and valve (not shown)), but other
   configurations are possible. In this arrangement, vacuum pump arrangement 207 may
   operate to remove air from the top of reservoir 204 and deliver the air to atmosphere (not
   shown). Removal of air from reservoir 204 in this manner may reduce the pressure within
   the reservoir, which reduces the pressure in the attached fluid pathway 226, to a level less
20 than the pressure within eye 114. A lower reservoir pressure connected through flow selector
   valve 202 may cause fluid to move from the eye, thereby providing aspiration. The vacuum
   pump arrangement 207 and reservoir 204 can be used to control fluid flow into and out of
   reservoir 204. Vacuum pump arrangement 207 may also be used to vent the aspiration line to
   air by opening a valve to the venturi pump.
25  [0061] The optional pressure regulator 209 may operate to add air to the top of reservoir 204
   which in turn increases pressure and may force the air-fluid boundary 213 to move
   downward. Adding air into reservoir 204 in this manner may increase the air pressure within
   the reservoir, which increases the pressure in the attached fluid aspiration line 226 to a level
   greater than the pressure within eye 114. A higher reservoir pressure connected through flow
30 selector valve 203 may cause fluid to move toward eye 114, thereby providing venting or
   reflux.
                                                    15

   100621 An alternate method of creating positive pressure in reservoir 204 is running pump
   205 in a counter-clockwise direction. Running pump 205 in a counter-clockwise direction
   will increase the amount of air in section 211 in reservoir 204.
   [0063] It is to be noted that higher pressure in reservoir 204 causes more fluid flow and
 5 potentially more reflux from reservoir 204 to handpiece 110. If the lines from the reservoir
   204 are plugged or otherwise occluded, providing pressure to reservoir 204 can result in
   venting and/or reflux. Venting in this context results in the release of pressure. Reflux
   occurs when a pump is reversed sending fluid in the opposite direction of normal flow (e.g.
   toward the eye). In a reflux condition, the surgeon can control the amount of fluid flowing
10 back through the fluid pathways and components.
   [00641 The present design may involve peristaltic operation, aspirating fluid from eye 114 to
   collector 206 illustrated in FIG. 2B, or venting fluid to the eye 114 to reduce the amount of
   pressure in the aspiration line (where such venting is only shown from BSS bottle 112 in FIG.
   2). Peristaltic pumping is generally understood to those skilled in the art, and many current
15 machines employ peristaltic and/or venturi pumps as the vacuum or pressure sources.
   Generally, a peristaltic pump has fluid flowing through a flexible tube and a circular rotor
   with a number of rollers attached to the periphery of the circular rotor. As the rotor turns,
   fluid is forced through the tube. Venturi pumping, or pressure or aspiration or aspirator
   pumping, produces the vacuum using the venturi effect by providing fluid through a
20 narrowing tube. Because of the narrowing of the tube, the speed at which the fluid travels
   through the tube increases and the fluid pressure decreases (the "Venturi effect"). As may be
   appreciated, operating pumps in one direction or another can change the pressure and the
   operation of the associated device, such as the operation of the cassette in the present design.
   [0065] FIG. 3 is a functional block diagram illustrating a surgical cassette system configured
25 for venting using a balanced saline solution (BSS) bottle in accordance with an aspect of the
   present design.
   [0066] In the arrangement where the flow selector valve 202 connects handpiece 110 with
   BSS bottle 112, the present design may allow for venting of fluid to eye 114 directly from
   BSS bottle 112 and/or the line between flow selector valve 202 and BSS bottle 112, where
30 fluid from BSS bottle 112 and/or the line flows toward and through flow selector valve 202.
   The fluid flow continues to flow toward and through flow selector valve 202 in the direction
   indicated by arrow 321. In order to vent from BSS bottle 112, instrument host 102 may
                                                   16

   signal flow selector valve 202 to connect port '0' to port  41'. When the flow selector valve
   202 switches to position '1,' fluid may flow from BSS bottle 112 and/or the line between
   BSS bottle 112 and flow selector valve 202 to handpiece 110 as indicated by directional
   arrows 322 and 321 as shown in FIG. 3. During fluid venting from bottle 112 and/or the line
 5 between BSS bottle 112 and flow selector valve 202, the present design may arrange the
   bottle position at an elevated height relative to the eye 114, thus realizing a positive pressure
   source.
   [0067] FIG. 4 is a functional block diagram illustrating a surgical cassette system 400
   configured for normal peristaltic aspiration. The present design may configure flow selector
10 valve 202 to connect handpiece 110 to pump 203 and may operate selector valve 202 to
   connect fluid pathway 421 at port '0' to fluid pathway 422 at port '3' of flow selector valve
   202. In this aspiration configuration, reservoir 204 is not employed. As pump 203 operates
   in a clockwise direction to pump fluid in the direction shown by arrow 424, the present
   design aspirates fluid from eye 114 to collector 206 following the path formed by connecting
15 fluid pathway 420 from the handpiece to fluid vacuum sensor 201, continuing through fluid
   pathway 421 toward the flow selector valve 202 where a fluid line is connected from flow
   selector valve 202 to pump 203 and moving fluid in the direction shown by the arrow above
   fluid pathway 422. Clockwise pump operation shown by arrow 423 forces fluid into fluid
   pathway 425 in direction 424 toward collector 206. During an ocular procedure, the surgeon
20 may stop the flow of fluid into the eye by stopping pump 203. When pump 203 is stopped,
   the rollers within the peristaltic pump stop moving and fluid through this path ceases to move
   or flow.
   [0068] FIG. 5 illustrates a surgical cassette system 500 configured for venting and reflux
   operation. The present design may configure flow selector valve 202 to connect handpiece
25 110 to pump 203 from port '3' to port '0'. As the pump 203 operates in a counter-clockwise
   direction as shown by arrow 523, the present design may vent fluid through fluid pathway
   525 in direction of flow arrows at 524, 523, 522, and 521 and ultimately to fluid pathway
   220. Note that in both FIGS. 4 and 5, flow selector valve 202 neither operates to take fluid
   from nor output fluid to reservoir 204.
30 100691 In the configuration of FIG. 5, the system can stop the inflow of fluid from fluid
   pathway 525 to the eye by stopping pump 203 or closing flow selector valve 202, or both.
                                                    17

   The internal volume of fluid pathway 525 has sufficient fluid volume to provide venting
   and/or reflux.
    [00701 The present design may alternately employ vacuum pump arrangement 207 to aspirate
   fluid from eye 114 to reservoir 204 as illustrated in FIG. 6, or applying pressure thus forcing
 5 fluid from reservoir 204 through selector valve 202 and irrigating eye 114 as illustrated in
   FIG. 7.
    [00711 FIG. 6 is a functional block diagram illustrating the system configured for vacuum
   pump arrangement 207 aspiration operation where the present design may operate either in a
   normal venturitaspiration mode to create avacuum-atfluid-pathway 626.-Again, flow
10 selector valve 202 connects handpiece 110 with reservoir 204 from port '2' to port '0'. In
   this aspiration configuration, pump 203 is not in use and typically not operating. Vacuum
   pump arrangement 207 may operate to allow pressure to be removed from reservoir 204
   either by venting to atmosphere or drawing a vacuum. Removing or reducing pressure using
   vacuum pump arrangement 207 may move air-fluid boundary 213 upward at 645 to aspirate
15 fluid from eye 114 to reservoir 204. Again, vacuum pump arrangement 207 may include or
   be attached to a venturi pump or pumping device. The fluid path from eye 114 to reservoir
   204 follows the direction indicated by the arrows above fluid passageway 621 and to the right
   of fluid passageway 626. Optionally, to vent and/or reflux, pressure regulator 209 may be
   used to increase the pressure in reservoir 204 to cause fluid to flow through fluid pathway
20 626 toward handpiece 110 via flow selector valve 202.
    [0072] FIG. 7 is a functional block diagram illustrating a surgical cassette system 700
   configured for venting and/or reflux operation in accordance with an aspect of the present
    invention. The present design may configure flow selector valve 202 to connect handpiece
    110 with reservoir 204 from port '2' to port '0'. Vacuum pump arrangement 207 may
25 operate to provide pressure to reservoir 204 via pressure regulator 209. Applying or
    increasing pressure using pressure regular 209 of vacuum pump arrangement 207 may move
   air-fluid boundary 213 downward in the direction of 745 causing fluid to flow from reservoir
   204 and/or fluid pathway 726 to eye 114.
    [00731 In sum, the present design surgical cassette system provides for aspiration, venting,
30 and/or reflux using pumping operations. A plurality of pumps are typically employed,
    including a first pump and a second pump, where a first pump may be pump 203, shown as a
                                                   18

   peristaltic pump in FIG. 2B, and pump 208, representing a venturi pump in certain
   embodiments shown herein.
   [0074] The instrument host 102 may provide a signal to position or switch flow selector valve
   202 for desired peristaltic or vacuum regulated operation. Aspiration, venting, and/or reflux
 5 may be controlled in various ways, including but not limited to switching offered to the
   surgeon on the instrument host 102, switching via a switch such as one provided on
   handpiece 110 or via a footswitch, or via automatic or semi-automatic operation, wherein
   pressure is sensed at some point, such as coming from the handpiece to the instrument host at
   sensor 201 or separately sensed by a sensor placed in the ocular region with pressure signals
10 being provided to the instrument host 102. In general, automatic or semi-automatic operation
   entails sensing a drop or rise in pressure and either aspirating fluid to or venting fluid from
   the ocular region or eye 114. In any circumstance, the surgeon or other personnel are
   provided with the ability to run the pumps in any available direction, such as for cleaning
   purposes.
15 10075] Other pumping states may be provided as discussed herein and based on the desires of
   personnel performing the surgical procedure. For example, in the case of the surgeon
   desiring aspiration operation as shown in FIG. 6 in all circumstances as opposed to aspiration
   as shown in FIG. 4, the surgeon may enable settings or the instrument host may provide for
   the surgeon to select such operation. Additionally, if the surgeon believes venturi pumping or
20 vacuum regulator operation should be employed wherever possible, she may select that from
   the instrument host. Other configurations may be provided, including limiting ocular
   pressure within a desired range, and so forth.
   [0076] Certain additional functionality or components may be provided in the current design.
   For example, a valve (not shown) may be located between pump 203 and flow selector valve
25 202 or between pump 203 and handpiece 110 in the design, such as in the design of FIG. 3, to
   build a bolus of fluid or build pressure between the valve and pump 203. Such a valve can
   thereby create positive pressure when pump 203, such as a peristaltic pump, reverses
   direction of flow and provides pressure to the valve. This positive pressure can be released
   by opening the valve thereby venting the system.
30 [0077] Referring to FIG. 1, the instrument host 102 will generally include at least one
   processor for processing instructions and sending command signals to other components of
   the system, and memory for storing instructions. The instrument host 102 and GUI host may
                                                   19

   be housed in a console. The instructions generally include methods for operating the system
    100. Methods disclosed herein may be stored as instructions on the memory.
    [00781   FIG. 8 shows a graph 802 which depicts a system switching from a first pump to a
   second pump according to one embodiment of the invention. The system may be the system
 5  100 depicted in FIG. 1. Curve V1 shows the operation of the first pump in terms of aspiration
   level (which may be flow-rate or vacuum level) versus time T. The first pump may be a
   volumetric, e.g. peristaltic or other displacement, pump. The first pump is capable of
   attaining a limited aspiration level, as shown. Curve P1 shows the operation of the second
   pump in terms of aspiration level versus time T. The second pump may be a pressure, e.g.
10 venturi or other pressure differential, pump and capable of a higher aspiration level than the
   first pump. As shown, through cassette arrangement 250, the second pump may begin
   operation while the first pump is operating at its maximum aspiration level, and thus a
   transitional time  TR between the peak aspiration levels is constantly increasing. Note that the
   time for initiating of a newly energized pump may occur before, during, or after a start time
15 of the ramp-down or decreasing of aspiration flow from a previously operating pump.
   Similarly, a complete halt of flow or end of the ramp-down may occur before, during or after
   the end of the ramp-up, so that the transitions shown schematically herein are simplified.
   Also, the ramp-up and ramp-down of aspiration may more accurately be represented by
   curves (rather than single linear slopes). Nonetheless, the ramp-up of the newly employed
20 pump (the second pump) will typically start before the ramp-down of the first pump has been
   completed. Thus, there is typically no time delay between switching of the pumps.
   Automatic switching between pumping systems, without the need for user interaction may be
   applied by automated control of the flow selector valve 202. Switching may occur as a series
   of cycles or pulses, and thus occur over a very short period of time, in some examples having
25 a frequency of a few milliseconds, less than a second, and/or a few seconds. A user may
   preprogram how and/or when switching between multiple pumps occurs.
   [00791 FIG. 9A shows a method 900 for applying aspiration to an eye using a probe (e.g.
   handpiece), according to one embodiment of the invention. Method 900 may be employed on
   the system 100 shown in FIG. 1. When solely using a pressure pump (e.g. a venturi/vacuum
30 type pump) to aspirate an eye, it may be difficult to detect when the probe is occluded by
   sensing vacuum changes when using a pressure pump. This is because the pressure pump
   may be configured to automatically compensate for pressure level, and thus no detectable
   pressure change is available. Method 900 tracks pressure changes from a secondary pump,
                                                  20

   which may be a volumetric pump, to detect occlusions while in a high flow-rate aspiration
   mode. At operation 902 a first pump, operating at a high flow-rate (e.g. high vacuum-rate),
   aspirates via a probe which is in a region of an eye. The probe for example may be a
   phacoemulsification device or a vitrectomy device. The first pump may be a pressure, e.g.
 5 venturi, pump. At operation 904 a second pump, operating at a low-flow rate, also aspirates
   via the probe. The second pump may be a volumetric pump, e.g. a peristaltic pump. At
   operation 906 the vacuum level, or pressure differential, of the second pump is monitored.
   As shown in operation 908, if a vacuum change is not detected via a pressure sensor or
   similar device, then the vacuum level is continuously monitored. If a vacuum change is
10 detected, for exampased                 pressure differential above a base pressure differential,
   then the probe may be determined to be at least partially occluded and thus in contact with
   cataract tissue, as shown in operation 910. Detection of the occlusion-induced pressure
   change may be facilitated by altering or inhibiting operation of the pressure-regulating system
   of the venturi pump in some modes, such as by the use of a check valve to avoid reflux flow
15 from the venturi pump toward the pressure sensor of the cassette.
    [0080] Phacoemulsification probes often work optimally when sufficiently occluded, as the
   ultrasonically energized tip will then be engaged with the tissue targeted for fragmentation.
   Thus, the determination that the probe is at least partially occluded may follow with an
   application of, change and/or adjustment of ultrasonic energy to the probe. Additionally, the
20 first pump may be instructed to be switched off, so that aspiration is performed by the second
   pump only.
    [0081] FIG. 9B shows a graphical depiction of method 900 shown in figure 9A, according to
   one embodiment of the invention. Curves 912 and 914 show the aspiration flows of the first
   pump and second pump, respectively. Curve 916 shows the pressure differential, which is
25 detected from the second pump, which may be a peristaltic pump. Curve dips 912A and
   914A indicate that the probe has been at least partially occluded, resulting in a reduced
   aspiration rate. Simultaneously, an increased pressure differential, shown by curve increase
   916A, shows a detectable response. Accordingly, the increase pressure differential may be
   used to send command signals to various portions of the system.
30  [0082] FIG. 1OA shows a method 1000 for applying aspiration to an eye using a probe,
   according to one embodiment of the invention. Method 1000 may be employed on the
   system 100 shown in FIG. 1. At operation 1010 a first pump, operating at a low flow-rate,
                                                  21

    aspirates via a probe which is in a region of an eye. The first pump may be a volumetric, e.g.
    peristaltic, pump. Additionally, irrigation is also being supplied to the eye using the probe.
    Irrigation may be provided, for example by irrigation fluid source 112. At operation 1020 an
    input is received to switch to a second pump, and increase the aspiration via the probe and
 5  also to increase irrigation. The second pump may be a pressure pump (e.g. venturi pump).
    The signal may be automatically triggered by a command signal generated in response to a
    detected condition, for example by detecting that the probe is not sufficient occluded to
   provide ultrasonic energy to cataract tissue (often per pressure signals generated along the
    aspiration pathway). The signal may also be manually triggered by a user input, for example
10 through the-actuation-of a-foot switch. -Various means-may-be-employed-to-increase-the
    irrigation rate, for example a fluid source may be automatically placed at a higher position
    and/or pressurized infusion may be used. An example of this is shown in co-assigned U.S.
   Patent Application No. 11/937,640, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.
   The fluid source may also be a bagged fluid source and additional pressure, externally or
15  internally, may be automatically applied to increase the irrigation rate. Examples of this are
    shown in U.S. Patent No. 6,491,661, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference
   herein. Additionally, some examples of factors which should be taken into consideration
   when supplying automatic irrigation are phacoemulsification device tip size, and surgical
   technique. These factors may be inputted into the console for consideration by the processor.
20 Thus, fluidic settings (vacuum, aspiration levels) can be limited based on the irrigation level,
   tip gage, and surgical technique. At operation 1030 it is determined if whether the increased
   aspiration rate will exceed the maximum irrigation rate, which would be an undesirable
   condition as the eye may be removed of all fluid. At operation 1040, if the increased
   aspiration rate exceeds the maximum irrigation rate, then the aspiration rate will be
25 automatically decreased to match the irrigation rate, resulting in a balanced fluid supply
   condition in the eye. At operation 1050, if the increased aspiration rate does not exceed the
   maximum irrigation rate, then the aspiration and irrigation rates will increase according to the
   input of operation 1020. Additionally, if the system detects that the probe has been occluded,
   resulting in decreased aspiration, the irrigation rate may be reduced automatically to match.
30 [0083] FIG. lOB shows a graphical depiction of method 1000, shown in FIG. I0A, according
   to one embodiment of the invention. Curves 1060 and 1070 show the aspiration flows of the
   first pump and second pump, respectively. Curve 1080 shows the irrigation flow rate
   supplied to the probe. At curve portion 1080A the irrigation flow rate is increased to match
                                                    22

   the increased aspiration rate of the second pump. At curve portion 1080B, the irrigation flow
   rate is shown at its maximum possible flow rate. Curve portion 1070 shows that the
   maximum aspiration rate has exceeded the maximum irrigation rate, and thus the aspiration
   rate is automatically decreased to compensate, as shown in curve portion 1070A.
 5 [0084] FIG. I lA shows a method 1100 for applying aspiration to an eye using a probe,
   according to one embodiment of the invention. Method 1100 may be employed on system
   100 shown in FIG. 1. In some dual-pump systems, tracking vacuum level for control
   feedback means does not apply in equivalent terms to each pump. For example, 500 mmHg
   of vacuum detected during the operation of a peristaltic pump may result in an aspiration rate
10 which is far lower than that for 500 mmHg detected during the operation of a venturi pump.
   Accordingly, using the same measurement for control feed back for each pump may result in
   a dangerous condition, e.g. the eye running out of fluid and chamber collapse. At operation
    1110 a first pump, operating at a low flow-rate, aspirates through a probe which is in a region
   of an eye. The first pump may be a volumetric, e.g..peristaltic, pump. The vacuum created
15 by the aspiration is tracked to provide feed back control aspects of the probe operation and
   aspiration. At operation 1120 a threshold is set for a maximum vacuum level which is used
   for feedback control purposes. Although only one threshold is shown, there may be multiple
   thresholds set for one, two, or both pumps. At operation 1130, aspiration through the probe is
    switched to a second pump, which increases the aspiration rate to the probe. The second
20 pump may be a pressure pump (e.g. venturi pump). At operation 1140 it is determined
   whether the threshold has been passed. If the threshold has not been passed, then the method
    1100 loops back to operation 1130. If the threshold has been passed, the system switches to
    control tbe probe based on flow rate, which may be calculated from known and measured
    quantities, some examples including tip size, type of procedure, irrigation flow rate, pressure
25  differentials, and actual flow rate. The same flow rate should be at least initially matched
    when switching between pumps. Multiple thresholds may be programmed for one or more
    pumps and/or thresholds may be programmed for a combination of pumps. However,
    measuring flow rate from a flow meter may be difficult because of the interaction of cataract
    particles with a flow meter.
30  [0085] FIG. I1B shows a graphical depiction of method 1100, shown in FIG. I A, according
    to one embodiment of the invention. Curves 1160 and 1170 show the aspiration flows of the
    first pump and second pump, respectively. Curve portion 1190 shows the vacuum being
    tracked for control feedback of the probe. Dotted line 1180 shows the threshold vacuum
                                                   23

level. Curve portion 1190A shows that the threshold has been passed, and accordingly the system
will switch from vacuum feedback based controls to flow-rate based controls.

concurrently filed U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/198,658, entitled

PROBE, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
[0087] It should be noted that the examples disclosed herein may describe low-flow rate pumps

are not limiting to the embodiments disclosed herein, for example high-flow rate peristaltic
pumps may be used in lieu of high flow-rate venturi pumps, and low flow-rate venturi pumps

venturi pump may be used in conjunction with a high flow-rate venturi pump, and a low flow-rate
peristaltic pump may be used in conjunction with a high flow-rate peristaltic pump.
