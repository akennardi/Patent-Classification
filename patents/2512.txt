BACKGROUND
[0003] Solar cells are well known devices for converting solar radiation to electrical energy.
They can be fabricated on a semiconductor wafer using semiconductor processing technology. A
photovoltaic cell or a solar cell includes P-type and N-type diffusion regions. Solar radiation
impinging on the solar cell creates electrons and holes that migrate to the diffusion regions,
thereby creating voltage differentials between the diffusion regions. In a backside contact solar
cell, both the diffusion regions and the metal contact fingers coupled to them are on the backside
of the solar cell. The contact regions and contact fingers allow an external electrical circuit to be
coupled to and be powered by the solar cell. Solar cells can be packaged into a photovoltaic
laminate using various processes and encapsulant materials, where photovoltaic laminates can
be further packaged to into a photovoltaic module. One or more embodiments pertain to
photovoltaic cells or solar cells and photovoltaic laminate fabrication processes.

metal foil to the first solar cell. In some embodiments, the metal bond can include a metal
contact region. Embodiments can also include a backing material on the metal foil and a back
layer on the backing material.

limit the embodiments of the subject matter or the application and uses of such embodiments.
As used herein, the word "exemplary" means "serving as an example, instance, or illustration."
Any implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as
preferred or advantageous over other implementations. Furthermore, there is no intention to be
bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field,
background, brief summary or the following detailed description.

                                                   5
[0019] This specification includes references to "one embodiment" or "an embodiment." The
appearances of the phrases "in one embodiment" or "in an embodiment" do not necessarily refer
to the same embodiment. Particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in
any suitable manner consistent with this disclosure.
[0020] Terminology. The following paragraphs provide definitions and/or context for terms
found in this disclosure (including the appended claims):
[0021] "Comprising." This term is open-ended. As used in the appended claims, this term does
not foreclose additional structure or steps.
[0022] "First," "Second," etc. As used herein, these terms are used as labels for nouns that they
precede, and do not imply any type of ordering (e.g., spatial, temporal, logical, etc.). For
example, reference to a "first" solar cell does not necessarily imply that this solar cell is the first
solar cell in a sequence; instead the term "first" is used to differentiate this solar cell from
another solar cell (e.g., a "second" solar cell).
[0023] "Coupled" - The following description refers to elements or nodes or features being
"coupled" together. As used herein, unless expressly stated otherwise, "coupled" means that one
element/node/feature is directly or indirectly joined to (or directly or indirectly communicates
with) another element/node/feature, and not necessarily mechanically.
[0024] In addition, certain terminology may also be used in the following description for the
purpose of reference only, and thus are not intended to be limiting. For example, terms such as
"upper", "lower", "above", and "below" refer to directions in the drawings to which reference is
made. Terms such as "front", "back", "rear", "side", "outboard", and "inboard" describe the
orientation and/or location of portions of the component within a consistent but arbitrary frame
of reference which is made clear by reference to the text and the associated drawings describing
the component under discussion. Such terminology may include the words specifically
mentioned above, derivatives thereof, and words of similar import.
[0025] Although much of the disclosure is described in terms of photovoltaic laminates and
solar modules that include solar cells for ease of understanding, the disclosed techniques and
structures apply equally to other semiconductor structures (e.g., silicon wafers generally).

                                                   6
[0026] Improvements in metallization techniques for solar cells, photovoltaic laminates and
photovoltaic modules can represent a significant impact in the total fabrication cost and output
yield of a photovoltaic module. Solar cells often require multiple steps in manufacturing to
allow the manufacturing of a high efficiency cell, where reducing the steps can result in
increased manufacturing output yield. Present metallization techniques can also require several
steps. These steps can include performing metal formation processes on solar cells such as
physical deposition processes (PVD), annealing and plating processes. Subsequent to the solar
cell metallization formation processes mentioned, soldering the solar cells can be required to
electrically connect multiple solar cells in a photovoltaic module. Therefore, improving such
techniques and even removing them altogether can result increase in manufacturing output yield
and in significant production cost savings.
[0027] To address the above difficulties, and in place of individually forming metal on a solar
cell and subsequently soldering metal interconnects to the solar cell, embodiments are presented
that involve the use of a metal bond coupling a solar cell to a metal foil and formed in a single
step process. Also, the technique of forming metal on a solar cell and bonding metal
interconnects to the solar cell can be at least a two step process, where the presented
embodiments are formed in a single step process as part of a photovoltaic laminate fabrication.
This and other solutions including similar embodiments are discussed in detail below.
