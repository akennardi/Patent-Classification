[0000]      This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>,
which is a national phase application of PCT Application No. PCT/US2016/042154, filed 13 July
2016, that claims priority from United States Provisional Patent Application No. 62/192059 filed
13 July 2015 and United States Patent Application No. 15/209623 filed 13 July 2016, the
contents of each of which applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
                                         TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]      The present disclosure relates to plates having dynamic elements, otherwise known
as elastic elements.     Plates with dynamic elements may be used to stabilize and apply
continuous load to hard tissues such as bone, or to soft tissues such as cartilage or ligaments.
The present disclosure relates to plates with dynamic elements that provide continuous load
across a joint, a resection, an osteotomy, a fracture, a tear, a laceration, or some other
discontinuity between hard or soft tissue portions. The continuous load may be compressive or
tensile. The present disclosure is made in the context of bone plates for use in the foot, having
various dynamic elements including staples, elbow pegs or L-pegs, and straight pegs. However,
the principles disclosed herein are applicable in locations throughout the body.
                                          BACKGROUND
[0002]      There are many circumstances in which bones, bone fragments, or other tissue
portions must be fused together, united, or otherwise permanently joined. Some examples
include arthrodesis, corrective osteotomy, fracture, tear, or laceration. Bones, bone fragments,
or other tissue portions heal better when they are stabilized with some mechanical load or
stress across the discontinuity, for example when the bones, bone fragments, or other tissue
portions are compressed together or distracted apart. This disclosure describes solutions to the
problem of stabilizing bones, bone fragments, or other tissue portions while applying a
therapeutic level of continuous mechanical load or stress across the discontinuity.
                                           SUMMARY
[0003]      The various systems and methods of the present technology have been developed in
response to the present state of the art, and in particular, in response to the problems and
needs in the art that have not yet been fully solved by currently available fixation systems. The
systems and methods of the present technology may provide a means for dynamic loading
while providing an overall stable construct.
                                                 1

[0004]      To achieve the foregoing, and in accordance with the technology as embodied and
broadly described herein, plate members provide stabilization and/or deformity correction in
conjunction with dynamic elements that provide continuous dynamic load between tissue
portions. The plate members may or may not be used with the dynamic elements. The dynamic
elements may be separate parts that may be attached to the plate members, or they may be
integrally formed with the plate members. The plate members and the dynamic elements may
be made from the same materials or from different materials. The dynamic elements may be
made from any elastic material, preferably a highly elastic metal, preferably a superelastic
metal, preferably nitinol.
[0005]      These and other features and advantages of the present technology will become
more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by
the practice of the technology as set forth hereinafter.

                                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0035]       Exemplary embodiments of the technology will be best understood by reference to
the drawings, wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout. It will be readily
understood that the components of the technology, as generally described and illustrated in
the figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations.
Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the apparatus, system,
and method is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely
representative of exemplary embodiments of the technology.
[0036]       The phrases "connected to," "coupled to" and "in communication with" refer to any
form of interaction between two or more entities, including mechanical, electrical, magnetic,
electromagnetic, fluid, and thermal interaction. Two components may be functionally coupled
to each other even though they are not in direct contact with each other. The term "abutting"
refers to items that are in direct physical contact with each other, although the items may not
necessarily be attached together. The phrase "fluid communication" refers to two features that
are connected such that a fluid within one feature is able to pass into the other feature.
[0037]       The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance, or
illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be
construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. While the various aspects of
the embodiments are presented in drawings, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale
unless specifically indicated.
[0038]       Standard medical planes of reference and descriptive terminology are employed in
this specification. A sagittal plane divides a body into right and left portions. A mid-sagittal
plane divides the body into bilaterally symmetric right and left halves. A coronal plane divides a
body into anterior and posterior portions. A transverse plane divides a body into superior and
                                                  6

inferior portions. Anterior means toward the front of the body. Posterior means toward the
back of the body. Superior means toward the head. Inferior means toward the feet. Medial
means toward the midline of the body. Lateral means away from the midline of the body. Axial
means toward a central axis of the body. Abaxial means away from a central axis of the body.
Ipsilateral means on the same side of the body. Contralateral means on the opposite side of the
body. These descriptive terms may be applied to an animate or inanimate body.
[0039]      In this specification, an elastically deformed state is defined as deformation
equivalent to strain values above 0.2%, for example strain values between 0.2% and 6%. An
elastically deformed state is distinct from the small magnitude of deformation and strain
tolerated by most materials under load.
[0040]      In this specification, a static material, or a static design, or a static component, is
defined as a material, design, or component that tolerates deformation equivalent to no more
than 0.2% strain before experiencing permanent plastic deformation, bending, cracking,
breaking, or other failure mode.
[0041]      Referring to FIGS. 1A-1F, an assembly 100 may include a stabilizing member, a
dynamic element, and one or more fasteners. In assembly 100, the stabilizing member may be
a bone plate 102, the dynamic element may be a staple 104, and the fasteners may be screws.
Assembly 100 is illustrated with locking screws 106 on the left and non-locking screws 108 on
the right.
[0042]      The bone plate 102 has an obverse side 112 and a reverse side 114. When the bone
plate 102 is implanted, the obverse side 112 faces away from the bone portions and the reverse
side 114 faces toward the bone portions. The bone plate 102 includes several holes 116 which
extend through the obverse and reverse sides 112, 114. Six holes 116 are illustrated, although
any number of holes may be present. Each hole 116 includes an internally threaded portion 118
and a non-threaded portion 120 so that each hole 116 accepts either the locking screw 106 or
the non-locking screw 108. The internally threaded portion 118 engages external threads 119
on the head 107 of the locking screw 106. The internally threaded portion 118 may be adjacent
to the reverse side 114. The non-threaded portion 120 engages the head 109 of the non-locking
screw 108. The non-threaded portion 120 may be adjacent to the obverse side 112. The non
threaded portion 120 may be concave and/or elongated. An optional groove 122 in the obverse
side 112 extends between two of the holes 116. Each of these two holes 116 is also elongated
toward the other hole 116, leaving a web 124 extending between the two holes 116. The web
                                                  7

124 may be adjacent to the reverse side 114. The web 124 separates the two holes 116, and
may be present even if the holes 116 are not elongated towards each other. The optional
groove 122 if present, the two elongated holes 116, and the web 124 are referred to
collectively as a receiver 126, and the involved holes 116 are referred to as receiver holes 128.
A receiver 126 may be included between any two holes through a bone plate. Multiple
receivers 126 may be included on a single bone plate. For example, referring to FIGS. 1A and 1E,
the bone plate 102 may be modified to include a second receiver between the left two holes
116 and/or a third receiver between the right two holes 116. Two receivers 126 may share a
common receiver hole 128. The bone plate 102 may be much more stiff than the dynamic
element, which in this example is the staple 104. The bone plate 102 may be rigid, or static as
defined above. Alternatively, the bone plate 102 may be malleable or elastic. The bone plate
102 may include rigid and malleable regions. The illustrated bone plate 102 may be 2 mm thick
in the vicinity of the receiver 126 and 1.5 mm thick in the vicinity of the leftmost two holes 116
and the rightmost two holes 116. The bone plate 102 is also illustrated in FIG. 11.
[0043]       Referring to FIG. 10, several different bone plate shapes may be provided in a kit or
a set. FIG. 10 shows, from left to right, a left double Y plate 102, a left Y plate, a right Y plate
902, a straight 4-hole plate, a straight 5-hole plate, a left metatarsophalangeal plate with 10
degree varus and zero degree dorsiflexion, and a right metatarsophalangeal plate with 10
degree varus and zero degree dorsiflexion.
[0044]       The staple 104 is described in at least one of the patent applications identified in the
priority chain of this application. The staple 104 may be the implant 200 of FIGS. 11 and 12,
implant 300 of FIGS. 15A-16B, implant 600 of FIGS. 21 and 22, implant 800 of FIGS. 23A-24, or
implant    2200 of     FIGS.   78 and    79    of  International  Patent   Application   Serial   No.
PCT/US2015/039551; or implant 100 of FIGS. 1-3, staple 300 of FIGS. 4 and 5, staple 400 of FIG.
7, staple 480 of FIG. 8, or implant 2100 of FIGS. 10A and 10B of International Patent Application
Serial No. PCT/US2015/039556.
[0045]       The staple 104 includes a body 140 or bridge, a first leg 142, and a second leg 144.
The bridge extends between a first end 146 and a second end 148. The first leg 142 is coupled
to the first end 146 and terminates in a first free end 143. The second leg 144 extends from the
second end 148 and terminates in a second free end 145.
[0046]       The staple 104 has an insertion state, or elastically deformed state, which is its
shape under the influence of an external force, for example, an external force applied by a
                                                   8

staple inserter tool. A first distance separates the free ends 143, 145 in the elastically deformed
state. The staple 104 also has a free state, or relaxed state, which is its shape when no external
forces are acting upon the staple, other than gravity. A second distance separates the free ends
143, 145 in the relaxed state. The second distance is different from the first distance. In the
example shown, the legs 142, 144 of the staple 104 are parallel to one another in the elastically
deformed state. However, the legs 142, 144 may converge or diverge in the elastically
deformed state. In the example shown, the legs 142, 144 of the staple converge at their free
ends, or tips, in the relaxed state, so that the second distance is less than the first distance.
However, the legs 142, 144 may diverge at their free ends, or the legs 142, 144 may be parallel
in the relaxed state. The staple 104 assumes the elastically deformed state under the influence
of an external force. The staple 104 may resume the free state as soon as the external force is
removed. If the legs 142, 144 of the staple 104 are engaged in bone holes, then the staple may
only be able to partially relax toward the free state due to the resistance of the bone. In this
situation, the staple 104 may be in a loaded state in between the elastically deformed state and
the relaxed state. The loaded state of the staple is shown in FIGS. 1A-1F. The staple 104 is
preferably made of a superelastic alloy such as nitinol, although other materials are also
suitable. In this example, the staple 104 is not locked to the bone plate 102, although in
subsequent examples the staple is locked to the bone plate. In this example, the body 140 of
the staple 104 rests within the groove 122 of the receiver 126 against the web 124, and the
staple legs 142, 144 extend through the receiver holes 128 and protrude from the reverse side
114 of the bone plate 102. The web 124 prevents the body 140 from passing through the
reverse side 114 of the bone plate 102. The receiver 126 holds the staple 104 in a
predetermined orientation and relative position with respect to the bone plate 102. The
receiver 126 is one example of a group of features that function together to hold a staple a in a
predetermined orientation and relative position with respect to a bone plate. Different
features, or groups of features, may provide the same function. For example, the groove 122
may be lacking so that the body 140 of the staple 104 rests atop the obverse side 112 of the
bone plate 102, or the web 124 may be replaced by ledges or other supports to serve as a stop
or a docking point to prevent the body 140 from passing through the reverse side 114.
Furthermore, the web 124 may be replaced by one or more stop feature(s) or docking
feature(s) on the staple 104 instead of on the bone plate 102.

[0047]      The locking screw 106 locks securely to any hole 116 in the bone plate 102. The
locking screw 106 may include an externally threaded head 107 which locks to the hole 116 in
the bone plate 102 when threaded tightly into the internally threaded portion 118 of the hole
116. The locking screw 106 may be the design disclosed in at least one of the patent
applications identified in the priority chain of this application. The locking screw 106 may be the
bone fixation device 390 of FIG. 11, bone fixation device 500 of FIGS. 24-26, bone fixation
device 600 of FIGS. 27-30 of International Patent Application Serial No. PCT/US2014/070495.
The locking screw 106 is also illustrated in FIG. 12.
[0048]      The non-locking screw 108 does not lock to the holes 116 in the bone plate 102.
Instead, it remains free to rotate and translate within the confines of the screw hole 116 after
implantation. The non-locking screw 108 may be polyaxially positionable relative to the screw
hole 116. The non-locking screw 108 may include a head 109 with an exterior surface that
forms a ball-and-socket joint with the non-threaded portion 120 of the hole 116. The exterior
surface may be convex, spherical, or conical. The non-locking screw 108 is also illustrated in FIG.
12.
[0049]      Referring to FIG. 13, the screws 106 and 108 are interchangeable in the screw holes
116 of the bone plate 102.
[0050]      Referring to FIG. 2, an assembly 200 may include a stabilizing member and one or
more fasteners. In assembly 200, the stabilizing member may be the bone plate 102 and the
fasteners may include one or more of the screws 106 and/or 108. This example includes a
locking screw 106 in one of the receiver holes, showing that the screws 106 or 108 can be used
interchangeably in the receiver holes 128 as well as the other holes 116 of the bone plate 102.
[0051]      Referring to FIGS. 3A-3F, an assembly 300 may include a stabilizing member, a
dynamic element, and one or more fasteners. In assembly 300, the stabilizing member may be
a bone plate 302, the dynamic element may be the staple 104, and the fasteners may include a
set screw 310 and one or more of the screws 106 and/or 108, although the screws 106 and 108
are omitted from the illustration for clarity.
[0052]      The bone plate 302 has an obverse side 312 and a reverse side 314. The bone plate
302 includes several holes 316, each of which may include an internally threaded portion 318
and a non-threaded portion 320, the same as hole 116. The internally threaded portion 318
may be adjacent to the reverse side 314 and the non-threaded portion 320 may be adjacent to
the obverse side 312. An optional groove 322 in the obverse side 312 extends between two of
                                                  10

the holes 316. Each of these two holes 316 is also elongated toward the other hole 316, leaving
a web 324 extending between the two holes 316. The web 324 may be adjacent to the reverse
side 314. The web 324 separates the two holes 316, and may be present even if the holes 316
are not elongated towards each other. The web 324 prevents the body 140 from passing
through the reverse side 314. The optional groove 322 if present, the two elongated holes 316,
and the web 324 are referred to collectively as a receiver 326, and the involved holes 316 are
referred to as receiver holes 328. The bone plate 302 includes an internally threaded socket 338
which receives the set screw 310 in threaded engagement. The set screw 310 locks the staple
104 to the bone plate 302, and may be referred to as a locking mechanism.
[0053]       Referring to FIGS. 4A-4G, an assembly 400 may include a stabilizing member, a
dynamic element, and one or more fasteners. In assembly 400, the stabilizing member may be
a bone plate 402, the dynamic element may be the staple 104, and the fasteners may include
one or more of the screws 106 and/or 108, although the screws 106 and 108 are omitted from
the illustration for clarity.
[0054]      The bone plate 402 has an obverse side 412 and a reverse side 414. The bone plate
402 includes several holes 416, each of which may include an internally threaded portion 418
and a non-threaded portion 420, the same as hole 116. The internally threaded portion 418
may be adjacent to the reverse side 414 and the non-threaded portion 420 may be adjacent to
the obverse side 412. An optional groove 422 in the obverse side 412 extends between two of
the holes 416. Each of these two holes 416 is also elongated toward the other hole 416, leaving
a web 424 extending between the two holes 416. The web 424 may be adjacent to the reverse
side 414. The web 424 separates the two holes 416, and may be present even if the holes 416
are not elongated towards each other. The web 424 prevents the body 140 from passing
through the reverse side 414. The optional groove 422 if present, the two elongated holes 416,
and the web 424 are referred to collectively as a receiver 426, and the involved holes 416 are
referred to as receiver holes 428. The bone plate 402 includes a ductile tab 430 that extends
from the obverse side 412 beside the receiver 426. There may be more than one tab 430. The
tab 430 couples the staple 104 to the bone plate 402. The tab 430 may therefore be considered
one of the fasteners, and may be referred to as a locking mechanism. The tab 430 is illustrated
in an open state in FIGS. 4A-4D, and in a closed state in FIGS. 4E-4G. In the open state, the
staple 104 may be inserted into the receiver 426. In the closed state, the tab 430 prevents the
staple 104 from being removed from the receiver. The tab 430 may be bent over the staple 104
                                               11

in the closed state. The tab 430 may experience plastic deformation, also known as permanent
deformation, so that the tab 430 remains bent over the staple 104 unless bent back towards
the open state. The tab 430 may be closed intraoperatively, or the assembly 400 may be
provided coupled together with the tab 430 closed as shown in FIGS. 4E-4G.
[0055]       Other means for locking the staple 104 to a bone plate are contemplated, such as a
snap fit between the staple 104 and the bone plate (not shown).
[0056]       Referring to FIGS. 5A-5F, an assembly 500 may include a stabilizing member, a
dynamic element, and one or more fasteners. In assembly 500, the stabilizing member may be
a bone plate 502, the dynamic element may be the staple 104, and the fasteners may be one or
more of the screws 106 and/or 108, although the screws 106 and 108 are omitted from the
illustration for clarity.
[0057]       The bone plate 502 has an obverse side 512 and a reverse side 514. The bone plate
502 includes several holes 516, each of which may include an internally threaded portion 518
and a non-threaded portion 520, the same as hole 116. The internally threaded portion 518
may be adjacent to the reverse side 514 and the non-threaded portion 520 may be adjacent to
the obverse side 512. Two of the holes 516 are elongated toward each other, leaving a web 524
extending between the two holes 516. The two elongated holes 516 in this example lack the
internally threaded portion 518. The web 524 may be adjacent to the reverse side 514. The web
524 separates the two holes 516, and may be present even if the holes 516 are not elongated
towards each other. The web 524 prevents the body 140 from passing through the reverse side
514. The two elongated holes 516 and web 524 are referred to collectively as a receiver 526,
and the involved holes 516 are referred to as receiver holes 528. In this example, the bone plate
502 is formed around the staple 104 at least partially so that the staple 104 is inseparable from
the bone plate 502 in normal use. The web 524 encircles a middle portion of the body 140 of
the staple 104, leaving lateral portions of the staple body 140 and the staple legs 142, 144 free
to flex between the relaxed state and the elastically deformed state. Alternately, the staple 104
may be partially or fully encapsulated in an elastically deformable material that bends with the
staple as the staple moves between the relaxed state and the elastically deformed state. The
bone plate 502 may be made of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) which is overmolded around the
staple 104. The staple 104 may be insert molded into the bone plate 502. The bone plate 502
and staple 104 may be integrally formed of a single material, preferably a highly elastic material
                                                 12

such as nitinol. The staple included in assembly 500 may be a modified version of staple 104.
The modifications may facilitate manufacturing the bone plate 502 and the staple as a unit.
[0058]      Referring to FIGS. 6A-6F, an assembly 600 may include a stabilizing member, a
dynamic element, and one or more fasteners. In assembly 600, the stabilizing member may be
a bone plate 602, the dynamic element may be an elbow peg 604 also known as an L-peg, and
the fasteners may be one or more of the screws 106 and/or 108.
[0059]      The bone plate 602 has an obverse side 612 and a reverse side 614. The bone plate
602 includes several holes 616. The holes 616 may lack an internally threaded portion like hole
116. A groove 622 in the obverse side 612 extends between two of the holes 616 and within the
holes, forming a shelf 623 within each hole 616. The shelf 623 may be adjacent to the reverse
side 614. Each of these two holes 616 is also elongated toward the other hole 616, leaving a
web 624 extending between the two holes 616. The web 624 may be adjacent to the reverse
side 614. The web 624 separates the two holes 616, and may be present even if the holes 616
are not elongated towards each other. The groove 622, two elongated holes 616, and web 624
are referred to collectively as a receiver 626, and the holes 616 are referred to as receiver holes
628, since these features receive the elbow pegs 604.
[0060]      Two elbow pegs 604 are shown facing each other in the assembly 600. In this
example, the elbow pegs 604 take the place of the previous dynamic element, the staple 104.
Each elbow peg 604 includes a head 632 and a bone-contacting leg 634, which terminates in a
free end 635. The head 632 may be shaped like a ring, as illustrated, or it may be any shape,
such as rectangular, square, oval, polygonal, etc. The head 632 may be perpendicular, or nearly
perpendicular, to the leg 634. For example, the head 632 and the leg 634 may form an angle of
90 degrees ± 10 degrees, 90 degrees ± 15 degrees, or 90 degrees ± 20 degrees. Alternatively,
the head 632 may form an acute angle or an obtuse angle with the leg 634. Each elbow peg 604
may be independently inserted into a bone hole and secured to the bone plate 602. The elbow
peg 604 may be secured to the bone plate 602 by a bone screw, such as screw 106 or 108,
through an aperture 636 through the head 632. The shelf 623 prevents the head 632 from
passing through the reverse side 614 of the bone plate 602. The elbow peg 604 may develop
some spring force as the bone screw is fully seated, as explained more fully below with regard
to assembly 700. The spring force may be linear or nonlinear. The elbow peg 604 may exert
force due to simple leverage without substantive spring force.
                                                 13

[0061]     While two elbow pegs 604 are shown, a single elbow peg 604 may be used opposite
a locking screw 106. This arrangement is not shown. In this case, the bone plate 602 would
have an internally threaded hole 616 at one end (like hole 116 of bone plate 102) and at the
other end, a receiver hole 628. The assembly would include a locking screw 106 in the internally
threaded hole 616 and an elbow peg 604 plus a screw in the receiver hole 628.
[0062]     In a further modification of assembly 600, a screw 108 and an elbow peg 604 may be
used together with no other apparatus. In this case, the screw 108 and the leg 634 of the elbow
peg 604 may lie on opposite sides of the discontinuity between tissue portions. A screw 106
may also be used in this fashion, in which case the aperture 636 through the head 632 of the
elbow peg 604 preferably includes an internally threaded portion to engage the external
threads 119 on the head 107 of the screw 106.
[0063]     Referring to FIGS. 7A-7F, an assembly 700 may include a stabilizing member, a
dynamic element, and one or more fasteners. In assembly 700, the stabilizing member may be
a bone plate 702, the dynamic element may be an elbow peg 704 also known as an L-peg, and
the fasteners may be one or more of the set screws 310.
[0064]     The bone plate 702 has an obverse side 712 and a reverse side 714. The bone plate
702 includes several holes 716, each of which may include an internally threaded portion 718.
The internally threaded portion 718 may be adjacent to the obverse side 712. Each hole 716
may include an interior shelf 723. The shelf 723 may be adjacent to the reverse side 714. Two of
the holes 716 are elongated toward each other, leaving a web 724 extending between the two
holes 716. The web 724 may be adjacent to the reverse side 714. The web 724 separates the
two holes 716, and may be present even if the holes 716 are not elongated towards each other.
The two elongated holes 716 and web 724 are referred to collectively as a receiver 726, and the
involved holes 716 are referred to as receiver holes 728, since these features receive the elbow
pegs 704.
[0065]     Two elbow pegs 704 are shown facing each other in the assembly 700. In this
example, the elbow pegs 704 take the place of the previous dynamic element, the staple 104.
Each elbow peg 704 includes a head 732 and a bone-contacting leg 734, which terminates in a
free end 735. The head 732 may be rounded, as illustrated, or it may be any shape. The head
732 may be perpendicular, or nearly perpendicular, to the leg 734. For example, the head 732
and the leg 734 may form an angle of 90 degrees ± 10 degrees, 90 degrees ± 15 degrees, or 90
degrees ± 20 degrees. Alternatively, the head 732 may form an acute angle or an obtuse angle
                                                14

with the leg 734. Each elbow peg 704 may be independently inserted into a bone hole and
secured to the bone plate 702. The elbow peg 704 may be secured to the bone plate 702 by the
set screw 310 against the head 734. The shelf 723 prevents the head 732 from passing through
the reverse side 714 of the bone plate 702. The elbow peg 704 may develop some spring force
as the set screw 310 is fully seated. FIG. 7D shows a free state elbow peg 704 in the left hole.
The head 732 and the leg 734 form an obtuse angle in the free state. A compressed elbow peg
704 is shown in the right hole. As a result of driving the set screw 310 tightly against the head
732, the elbow peg 704 is elastically bent to a 90 degree state, which is an elastically deformed
state. The leg 734 exerts a force against the bone, acting toward the left-hand elbow peg 704.
The force may be linear or nonlinear. A similar principle may apply to the elbow pegs 604
described for assembly 600. The elbow peg 704 may exert force due to simple leverage without
substantive spring force.
[0066]      While two elbow pegs 704 are shown, a single elbow peg 704 may be used opposite
a locking screw 106. This arrangement is not shown. In this case, the bone plate would have an
internally threaded hole 716 at one end (like hole 116 of bone plate 102) and at the other end,
a receiver hole 728. The assembly would include a locking screw 106 in the internally threaded
hole 716 and an elbow peg 704 plus a set screw 310 in the receiver hole 728.
[0067]      Referring to FIGS. 8A-8G, an assembly 800 may include a stabilizing member, a
dynamic element, and one or more fasteners. In assembly 800, the stabilizing member may be
a bone plate 802, the dynamic element may be a straight peg 804, and the fasteners may be
one or more of the set screws 310.
[0068]      The bone plate 802 has an obverse side 812 and a reverse side 814. The bone plate
802 includes several holes 816, each of which may include an internally threaded portion 818.
The internally threaded portion 818 may be adjacent to the obverse side 812. Each hole 816
may include an interior shelf 823. The shelf 823 may be adjacent to the reverse side 814. A web
824 extends between two of the holes 816. The web 824 may be adjacent to the reverse side
814. The web 824 separates the two holes 816, and may be present even if the holes 816 are
elongated towards each other. The two holes 816 are referred to as receiver holes 828, since
these features receive the straight pegs 804.
[0069]      Two straight pegs 804 are shown facing each other in the assembly 800. In this
example, the straight pegs 804 take the place of the previous dynamic elements, the staple 104
or the elbow pegs 604, 704. Each straight peg 804 includes a head 832 and a bone-contacting
                                                15

leg 834, which terminates in a free end 835. The head 832 may be rounded, as illustrated, or it
may be any shape. The head 832 may include a mark 837, such as an arrowhead pointing
toward the free end 835 of the leg 834 (FIG. 8F). The head 832 may form an obtuse angle, a
right angle, or an acute angle with the leg 834 (FIG. 8E). Each straight peg 804 may be
independently inserted into a bone hole and secured to the bone plate 802. The straight peg
804 may be secured to the bone plate 802 by the set screw 310 against the head 832. The shelf
823 prevents the head 832 from passing through the reverse side 814 of the bone plate 802.
The straight peg 804 is free to rotate about its head 832 within the receiver hole 828, at least
until secured by the set screw 310. Alternatively, the straight peg 804 may be rotationally
constrained relative to the receiver hole 828 to a set of discrete rotational positions. The head
832 and/or the leg 834 of the straight peg 804 may be non-circular, and may engage a
complementary non-circular portion of the receiver hole 828. A similar arrangement is
illustrated in FIGS. 25A-H. Whether the straight pegs 804 are free to rotate or constrained to
discrete rotational positions, the assembly 800 can deliver dynamic load in multiple directions
relative to the bone plate 802 and/or other straight pegs 804. The mark 837 (arrowhead) may
assist in orienting each leg 834 in the desired direction. FIGS. 8D and 8E illustrate that the
straight peg 804 may develop spring force as the set screw 310 is fully seated, according to the
same principles described for assembly 700 above. However, in FIG. 8E, the straight peg 804 is
illustrated in its free state, having rotated counterclockwise due to the action of the set screw
310. If the leg 834 were constrained to the position shown in FIG. 8D, perpendicular to the
bone plate 802, then the straight peg 804 would develop spring force as the set screw 310 is
tightened.
[0070]      While two straight pegs 804 are shown, a single straight peg 804 may be used
opposite a locking screw 106. This arrangement is not shown. In this case, the bone plate would
have an internally threaded hole 816 at one end (like hole 116 of bone plate 102) and at the
other end, a receiver hole 828. The assembly would include a locking screw 106 in the internally
threaded hole 816 and a straight peg 804 plus a set screw 310 in the receiver hole 828.
[0071]      Referring to FIGS. 24A-24J, an assembly 1000 may include a stabilizing member and
a dynamic element. In assembly 1000, the stabilizing member may be the bone plate 602 and
the dynamic element may be a straight peg 1004.
[0072]      Two straight pegs 1004 are shown facing each other in the assembly 1000. In this
example, the straight pegs 1004 take the place of the previous dynamic elements, the staple
                                                 16

104 or the elbow pegs 604, 704 or the straight peg 804. Each straight peg 1004 includes a
rounded head 1032 and a bone-contacting leg 1034, which terminates in a free end 1035. The
head 1032 may form an obtuse angle, a right angle, or an acute angle with the leg 1034 (FIG.
24D). The head 1032 may include a mark pointing toward the free end 1035 of the leg 1034,
similar to mark 837 of straight peg 804. The leg 1034 may include external threads as shown, or
the leg 1034 may be smooth. Each straight peg 1004 may be independently inserted into a
bone hole and secured to the bone plate 602. The straight peg 1004 may be secured to the
bone plate 602 by threading the leg 1034 into bone, or with a set screw 310 as explained
previously. The shelf 623 prevents the head 1032 from passing through the reverse side 614 of
the bone plate 602. The straight peg 1004 may develop spring force, according to similar
principles to those described above. FIG. 24E illustrates an inserter tool 1040 for temporarily
straightening the angle between the head 1032 and the leg 1034, and for threading the leg
1034 into a bone hole. The inserter tool 1040 includes a torque drive feature 1042 (a hex) with
a distal shaft 1044 that extends within a cannulation 1033 in the straight peg 1004.
[0073]      While two straight pegs 1004 are shown, a single straight peg 1004 may be used
opposite a locking screw 106. This arrangement is not shown. In this case, the bone plate 602
would have an internally threaded hole 616 at one end (like hole 116 of bone plate 102) and at
the other end, a receiver hole 628. The assembly would include a locking screw 106 in the
internally threaded hole 616 and a straight peg 1004 in the receiver hole 628.
[0074]      Referring to FIGS. 25A-25H, an assembly 1100 may include a stabilizing member, a
dynamic element, and one or more fasteners. In assembly 1100, the stabilizing member may be
a bone plate 1102, the dynamic element may be a wire peg 1104, and the fastener may include
a set screw 310.
[0075]      The bone plate 1102 has an obverse side 1112 and a reverse side 1114. The bone
plate 1102 includes several holes 1116, each of which may include an internally threaded
portion 1118. The internally threaded portion 1118 may be adjacent to the obverse side 1112.
Each hole 1116 may include an interior shelf 1123. The shelf 1123 may be adjacent to the
reverse side 1114. A web 1124 extends between two of the holes 1116. The web 1124 may be
adjacent to the reverse side 1114. The web 1124 separates the two holes 1116, and may be
present even if the holes 1116 are elongated towards each other. The two holes 1116 are
referred to as receiver holes 1128, since these features receive the wire pegs 1104. Each
                                                17

receiver hole 1128 includes a noncircular through hole 1129. The illustrated holes 1129 are
rectangular, and may be square.
[0076]      Two wire pegs 1104 are shown facing each other in the assembly 1100. In this
example, the wire pegs 1104 take the place of the previous dynamic elements, the staple 114,
the elbow pegs 604, 704, the straight pegs 804, 1004. Each wire peg 1104 is formed from a
sharply bent, or folded, piece of wire having a rectangular cross section. Each wire peg 1104
includes a head 1132 and a bone-contacting leg 1134, which terminates in a free end 1135
where the wire is sharply bent or folded. The head 1132 in this example is formed by outwardly
bent ends, or terminal portions, of the wire. The head 1132 may form an obtuse angle, a right
angle, or an acute angle with the leg 1134. In FIG. 25E-F, the outwardly bent wire ends of the
head 1132 form right angles with the leg 1134 when the wire peg 1104 is in the free state. The
outwardly bent wire ends of the head 1132 are uneven when the wire peg 1104 is in the free
state. Each wire peg 1104 may be independently inserted into a bone hole and secured to the
bone plate 1102. The wire peg 1104 may be secured to the bone plate 1102 with a set screw
310. The shelf 1123 prevents the head 1132 from passing through the reverse side 1114 of the
bone plate 1102. The wire peg 1104 may develop spring force and may bow sideways as the set
screw 310 is tightened, due to the uneven height of the outwardly bent wire ends of the head
1132. The stressed or bowed state of the wire peg 1104 is illustrated in FIGS. 25A-25D, 25G, and
25 H.
[0077]      While two wire pegs 1104 are shown, a single wire peg 1104 may be used opposite a
locking screw 116. This arrangement is not shown. In this case, the bone plate would have an
internally threaded hole 1116 at one end (like hole 116 of bone plate 102) and at the other end,
a receiver hole 1128. The assembly would include a locking screw 116 in the internally threaded
hole 1116 and a wire peg 1104 with a set screw 310 in the receiver hole 1128.
[0078]      Referring to FIGS. 26A-26H, an assembly 1200 may include a stabilizing member, a
dynamic element, and one or more fasteners. In assembly 1200, the stabilizing member may be
a bone plate 1202, the dynamic element may be a wire peg 1204, and the fastener may include
a set screw 310.
[0079]      The bone plate 1202 has an obverse side 1212 and a reverse side 1214. The bone
plate 1202 includes several holes 1216, each of which may include an internally threaded
portion 1218. The internally threaded portion 1218 may be adjacent to the obverse side 1212.
Each hole 1216 may include an interior shelf 1223. The shelf 1223 may be adjacent to the
                                               18

 reverse side 1214. The shelf 1223 may include a medial alcove 1221. A web 1224 extends
 between two of the holes 1216. The web 1224 may be adjacent to the reverse side 1214. The
web 1224 separates the two holes 1216, and may be present even if the holes 1216 are
elongated towards each other. The two involved holes 1216 are referred to as receiver holes
1228, since these features receive the wire pegs 1204. Each receiver hole 1228 includes a
 noncircular through hole 1229. The illustrated holes 1229 are elongated, and may be oval,
 round, or another shape such as rectangular or square.
 [0080]     Two wire pegs 1204 are shown facing each other in the assembly 1200. In this
example, the wire pegs 1204 take the place of the previous dynamic elements, the staple 104,
the elbow pegs 604, 704, the straight pegs 804, 1004, or the wire peg 1104. Each wire peg 1204
is formed from a sharply bent, or folded, piece of wire having a round cross section. Each wire
 peg 1204 includes a head 1232 and a bone-contacting leg 1234, which terminates in a free end
 1235 where the wire is sharply bent or folded. The head 1232 in this example is formed by
outwardly bent ends, or terminal portions, of the wire. The head 1232 may form an obtuse
angle, a right angle, or an acute angle with the leg 1234. In FIG. 26E-F, the outwardly bent wire
ends of the head 1232 form right angles with the leg 1234 when the wire peg is in the free
state. The outwardly bent wire ends of the head 1232 are uneven when the wire peg is in the
free state. Each wire peg 1204 may be independently inserted into a bone hole and secured to
the bone plate 1202. The wire peg 1204 may be secured to the bone plate 1202 with a set
screw 310. The wire peg 1204 may develop spring force and may bow sideways as the set screw
is tightened, due to the uneven height of the outwardly bent wire ends of the head 1232. The
stressed or bowed state of the wire peg 1204 is illustrated in FIGS. 26A-26D, 26G, and 26H.
 [0081]     While two wire pegs 1204 are shown, a single wire peg 1204 may be used opposite a
 locking screw 126. This arrangement is not shown. In this case, the bone plate would have an
internally threaded hole 1216 at one end (like hole 116 of bone plate 102) and at the other end,
a receiver hole 1228. The assembly would include a locking screw 126 in the internally threaded
 hole 1216 and a wire peg 1204 with a set screw 310 in the receiver hole 1228.
 [0082]      Referring to FIGS. 27A and 27B, an alternative wire peg 1302 is formed from a
sharply bent, or folded, piece of wire having a round cross section. Each wire peg 1304 includes
a head 1332 and a bone-contacting leg 1334, which terminates in a free end 1335 where the
wire is sharply bent or folded. The head 1332 in this example is formed by an outwardly bent
end, or terminal portion, of the wire and a straight end of the wire. The head 1332 may form an
                                                19

obtuse angle, a right angle, or an acute angle with the leg 1334. In FIG. 26E-F, the outwardly
bent wire end of the head 1332 forms a right angle with the leg 1334 when the wire peg is in
the free state. The outwardly bent wire end of the head 1332 is uneven with the straight end of
the head 1332 when the wire peg is in the free state. This wire peg 1302 may be used
interchangeably with the wire pegs 1102 and 1202.
[0083]      Referring to FIGS. 28A-28F, an assembly 1400 may include a stabilizing member, a
dynamic element, and one or more fasteners. In assembly 1400, the stabilizing member may be
a bone plate 1402, the dynamic element may be a staple 1404, and the fasteners may be
screws. Assembly 1400 is illustrated with locking screws 1406 on the left and non-locking
screws 1408 on the right.
[0084]      The bone plate 1402 has an obverse side 1412 and a reverse side 1414. The bone
plate 1402 includes several holes 1416 which extend through the obverse and reverse sides
1412, 1414. Sixteen holes 1416 are illustrated, although any number of holes may be present.
Each hole 1416 includes an internally threaded portion 1418 and a non-threaded portion 1420
so that each hole 1416 accepts either the locking screw 1406 or the non-locking screw 1408.
The internally threaded portion 1418 engages external threads 1419 on the head 1407 of the
locking screw 1406. The internally threaded portion 1418 may be adjacent to the reverse side
1414. The non-threaded portion 1420 engages the head 1409 of the non-locking screw 1408.
The non-threaded portion 1420 may be adjacent to the obverse side 1412. The non-threaded
portion 1420 may be concave and/or elongated. An optional groove 1422 in the obverse side
1412 extends along a line of six holes 1416 that extend along the midline of the plate 1402.
Each of these six holes 1416 is also elongated, leaving webs 1424 extending between the
second and third holes 1416 and the fourth and fifth holes 1416. No webs are shown between
the first and second holes 1416, the third and fourth holes 1416, or the fifth and sixth holes
1416, although these webs may be present. The webs 1424 may be adjacent to the reverse side
1414. The webs 1424 separate the second and third holes 1416 and the fourth and fifth holes
1416, respectively, and may be present even if the holes 14416 are not elongated. The first and
second holes 1416 are referred to collectively as a receiver 1426, and the involved holes 1416
are referred to as receiver holes 1428. A second receiver 1426 includes the third and fourth
holes 1416, and a third receiver 1426 includes the fifth and sixth holes 1416.
[0085]      The staple 1404 is described in at least one of the patent applications identified in
the priority chain of this application. The staple 1404 may be the implant 200 of FIGS. 11 and
                                                20

12, implant 300 of FIGS. 15A-16B, implant 600 of FIGS. 21 and 22, implant 800 of FIGS. 23A-24,
or implant 2200 of FIGS.         78 and 79 of International Patent Application Serial No.
PCT/US2015/039551; or implant 100 of FIGS. 1-3, staple 300 of FIGS. 4 and 5, staple 400 of FIG.
7, staple 480 of FIG. 8, or implant 2100 of FIGS. 10A and 10B of International Patent Application
Serial No. PCT/US2015/039556. The illustrated staple 1404 is the implant 2200 of FIGS. 78 and
79 of International Patent Application Serial No. PCT/US2015/039551.
[0086]      The staple 1404 includes a body 1440 or bridge, a first leg 1442, and a second leg
1444. The bridge extends between a first end 1446 and a second end 1448. The first leg 1442 is
coupled to the first end 1446 and terminates in a first free end 1443. The second leg 1444
extends from the second end 1448 and terminates in a second free end 1445. A first projection
1450 extends from the first end 1446 and a second projection 1452 extends from the second
end 1448.
[0087]      The staple 1404 has an insertion state, or elastically deformed state, which is its
shape under the influence of an external force, for example, an external force applied by a
staple inserter tool. A first distance separates the free ends 1443, 1445 in the elastically
deformed state. The staple 1404 also has a free state, or relaxed state, which is its shape when
no external forces are acting upon the staple, other than gravity. A second distance separates
the free ends 1443, 1445 in the relaxed state. The second distance is different from the first
distance. In the example shown, the legs 1442, 1444 of the staple 1404 are parallel to one
another in the elastically deformed state. However, the legs 1442, 1444 may converge or
diverge in the elastically deformed state. In the example shown, the legs 1442, 1444 of the
staple converge at their free ends 1443, 1445, or tips, in the relaxed state, so that the second
distance is less than the first distance. However, the legs 1442, 1444 may diverge at their free
ends 1443, 1445, or the legs 1442, 1444 may be parallel in the relaxed state. The staple 1404
assumes the elastically deformed state under the influence of an external force. The staple
1404 may resume the free state as soon as the external force is removed. If the legs 1442, 1444
of the staple 1404 are engaged in bone holes, then the staple may only be able to partially relax
toward the free state due to the resistance of the bone. In this situation, the staple 1404 may
be in a loaded state in between the elastically deformed state and the relaxed state. In this
example, the staple 1404 is not locked to the bone plate 1402, although in other examples the
staple is locked to the bone plate. In this example, the body 1440 of the staple 1404 rests
within the receiver 1426, and the staple legs 1442, 1444 extend through the receiver holes
                                                 21

1428 and protrude from the reverse side 1414 of the bone plate 1402. The receiver 1426 holds
the staple 1404 in a predetermined orientation and relative position with respect to the bone
plate 1402. The receiver 1426 is one example of a group of features that function together to
hold a staple a in a predetermined orientation and relative position with respect to a bone
plate. Different features, or groups of features, may provide the same function. For example,
the body 1440 of the staple 1404 may rest atop the obverse side 1412 of the bone plate 1402,
or on a web, or the web 1424 may be replaced by ledges or other supports to serve as a stop or
a docking point to prevent the body 1440 from passing through the reverse side 1414.
Furthermore, the web 1424 may be replaced by one or more stop feature(s) or docking
feature(s) on the staple 1404 instead of on the bone plate 1402. For example, the projections
1450, 1452 may serve as stop features or docking features.
[0088]       The locking screw 1406 locks securely to any hole 1416 in the bone plate 1402. The
locking screw 1406 may include an externally threaded head 1407 which locks to the hole 1416
in the bone plate 1402 when threaded tightly into the internally threaded portion 1418 of the
hole 1416. The locking screw 1406 may be the design disclosed in at least one of the patent
applications identified in the priority chain of this application. The locking screw 1406 may be
the bone fixation device 390 of FIG. 11, bone fixation device 500 of FIGS. 24-26, bone fixation
device 600 of FIGS. 27-30 of International Patent Application Serial No. PCT/US2014/070495.
[0089]       The non-locking screw 1408 does not lock to the holes 1416 in the bone plate 1402.
Instead, it remains free to rotate and translate within the confines of the screw hole 1416 after
implantation. The non-locking screw 1408 may be polyaxially positionable relative to the screw
hole 1416. The non-locking screw 1408 may include a head 1409 with an exterior surface that
forms a ball-and-socket joint with the non-threaded portion 1420 of the hole 1416. The exterior
surface may be convex, spherical, or conical.
[0090]       The screws 1406 and 1408 are interchangeable in the screw holes 1416 of the bone
plate 1402.
[0091]       Referring to FIGS. 9A and 9B, a normal human foot 10 includes twenty-six bones,
including a talus 12, a calcaneus 14, a navicular 16, a medial cuneiform 18, an intermediate
cuneiform 20, a lateral cuneiform 22, a cuboid 24, a first metatarsal 26, a second metatarsal 28,
a third metatarsal 30, a fourth metatarsal 32, a fifth metatarsal 34, a first proximal phalanx 36,
a second proximal phalanx 38, a third proximal phalanx 40, a fourth proximal phalanx 42, a fifth
proximal phalanx 44, a first middle phalanx 46, a second middle phalanx 48, a third middle
                                                 22

phalanx 50, a fourth middle phalanx 52, a first distal phalanx 54, a second distal phalanx 56, a
third distal phalanx 58, a fourth distal phalanx 60, and a fifth distal phalanx 62.
[0092]       Referring to FIG. 14, several different surgical instruments may be provided in a kit
or a set.
[0093]       Referring to FIG. 15, a plate sizing template may include several individual templates
for different plate shapes, each of which may be removed from the sizing template. Templating
may be a step in a method for using the disclosed apparatus.
[0094]       Referring to FIGS. 16 and 17, a plate bender may include a threaded end and a
forked end opposite the threaded end. The plate bender may also be used as a handle for the
non-locking polyaxial drill guide (FIG. 20). Plate bending or plate contouring may be a step in a
method for using the disclosed apparatus.
[0095]       Referring to FIG. 18, a threaded drill guide may lock into a threaded hole in a bone
plate, for example bone plate 902, to accurately guide a drill to make a hole in the bone to
receive a locking screw 106. The threaded drill guide may also be used as a bone plate inserter
instrument. Inserting a bone plate may be a step in a method for using the disclosed apparatus.
[0096]       Referring to FIG. 19, an olive wire may be used for temporary fixation in a hole in a
bone plate, for example bone plate 902. Drilling for a locking bone screw, and/or tapping for
the locking bone screw, may be steps in a method for using the disclosed apparatus.
[0097]       Referring to FIG. 20, a non-locking polyaxial drill guide may engage a hole in a bone
plate, for example bone plate 902, to accurately guide a drill to make a hole in the bone to
receive a non-locking screw 108. Drilling for a non-locking bone screw, and/or tapping for the
non-locking bone screw, may be steps in a method for using the disclosed apparatus.
[0098]       Referring to FIG. 21, locking or non-locking screws may be used interchangeably in
the screw holes of the bone plates. A screw driver instrument transmits torque from a manual
or power source to the screw to drive the screw into the bone and, if a locking screw, into the
screw hole threads of the bone plate. Driving a screw into threaded engagement with the bone
and, if a locking screw, with the screw hole threads of the bone plate, may be a step in a
method for using the disclosed apparatus.
[0099]       Referring to FIG. 22, a staple drill guide may engage a pair of holes in a bone plate,
for example bone plate 902, to accurately guide a drill to make holes in the bone to receive a
staple 104. Drilling for a staple may be a step in a method for using the disclosed apparatus.
                                                    23

[00100]     A staple inserter may hold the staple 104 for insertion. The staple inserter is
described in at least one of the patent applications identified in the priority chain of this
application. For example, the staple 104 may be held with its legs forced into a parallel state for
insertion. The staple inserter may engage the staple 104 strictly from a side of the staple
opposite the side that faces the bone plate and bone portions, so that the staple 104 may be
fully seated in the receiver while the staple inserter is attached to the staple 104.. After the
staple has been inserted through the bone plate, removing the staple inserter may allow the
staple legs to relax and attempt to resume the free state, in which the staple legs are acutely
angled with respect to each other (FIGS. 1A-1F). Inserting a staple may be a step in a method
for using the disclosed apparatus.
[00101]     The rightmost view of FIG. 22 shows the bone plate 902 and the staple 104
extending across the first Lisfranc joint (or first tarsometatarsal joint) of a human left foot. The
staple extends through holes in the bone plate 902 so that each staple leg is on a different side
of the joint. As the staple relaxes after the staple inserter is removed, the staple legs apply
mechanical load or stress across the joint. As the staple 104 relaxes towards its free state
shown in FIGS. 1A-1F, the staple legs apply compressive load or stress across the joint.
Conversely, a staple with divergent legs would apply tensile load or stress across the joint.
[00102]     Referring to FIG. 23, the bone plate 902, staple 104, locking screws 106, and non
locking screws 108 are shown in the final implanted state across the first Lisfranc joint. It may
be particularly advantageous to use locking screws 106 adjacent to one leg of the staple 104,
and non-locking screws 108 adjacent to the other leg of the staple 104. This is illustrated in FIG.
23, where locking screws 106 are used in the medial cuneiform 18 and non-locking screws 108
are used in the first metatarsal 26. However, an opposite arrangement is contemplated, with
non-locking screws 108 are used in the medial cuneiform 18 and locking screws 106 are used in
the first metatarsal 26.
[00103]     Methods of using the disclosed apparatus may include any combination of the above
mentioned steps, in any order.
[00104]     One example of a method of using the disclosed apparatus includes the steps of:
inserting a bone plate adjacent to a first bone portion and a second bone portion, wherein a
discontinuity separates the second bone portion from the first bone portion, wherein the bone
plate extends across the discontinuity, wherein the bone plate includes at least four holes;
locking a threaded drill guide to a first hole through the bone plate, wherein the first hole of the
                                                   24

bone plate is adjacent to the first bone portion; drilling a first bone hole through the threaded
drill guide into the first bone portion; driving a locking screw through the first hole of the bone
plate into threaded engagement with the first bone hole and the first hole of the bone plate;
engaging a staple drill guide with a second hole through the bone plate and a third hole through
the bone plate, wherein the second hole of the bone plate is adjacent to the first bone portion,
wherein the third hole of the bone plate is adjacent to the second bone portion; drilling a
second bone hole through the staple drill guide into the first bone portion; drilling a third bone
hole through the staple drill guide into the second bone portion; inserting a first leg of a staple
through the second hole of the bone plate into engagement with the second bone hole and
inserting a second leg of the staple through the third hole of the bone plate into engagement
with the third bone hole, wherein the first leg of the staple is parallel to the second leg of the
staple while the staple is inserted, wherein the first and second legs of the staple compress
towards each other after the staple is inserted; engaging a non-locking polyaxial drill guide with
a fourth hole through the bone plate, wherein the fourth hole of the bone plate is adjacent to
the second bone portion; drilling a fourth bone hole through the non-locking polyaxial drill
guide into the second bone portion; and driving a non-locking screw through the fourth hole of
the bone plate into threaded engagement with the fourth bone hole and non-locking
engagement with the fourth hole of the bone plate.
[00105]      The preceding method may also include the step of securing the staple to the bone
plate. The staple may be secured to the bone plate with a set screw, a ductile tab, or a snap fit.
The staple may be secured to the bone plate by a portion of the staple being molded within a
portion of the bone plate. The staple may be secured to the bone plate by being integrally
formed with the bone plate.
[00106]      Another example of a method of using the disclosed apparatus includes the steps of:
inserting a bone plate adjacent to a first bone portion and a second bone portion, wherein a
discontinuity separates the second bone portion from the first bone portion, wherein the bone
plate extends across the discontinuity; drilling a first bone hole through a first hole through the
bone plate into the first bone portion;       drilling a second bone hole through a second hole
through the bone plate into the second bone portion; inserting a leg of a first elbow peg
through the first hole of the bone plate into engagement with the first bone hole and placing a
