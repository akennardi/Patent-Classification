   Description
   A door for a microwave appliance
 5 The present invention relates to a door for a microwave appli
   ance.   In particular, the present invention relates to an oven
   door for a microwave oven or a multifunctional    oven with micro
   wave   heating function. Further, the present invention relates to
   a microwave appliance. Moreover, the present invention relates
10 to a microwave oven or a multifunctional oven with microwave
   heating function.
   In a microwave appliance the leakage between a door and an open
   ing has to be minimized. For this purpose, a wave choke system
15 is arranged in the outer portions inside the door. The dimen
   sions of the wave choke system result in a small window in the
   central portion of the door. In a similar way, the dimensions of
   a door frame made of plastics also contribute to the small win
   dow in the door. Said small window limits the view into the in
20 ner space of the microwave appliance.
   It is an object of the present invention to provide a door for a
   microwave appliance, which allows an improved view into the in
   ner space of the microwave appliance.
25
   The object of the present invention is achieved by the door for
   a microwave appliance according to claim 1.
   The present invention relates to a door for a microwave appli
30 ance, wherein:
        -     the door includes an outer glass panel ranging over a
              complete outer side of the door,
        -     the door includes an inner glass panel ranging over at
              least a central portion of an inner side of the door,
35      -     the door includes a door frame covering at least the cir
              cumferential sides of the oven door,
                                      1

   WO 2014/135347                                      PCT/EP2014/052770
       -     the door includes a wave choke system,
       -     the outer glass panel, the inner glass panel and the door
             frame form a casing of the door,
       -     the wave choke system is arranged inside said casing of
 5           the door,
       -     the wave choke system is arranged in an outer portion of
             the interior of the door and circumferentially enclosed
             by the door frame,
       -     the wave choke system is arranged adjacent to an outer
10           side of the inner glass panel, and
       -     the circumferential sides of the inner glass panel are
             enclosed by the door frame.
   The main idea of the present invention is that the outer glass
15 panel ranges over the complete outer side of the door on the one
   hand and the inner glass panel ranges over the substantially
   complete inner side of the door on the other hand. The circum
   ferential sides of the door are covered by the door frame. Addi
   tionally, the outer portions of the inner side of said door are
20 also covered by the door frame. Thus, the outer glass panel, the
   inner glass panel and the door frame form the casing of the
   door, wherein the wave choke system is arranged inside said cas
   ing. The door has a compact form with smooth surfaces. Since the
   wave choke system is adjacent to the outer side of the inner
25 glass panel, said inner glass panel is relative large and the
   door allows an improved view through said door into a cavity of
   the microwave appliance.
   According to preferred embodiment of the present invention the
30 door frame     is made of plastics.
   Further, at least one intermediate glass panel may be arranged
   between the wave choke system and the outer glass panel.
35 According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the
   wave choke system includes a G-shaped profile.
                                       2

   WO 2014/135347                                     PCT/EP2014/052770
   In particular, the wave choke system includes at least one la
   mellae   structure.
 5 For example, the lamellae structure is arranged beside a gap of
   the G-shaped profile of the wave choke system.
   Preferably, the lamellae structure is arranged adjacent to an
   outer side of the inner glass panel. The inner glass panel may
10 have a relative high thickness.
   Further, a gap between the circumferential sides of the inner
   glass panel and the door frame may be filled by a gasket. This
   contributes to a smooth surface of the door.
15
   Moreover, a bending up of the wave choke system penetrates at
   least partially into the gap between the circumferential sides
   of the inner glass panel and the door frame.
20 In particular, the door is an oven door for a microwave oven.
   Further, the present invention relates to a microwave appliance,
   wherein said microwave appliance includes at least one door men
   tioned above.
25
   For example, the microwave appliance is a microwave oven.
   Preferably, the microwave appliance comprises a cavity and a
   front  frame, wherein the front frame encloses circumferentially
30 a front opening of the  cavity.
   Furthermore, a gap between the front  frame and the front   opening
   of the cavity is filled by a gasket.
                                    3

   At last, the wave choke system of the door may extend in paral
   lel to the gap between the    front frame and the front  opening of
   the cavity in a closed state of said door
 5 Novel  and inventive   features of the present invention are   set
   forth in the appended claims.
   The present invention will be described in further detail with
   reference to the drawings, in which
10
   FIG 1     illustrates a schematic sectional side view of an oven
             door for a microwave oven or  a multifunctional oven with
             microwave heating function according to a preferred em
             bodiment of the present invention, and
15
   FIG 2     illustrates a schematic sectional perspective view of an
             upper part of the oven door for the microwave oven or
             multifunctional oven with microwave heating function ac
             cording to the preferred embodiment of the present inven
20           tion.
   FIG 1 illustrates a schematic sectional side view of an oven
   door 10 for a microwave oven or a multifunctional    oven with mi
   crowave heating function according to a preferred embodiment of
25 the present invention. The oven door 10 is attached at a micro
   wave oven. In FIG 1 the oven door 10 is in a closed state.
   The oven door 10 comprises an outer glass panel 12,     an inner
   glass panel 12, a first intermediate glass panel 16,     a second
30 intermediate glass panel 18, a door frame 20 and a wave choke
   system 22.    The microwave oven includes an oven cavity 28 and a
   front  frame 30.
   The outer glass panel 12 forms the outer side of the oven door
35 10 and is attached at the door frame 20. The area of the outer
   glass panel 12 is bigger than that area spanned by the door
                                      4

    WO 2014/135347                                       PCT/EP2014/052770
   frame 20.     Thus, the outer glass panel 12 covers completely the
   door frame 20. The inner glass panel 12 forms the substantial
   part of the inner side of the oven door 10.     The circumferential
   sides of the inner glass panel 12 are enclosed by the door frame
 5 20.  In this example, the door frame 20 is made of plastics. The
   door frame 20 may either be formed as a single-piece part or
   composed by several frame parts. The wave choke system 22 is
   made of metal sheets.
10 The wave choke system 22,     the first intermediate glass panel 16
   and the second intermediate glass panel 18 are arranged between
   the outer glass panel 12 and the inner glass panel 12. The wave
   choke system 22 is adjacent to the outer side of the inner glass
   panel 12.     The first intermediate glass panel 16 is arranged in
15 front   of the wave   choke system 22. In turn, the second interme
   diate glass panel 18 is arranged in front of the first interme
   diate glass panel 16.     The door frame encloses circumferentially
   also the wave choke system 22,     the first intermediate glass pan
   el 16 and the second intermediate glass panel 18.
20
   The wave choke system 22 includes a G-shaped profile extending
   in parallel to the     front frame 30 of the microwave oven.   The G
   shaped profile forms a rectangular frame enclosed by the door
   frame 20. A gap of the G-shaped profile extends in parallel to a
25 gap between the oven cavity 28 and the front frame 30 of the mi
   crowave oven. A profile section besides the gap of the G-shaped
   profile includes a lamellae structure 24.     The lamellae  structure
   24 is adjacent to the outside of the inner glass panel 14. The
   plane   of the lamellae structure   24 extends in parallel to the
30 inner   glass panel 14.
   A circumferential gap between the inner glass panel 14 and the
   door frame 20 is filled by a gasket 26. Further, said gasket 26
   encloses partially a bending up of the wave choke system 22.
35 Said bending up encloses the wave choke system 22 and penetrates
                                       5

   partially into the gap between the inner glass panel 14 and the
   door frame 20.
   FIG 2 illustrates a schematic sectional perspective view of an
 5 upper part of the oven door 10 for the microwave oven or the
   multifunctional    oven with microwave heating function according
   to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
   In particular, FIG 2 shows the geometric properties of the wave
10 choke  system 22 including the lamellae structure    24. Further,
   the arrangements of the outer glass panel 12, the inner glass
   panel 12,    the first intermediate glass panel 16, the second in
   termediate glass panel 18 and the door frame 20 are shown. For
   clarity, the gasket 26 is not shown in FIG 2.
15
   The oven door 10 allows an improved view through said oven door
   10 into the oven cavity 28. The oven door 10 has a compact form
   with smooth surfaces. Since the inner glass panel 14 ranges over
   the nearly complete inner side of the oven door 10,     said inner
20 side may be cleaned up in an easy way. The oven door 10 allows a
                           2
   leakage below 1 mW/cm     . This value results from the structure
   and profile of the wave choke system 22.
   The present invention is not restricted to the oven door 10 for
25 the microwave    oven. In general, the present invention relates to
   a door for a microwave appliance and a corresponding microwave
   appliance.
