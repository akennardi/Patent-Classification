                           Structural Column Fixing System
Technical Field
[0001]      The present invention relates to a structural column fixing system. In
particular, but not exclusively, the present invention relates to a structural column
fixing system having a structural column, a cap plate having two or more countersunk
apertures, and fasteners with countersunk heads adapted to be received in the two or
more countersunk apertures in the cap plate to fix the cap plate to the column.
Background of Invention
[0002]      Structural columns, such as structural steel columns, are traditionally pre
fabricated and then fixed in a desired position at a construction site by skilled
labourers. These columns are traditionally cut and welded on site to fit the desired
height required for a particular application by skilled labourers. Further, for the
columns to interface with structural beams and surfaces at the construction site, cap
plates and base plates with particular configurations for interfacing with structural
beams and surfaces are welded to the columns. The cutting and welding of the
columns, however, is time consuming and requires specialised tools and expertise.
[0003]      In an existing example, structural steel columns are pre-fabricated at a
manufacturing facility remote from the construction site to minimise the cutting and
welding required at the construction site. To do so, various configurations of base
plates and cap plates for columns are also pre-fabricated at the manufacturing site
and the fabricator will weld together specifically configured cap and base plates to
columns for particular applications. These finished columns then typically have a
finished surface treatment applied, such as prime painting or hot dip galvanising, and
the whole process can take considerable time (e.g. approximately 30-40 minutes).
Once these columns are finished, they are transported to the construction site, and
the skilled workers are required to select columns with correct length, as well as base
plate and cap plate configurations before fixing the columns in position. This
selection process is time consuming and not readily adaptable to changes in
requirements at the construction site.

                                              2
[0004]      The above discussion of background art is included to explain the context
of the present invention. It is not to be taken as an admission that any of the
documents or other material referred to was published, known or part of the common
general knowledge at the priority date of any one of the claims of this specification.
Summary of Invention
[0005]      Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention provides a structural
column fixing system, including: a structural column including a first end portion
having a first column plate and an opposed second end portion having a second
column plate, the first column plate having two or more threaded apertures; and a cap
plate including a first side adapted to be fixed to the column and a second opposed
side adapted to interface with a structural element, the cap plate having two or more
countersunk apertures adapted to align with the two or more threaded apertures when
the cap plate is fixed to the column; and two or more fasteners with countersunk
heads adapted to be received in the two or more countersunk apertures in the cap
plate and to be threaded into the two or more threaded apertures to fix the cap plate
to the column, whereby a top of the countersunk heads of the two or more fasteners
is substantially flush with the second side of the cap plate when the cap plate is fixed
to the column.
[0006]      Preferably, the structural column is made from steel or some other suitable
metal, and the structural column fixing system fixes the cap plate to the column using
fasteners instead of welding the cap plate to the column. The top of the heads of the
fasteners is substantially flush when the cap plate is fixed to the column so as to not
interfere with the interfacing with the structural element, such as a structural beam.
Thus, the structural column fixing system eliminates the necessity for welding and
offers a versatile structural column fixing system that can replace the traditional pre
fabricated column system described above as it can be more easily and quickly
assembled with the desired configurations at the construction site.
[0007]      In an embodiment, the cap plate has one or more holes or slots for further
fasteners to be received therethrough to interface with the structural element. In an
example, the structural element is a beam and the further fasteners are bolts that fix
the cap plate to the structural beam when it is flush with the beam. In an example,

                                              3
cap plates with various configurations of holes and slots are stored at the construction
site rather than being welded or fabricated to the top of the column at the
manufacturing site.
[0008]      In an embodiment, the structural column fixing system further includes a
base plate including a first side adapted to be fixed to a first end of a threaded rod
and a second opposed side adapted to interface with a further structural element,
such as a concrete floor. The second column plate has a threaded aperture adapted
to receive a second opposed end of the threaded rod therein. The threaded rod
provides adjustment of height of the structural column. Thus, in the embodiment, the
structural column has an adjustable height that is selected by users of the system by
rotating the threaded rod through the threaded aperture until the desired height is
reached. Thus, the adjustable height of the structural columns of the structural
column fixing system enables the structural columns stored on a construction site to
cater for a wide range of desired heights. The system is therefore a complete system
that provides structural columns that are suitable for most applications on the
construction site - eliminating the need for storing many different pre-fabricated
columns with different configurations at the construction site.
[0009]      Preferably, the base plate is welded to the threaded rod and the threaded
rod does not affect the desired load bearing characteristics of the column. Further,
the threaded rod rotates through the threaded aperture for only part of its length until
the desired height is reached to maintain the load bearing characteristics of the
column. For example, the threaded rod has a length of 450mm and can be threaded
to provide for 350mm of height adjustment.
[0010]      In an embodiment, the base plate has one or more holes or slots for further
fasteners to be received therethrough to interface with the further structural element.
For example, the further structural element is a concrete floor and the further
fasteners are bolts that fix the base plate to the floor. In an example, base plates with
various configurations of holes and slots are stored at the construction site and these
base plates all utilise the threaded rod as a fixing method to replace welding or
fabricating of the base plates to the bottom of the column. Further, having the base
plate being adjustable in height enables the column to be pre-fabricated and stored at
the constructions site at set lengths. The structural column fixing system thus

                                             4
enables users to pick parts, in the form of columns with set lengths and cap and base
plates with different configurations of hole and/or slots, from stock that is stored on
site, and then assembly them into a finished column.

Detailed Description
[0025]       Figure 1 shows a structural column fixing system 10 according to an
embodiment of the present invention. The system 10 is a structural steel column
fixing system which includes steel cap plates 12, steel structural columns 14, steel
base plates 16, and steel fasteners 18 in the form of set screws 18. As mentioned, it
will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that other metals instead of
steel can be utilised by the system 10 for one or more of these components. Figure 1
also shows the system 10 in the form of one fully assembled structural steel column.
[0026]      The structural steel column 14 component of the system 10 has a first end
portion 11 (i.e. the top of the column 14) having a first column plate 13, shown in
Figure 2 and 6, and an opposed second end portion 15 (i.e. the bottom of the column
14) having a second column plate 17, shown in Figure 5. The first column plate 13 of
the embodiment shown in detail in Figures 1 to 3 and Figure 6 has four threaded
apertures 20. These threaded apertures 20 are tapped at the manufacturing site by
the fabricator to provide the thread for the set-screws 18. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show
the cap plate 12 of the system 10 being fixed to the column 14, whereby Figure 2
shows the components of the system 10 in the disassembled position and Figure 3
shows the components of the system 10 in the assembled or fixed position.
[0027]       More specifically, the cap plate 12 has a first side 19 adapted to be fixed to
the first column plate 13 of the column 14, and a second opposed side 21 adapted to
interface with a structural element. As mentioned, in an example, the structural
element is a structural beam and the structural steel column is configured to support
the structural beam. The cap plate 12 shown in detail in Figure 2 has four
countersunk apertures 22 adapted to align with the four threaded apertures 20 when

                                              6
the cap plate 12 is fixed to the column 14 using four set-screws 18. It will also be
appreciated that different configurations of set-screws 18, threaded apertures 20, and
countersunk apertures 22 are envisaged for the system 10, such as the configuration
shown in Figure 10 which utilises only two set-screws 18, threaded apertures 20, and
countersunk apertures 22.
[0028]      In the embodiment, the set-screws 18 have countersunk heads that are
adapted to be received in the countersunk apertures 22 in the cap plate 12 and to be
threaded into the threaded apertures 20 to fix the cap plate 12 to the column 14, as
shown in Figure 3. It can be seen in Figure 3 that the top of the countersunk heads of
the set-screws 18 is substantially flush with the second side 21 of the cap plate 12
when the cap plate 12 is fixed to the column 14. The cap plate 12 also has two slots
24 for further fasteners to be received therethrough to interface with the structural
element, such as the structural beam. Thus, in an example, an assembled structural
column, which is assembled according to the system 10, is then fixed to the structural
beam without the need for the cap plate 12 to be welded to the column 14 on the
construction site or in a manufacturing facility of the components of the system 10.
[0029]      The base plate 16 shown in Figure 1 and Figure 4 has a first side 23
adapted to be fixed to a first end 25 of a threaded rod 26 and a second opposed side
27 adapted to interface with a further structural element, such as a concrete floor.
The second column plate 17, shown in Figure 5, has a threaded aperture 28 in the
centre of the second column plate 17 that is adapted to receive a second opposed
end 29 of the threaded rod 26 therein. The threaded aperture 28 is also tapped at the
manufacturing site to provide the thread by the fabricator. In this manner, the
threaded rod 26 provides for adjustment in height of the structural steel column 14
when being assembled at the construction site, and once the desired height is
achieved, lock nut 30 is tightened by user of the system 10 so that the height cannot
be inadvertently altered.
[0030]      The threaded rod 26 has a length of, for example, 450mm, and the
threaded rod 26 is configured to rotate through the threaded aperture 28 for 350mm
of this length until a desired height of the structural steel column 14 is reached.
Thus, the structural steel column 14 has 350mm of height adjustment available to the

                                                7
user, and 100mm of the threaded rod is retained within the structural steel column 14
to maintain its load bearing characteristics.
[0031]       The base plate 16 shown in Figure 1 has eight holes 31 for further
fasteners to be received therethrough to interface with the further structural element,
such as the floor. In an example, these fasteners are concrete bolts that are inserted
into drilled holes in the concrete floor to fix the assembled column of the system 10
into position at the construction site. It will also be appreciated that different
configurations of holes 31 for interfacing with the floor are envisaged. For example,
the configuration shown in Figure 4 utilises four holes 31 for fasteners to be received
therethrough to interface with the floor. Figure 4 also shows the threaded rod 26
projecting from the base plate 16. In some embodiments, the threaded rod 26 is
welded onto the base plate 16 at the manufacturing site. In other embodiments, the
threaded rod 26 is threaded onto the base plate 16 via a tapped hole in the base plate
16.
[0032]       Figures 7 to 12 show different configurations of cap plates 12 that can be
used by the system 10. It will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that
many other configurations are possible provided that the cap plates 12 have two or
more countersunk apertures 22 that are adapted to align with two or more
corresponding threaded apertures 20 when the cap plates 12 are fixed to the column
14.
[0033]       More specifically, Figure 7 shows a configuration of cap plate 12 whereby
the cap plate 12 has four countersunk apertures 22 and four slots for further fasteners
to be received therethrough to interface with one or more structural beams. And
Figure 9 shows a configuration of cap plate 12 whereby the cap plate 12 has four
countersunk apertures 22 and only two slots. Figure 8 shows a configuration of cap
plate 12 whereby the cap plate 12 has four countersunk apertures 22, one slot for a
fastener to be received therethrough to interface with one or more structural beams,
and a further tapped hole 32 for a fastener to be threaded therethrough to further fix
the structural beam to the cap plate 12.
[0034]       Figure 10 shows a configuration of cap plate 12 whereby the cap plate 12
has two countersunk apertures 22 for fixing to the column 14 and two threaded rods

                                              8
projecting therefore to interface with the structural beam. As above, in some
embodiments, these threaded rods 34 are welded onto the cap plate 12 at the
manufacturing site or the threaded rods 34 are threaded onto the cap plate 12 via
tapped holes in the cap plate 12.
[0035]      Figures 11 and 12 show configurations of cap plate 12 in the form of a
bracket with four countersunk apertures 22. In both Figures, the cap plate 12 has
various holes 36 in the upright portion of the bracket for further fasteners to be
received therethrough to interface with one or more structural beams, and various
tapped holes 32 for fastener to be threaded therethrough to further fix the structural
beams to the cap plate 12.
[0036]      Finally, Figure 13 shows another embodiment of the column 14 of the
system 10. In this embodiment, the column 14 has holes 38 at designated intervals
towards the top of the column 14. These holes 38 can be used, for example, to assist
the users in locating the column 14 in the desired position at the construction site. It
will be appreciated that other configurations of these holes on the column 14 are
envisaged, such as the holes extending along the length of the column 14 at
designated intervals.
[0037]      It will also be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that the
invention described herein is susceptible to variations and modifications other than
those specifically described. It is to be understood that the invention includes all such
variations and modifications.
