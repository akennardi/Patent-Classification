 [0001] This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2014239322,
which is the Australian national phase of PCT/US2014/027556, and claims the benefit of
U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/783,437, filed 14 March 2013. The entire content of
each of these applications is incorporated herein by reference.
                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]    The present invention relates to interferon-free treatment for hepatitis C virus
(HCV).
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]    The HCV is an RNA virus belonging to the Hepacivirus genus in the Flaviviridae
family. The enveloped HCV virion contains a positive stranded RNA genome encoding all
known virus-specific proteins in a single, uninterrupted, open reading frame. The open
reading frame comprises approximately 9500 nucleotides and encodes a single large
polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. The polyprotein comprises a core protein, envelope
proteins E l and E2, a membrane bound protein p7, and the nonstructural proteins NS2, NS3,
NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B.
[0004]    Chronic HCV infection is associated with progressive liver pathology, including
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic hepatitis C may be treated with
peginterferon-alpha in combination with ribavirin. Substantial limitations to efficacy and
tolerability remain as many users suffer from side effects, and viral elimination from the body
is often incomplete. Therefore, there is a need for new therapies to treat HCV infection.
                          BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0005]    One aspect of the present invention features methods for treating HCV infection in a
subject in need of such treatment. The methods comprise administering at least two direct
acting antiviral agents (DAAs) and ribavirin to the subject for a duration of no more than 12
weeks, or for another duration as set forth herein. The at least two DAAs comprise
Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof). Preferably, the duration of the treatment is 12
weeks. The duration of the treatment can also be, for example, no more than 8 weeks.
Preferably, the two or more DAAs are administered in amounts effective to provide a
sustained virological response (SVR) or achieve another desired measure of effectiveness in
the subject. The subject is not administered interferon during the treatment regimen. Put

                                                la
another way, the methods exclude the administration of interferon to the subject, thereby
avoiding the side effects associated with interferon.
[0006]   Another aspect of the present invention features methods for treating a population of
subjects having HCV infection. The methods comprise administering at least two DAAs and
ribavirin to the

subjects for a duration of no more than 12 weeks. The at least two DAAs comprise Compound 1 (or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof).
Preferably, the at least two DAAs are administered to the subjects in amounts effective to result in SVR
or another measure of effectiveness in at least about 70% of the population, preferably at least about 80%
of the population, or more preferably at least about 90% of the population.
[00071       In any method described herein, the at least two DAAs comprise (a) Compound 1 or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and (b) Compound 2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof. The at least two DAAs can also optionally comprise another anti-HCV agent. The other optional
anti-HCV agent can be selected from protease inhibitors, nucleoside or nucleotide polymerase inhibitors,
non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors, NS3B inhibitors, NS4A inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors, NS5B
inhibitors, cyclophilin inhibitors, or combinations thereof.    For example, in some embodiments, the
DAAs used in a method of the present invention comprise or consist of (a) Compound 1 or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and (b) Compound 2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof. For another example, the DAAs used in a method of the present invention comprise or consist of
(a) Compound 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, (b) Compound 2 or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof, and (c) a HCV polymerase inhibitor, wherein said HCV polymerase inhibitor can
be a nucleotide or nucleoside polymerase inhibitor or a non-nucleoside or non-nucleotide polymerase
inhibitor.
[0008]       Non-limiting examples of the other optional antic-HCV agent include PSI-7977 (sofosbuvir),
PSI-938, BMS-790052 (daclatasvir), BMS-650032 (asunaprevir), BMS-791325, GS-5885 (ledipasvir),
GS-9451     (tegobuvir),  GS-9190,   GS-9256,    BI-201335,   BI-27127, telaprevir, VX-222,       TMC-435
(simepravir), MK-5172, MK-7009 (vaniprevir), danoprevir, R7128 (mericitabine), and any combination
thereof.
[0009]       In any method described herein, the DAAs can be administered in any effective dosing
schemes and/or frequencies; for example, they can each be administered daily.          Each DAA can be
administered either separately or in combination, and each DAA can be administered once a day, twice a
day, or three times a day. Preferably, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) and
Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) are administered once daily.
[0010]       Preferably, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered from
100 mg to 600 mg once daily, and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is
administered from 50 to 500 mg once daily.         More preferably, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof) is administered from 200 mg to 600 mg once daily, and Compound 2 (or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered from 100 to 500 mg once daily.            Highly
preferably, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered from 400 mg to
                                                      2

600 mg once daily, and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered from
100 to 500 mg once daily. For instance, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) can
be administered 400 mg once daily, and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is
administered 120 mg once daily. For another instance, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt thereof) can be administered 400 mg once daily, and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt thereof) can be administered 240 mg once daily.
[0011]       In yet another aspect, the present invention features a combination of Compound 1 (or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof),
together with ribavirin, for use to treat HCV infection. The treatment comprises administering the DAAs
and ribavirin to a subject infected with HCV.      The duration of the treatment regimen is no more than
twelve weeks (e.g., the duration being 12 weeks; or the duration being 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, or 3 weeks).
Preferably, the duration of the treatment regimen is twelve weeks. The duration of the treatment can also
last, for example, no more than eight weeks (e.g., the duration being 8 weeks; or the duration being 7, 6, 5,
4, or 3 weeks). The treatment does not include administering interferon. Compound 1 (or the salt thereof)
and Compound 2 (or the salt thereof) can be administered concurrently or sequentially.            Preferably,
Compound 1 (or the salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or the salt thereof) can be administered once daily.
As a non-limiting example, the patient being treated is infected with HCV genotype 1, such as genotype
la or lb. As another non-limiting example, the patient is infected with HCV genotype 2. As another
non-limiting example, the patient is infected with HCV genotype 3. As another non-limiting example, the
patient is infected with HCV genotype 4. As another non-limiting example, the patient is infected with
HCV genotype 5. As another non-limiting example, the patient is infected with HCV genotype 6. As yet
another non-limiting example, the patient is a HCV-treatment naive patient, a HCV-treatment experienced
patient, an interferon non-responder (e.g., a null responder), or not a candidate for interferon treatment.
As used in this application, the interferon non-responder patients include partial interferon responders and
interferon rebound patients. See    GUIDANCE FOR INDUSTRY - CHRONIC HEPATITIS C VIRUS INFECTION:
DEVELOPING DIRECT-ACTING ANTIVIRAL AGENTS FOR TREATMENT                     (FDA, September 2010, draft
guidance) for the definitions of naive, partial responder, responder relapser (i.e., rebound), and null
responder patients. The interferon non-responder patients also include null responder patients.        In one
example of this aspect of the invention, the treatment lasts for 12 weeks, and the subject being treated is a
naive patient infected with HCV genotype 1. In another example, the treatment lasts for 11 weeks, and
the subject being treated is a naive patient infected with HCV genotype 1. In still another example, the
treatment lasts for 10 weeks, and the subject being treated is a naive patient infected with HCV genotype
1. In yet another example, the treatment lasts for 9 weeks, and the subject being treated is a naive patient
infected with HCV genotype 1. In yet another example, the treatment lasts for 8 weeks, and the subject
                                                      3

being treated is a naive patient infected with HCV genotype 1. In yet another example, the treatment lasts
for 12 weeks, and the subject being treated is a naive patient infected with HCV genotype 3. In another
example, the treatment lasts for 11 weeks, and the subject being treated is a naive patient infected with
HCV genotype 3. In still another example, the treatment lasts for 10 weeks, and the subject being treated
is a naive patient infected with HCV genotype 3. In yet another example, the treatment lasts for 9 weeks,
and the subject being treated is a naive patient infected with HCV genotype 3.      In yet another example,
the treatment lasts for 8 weeks, and the subject being treated is a naive patient infected with HCV
genotype 3. In yet another example, the treatment lasts for 12 weeks, and the subject being treated is a
non-responder (e.g., a null responder) infected with HCV genotype 1. In another example, the treatment
lasts for 11 weeks, and the subject being treated is a non-responder (e.g., a null responder) infected with
HCV genotype 1. In still another example, the treatment lasts for 10 weeks, and the subject being treated
is a non-responder (e.g., a null responder) infected with HCV genotype 1. In yet another example, the
treatment lasts for 9 weeks, and the subject being treated is a non-responder (e.g., a null responder)
infected with HCV genotype 1. In yet another example, the treatment lasts for 8 weeks, and the subject
being treated is a non-responder (e.g., a null responder) infected with HCV genotype 1. In yet another
example, the treatment lasts for 12 weeks, and the subject being treated is a non-responder (e.g., a null
responder) infected with HCV genotype 3. In another example, the treatment lasts for 11 weeks, and the
subject being treated is a non-responder (e.g., a null responder) infected with HCV genotype 3.      In still
another example, the treatment lasts for 10 weeks, and the subject being treated is a non-responder (e.g., a
null responder) infected with HCV genotype 3. In yet another example, the treatment lasts for 9 weeks,
and the subject being treated is a non-responder (e.g., a null responder) infected with HCV genotype 3. In
yet another example, the treatment lasts for 8 weeks, and the subject being treated is a non-responder (e.g.,
a null responder) infected with HCV genotype 3.

                                                 Compound 2
Compound 2 is a potent NS5A inhibitor and is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No.
2012/0220562.
[0024]       The current standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of HCV includes a course of treatment of
interferon, e.g. pegylated interferon (e.g., pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or pegylated interferon-alpha-2b,
such as PEGASYS by Roche, or PEG-INTRON by Schering-Plough) and the antiviral drug ribavirin (e.g.,
COPEGUS        by  Roche,    REBETOL        by  Schering-Plough,    or RIBASPHERE        by   Three   Rivers
Pharmaceuticals).    The treatment often lasts for 24-48 weeks, depending on hepatitis C virus genotype.
Other interferons include, but are not limited to, interferon-alpha-2a (e.g., Roferon-A by Roche),
interferon-alpha-2b (e.g., Intron-A by Schering-Plough), and interferon alfacon- 1 (consensus interferon)
(e.g., Infergen by Valeant).
[00251       The interferon-based treatment may be physically demanding, and can lead to temporary
disability in some cases. A substantial proportion of patients will experience a panoply of side effects
ranging from a "flu-like" syndrome (the most common, experienced for a few days after the weekly
injection of interferon) to severe adverse events including anemia, cardiovascular events and psychiatric
                                                       6

problems such as suicide or suicidal ideation. The latter are exacerbated by the general physiological
stress experienced by the patients.
[0026]      The methods of the present invention provide effective treatment of HCV infection without
the use of interferon and for a shorter period of time, for example and without limitation, a treatment
duration of no more than twelve weeks, alternatively no more than eleven weeks, alternatively no more
than ten weeks, alternatively no more than nine weeks, alternatively no more than eight weeks,
alternatively no more than seven weeks, alternatively no more than six weeks, alternatively no more than
five weeks, alternatively no more than four weeks, or alternatively, no more than three weeks.
[00271      In one aspect, the present invention features methods for treating HCV infection in a subject
comprising administering at least two DAAs and ribavirin, in the absence of interferon, to the subject for
a duration of no more than twelve weeks, alternatively no more than eight weeks. Put another way, the
methods exclude interferon.      The at least two DAAs comprise Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), which can be co
administered, or administered separately or independently, with the same or different dosing frequencies.
Preferably, the at least two DAAs are administered once a day.           They can also be administered, for
example, twice a day or three times a day.
[0028]      Various measures may be used to express the effectiveness of a method of the present
invention. One such measure is SVR, which, as used herein, means that the virus is undetectable at the
end of therapy and for at least 8 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR8); preferably, the virus is
undetectable at the end of therapy and for at least 12 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR12); more
preferably, the virus is undetectable at the end of therapy and for at least 16 weeks after the end of therapy
(SVR16); and highly preferably, the virus is undetectable at the end of therapy and for at least 24 weeks
after the end of therapy (SVR24).     SVR24 is often considered as a functional definition of cure; and a
high rate of SVR at less than 24 week post-treatment (e.g., SVR8 or SVR12) can be predictive of a high
rate of SVR24.
[0029]      In some embodiments, a treatment regimen of the invention comprises treating a population of
subjects having HCV infection (e.g. treatment naive subjects), and the regimen comprises administering
at least two DAAs and ribavirin to the subjects for a duration of no more than 12 weeks, or for another
duration disclosed herein, wherein the at least two DAAs comprise Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), and are
administered to the subjects in amounts effective to provide an SVR (e.g., SVR12 or SVR24) in at least
about 70% of the population, alternatively at least about 75% of the population, alternatively at least
about 80% of the population, alternatively at least about 85% of the population, alternatively at least
about 90% of the population, alternatively at least about 95% of the population, alternatively about 100%
                                                       7

of the population.     In some embodiments, a treatment regimen of the invention comprises treating a
population of IFN experienced subjects (e.g., interferon non-responders) having HCV infection, and the
method comprises administering at least two DAAs and ribavirin to the subjects for a duration of no more
than 12 weeks, or for another duration disclosed herein, wherein the at least two DAAs comprise
Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof), and are administered to the subjects in amounts effective to provide an SVR (e.g.,
SVR12 or SVR24) in at least about 50% of the population, alternatively at least about 55% of the
population, alternatively at least about 60% of the population, alternatively at least about 65% of the
population, alternatively at least about 70% of the population, alternatively at least about 75% of the
population, alternatively at least about 80% of the population, alternatively at least about 85% of the

Example 1.        Clinical Modeling for Interferon-free DAA Combination Therapies
[00711       Treatment regimens comprising administration of Compound 1 and Compound 2 were
evaluated using clinical models described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013/0102526, filed
October 19, 2012 and entitled "Methods for Treating HCV", which is incorporated herein by reference in
its entirety. These treatment regimens comprised administration of Compound 1 and Compound 2, but
did not include administration of either interferon or ribavirin. However, similar SVR rates are expected
when ribavirin is added to these regimens.
                                                       26

[00721      Figure 1 shows the predicted median SVR percentages and 90% SVR confidence intervals for
2-DAA regimens consisting of the use of Compound 1 (400 mg once daily) and Compound 2 (120 mg
once daily) to treat genotype 1 naive subjects.       Different treatment durations were assessed.     The
predicted SVR rate for a 12-week treatment was about 95%. As used in all of the figures of the present
application, the vertical bar at the top of each SVR percentage column represents the 90% SVR
confidence interval, and the x-axis ("Time (weeks)") indicates the duration of each treatment regimen.
[0073]      Figure 2 illustrates the predicted median SVR percentages and 90% SVR confidence intervals
for 2-DAA regimens consisting of the use of Compound 1 (400 mg once daily) and Compound 2 (60 mg
once daily) to treat genotype 1 naive subjects.       Different treatment durations were assessed.     The
predicted SVR rate for a 12-week treatment was about 85-90%.
[0074]      Figure 3 shows the predicted median SVR percentages and 90% SVR confidence intervals for
2-DAA regimens consisting of the use of Compound 1 (600 mg once daily) and Compound 2 (480 mg
once daily) to treat genotype 1 naive subjects.       Different treatment durations were assessed.     The
predicted SVR rate for a 12-week treatment was about 100%.
[00751      Figure 4 depicts the predicted median SVR percentages and 90% SVR confidence intervals for
2-DAA regimen consisting of the use of Compound 1 (400 mg once daily) and Compound 2 (120 mg
once daily) to treat genotype 3 naive subjects.       Different treatment durations were assessed.     The
predicted SVR rate for a 12-week treatment was about 95%.
[0076]      Figure 5 illustrates the predicted median SVR percentages and 90% SVR confidence intervals
for 2-DAA regimen consisting of the use of Compound 1 (400 mg once daily) and Compound 2 (60 mg
once daily) to treat genotype 3 naive subjects.       Different treatment durations were assessed.     The
predicted SVR rate of a 12-week treatment was about 85-90%.
[00771      Figure 6 shows the predicted median SVR percentages and 90% SVR confidence intervals for
2-DAA regimens consisting of the use of Compound 1 (600 mg once daily) and Compound 2 (480 mg
once daily) to treat genotype 3 naive subjects.       Different treatment durations were assessed.     The
predicted SVR rate of a 12-week treatment was about 100%.
Example 2.       Combination of Compound 1 and Compound 2 In Vitro
[0078]      Figure 7 shows that the combination of Compound 1 and Compound 2 exhibits significant
synergistic effect on HCV inhibition as tested in HCV GT lb Con-i replication cells. The result was
generated using Prichard and Shipman model (Prichard et al. ANTIVIRAL     RESEARCH     14:181-205 (1990)).
[0079]     Compound 1 inhibited replication of HCV stable subgenomic replicons containing NS3 genes
from GT la, lb, 2a, 3a, 4a, or 6a with EC50 values ranging from 0.85 to 2.8 nM. Of note, Compound 1
                                                     27

was potent against replicon containing GT3a protease, with an EC5 0 value of 1.6 nM.            Compound 1
retained its activity against common GTla and lb variants at NS3 amino acid positions 155 and 168 that
conferred resistance to other HCV protease inhibitors (Pis). Resistant colony selection studies in GTla
and lb subgenomic replicon cells identified A156T in GTla and A156V in GTlb as the most frequent
variants, which conferred 1400- and 1800-fold reduced susceptibility to Compound 1, respectively.
However, these variants had in vitro replication capacities of only 1.5% and 9.2% that of their
corresponding wild-type replicons. In a replicon containing GT3a NS3 protease, Compound 1 selected
very few colonies at concentrations > 100-fold over its EC50 value.            The colonies that survived the
selection contained either A156G alone, or Q168R co-selected with Y56H, which conferred 1500- or
1100-fold loss in susceptibility to Compound 1, respectively.
