                                            ABSTRACT
         A headgear for use with a mask includes a first strap being configured to engage a
back of a patient's head and extend on either side of the patient's parietal bone behind the
patient's ears and assume, in use, a substantially circular or oval shape. At least a portion of
the first strap is substantially inextensible. The headgear also includes at least one second
strap configured to removably connect the first strap to the mask. The second strap may be
more extensible than the first strap. At least a portion of the first strap is self-supporting such
that the headgear maintains a three dimensional shape when not in use. The substantially
inextensible portion of the first strap is constructed to resiliently return to a predetermined
shape when not in use. The arcuate region includes a first portion that may be arranged to
align substantially parallel with a top of the patient's head and a second portion being
arranged to align substantially to a rear surface of the patient's head.

                                   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]           The present invention relates to headgear and a method of manufacturing the
headgear for use in holding a mask in position on a patient's face, the mask being used for
treatment, e.g., of Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) with Continuous Positive Airway
Pressure (CPAP) or Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV).
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]           Masks used for treatment of SDB such as OSA are typically held on a patient's
head by headgear. Headgear typically includes one or more headgear straps that are adapted
to engage with the mask and hold the mask in position on the patient's face. In addition,
headgear should be comfortable so that a patient can wear the mask at night while they sleep.
There is a continuous need in the art for headgear that is comfortable, fits a wide range of
patients, is easily manufactured, and is inexpensive.
[0004]           A problem with some prior art headgear is that a given size may fit very few
patients, or alternatively that they may require a large number of adjustments to fit. Another
problem with some prior art headgear is that they have a tendency to leave facial marks in
use. Another problem with some prior art headgear is that they are awkward and complicated
to use.
                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0005]           A first aspect of the present technology is to provide headgear for a respiratory
mask.
                                                   1

[00061           Another aspect of the present technology is to provide headgear that
comfortably fits a wide range of patients. Another aspect of the present technology is to
provide a lower cost method of manufacturing headgear for a respiratory mask. Another
aspect of the present technology is to provide a headgear that is easy to use.
[00071           One aspect of a headgear in accordance with the present technology is that a
rear portion of the headgear is constructed and arranged to remain relatively fixed in position
in use. In one form, the headgear comprises a rear portion that does not substantially "ride" or
slide forward. Another aspect that a preferred headgear does not impinge on the ears when in
use.
[0008]           In one form the rear portion of the headgear defines a rear loop that
circumscribes the rear of the head. In one form the rear portion comprises a rear loop that is
substantially inextensible along its length. In one form of the present technology headgear for
a respiratory mask is provided having a first region with a first extensibility and at least one
further region with a different extensibility. In one form the headgear comprises a generally
inextensible rear portion and an elastic side portion.
[0009]           One aspect of the present technology relates to headgear for use with a mask
and may include a rigidizer constructed of a rigid or semi-rigid material and adapted to
extend on either side of the patient's parietal bone, an upper strap adapted to removably
connect the rigidizer to an upper portion of the mask, and a lower strap adapted to removably
connect the rigidizer to a lower portion of the mask.
[0010]           Another aspect of the present technology relates to headgear for use with a
mask including a rigidizer constructed of a rigid or semi-rigid material and adapted to extend
along the patient's parietal and zygomatic bones, and one or more straps adapted to support
the rigidizer at the back of the patient's head.
[0011]           Another aspect of the present technology relates to headgear comprising a
relatively inextensible rear portion and a plurality of relatively extensible straps. Preferably in
use the relatively extensible straps interconnect the rear portion and a mask.
[0012]           Another aspect of the present headgear technology is a relatively low cost
manufacturing technique.
[0013]           Another aspect of the present technology relates to method of constructing
headgear comprising the step of die cutting relatively straight portions from a sheet of
                                                 2

material. Another aspect of the present technology relates to a high yield layout of headgear
strap components in a sheet.
 [0014]          Another aspect of the present technology may include a method of
manufacturing headgear for use with a mask, wherein the headgear comprises components
that are generally simple geometric shapes and capable of being cut from a flat piece of
material, wherein the method includes: a) cutting multiple components of the same type from
a single flat sheet of said material; b) components are nested against each other on said sheet
to minimize the amount of waste material that is removed and discarded; and c) wherein the
method produces a high manufacturing yield. Preferably, the high manufacturing yield is
defined by being greater than 11.5 headgears per metre 2 and the shapes may include:
generally rectangular or arcuate shapes.
 [0015]          Preferably, the shapes may include: generally rectangular or arcuate shapes;
and the components may include: straps or rigidizers.
 [0016]          Another aspect of the present technology may include a headgear assembly
for use to attach medical equipment to a patient's head, wherein the headgear comprises: a
plurality of elongated straps, wherein at least a portion of said straps includes a rigid or semi
rigid layer encapsulated between a first and second layer of flexible biocompatible material;
and further wherein a cushioning layer is also encapsulated between the first layer of material
and the rigid layer. Preferably, the layers of the straps are fixed by vulcanization or gluing
and the straps may include the rigid layer are positioned to the posterior of the head, when in
use. Preferably, the material is fabric.
 [00171          Another aspect of a headgear in accordance with the present technology is that
it has a lesser tendency to produce facial marks when compared to prior art. In one form,
headgear in accordance with the present technology has softened edges. In one form, joins are
located away from contact with the face. In one form, large radius edges are used. In one
form, die cut edges are not presented to the face in use.
 [0018]          Another aspect of the present technology may include a process for making
headgear including laminating foam and fabric material to one another, thermoforming the
laminated foam and fabric material, ultrasonically die cutting the thermoformed and
laminated foam and fabric material into one or more strap portions of the headgear, and
joining the one or more strap portions to one another.
                                                 3

[0019]           Another aspect of a preferred headgear in accordance with the present
technology is that it is constructed and arranged to assume a predetermined shape when not in
use. The predetermined shape may be substantially similar to the shape the headgear
assumes when being worn, making the headgear intuitively easier to use. In one form,
headgear in accordance with the present technology is constructed and arranged to "spring to
life" and assume the predetermined shape when removed from packaging and/or when a
force (e.g. compression) tending to deform the headgear is removed. In one form the
headgear comprises a portion constructed from a resilient material. In one form the headgear
comprises a self-supporting rear portion.
[0020]           A further aspect of the present technology relates to a headgear for use with a
mask comprising a rigidizer; a conformable material; and at least one fabric, wherein edges
of the at least one fabric are sealed by at least one joint so that the rigidizer, the conformable
material, and the at least one joint are encapsulated by the at least one fabric over at least a
portion of the headgear.
[0021]           A still further aspect of the present technology relates to a headgear for use
with a mask comprising a first strap being configured to engage a back of a patient's head
and extend on either side of the patient's parietal bone behind the patient's ears and assume,
in use, a substantially circular or oval shape, wherein at least a portion of the first strap is
substantially inextensible; and at least one second strap configured to removably connect the
first strap to the mask.
[0022]           Another aspect of the present technology relates to a headgear for use with a
mask comprising a first strap being configured to extend over the crown of a patient's head
and extend on either side of the patient's parietal bone and behind the patient's ears in use;
and at least one second strap configured to removably connect the first strap to the mask,
wherein at least a portion of the first strap is self-supporting such that the headgear maintains
a three dimensional shape when not in use.
[00231           An even further aspect of the present technology relates to a headgear for
holding a respiratory mask in position on a face of a patient comprising a rear portion; and
respective left and right side portions adapted for connection with the respiratory mask,
wherein the rear portion comprises a substantially inextensible arcuate region constructed to
resiliently return to a predetermined shape when not in use, the arcuate region including a
                                                   4

first portion being arranged to align substantially parallel with a top of the patient's head and
a second portion being arranged to align substantially to a rear surface of the patient's head.
[0024]          Yet another aspect of the present technology relates to a method of
manufacturing a headgear for use with a mask comprising placing a rigidizer over a first
foam and first fabric lamination; placing a second foam over the rigidizer and a second fabric
over the second foam; thermoforming the first foam and the first fabric lamination, the
rigidizer, the second foam, and the second fabric to form a thermoformed sheet; and
ultrasonically cutting the thermoformed sheet around a perimeter of the headgear.
[0025]          Another aspect of the present technology is to provide one size of headgear
that fits a wide range of patients, reducing or eliminating the need to make adjustments to
headgear to achieve a fit. In one form of the present technology, a rear portion of headgear is
provided having a fixed size that does not require adjustment to fit a wide range of patients.

              DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS
[0073]           The following description is provided in relation to several embodiments
which may share common characteristics and features. It is to be understood that one or
more features of any one embodiment may be combinable with one or more features of the
other embodiments. In addition, any single feature or combination of features in any of the
embodiments may constitute additional embodiments.
[0074]           In this specification, the word "comprising" is to be understood in its "open"
sense, that is, in the sense of "including", and thus not limited to its "closed" sense, that is the
sense of "consisting only of'. A corresponding meaning is to be attributed to the
corresponding words "comprise", "comprised" and "comprises" where they appear.
"Rigidizer" means and includes any reinforcing element that increases the rigidity of an
another item and may include an object that increases rigidity in one or more axes.
[00751           In this specification, a substantially "inextensible" structure will be taken to
mean a structure that when subject to the forces normally encountered in use of a respiratory
mask, will have an elongation of less than about 5%, more preferably less than about 3%.
[00761           In this specification a "self-supporting" structure will be taken to mean a
structure that can substantially support its own weight under the force of gravity. Such a self
supporting structure will be contrasted with a "floppy" structure that is unable to support its
own weight under gravity.
[00771           In this specification a "rigid" structure is intended to mean a structure
relatively more rigid than a "floppy" structure, such as the fabrics typically used as headgear.
Such fabrics are typically unable to hold a predefined shape under gravity. A rigid structure
                                                   8

may be able to redirect vectors around physical structures such as ears, unlike a floppy fabric
that may bend or buckle.
1. Headgear
[00781            The figures illustrate headgear according to alternative embodiments of the
present technology. In the illustrated embodiments, headgear are adapted to be removably
attached to a mask to hold and maintain the mask in a desired position on a patient's face.
While headgear may be illustrated as being used with a particular type of mask, it should be
appreciated that each headgear may be adapted for use with other suitable masks. That is, the
masks are merely exemplary, and each headgear embodiment may be adapted for use with
any suitable mask, e.g., full-face mask, nasal mask, mouth mask, nozzles or puffs, nasal
prongs, etc, with any suitable configuration, e.g., with or without forehead support.
[00791            Also, it should be appreciated that the headgear may be used with a new mask
or the headgear may be retrofit to an existing mask.
[00801            In embodiments, the headgear arrangement, material, and/or adjustability may
be designed to enhance usability, maintenance, comfort, and/or aesthetics. Also, the
headgear arrangement, materials, and/or adjustability may be designed to enhance the range
of fit, e.g., one size fits all.
[00811            An advantage of a headgear in accordance with the present technology is that
it is relatively self-supporting and/or able to hold its shape without being worn. This can
make it more intuitive or obvious for patients to understand how to use the headgear and may
contrast with headgear systems that are entirely floppy and do not retain their shape. In one
form the self-supporting aspect of the headgear is provided by the use of stiffened and/or
thickened elements. In another embodiment, the headgear arrangement, material, and/or
adjustability may be designed so that e.g., headgear springs out of the box and generally into
its in-use configuration. In addition, the headgear arrangement may hold its in use shape once
out of the box, for example a rigidizer may be formed to maintain the shape of some or part
of the headgear.
[0082]            Advantages to the patient of the present technology may include (but are not
limited to) one or more of the following: a comfortable headgear system, a perceived level of
comfort and quality, a smooth continuous headgear shape that is appealing to the consumer, a
pillow-like appearance of the headgear that is soft to touch and comfortable to wear, and/or
                                                  9

headgear that is pre-formed in the shape it is intended to be worn and is able to support itself
in this shape such that the orientation of the headgear is clear. The orientation of the
headgear is clear to the patient as the shape of the headgear is generally curved much like the
rear portion of the patient's head. That is, the headgear is generally dome shaped.
[00831          In addition, the headgear is able to maintain its shape due to the manufacturing
processes employed to construct the headgear and/or the combination of materials it
comprises.
[0084]          Another aspect of the headgear described herein is to direct the mask system
to direct contact with the patient's face, that is, the vector of the headgear may cause the
mask to apply pressure perpendicular or normal to the patient's face.
[00851          The headgear may further avoid contacting or obstructing the patient's eyes
and ears.
[00861          The headgear may also be arranged such that it may fit a wider range of
patients with only one size.
1.1 Headgear Attachment to Mask
[00871          Preferably, each headgear includes two side portions with a rear portion
connecting the side portions. The side portions provide a four-point attachment with a mask
which is consistent with prior headgear, e.g., allows headgear to be retrofit. However, it
should be appreciated that the headgear may be structured to provide more or fewer
attachment points, e.g., 2 point attachment with a mask, 3 point attachment with the mask, 5
point attachment with the mask.
[00881          In addition, the headgear may be constructed and arranged to provide force
vectors at the mask which are consistent with prior headgear. For example, the headgear may
be arranged such that the force vectors applied by the headgear to the mask are substantially
perpendicular to the mask and substantially parallel to one another (e.g., see Fig. 1). This
arrangement enhances the mask seal as the headgear forces the mask directly into the patient's
face. However, adjustment of the headgear vectors may be necessary, e.g., depending on the
type of mask used with the headgear.
                                                  10

1.2 Rigidizers
[0089]           The headgear may include one or more rigidizers constructed of a rigid or
semi-rigid material that are structured to add rigidity to the headgear and anchor the headgear
in position in use. Rigidizer may be able to bend or deform along its length but resist or
prevent stretching of the headgear in the lengthwise direction of the rigidizer. The rigidizers
may be substantially inextensible. The rigidizer may be resilient. A rigidizer in accordance
with the present technology preferably has one or more of the following features:
[0090]           -holds it shape;
[0091]           -allows headgear to redirect seal-force vectors around curves such as around
the eyes, or around the ears;
[0092]           -ability to flex; and/or
[00931           -in certain planes provides a structure to maintain a predefined form.
1.2.1 Rigidizer Positioning
[0094]           The one or more rigidizers may be configured and positioned to engage
alternative regions of the patient's head, e.g., for comfort, aesthetics, usability, etc.
[0095]           The preferred positioning on the patient head is for the rigidizer to engage the
posterior portion of the patient's skull or head. Additionally, it is advantageous not to cover
the posterior portion of the patient's head to promote comfort whilst the patient is sleeping or
in a prone position. Preferably, the rigidizer partially or fully surrounds or encompasses the
parietal and/or occipital regions of the patient's skull. This rigidizer is preferably mounted in
an axis that is approximately parallel to the orientation of the mask on the patient's face,
when the headgear and mask combination are worn.
1.2.1.1 Parietal Rigidizer
[0096]           Figs. 1-3 illustrate headgear including rigidizers structured to conform to
either side in a substantially vertical orientation on the patient's parietal bone to anchor the
headgear in position.
[00971           Preferably, the rigidizer is relatively not elastic nor extendible along its length
and is generally comprised of material that is resilient in nature.
[0098]           In Fig. 1, a rigidizer 60 is provided on each side of the patient's head with each
rigidizer 60 including an elongated main body 62, a lower arm 64 extending generally
                                                   11

transverse from a lower end of the main body, and an upper arm 66 extending generally
transverse and spaced downwardly from an upper end of the main body. An upper side strap
20 removably connects an upper portion of the mask 10 (e.g., via forehead support) to the
upper arm 66, a lower side strap 30 removably connects a lower portion of the mask 10 (e.g.,
via headgear clip associated with clip receptacle) to the lower arm 64, a top strap 40 (e.g.,
elastic joining member) is adapted to pass over the top of the patient's head in use and
interconnect the upper ends of opposing rigidizers 60, and a rear strap 50 is adapted to pass
behind the patient's head in use and interconnect the lower ends of opposing rigidizers 60.
[0099]          In an embodiment, the upper side strap 20 could be a single piece extending
across the patient's forehead from one upper arm 66 to the opposing upper arm 66 on the
other side of the patient's head. Preferably, the upper side strap 20 does not extend
rearwardly significantly past the patient's ears. Also, Fig. 1 illustrates in dashed lines a
potential extent of the upper and lower arms 66, 64. In an alternative embodiment, the upper
arm 66 may be a single piece structured to extend across the patient's forehead from one main
body 62 to the opposing main body 62 on the other side of the patient's head.
[00100]         In Fig. 2, each rigidizer 260 has a composite construction (as described below)
and is arranged such that the upper and lower side straps 220, 230 are continuous and extend
from upper and lower portions of the mask, and through respective rigidizers 260, which
rigidizers 260 extend along the parietal bone of the patient's head.
[00101]         In an embodiment, each of the upper side straps 220, lower side straps 230 and
rigidizer 260 may have different elastic properties so as to allow adjustability and stability to
the mask on the patient's face in use.
[00102]         In an example, the upper side strap 220 may be constructed from an extensible
material to allow for adjustment of the mask when in use. For example, the upper side strap
220 may be made from elastic. Furthermore, the extensibility provided by the upper strap
may allow for a greater fit range of patients. Additionally, the lower side straps 230 may be
made from a material with lower extensibility than that of the upper side strap. That is, the
lower side straps 230 may be constructed of a material with less stretch for a given force
when compared to the material used for upper side strap 220. This is to secure the mask in
position while allowing for some adjustment of the mask position on the face of the patient.
Furthermore, the rigidizers 260 may be less extensible and less elastic than upper side strap
                                                 12

220 and/or lower side strap 230 so as to provide structure and support to the headgear and
thus adequately anchor the mask to the patient's head in use.
[00103]          Upper side straps 220 and/ or lower side straps 230 may be constructed from a
composite material such as Breath-O-Prene TM, and die cut from bulk material. Upper side
straps 220 and/or lower side straps 230 may be constructed from a narrow weave material so
as to reduce or eliminate the waste incurred by die cutting.
[00104]          In Fig. 3, the rigidizer 360 has a mesh construction adapted to sit over the
patient's occiput. As illustrated, the rigidizer 360 is generally trapezoidal shaped with an
upper end adapted to removably connect to upper side straps 320 associated with an upper
portion of the mask and a lower end adapted to removably connect to lower side straps 330
associated with a lower portion of the mask. The mesh-like rigidizer 360 may be flexible to
conform to the patient's head yet non-stretch to anchor the headgear in position, for example.
However, the mesh may have other suitable constructions.
[00105]          In each embodiment, the rigidizers extend generally vertical along the parietal
bone of the patient's head and are adapted to cup and/or rest on the patient's occiput. As
illustrated, the parietal bone rigidizers may be connected at the top and/or bottom (i.e., in
order to sit over the occiput) and may include additional rigid or semi-rigid components to
facilitate connection (e.g., see strap connectors in Figs. 2 and 3). Also, the rigidizers avoid
the use of any rigid or semi-rigid components at the back of the head where the patient's head
would contact the bed in use. Preferably, the rigidizers are flexible or able to conform to the
patient's head along their length, however cannot flex or deform across their width. This is so
that the headgear is comfortable whilst maintaining its structural function of anchoring the
mask in position.
1.2.1.2 Parietal and Zygomatic Rigidizer
[00106]          Figs. 4-5 illustrate headgear including rigidizers structured to conform to
either side of the patient's parietal bone (i.e., in a generally vertical orientation) to anchor the
headgear in position at the back of the patient's head, and extend to the front of the patient's
head to the patient's zygomatic bone.
[001071          In Fig. 4, the rigidizer 460 is a continuous component with two side portions
adapted to extend across the mask 10. As illustrated, each side portion includes an upper
strap portion 462 that extends along the patient's parietal bone over the patient's ear and to the
                                                   13

patient's zygomatic bone, and a lower strap portion 464 that extends below the patient's ear.
The upper strap portion 462 extends across an upper portion of the mask 10 and the lower
strap portion 464 extends across a lower portion of the mask 10.
[00108]          As shown in Fig. 4A, the upper strap portion 462 may be removably clipped
onto the mask 10. As illustrated, the upper portion of the mask 10 may include a plurality of
spaced apart slots 15, and a clip 470 may extend through an opening in the upper strap
portion 462 and into a selected one of the slots 15.
[00109]          A flexible strap arrangement including an upper rear strap 440 and a lower
rear strap 450 connect the left and right sides of the rigidizers 460 at the back of the patient's
head. Upper rear strap 440 and lower rear strap 450 may be a continuous component, or may
be separate components.
[00110]          In Fig. 5, each rigidizer 560 is a continuous component adapted to connect to a
respective side of the mask 10. As illustrated, each rigidizer 560 includes an upper strap
portion 562 that extends along the patient's parietal bone over the patient's ear and to the
patient's zygomatic bone, a lower strap portion 564 that extends below the patient's ear, and a
front strap portion 566 adapted to connect to the mask 10.
[00111]          In the illustrated embodiment, each rigidizer 560 is adapted to rotatably
engage the side of the mask 10 (e.g., clip onto the side of the mask, wrap around anchor on
the side of the mask) to allow rotational movement of the mask relative to the rigidizers 560,
so that the mask can be rotated and adjusted for proper mask fit.
[00112]          An upper rear strap 540 and a lower rear strap 550 connect the left and right
sides of the rigidizers 560 at the back of the patient's head.
1.2.1.3 Occipital and Parietal Rigidizer
[00113]          Figs. 6-11 illustrate headgear including rigidizers structured to form a
substantially complete circle/oval shape (e.g., could have an arc removed at the occiput for
adjustability) to anchor the headgear in position at the back of the patient's head. As
illustrated, the rigidizers extend along the patient's parietal and occipital bones.
[00114]          In Figs. 6-7, the rigidizer 660 includes a substantially circular or oval shape
with an arc removed at the lower end. The portion removed at the lower end may allow
adjustment of the size of the circle/oval shape.
                                                  14

[00115]          An upper side strap 620 removably connects an upper portion of the mask 10
(e.g., via forehead support) to the rigidizer and a lower side strap 630 removably connects a
lower portion of the mask 10 (e.g., via headgear clip associated with clip receptacle) to the
rigidizer.
[00116]          Preferably, lower side strap 630 and/or rigidizer 660 engage with the occipital
bone in order to maintain the rigidizer in position and prevent the headgear from riding up the
back of the patient's head in use. In another preferred form, the upper side strap 620 and/or
rigidizer 660 could capture or pass over the upper most part of the patient's parietal bone in
use, so as to prevent the headgear from slipping back down the patient's head in use.
[001171          In another embodiment, upper side strap 620 and/or lower side strap 630 may
have adjustable lengths. This may be achieved through the use of, for example, hook and loop
fasteners. The lengths of the upper side strap 620 and/or lower side strap 630 should be such
that the rigidizer 660 does not impinge on the patient's ear. For example, it could be possible
to adjust the length of the upper side strap 620 or lower side strap 630 such that the rigidizer
is urged towards the patient's face, and thus contacts the ear. This may cause discomfort to
the patient.
[001181          In another preferred embodiment, lower side strap 630 is threaded through
apertures in rigidizer 660 such that rigidizer 660 may slide along the length of lower side
strap 630, thereby adjusting the size of the space encapsulated by rigidizer 660 and thus
altering the shape of the headgear to suit different patient's head sizes. In another preferred
form, lower side strap 630 may have engaging portions along its length such that if the size of
the space encapsulated by rigidizer 660 is adjusted by sliding rigidizer 660 along the length
of lower side straps 630, the position of the rigidizer 660 on lower side straps 630 can be
secured in position. For example, engaging portions may be clips, Velcro, raised stitching, or
any other means of securing the rigidizer 660 in position.
[00119]          In another preferred embodiment, upper side strap 620, lower side strap 630
and/or rigidizer 660 maybe be formed individually such that each component is manufactured
efficiently and cost effectively, (i.e. by nesting the components) as will be described below.
[00120]          As shown in Fig. 15, rigidizer 660 may be formed from a flat component and
then bent or deformed into a shape suitable for use. Rigidizer 660 may be die cut from sheet
material. Rigidizer 660 may have upper apertures 2000 for engagement with upper side straps
620. Multiple upper apertures 2000 may be provided (for example, as shown in Fig. 15 there
                                                  15

are 4 apertures) so that the patient can adjust the position of upper side strap 620. Rigidizer
660 may also have lower apertures 2100 for engagement with lower side straps 630.
[00121]          Figs. 8-9 show the headgear of Figs. 6-7 attached to a mask with a different
configuration. In this embodiment, the upper side strap 620 connects to a lateral outrigger of
the mask 10 and the lower side strap 630 removably connects to the mask 10 via headgear
clip associated with a mask clip receptacle. As best shown in Fig. 8, the upper side strap 630
may be connected to the lateral outrigger of the mask 10 by an adhesive, so that the upper
side strap is adjustable only at the rigidizer. Alternatively, the upper side strap 630 may be
adjustably connected to the slot provided at the end of the lateral outrigger of the mask 10, so
that the upper side strap may be adjustable at both the rigidizer and lateral outrigger.
[00122]          Figs. 10-11 show an alternative configuration for attaching the rigidizer 660 to
the upper and lower side straps 620, 630 as described below.
[00123]          Fig. 40 shows an alternative arrangement for a rigidizer 7560 adapted to be
positioned along a general rear portion of the patient's head in use. The rigidizer may be
formed in a generally light bulb shape, where there are two generally round or curved
portions, i.e., an upper portion 7562 adapted to engage the general region of the parietal bone
of the patient's head in use and a lower portion 7564 adapted to engage the general region of
the occipital bone of the patient's head in use. Upper straps 7512 are provided to the upper
portion 7562 for engaging an upper portion of a mask, and lower straps 7514 are provided to
the lower portion 7564 for engaging a lower portion of a mask.
1.2.2 Rigidizer/Strap Attachment
[00124]          The one or more rigidizers may be coupled to the mask and/or with one
another in alternative configurations.
[00125]          In an embodiment, each rigidizer may include one or more slots to allow
headgear straps to pass through it. For example, in Fig. 1, each end of the main body 62, the
end of the lower arm 64, and the end of the upper arm 66 include a slot to allow the headgear
strap to pass through it in use. Fig. 3 shows the mesh-like rigidizer 360 with upper and lower
connectors 365, 366 (e.g., overmolded to mesh) with slots for receiving headgear straps. In
Fig. 5, the rear portion of rigidizer 560 may include upper and lower slots for receiving upper
and lower rear straps 540, 550. Figs. 6-11 also show one or more slots provided to the
rigidizer 660 for receiving headgear straps.
                                                 16

[001261         In another embodiment, the rigidizer may provide loops to receive headgear
straps. For example, in Fig. 2, upper and lower ends of the rigidizer 260 include connectors
265 that provide a loop for receiving respective headgear straps. The lower connectors 265
are aligned with a slot in the rigidizer covering so that the lower strap 230 passes through the
slot positioned at the back of the patient's head, i.e., lower strap 230 passes through a void in
the rigidizer 260.
[001271         Figs. 10-13 show an arrangement wherein the rigidizer and straps provide a
press stud arrangement. As illustrated, the lower end of the rigidizer may include a strap
portion 662 with a plurality of holes 663, and one end of the lower strap 630 may provide a
stud 665 (e.g., overmolded or sonically welded to strap) adapted to be press fit into a selected
one of the holes 663. As shown in Fig. 13, the stud 665 and holes 663 are configured to
provide a snap fit arrangement. The opposite end of the lower strap 630 may include a
Velcro® tab for attachment to the mask.
[00128]         Figs. 25A to 25C show a further adjustment mechanism for a top strap 4412.
A forehead support 5000 may be provided to a mask 10. Forehead support 5000 may allow
the top strap to be looped through an aperture 5005. As best shown in Fig. 25C, forehead
support may be provided with a push tab 5010 that is pre loaded or biased with spring 5025
so as to allow for engagement and disengagement of looped through portion of the top strap
4412. Gripping portion 5015 may be provided on an opposite side of the forehead support
5000 to push tab 5010 for the patient to stabilize the mechanism on their forehead. Additional
gripping portion 5020 may be provided at the end of looped portion of top strap 4412.
Additional gripping portion 5020 may also prevent disassembly of the looped portion by
pulling it back through aperture 5005.
[00129]         Fig. 26 also shows a further alternative method of adjusting bottom straps
4513, wherein the perforations 6000 may be provided along the length of the bottom strap
4513 that may allow the patient to tear or cut segments of the bottom strap 4513 off to
shorten its length. Perforations 6000 may be weakened regions along the bottom strap 4513,
for example thinner cross section, narrower strap width.
Additional Embodiments
[00130]         Fig. 18 also shows a first strap 3010 with an encapsulated rigidizer 3001 that
may have bows or bends 4000. Bends 4000 may be provided in select region(s) of rigidizer
                                                 17

3001 to allow the rigidizer to readily flex or hinge at the region(s). This may be beneficial for
fitting a larger range of patient head sizes. As shown in Fig. 18, bends 4000 may be
positioned so as to allow lower portions of the rigidizer to flex outwards towards the ears of
the patient or inwards towards the centre of the patient's head. Bends 4000 may be weakened
regions to achieve a similar flexibility in the rigidizer 3001. For example, bends 4000 may be
curved portions, portions with a thinned cross section, narrowed portions of the width of the
rigidizer 3001. This bending portion may not be in tension as other parts of the headgear,
e.g., the upper and lower headgear straps for direct attachment to the mask system.
[001311          Fig. 20 shows a further arrangement wherein the first strap 3010 may have an
encapsulated rigidizer 3001 (not shown) and may be provided with a top strap 3012 and a
bottom strap 3013. Top strap 3012 and bottom strap 3013 may each be a single length of
material that may loop through or otherwise attach to first strap 3010. Securing means (for
example, hook and loop attachment, press studs, adhesive) may be attached at the ends of top
strap 3012 and bottom strap 3013 to allow for adjustment of the length of the straps.
[00132]          Fig. 21 shows a further arrangement wherein a first strap 4010 (that may be
provided with an encapsulated rigidizer (not shown)) is joined at its lower end by stitching,
gluing, welding, or other means. Alternatively, first strap 4010 may be formed of a single
circle or loop or material. First strap 4010 may be formed in one piece by ultrasonic die
cutting. The circumference of the first strap (measured from the inner edge, or edge that is
furthest from the top strap 4012 and bottom strap 4013) may be about 420-600mm.
Preferably, the circumference may be about 480-540mm. Preferably, the circumference may
be about 490-505mm. Preferably the circumference may be about 500mm. With a
circumference in these ranges, the headgear may fit the crown region of the head for a larger
proportion of the population. Additionally, the rigidizer may avoid contacting the ears of the
patient. Furthermore, the rigidizer may avoid contacting the lower neck or upper back or
spine of the patient.
[00133]          Fig. 21 also shows top straps 4012 attached to first strap 4010 at join 4035.
Join 4035 may be stitching, ultrasonic welding, gluing, or any other joining means, or a
combination of means. Top straps 4012 may be provided with adjustment means 4020 at their
free ends, for example hook or loop material, press studs, etc. Bottoms straps 4013 may be
attached to first strap 4010 by join 4035. Join 4035 may be stitching, ultrasonic welding,
gluing, or any other joining means, or a combination of means. Bottom straps 4013 may be
                                                  18

provided with adjustment means 4020 at their free ends, for example hook or loop material,
press studs, etc. In a further alternative embodiment, first strap 4010, top straps 4012, and
bottom straps 4013 may be formed in one piece. The single component may be formed by
manually rolling an ultrasonic welder around the perimeter of the component. In an
embodiment, this method may provide some edges that are not consistent as this method
relies on manual control of the process. The single component may be constructed by
ultrasonic die cutting. This may be advantageous as each headgear may be more uniform or
consistent as the process can be more strictly controlled. Alternative methods of construction
are also possible, including ultrasonic welding and CNC knife cutting.
[00134]          Fig. 22 shows a rear view of a first strap 4110 (that may be provided with an
encapsulated rigidizer (not externally visible in Fig. 22)) in its in use position. Angle a shows
the angle of alignment of the bottom straps 4113 with respect to a horizontal plane. Bottoms
straps 4113 are preferably angled or deflected downward by angle a to guide the bottom
straps below the ears of the patient. Angle a may be greater than 0'. Angle a may be 0o-90'.
Preferably, angle a may be about 10'-30'. Preferably, angle a may be about 15'-20'. Angle
a may be about 110. First strap 4110 may also be provided with a top strap 4112 that may be
elastic. Bottom straps 4113 may be attached to first strap 4110 by joins 4134, 4135.
[00135]          Fig. 22 also shows length L, which is the width of the lower portion of the first
strap nearest join 4130. Preferably, length L may be less than about 60mm to avoid contact
with the neck or upper back or spine of the patient. Preferably, length L may be about 30
50mm.
[00136]          As shown in Fig. 22, the upper region of the headgear defined by the first strap
4110 is arched to engage the crown of the patient's head. In use, the first strap 4110 extends
in a horizontal plane 4115 through the widest portion of the arched region so as to lie flat on
the crown of the patient's head. The lower portions or sides of the first strap 4110 extend
through a vertical plane (parallel to vertical axis 4116) at the widest portions of the lower
portions or sides of the first strap. This configuration allows the region of the headgear
including the first strap 4110 to lie flat on the back of the patient's head. In the case where
the first strap 4110 is provided with an encapsulated rigidizer, the configuration of the first
strap 4110 in combination with the rigidizer provides the headgear with a 3D shape.
[001371          Fig. 23 shows a further arrangement wherein first strap 4210 (that may be
provided with an encapsulated rigidizer (not shown)) may be attached to top strap 4212 by
                                                  19

joins 4235. Joins 4235 are shown as ultrasonic welds, however may be any other reasonable
method of attaching the top strap 4212 to first strap 4210. Top strap 4212 may be elastic, or
any other suitable material. Bottom strap 4213 may be passed through loops 4235 on first
strap 4210. Bottom strap 4213 may be made from elastic or any other suitable material.
Bottom strap 4213 may also be adjustable by providing ladder locks 4220 on its ends. By
sliding ladder locks 4220 along the length of bottom strap 4213, the length of the strap may
change.
 [00138]         Fig. 23 further shows rigidizer lower portion 4250 that may be curved in such
a way so as to avoid contacting the back of the patient's ear when in use. The curvature of
this lower portion 4250 on Fig. 20 is such that the first strap 4210 follows a similar radius of
curvature along its length. As shown in Fig. 23, the radius of curvature of lower portion 4250
is different to that of the upper portion 4260. Lower portion 4250 may have a radius of
curvature less than that of upper portion 4260. The shape of first strap 4210 may be similar to
the rigidizer 4201 (not externally visible in Fig. 23) encapsulated within it.
 [00139]         Fig. 27 shows rigidizer 4201 where the lower portion 4251 may have a radius
of curvature less than that of upper portion 4261. Alternatively, a bend 4200 may be provided
to rigidizer 4201 so that lower portion 4251 is positioned further in towards the centre of the
patient's head thereby avoiding contact with the back of the patient's ears in use.
 [00140]         Fig. 28 shows rigidizer 4201 nested or positioned multiple times on a single
piece of base material to demonstrate the ability of the rigidizer's shape to be manufactured
and wherein multiple rigidizers 4201 are produced with minimal wasted base material.
 [00141]         Fig. 29 shows a flattened first strap 4210 with the encapsulated rigidizer 4201
(as delineated by dashed lines) to demonstrate the similar curvature or general arcuate shape
of the two parts when formed or joined together. In this embodiment, either end 4280 of
rigidizer 4201 may preferably: have a maximum length no greater the furthest point of the
end 4211 of first strap 4210; and have a preferred minimum length of no less than the
distance required to prevent or limit the end 4211 from distorting or bending, when a further
 strap is connected to end 4211 and when the headgear is tightened on a patient's head. This
feature may also avoid rigidizer 4201 causing discomfort or irritation on the patient's neck or
upper back / spine.
 [00142]         Fig. 30 shows a further embodiment of the present technology, where rigidizer
4601 may be encapsulated within a first strap 4610. Rigidizer 4601 may extend only across
                                                 20

the centre portion of first strap 4610, such that when in use, is only located at approximately
the top, upper half of the patient's head. This may increase comfort while maintaining the
stability of previous embodiments. Additionally, the reduced length rigidizer 4601 may
increase the comfort of this embodiment and yet more allow the strap to retain a shape and
configuration that may allow a user or patient to quickly fit or wear the headgear. One
advantage of rigidizer being mounted within the headgear is the part of the headgear that
engages the rear portion of the patient's head includes enough support in the form of rigidity
to maintain its basic shape and to prevent or limit distortion whilst the patient is donning the
headgear.
[001431          Fig. 24 shows a further embodiment where top strap 4312 and bottom strap
4313 may be adjustable with ladder locks 4320. Top strap 4312 and bottom strap 4313 may
be attached to a first strap 4310 with an encapsulated rigidizer (not shown).
[001441          In an embodiment, one or more aspects of the headgear may be structured to
prevent or at least reduce the chances of headgear riding up the patient's head and causing the
straps to abut or touch underneath the patient's ears in use.
[001451          For example, as shown in Fig. 36, the position of the crown strap 7360 may be
moved rearwardly (i.e., change the angle of the crown strap) to reduce the chances of
headgear ride up. The original position of the crown strap 7360 is indicated in Fig. 36 by the
solid line. The original position of the crown strap 7360 may be vertical direction or in the
direction of the frontal plane of the body. In an example, the crown strap 7360 may be
moved back by up to 400 from the position shown in Fig. 36, e.g., moved back 15' as
indicated by al, 200 as indicated by a2, and 40' as indicated by U3. Also, moving the crown
strap rearwardly improves cradling in the crown region of the patient's head to enhance
support, e.g., so crown strap is not too loose on the top of the patient's head. Furthermore the
strap may include a curvature such as a J-shape, or a "dog leg" shape to direct a headgear
vector around an ear, for example having a radius of approximately 50mm to 70mm, more
preferably about 55mm to about 65mm, as shown in Fig. 36. Fig. 37 illustrates how the
crown strap 7360 helps to maintain sufficient spacing of the lower strap 7364 from the
patient's ear.
[001461          In another example, as shown in Figs. 38 and 39, the rigidizer 7460 may be
extended to enhance support along the bottom strap along the bottom of the neck. In
addition, the length of the top strap 7466 may be extended to enhance the positioning of the
                                                21

crown strap. Preferably, the rigidizer 7460 may support or position the lower straps of the
headgear underneath or out of contact with the patient's ears. Also, the rigidizer 7460 may
prevent the headgear from riding up or translating vertically upwards on the patient's head,
by securing the headgear at the occiput and/or neck of the patient. The inextensibility of the
rigidizer 7460 also prevents the crown strap 7462 from being stretched into impinging on the
patient's ears. The crown strap 7462 secures the headgear in position so that the headgear
does not slide forward or around the patient's head. The bottom and top straps 7464, 7466
may be more elastic or extensible than the crown strap 7462.
[001471         In an example, as shown in Fig. 38 and 39, the diameter d of the crown strap
7462 preferably may be about 500 mm, and the top strap 7466 may be oriented at an angle a.l
of about 900 with respect to the crown strap. The lower strap 7464 may be oriented at an
angle a2 of about 15-30', e.g., 20', down from horizontal. In a further example, the diameter
d of the crown strap 7462 may be about 440 mm to about 600mm. In a further example, the
diameter d of the crown strap 7462 may be about 500 mm to about 600mm. In a further
example, the diameter d of the crown strap 7462 may be about 550 mm to about 600mm. In a
further example, the diameter d of the crown strap 7462 may be about 440 mm to about
550mm. In a further example, the diameter d of the crown strap 7462 may be about 440 mm
to about 500mm. The diameter d defines a loop of a back portion of the headgear that
circumscribes the rear of the patient's head such that little, or none, of the headgear is
between the patient's head and the pillow or bed when the patient is lying on his/her back.
1.2.3 Rigidizer/Strap Adjustment
[00148]         In an embodiment, adjustment of the rigidizers and headgear straps may be
provided by hook and loop material (e.g., Velcro®), elastic, press studs, etc).
[00149]         For example, in Figs. 1-2 and 6-10, one or both ends of the straps 20, 30, 220,
230, 620, 630 include a Velcro® tab structured to engage the remainder of the strap to secure
the strap in place and allow adjustment (e.g., with respect to the rigidizer and/or mask).
[00150]         In Figs. 1, 4, and 5, one or more straps 40, 440, 450, 540, 550 are in the form
of an elastic component to allow adjustment.
[00151]         Elastic provided to a top strap of a headgear (for example, top strap 3012 in
Fig. 20) may be 250-450mm in length. Preferably, elastic top strap may be about 320
400mm. Preferably, elastic top strap may require no more than 1ON of force to stretch the
                                                22

elastic 100mm from its original length. Preferably, elastic top strap may require no more than
6N of force to stretch the elastic 100mm from its original length. Preferably, elastic top strap
may require no more than 4N of force to stretch the elastic 100mm from its original length.
Preferably, elastic top strap may require no more than 3N of force to stretch the elastic
100mm from its original length. This may ensure the headgear is comfortable for a range of
patient's head sizes.
[00152]            In Figs. 10-13, one or more straps include a press stud arrangement as
described above to allow adjustment.
1.2.4 Rigidizer Material
[00153]            The rigidizer may have composite construction with two or more materials
(rigid or semi-rigid material with a covering constructed of a softer, patient contacting
material), may be constructed of alternative fabric or polymeric materials (3D weave, knit,
non-wovens, laminates), and may be manufactured in alternative manners.
[00154]            For example, the rigidizer may be made from any flexible, conforming
material such as nylon, polypropylene, polycarbonate, polystyrene, polyethylene,
thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), thermoplastic urethane (TPU), silicone, polyester, etc (e.g.,
see Fig. 1). In Fig. 3, the rigidizer 360 is a 3D weave/knit with overlocked edges.
[00155]            The rigidizer may also be constructed by thickening or treating a fabric such
that it is stiffer or impedes the stretch of the material. For example, the fabric may be printed
on such that the ink from the print restrains or reduces the capacity of the fabric to stretch.
Additionally, the fabric may be stitched in selected regions to stiffen it. Also, the fabric may
be ultrasonically welded in selected regions to stiffen it.
[00156]            The rigidizer may be constructed from a non-woven material, for example
netting, such that it is resistant to stretching in at least one direction.
[001571            The rigidizer may alternatively be formed from a woven material, where the
grain of the material is aligned such that the fabric may not stretch in the lateral direction
(when positioned on the patient's head) to secure and anchor the headgear in position on the
patient's head.
[001581            The rigidizer may also be formed by a layer of additional material such as
silicone, polyurethane or other tacky material, that may be applied to a fabric strap to
reinforce the strap. Silicone beading or polymeric over molding may also be used.
                                                   23

[00159]          The rigidizer may be 0.1mm to 10mm thick. Depending on the construction
material of the rigidizer, the rigidizer may be preferably between 0.5mm and 5mm thick.
Generally, the thinner rigidizers may result in more comfortable headgear for the patients.
Thicker rigidizers may be the more dimensionally stable or rigid.
[001601          The rigidizer may be 1mm to 30mm wide. Preferably, the rigidizer may be 5
20mm wide. Preferably, the rigidizer in some of the embodiments described herein may be
10mm wide. To increase flexibility along the length of the rigidizer, the material may be
thinner in its width than height, or narrower in its width for a thicker material.
[001611          In another embodiment, the rigidizer may have the same width or a width less
than a fabric backing material. The fabric backing material is in contact with the patient's
head in use. This is to increase the comfort of the headgear system in use.
[00162]          In a further embodiment, the rigidizer may be encapsulated within a suitable
fabric material to improve patient comfort and wearability.
[001631          The rigidizer may be overmolded (e.g., TPE overmolded with a softer material
(e.g., see Fig. 10)) or formed separately and then a sock of patient contacting material (e.g.,
Breath-0-PreneTM) may be wrapped or slid over the rigidizer (e.g., see Figs. 2, 6, and 9). In
alternative embodiments, the patient contacting material may be provided to the rigidizer by
adhesive, ultra sonic welding, sewing, hook and loop material, and/or stud connectors. In an
embodiment, the patient contacting material may only be on the patient contacting side of the
rigidizer to reduce bulk and cost of headgear.
[00164]          The resilient structure of the rigidizer may also improve the anchoring of the
straps to it and may prevent the straps from tearing or ripping through the rigidizer under
conditions of normal use by a patient.
[001651          Figs. 14A to 14G are cross-sectional views showing alternative rigidizer
configurations. As shown in Fig. 14A, the rigidizer may include a die cut sheet material 780
that is covered in fabric 781, e.g., two pieces of fabric joined by stitching or gluing.
Preferably, the joint of the fabric is within the strap, such that the joint is not able to contact
the patient's face in use. This may be achieved by sewing the strap inside out and returning it
to its intended orientation so that the stitching is within the pocket of the fabric. The fabric
provides a softer material for contacting the patient's face in use. The softer material may also
be suitable for the selective attachment of VelcroTM tabs. The fabric on the patient contacting
side may be the same as the fabric on the non-patient contacting side. The fabric on the
                                                  24

patient contacting side may preferably have the same weave as the fabric on the non-patient
contacting side, such that the stretch characteristics of the straps are approximately equal on
both sides. Also, it is preferred that the fabric on the patient contacting side have the same
heat shrinkage characteristics as the non-patient contacting side. This is to prevent the
headgear deforming unevenly when thermoformed or otherwise processed or exposed to heat.
The fabric on the patient contacting side may be a different fabric to the non-patient
contacting side, such that the fabric on the patient contacting side is more comfortable than
the non-patient contacting side.
[001661         As shown in Fig. 14B, the rigidizer may include a die cut sheet material 880
that is overmolded with a soft polymeric material 881, e.g., TPE, TPU. The polymeric
material provides a softer material for contacting the patient's face in use.
[001671         As shown in Fig. 14C, the rigidizer may include a semi-rigid molded
component 980 that is covered in fabric 981, e.g., two pieces of fabric joined by stitching.
[001681         As shown in Fig. 14D, the rigidizer may include a semi-rigid molded
component 1080 that is attached (e.g., welded, glued, overmolded) to a fabric composite
material 1081 (e.g., Breath-0-PreneTM material or similar). The fabric composite material
provides a softer material for contacting the patient's face in use.
[001691         As shown in Fig. 14E, the rigidizer may include a semi-rigid molded
component 1180 that is overmolded with a soft polymeric material 1181, e.g., TPE, TPU.
The polymeric material provides a softer material for contacting the patient's face in use.
[001701         As shown in Fig. 14F, the rigidizer may include a soft molded component
1280 molded with a soft polymeric material, e.g., TPE, TPU. In an embodiment, the molded
component may be provided with soft touch or flock coatings.
[001711         As shown in Fig. 14G, the rigidizer may include a fabric outer layer 1381
thermoformed and attached to a rigidizer 1380. The rigidizer may be a die cut sheet material.
Alternatively, the rigidizer could be a molded part, machined part, or otherwise formed part.
The fabric outer layers may be heat sealed together, stitched, ultrasonically cut, CNC knife
cut, or otherwise joined. As illustrated, the fabric outer layer 1381 is joined at approximately
the center or middle of the edge. Preferably, the joint is at the center or close to the center of
the side of the headgear. Alternatively, the joint may be positioned away from the patient's
face when in use. It is also possible to position the joint adjacent or close to the patient's face
in use. Preferably, a layer of foam or other conformable material may be positioned around or
                                                 25

about the rigidizer 1380. The foam may preferably extend to the lateral, horizontal edges of
the rigidizer 1380 so as to prevent the ends of the rigidizer abutting the patient's face and
causing discomfort or facial marking. For example, Fig. 14H illustrates a rigidizer 1480 with
fabric outer layers 1481 and a foam layer 1482 provided along at least a portion of the
rigidizer 1480. As illustrated, the foam layer 1482 positions the joints 1483 away from the
patient's face when in use.
[00172]         In an embodiment, the headgear strap may be thermoformed and then edges of
the strap may be ultrasonically cut. The thermoformed and ultrasonically cut strap provides
rounded edges 7081 (as shown in Fig. 31) which provides substantially reduced facial
marking in use. In addition, the thermoformed and ultrasonically cut edges are softer and less
abrasive, which provides a more comfortable feel on the patent's face in use, e.g., more
comfortable feel around the patient's ears.
[001731         In a further embodiment, at least a portion of the headgear may be constructed
from a spacer fabric, where the edges of the spacer fabric may be ultra sonically welded.
This may cause the edges of the spacer fabric to be rounded, thereby reducing facial marking
and increasing comfort for the patient.
[00174]         In an alternative embodiment, the fabric outer layers may be attached together
by adhesive. For example, as shown in Fig. 141, a first layer of fabric 158 1(1) may have
wings 1585 positioned at one or both ends. Adhesive 1586 (e.g., glue) may be positioned on
ends of a second layer of fabric 1581(2), such that the wings 1585 can be folded onto the
adhesive to seal the inner portions of the headgear within the fabric layers. As illustrated, the
inner portions of the headgear may include a conformable material such as foam 1582, or a
rigidizer 1580, or a combination of the two. Alternative internal components may include
other elements disclosed herein, such as 3D weaves. It should further be appreciated that the
adhesive and wings may be positioned in alternative arrangements, such as the adhesive
positioned on the wings, or the wings positioned on the second layer of fabric. It is further
possible for the first and second layers of fabric to be a single, continuous piece of fabric that
is sealed at one end by a wing and adhesive arrangement. For example, Fig. 14J shows a
single piece of fabric 1681 including a wing 1685 at one end that is adapted to be folded onto
adhesive 1686 (e.g., glue) at the other end. As illustrated, the inner portions of the headgear
include a conformable material such as foam 1682 and a rigidizer 1680.
                                                26

[001751          Preferably, the edges of the headgear are completely closed, that is, the
interior components of the headgear (such as the rigidizer and conformable material) are
completely contained within the fabric outer layers. This is to avoid hair tangling in the
internal components or discomfort due to contact with the interior elements. In addition, it
may be easier to maintain the cleanliness and durability of the system if the internal
components are completely encapsulated or contained within the fabric layers.
[001761          Preferably, the edges where the fabric layers meet one another are sealed or
otherwise hidden to avoid the fabrics from parting or becoming dislodged. This arrangement
may also be preferable for creating a rounded continuous edge. See Fig. 14A for example.
[001771          In an embodiment, one or more aspects of the headgear strap may be
structured to enhance comfort of the crown strap (i.e., the strap adapted to pass over the top
of the patient's head in use). For example, the rigidizer may be relatively thin, e.g., less than
1 mm such as 0.5 mm or 0.8 mm. In another example, the strap may include a nylon rigidizer
enclosed in foam. In such embodiment, the density of the foam may be increased to improve
comfort and reduce chances of feeling the nylon rigidizer. Alternatively, the thickness of the
foam may be utilized to alter the softness or roundness of the edge of the headgear. For
example, thicker layers of foam are more likely to produce rounder corners than thinner
layers of foam. In a further embodiment, the foam may begin at one thickness, and be
compressed to another thickness during processing. The first thickness of the foam may be 5
to 30 mm. Preferably, the first thickness may be 7 to 12 mm. Alternatively, the first foam
thickness may be 10 to 20 mm. The second foam thickness may be 0.1 to 10 mm.
Preferably, the second foam thickness may be 2 to 5 mm. The second foam thickness may
alternatively be 3 to 7 mm.
[001781          In another example, a non-woven material (e.g., such as that shown in Fig. 32)
may be used for the crown strap because it may be more rigid or less flexible than a woven
material, e.g., business shirt collar stiffener is a non-woven material.
[001791          In another example, the rigid component may be removed from the crown
strap and as an alternative a fabric crown strap 7181 may be heat pressed or embossed with a
foam inner 7180 to melt the foam and create a stiffened region (see Figs. 33 and 34). In an
example, a thermoformed rib may be formed by compressing the foam by about 80%.
[001801          In another example, multiple ribs 7280 may be embossed into the rigidizer to
reduce visual bulk and add rigidity, as shown in Fig. 35.
                                                   27

[001811         Also, the rigidizer may include embossed ribs or other features to encourage
flex or control movement of the headgear in specific regions. In addition, embossing may be
used to stamp on a branding logo.
[00182]         In an example, the headgear strap may include two layers of foam. However,
other suitable configurations are possible, e.g., 1, 2, 3, or more layers of foam. In an
embodiment, foam on the patient contacting side may be less dense or have a lower hardness
than foam on non-patient contacting side. It is also possible to have more than one layer of
foam and more than one rigidizer component. Alternatively, the headgear may comprise
more than one rigidizer and a single layer of foam.
[00183]         In an example, non-woven material may be inserted in-between additional
foam or fabric layers in place of a nylon rigidizer.
[00184]         In an embodiment, the materials and/or headgear configuration may be
selected to reduce costs.
2.0 Manufacturing
[00185]         Preferably, the method of manufacturing the headgear may reduce costs by
maximizing volume and eliminating material wastage. For example, components may be
shaped such that they can be nested closely on the bulk material such that when die cut into
individual components, waste is reduced waste thereby reducing cost.
[00186]         Figs. 41 and 42 show exemplary processing steps for creating headgear as
described. Alternative manufacturing steps are also possible.
[001871         For example, Fig. 41 shows an exemplary process for creating rigidized
headgear. This exemplary process includes material lamination (foam and fabric joined
together by a lamination process), thermoforming (foam and fabric lamination placed in tool,
pre-shaped rigidizer placed in the tool on top of first lamination layer, a second foam and
fabric lamination layer placed on top of rigidizer; tool closed, heat applied, laminations
permanently join around tool faces) ultrasonic die cut (thermoformed sheet placed on die
cutting machine, ultrasonic welder travels around perimeter of headgear), and joining (lower
portion of headgear crown cap joined together, headgear straps attached to crown cap). In one
process, the lamination step may be omitted. In another process the thermoforming and
ultrasonic cutting may be completed in one step.
                                                28

[001881          Fig. 42 shows an exemplary process for creating non-rigidized headgear. This
exemplary process includes material lamination (foam and fabric joined together by a
lamination process), thermoforming (foam and fabric lamination placed in tool; tool closed,
heat applied, laminations permanently join around tool faces), ultrasonic die cut
(thermoformed sheet placed on die cutting machine, ultrasonic welder travels around
perimeter of headgear), and sewing (lower portion of headgear crown cap joined together,
headgear straps attached to rigidizer).
[00189]          As illustrated in Fig. 16A, a headgear component 660 in accordance with the
present technology may be arranged for die cutting from a sheet. In the example of Fig. 16A,
twelve headgear components 660 may be cut from a single sheet 2500 of fabric material. The
headgear components 660 shown in Fig. 16A may be joined to a set of relatively straight
straps that may also be efficiently nested (not shown), the combination making a complete
headgear assembly. By way of contrast to a prior art configuration shown in Fig. 16B, only
three headgear assemblies 2600 may be cut from a similarly sized sheet 2500 of a different
design as shown in Fig. 16B. The manufacturing yield of Fig. 16B is approximately 11.5
headgears per metres2. For purposes of this specification, "high manufacturing yield" is
                                                                                      2
defined as any and all manufacturing yields higher than 11.5 headgears per metres2
[00190]          In contrast to other prior art headgear configurations, such as the ResMed
QuattroTM headgear, embodiments shown are constructed from multiple components that
when separate, are simple geometric shapes that can be nested easily. For example, in the
embodiment shown in Fig. 6, the upper headgear strap 620 and lower headgear strap 630 are
substantially straight, rectangular components that could be nested and cut from a bulk piece
of material without waste. Alternatively, upper headgear strap 620 and lower headgear strap
630 could be formed from woven materials and cut to length without waste. Rigidizer 660
may be formed from a flat piece, such as that shown in Fig. 15. In such a configuration,
multiple rigidizers could be formed from a single bulk sheet of the rigidizer material with
minimal waste as the rigidizers can be nested close together as shown in Fig 16A. The
Rigidizer 660 has a generally arcuate shape, but could be regarded by a person skilled in the
art as a relatively simple geometric shape.
[00191]          This is in contrast with prior art headgear such as the ResMed QuattroTM
headgear, as such a shape can be nested closely but waste is generated due to the general
shape of the headgear (i.e., apertures or holes in the headgear that must be stamped out).
                                                  29

[001921          A further embodiment is depicted in Figs. 17-20. Fig. 20 depicts an assembled
headgear 3015 for use attaching medical equipment to the head of a patient. In this
embodiment, the preferred medical equipment is the mask of a CPAP machine.
[00193]          The depicted headgear 3015 is adapted to mount a face mask on the face of a
patient. The headgear 3015 comprises first 3010, second 3012, and third 3013 straps. The
second 3012 and third 3013 straps are attached to the first strap 3010 by attachment means,
which comprises a series or plurality of holes or apertures in the first strap 3010 adapted to
receive the other straps. The second 3012 and third 3013 straps may be fixed or connected to
the first strap 3010 by the use of one or more VelcroTM tabs adapted to loop back onto the
original strap and attach to the preferably soft fabric material on the outer surface of the
straps. Preferably, the VelcroTM tabs and the soft fabric used in the straps could selectively
engage each other in "hook and loop" attachment common to the use of VelcroTM.
[00194]          The first strap 3010 comprises a construction shown in Fig. 17 and Fig. 18. A
rigid or semi-rigid layer 3001 of resilient material is encapsulated between a first 3004 and a
second layer 3002 of soft fabric material. Preferably, the soft fabric is adapted to be
biocompatible, as in use, the layers 3002 and 3004 may contact the skin layer of the patient.
Biocompatibility and softness may both reduce skin irritation to the patient.
[00195]          Encapsulated between the rigid layer 3001 and the first soft fabric layer 3004
is a layer of cushioning 3003. Preferably, this cushioning layer 3003 is constructed a soft
foam like material. In use, the first strap 3010 is preferably adapted to contact the skin layer
of patient by contact with the first soft fabric layer 3004. The layered configuration of the
first strap 3010 as depicted in Fig 17 may only be required to extend along a portion of one of
the straps to function correctly as disclosed in this embodiment.
[001961          Preferably, the layers of the first strap 3010 may be attached to each other by
vulcanization or gluing. Additionally, the first fabric layer 3004 and second fabric layer 3002
are not required to be of the same or identical material and may be substitute to improve the
aesthetic appearance of the headgear 3015.
[001971          In this embodiment, the second strap 3012 and third strap 3013 may be
entirely constructed of soft fabric material to improve comfort. However, other strap
configurations are possible.
[001981          The rigid layer 3001 or rigidizer may preferably be constructed of
polycarbonate, LexanIm or similar resilient material of about a thickness of 1-2mm. The soft
                                                  30

fabric material may be Breath-0-PreneTM or other soft fabric material including but not
limited to nylon or SpandexTM.
[00199]         Preferably, the first strap 3010 may function as a rigidizer within the overall
headgear assembly or configuration 3015 as shown in Fig. 20. One advantage with including
a rigidizer within this construction is that it may allow for equalized distribution of pressure
around the patient's head, particularly, when mounted in the configuration shown in Fig. 20.
This embodiment may increase patient comfort by the rigidizer being mounted around or on
the posterior of the patient's head.
[00200]         Of further advantage in this embodiment, the construction of the straps may be
optimized to reduce wastage. Previously, straps of headgear were constructed by cutting the
entire headgear from a single bulk piece of material, which created a relatively large amount
of waste material. Fig 19 depicts a plurality of straps to be cut out of a bulk piece of
manufacturing material. As depicted, the second layer 3002 of soft fabric material of the first
strap 3010 is shown within a bulk sheet 3011 of material. In this example, the wastage is
limited and minimized by nesting each of the component straps closely together on the same
bulk sheet 3011.
[00201]         In a further embodiment, an inner layer of foam may be molded, such that a
skinned foam is formed in the shape of the headgear. Alternatively, any foam (skinned,
unskinned or partially skinned) may first be formed or otherwise shaped to the shape of the
headgear. Fabric may then be laminated onto the foam layer.
[00202]         In a further alternative embodiment, a fabric or textile may be placed within a
mold and a polymer or other such moldable material may be injected onto the fabric to the
desired shape of the headgear.
[002031         In a further embodiment, the fabric outer layer may be filled with gel, air
and/or other gas. The gas may be selectively filled in pockets with varying volumes in each
pocket to influence the rigidity or support provided by that section of the headgear. The
fabric outer layer may need to be gas tight, so may for example be laminated with an
impermeable polymer layer.
[00204]         In a further alternative embodiment, the outer layer of fabric may be formed
around or over two cords of material. The cords of material are intended to create a round
edge at the sides of the material. For example, Fig. 43 shows a cross section through a
proposed headgear or portion thereof, wherein the cords 1785 provided within the outer
                                                 31

fabric layer 1781 are rounded sections of material. The cords may be provided to both sides
(as shown) or may be provided to just one side of the headgear strap. The cords may be
constructed of foam, gel, polymer, or any other conformable material. The cords may have
alternative shapes, for example they may have an ovoid or elliptical cross section. The cords
are further shown as being separate (that is, not joined together through the center portion of
the headgear section), however it is possible for the cords to be connected to one another.
[00205]         It should also be appreciated that the foam outer layer may also be constructed
of a single piece of material that is continuously weaved to make a tube of fabric.
[002061         It should be appreciated that while this technology has been described in
relation to a headgear for a mask system, this technology may be applicable to other portions
of the mask system, such as forehead pads, mask cushions, comfort pads, tube wraps, comfort
socks, chin straps, mask frames or any other suitable portion of the mask system.
[002071         It is possible for a quick release mechanism to be attached to the headgear, for
example a selectively releasable portion at the rear of the headgear. This may include a hook
and loop material connection with a pull cord. Alternatively, the quick release mechanism
may be a clip or any other mechanism to allow the patient to remove the mask system in an
emergency.
[002081         In a further embodiment, it is possible for a tube mounting component to the
attachable or formed with the headgear. For example, a strap for wrapping around a tube
may be provided to the headgear, that may be attached to the tube by a hook and loop
connection. Alternatively, clips or rings may be attached or formed with the headgear for
engagement with a tube.
[00209]         The rigidizer may also be formed from a selectively adjustable shape
changeable material. For example, the rigidizer may be formed from a metal such that the
patient can adapt the shape of the headgear to their desired position. It may also be possible
to form the rigidizer from a heat deformable material, such that the headgear may be heated
and positioned on the patient's head, and then taking on the form or shape of the patient's
head. When the headgear is cooled, it may retain this shape. The rigidizer may also be
formed of a malleable material, such as nitinol, that is able to be shaped.
[00210]         The headgear may also be provided with pockets or gaps for inserting
additional material or removing material. This may be provided so that the patient can alter
and adapt the stiffness or comfort of the headgear in specific regions. For example, a pocket
                                                 32

or space may be provided to the rear of the headgear so that the patient can add padding or
conformable materials to this portion of the headgear.
[00211]          In a further embodiment, the headgear may be provided with socks or wraps of
padded or soft material to provide the patient with additional comfort should they require it.
The socks or wraps may be selectively attachable to the headgear straps, for example by
clipping, hook and loop material, pulling over or any other reasonable attachment method.
[00212]          It may also be possible to provide the headgear with sensors for diagnosing or
monitoring the patient.
[00213]          In an alternative embodiment, the above described rigidizer may be replaced
or supplemented with one or more elements possessing substantial inextensibility and/or
resilience. For example, instead of using the above described rigidizer, stitching or embossing
may be used to create a substantially inextensible structure. Furthermore, a non-rigid spring
structure may provide resilience.
[00214]          While the technology has been described in connection with what are
presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be
understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiments, but on the
contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included
within the spirit and scope of the invention. Also, the various embodiments described above
may be implemented in conjunction with other embodiments, e.g., aspects of one
embodiment may be combined with aspects of another embodiment to realize yet other
embodiments. Further, each independent feature or component of any given assembly may
constitute an additional embodiment. In addition, while the invention has particular
application to patients who suffer from OSA, it is to be appreciated that patients who suffer
from other illnesses (e.g., congestive heart failure, diabetes, morbid obesity, stroke, bariatric
surgery, etc.) can derive benefit from the above teachings. Moreover, the above teachings
have applicability with patients and non-patients alike in non-medical applications.
