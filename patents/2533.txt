    Description of Embodiments of the Invention
    In an embodiment of the present invention a system for distributing progressive
    gaming related information comprises a combiner for inserting data indicative of
30  progressive gaming related information into a video signal as closed caption
    data to produce a combined video signal; and a communications medium for
    distributing the combined video signal to one or more receivers for display of a
                                                             101827441 (GHMatters) P25811 AU.4 18/04118

   video image which comprises the progressive information as closed caption
   text.
   In an embodiment a source of the data indicative of the progressive information
 5 is a gaming system.
   Referring to Figure 6 there is shown a system 300 for distributing progressive
   gaming related information, which comprises a source of progressive gaming
   information, video source 308, combiner 312, communication medium 316 and
10 one or more displays 318. In an embodiment the source of progressive gaming
   information is in the form of a gaming system server 302. The server 302 may
   be a server which controls and monitors a progressive jackpot or a server which
   receives information regarding the progressive jackpot from a jackpot controller.
   The progressive gaming related information may be stored in a database 304.
15 The server 302 accesses database 304 to obtain the progressive gaming
   related information, such as a cumulative Jackpot prize pool, winning
   information such as bingo or Keno numbers or information on winners of
   games. Other information such as progressive amounts, win
   notifications/congratulations, or other messages can be output from the server
20 302. Such information is in the form of text and is encoded in a data signal 306
   indicative of this information. The server 302 outputs the data signal 306 to the
   combiner 312. In an embodiment the information is formatted using a suitable
   protocol, such as GDAP, SAS, G2S, or XML to form the data signal 306.
   Further, the text information may be formatted in a non-human readable form
25 which can be subsequently converted into readable text by the combiner 312.
   The video source 308 produces a digital or analog video signal 310. The video
   signal may be in one of any suitable format, such as modulated, unmodulated,
   digital, NTSC, ATSC, HD, PAL etc. The source may be for example a
30 broadcast television receiver, a video cassette recorder, a DVD player or
   another form of suitable video player. The video signal may be any suitable
                                                            101827441 (GHMatters) P25811 AU.4 18/04118

                                            -  6
    image such as video of a sporting event or casino related promotional
    materials. The video source 308 provides the signal 310 to the combiner 312.
    The combiner 312 is configured to receive the data signal 306 and, if
  5 necessary, process it into the text information. The combiner 312 also inserts
    the text information into the video signal as closed captioned (CC) text, thereby
    producing a video signal with CC text 314. The CC text video signal 314 is
    provided to a communication medium 316 for distribution to the displays 318. A
    communication medium 316 may be for example coaxial cable or a suitable
10  data cable or in a wireless format. The displays 318 may be for example,
    television sets, video projectors or video monitors (CRT, LCD or plasma
    screen) located at the gaming machine such in the top box, in a separate video
    display such as one associated with a player tracking module, at a bank display
    over a bank of machines or at video displays distributed throughout the casino.
15  Each display 318 displays a video image according to the video signal and
    converts the combined CC text embedded within a video signal into
    progressively displayed text 320 over the video image.
    In an embodiment the combiner 312 receives a plurality of video signals and
20  the same information is inserted into each video signal. Alternatively a different
    set of information, or differently timed information, is inserted in each video
    signal. In an embodiment the gaming related information is provided from a
    plurality or sources and can be converted from a plurality of formats into the text
    for insertion in the video signal.
25
    In an embodiment if the video signal already has closed caption information
    present, the information from the server is inserted in addition to the existing
    information. In an alternative the information from the server replaces the
    existing information.
30
    The information may be inserted into the video signal using a format that is
    decodable and/or presentable by a downstream display device.
                                                                101827441 (GHMatters) P25811 AU.4 18/04118

   In an embodiment the information is inserted as Closed Caption text in line 21
   of the video signal, that is, the last horizontal line before video information
   starts. In an embodiment the display 318 is capable of displaying standard
 5 Closed Caption text as described in the United States of America Federal
   Communication Commission Rules under Title 47 CFR Part 15, Section 15.119
   (also known as FCC 15.119), which is incorporated herein by reference.
   The combiner 312 may be capable of script operation or more elaborate
10 presentation of the progressive information or advertising, as to colour, font,
   size, location, background etc. In this embodiment the data signal 306 from the
   server 302 may also have embellishment information for the combiner 312 to
   process and apply to the text.
15 In an embodiment the combiner 312 is a processor controlled by logic in the
   form of firmware or computer software. In an embodiment the combiner 312
   also comprises working memory. In an embodiment the combiner 312 is in the
   form of a computer running a computer program in memory for controlling the
   computer to operate as the combiner and to perform the functions of the
20 combiner. The software may be embodied in a computer readable form, such
   as a disk, CD, DVD, volatile or non-volatile memory (such as RAM or flash
   memory) or a mass storage device, such as a hard disk drive.
   Referring to Figure 7, there are shown a method 400 for distributing progressive
25 gaming related information, which commences at 402, and in an embodiment is
   performed by the system 300. Output data signal 306 is received 404 from the
   server 302. Output video signal 310 is received 406 from the video source 308.
   The progressive information is extracted from the data signal 306. The
   progressive information and video signal 310 are combined 408 to produce a
30 video signal with embedded CC text 314. The combiner 312 outputs 410 the
   combined signal 314 to the communication medium 316. The communication
   medium 316 distributes 412 the combined signal 314 to the receivers decode
                                                                101827441 (GHMatters) P25811 AU.4 18/04118

    the combined signal to produce the image according to the video signal. The
    image is overlaid with the progressive text in the CC component of the
    combined signal 314 and is displayed 416. The method ends at 418.
  5 The source of progressive gaming related information may be one or more of
    the following gaming systems arranged to implement a probabilistic wagering
    game wherein a player wagers a bet amount and a prize is allocated to the
    player depending on a game result.
10  The game implemented by the gaming system operates such that a player
    places a bet on a game outcome and will be awarded a prize according to the
    result of the game and in some embodiments according to the amount
    wagered.
15  The outcome of the game is determined according to the rules of the specific
    implementation of the game and the related symbols.
    Jackpots are commonly implemented in casinos. One form of Jackpot may be
    particular to a stand alone machine, where certain winning conditions trigger
20  winning of the Jackpot for that machine. Another form of Jackpot is where a
    number (often all the machines of a certain type on the casino floor) contribute
    to the Jackpot total. Certain winning conditions trigger winning of the
    cumulative Jackpot total. A Jackpot may be a progressive monetary total or a
    fixed prize, such as fixed monetary amount or, for example, a car or holiday.
25
    Referring to Figure 1, a gaming apparatus 10 for implementing an electronic
    embodiment of the game is shown in diagrammatic form. The gaming
    apparatus 10 comprises a memory 12 arranged to store symbols data 14
    indicative of a plurality of symbols for selection and display to a player during a
30  game, function data 16 indicative of one or more functions associated with one
    or more of the symbols, prize data 18 indicative of prize amounts of the game,
                                                               101827441 (GHMatters) P25811 AU.4 18/04118

                                          -  9
    and game instruction data 20 indicative of game instructions usable by the
    gaming machine 10 to control operation of the game.
    The gaming apparatus 10 also includes a symbol selector 22 which is arranged
  5 to randomly select symbols for display in the game. A random number
    generator 24 is used to determine which symbols of the selector 22 selects.
    It will be appreciated that the random number generator 24 may be of a type
    which is arranged to generate pseudo random numbers based on a seed
10  number, and that in this specification the term "random" will be understood
    accordingly to mean truly random or pseudo random.
    The gaming apparatus 10 also comprises a comparator 30 arranged to
    compare the related symbols in accordance with the game instruction data 20,
15  and an outcome generator 32 which in accordance with the game instruction
    data 20 determines whether the player is successful or unsuccessful and
    therefore wins a prize or not.
    While in this example the comparator and the outcome generator are shown as
20  separate components, it will be understood that the functions of the outcome
    generator and the comparator may be implemented by one component such as
    a micro-processor configured to have the memory, program instructions, and
    other components and software known in the art for operating and controlling a
    gaming machine.
25
    The gaming apparatus 10 also comprises software and data stored to define a
    prize allocator 34 which communicates with the prize data 18 stored in the
    memory 12 and with the outcome generator 30, and determines the
    predetermined prize to award to a player obtaining a corresponding outcome
30  such as symbols selected by the symbol selector 22 or combinations of
    symbols obtained after some interaction of the player with the game.
                                                            101827441 (GHMatters) P25811 AU.4 18/04118

                                          -  10
   The gaming apparatus 10 may also be arranged such that a player has the
   option of choosing to continue with another round of the game and thereby
   attempt to wager the winnings of the previous round (parley his winnings)or to
   win a game in which the results of subsequent rounds determines he outcome
 5 of the game.
   Instead of providing monetary prize amounts, the prize allocated to a player for
   reaching a level and/or any additional prize may be in the form of points,
   tokens, progressive prizes, eligibility for feature games, tournament
10 entitlements, or special symbol entitlements in other games, such as an
   additional wild symbol for a predetermined number of games.
   In the embodiment described below, the symbol selector 22, the comparator 30,
   the prize allocator 34 and the outcome generator 30 are implemented using a
15 microprocessor and associated programs, although it will be understood that
   other implementations are envisaged.
   The gaming apparatus 10 can take a number of different forms.
20 In a first form, a stand alone gaming apparatus 10 is provided wherein all or
   most components required for implementing the game are present in a player
   operable gaming machine. The outcome derived at the gaming machine 10 is
   not dependant upon interaction from any system connected to the gaming
   apparatus 10. The gaming machine 10 could accept wagers, render winning
25 and losing outcomes and, inmost cases, pay awards issued to the players.
   The stand alone gaming apparatus 10 may be the source of progressive
   gaming related information, which may be provided directly to the combiner 312
   or it may be collated by the server 302.
30
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided wherein some of the
   components required for implementing the game are present in a player
                                                              101827441 (GHMatters) P25811 AU.4 18/04118

                                          -  11
   operable gaming apparatus 10 and some of the components required for
    implementing the game are located remotely relative to the gaming apparatus.
    For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used wherein part of the game
    presentation is controlled at the gaming apparatus 10 and part of the game is
 5 controlled or influenced remotely, such as by a remote gaming server in
   communication with the gaming apparatus 10; or a "thin client" architecture may
    be used wherein most of the game is controlled or influenced remotely such as
    by a remote gaming server and a player operable gaming machine used only to
   display audible and/or visible gaming information to the player and receive
10 gaming inputs from the player.
    In this embodiment the gaming apparatus 10 or the remote gaming server may
    be the source of progressive gaming related information.
15  However, it will be understood that other arrangements are envisaged. For
   example, an architecture may be provided wherein a gaming machine is
    networked to a gaming server and the respective functions of the gaming
    machine and the gaming server are selectively modifiable. For example, the
   gaming apparatus may operate in stand alone gaming machine mode, "thick
20 client" mode or "thin client" mode depending on the game being played,
   operating conditions, and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
   The results of each game may be reported to a slot accounting system server.
25 Where gaming apparatus 10 are linked to a progressive jackpot, the gaming
   apparatus 10 may be linked in the foregoing manner for a system driven
    progressive jackpot or may be linked through a separate jackpot control device
   configured to monitor the wagers, allocate portions to one or more progressive
   jackpot pools and control display meters at the gaming machines 10 (or at
30 common overhead displays) to display information as to the amount in each
   jackpot. The jackpot control device may be the source of progressive gaming
    related information.
                                                            101827441 (GHMatters) P25811 AU.4 18/04118

                                        -  12
   In particular each gaming apparatus 10 may be configured (or selectively
   configurable by the player or casino) to link the gaming apparatus 10 to a
   progressive jackpot pool, where a proportion of the takings from each of a
 5 plurality of gaming machines are accumulated. When a player wins a game
   that meets predetermined jackpot winning criteria the player will win the
   accumulated "Jackpot" amount. The server or jackpot controller will keep track
   of the accumulated amount and can provide the current jackpot total. Where
   there are a large number of machines feeding the jackpot total can accumulate
10 rapidly to very high awards of several millions. The rapid accumulation of this
   total can increase the excitement of playing a game in which the jackpot can be
   won.
   A gaming apparatus in the form of a stand alone gaming machine 40 is
15 illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine 40 includes a console 42 having a
   display 44 on which is displayed representations of a game 46 that can be
   played by a player. A mid-trim 50 of the gaming machine 40 houses a bank of
   buttons 52 for enabling a player to interact with the gaming machine during
   game play, including enabling the player to select the bet amount and to
20 provide other inputs. The mid-trim 50 also houses a credit input mechanism 54
   which in this example includes a coin acceptor 54A and a bill collector 54B.
   Other credit input mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit card. A reading device may
   also be provided for the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
25 example as part of a loyalty program. The player tracking device may be in the
   form of a card having a machine readable element or any other portable
   storage medium capable of being read by the reading device.
   A top box 56 may carry artwork 58, including for example pay tables and details
30 of bonus awards and other information or images relating to the game. Further
