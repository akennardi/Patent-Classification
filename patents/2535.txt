   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
 5 having a game controller arranged to respond to a start
   condition by conducting game rounds until either a first
   or a second end condition is met. In each game round,
   symbols are selected by the game controller and displayed
   on a display at a set of display positions. The symbols
10 that are selected can include, first "enemy" symbols and
   second "hero" symbols.  When the game controller selects
   one or more enemy symbols, these are added to a first
   symbol display area separate to the display positions,
   thereby keeping a count of the enemy symbols and enabling
15 the player to view the current total. In embodiments of
   the invention, there are a plurality of different
   "enemies" and they are grouped together in the first
   symbol display area under the control of the game
   controller with separate counts being displayed for each
20 type of "enemy" so that a player can view both how many
   different "enemy" symbols have been collected and the
   total number of enemies collected. If the total number of
   enemies reaches a threshold number, a first end condition
   is met and the game ends. If a hero symbol is in the
25 selected symbols, one of the groups of enemies is removed
   by the game controller. Each time a group of enemy symbols
   is removed an award may be made. The first symbol display
   area is updated to reflect the removal of symbols so that
   the player can readily see the state of the game. If
30 removal of a group of enemy symbols results in the removal
   of all of the enemy symbols, a second, winning end
   condition is met resulting in the award of a prize by the
   game controller.
35 General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different physical
                                            10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

                               - 10
    forms. In a first form, a standalone gaming machine is
    provided wherein all or most components required for
    implementing the game are present in a player operable
    gaming machine.
  5
    In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
    wherein some of the components required for implementing
    the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
    and some of the components required for implementing the
10  game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
    For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
    wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
    gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
    such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
15  architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
    executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
    operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
    and/or visible gaming information to the player and
    receive gaming inputs from the player.
20
    However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
    envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
    wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
    and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
25  gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
    the gaming system may operate in standalone gaming machine
    mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending
    on the game being played, operating conditions, and so on.
    Other variations will be apparent to persons skilled in
30  the art.
    Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
    core components. At the broadest level, the core
    components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
35  60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
    arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
    the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
                                              10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

                               - 11
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
 5 Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
10 enable a player to input game play instructions            (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
15 that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
20 to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
25 provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory   and generating outputs  (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
30 general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
   integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array  (FPGA).
35 A gaming system in the form of a standalone gaming machine
   10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine 10
   includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
                                             10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

                               - 12
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
 5 game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.    Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
10 card.  Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
15 the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.    The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
20 module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module.

   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
10 Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
15 with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
20 player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the

   random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.

   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
35 mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be

   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
 5 player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
10 that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
15 In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
20 database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                   In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module - i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
25 communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
30 103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.               The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.               The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
35 103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B

   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
 5 input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
10 network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
15 machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three,
   four, five or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
20
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
25 associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
30 part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
35 management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the

   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
10 the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
15 could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
20 and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
25 example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.

   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
                                             10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.        For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.        For example, the game
 5 server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.    Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
10 may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Further detail of gaming system
15 Referring to Figure 6, the gaming system 1 has a game play
   mechanism 56. The player operates the game play mechanism
   56 to make a wager on the game. The wager specifies the
   win entitlement which will be evaluated for this play of
   the game and initiates a play of the game. Persons skilled
20 in the art will appreciate that a player's win entitlement
   will vary from game to game dependent on player
   selections. In most spinning reel games, it is typical for
   the player's entitlement to be affected by the amount they
   wager and selections they make       (i.e. the nature of the
25 wager) . For example, a player's     win entitlement may be
   based on how many lines they play in each game -                   e.g. a
   minimum of one line up to the maximum number of lines
   allowed by the game   (noting that not all permutations of
   win lines may be available for selection) and how much
30 they wager per line.    In a spinning reel game, such win
   lines are typically formed by a combination of symbol
   display positions, one from each reel, the symbol display
   positions being located relative to one another such that
   they form a line.
35
   In many games, the player's win entitlement is not
   strictly limited to the lines they have selected, for
                                                   10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

                              - 18
   example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
   player's selection of pay lines and are an inherent part
   of the win entitlement. In some embodiments, there may be
   an ante bet that the player needs to place which provides
 5 the player with the ability to achieve certain wins or
   changes the manner in which the game controller carries
   out game play in some manner.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in other
10 embodiments, the player may obtain a win entitlement by
   selecting a number of reels to play and an amount to wager
   per reel. Such games are marketed under the trade name
   "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd. The
   selection of the reel means that each displayed symbol of
15 the reel can be substituted for a symbol at one or more
   designated display positions. In other words, all symbols
   displayed at symbol display positions corresponding to a
   selected reel can be used to form symbol combinations with
   symbols displayed at a designated symbol display positions
20 of the other reels. For example, if there are five reels
   and three symbol display positions for each reel such that
   the symbol display positions comprise three rows of five
   symbol display positions, the symbols displayed in the
   centre row are used for non-selected reels. As a result,
25 the total number of ways to win is determined by
   multiplying the number of active display positions of each
   reel, the active display positions being all display
   positions of each selected reel and the designated display
   position of the non-selected reels. As a result for five
30 reels and fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to
   win.
   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
   shown implementing a number of modules based on program
35 code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that one or more the modules could be
   implemented in some other way, for example by a dedicated
                                            10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

                              - 19
   circuit or by a separate processor.
   These modules include the outcome generator 622 which
   operates in response to the player's operation of game
 5 play mechanism 56 to place a wager and initiate a play of
   the game. In an embodiment, a based game is carried out by
   the game controller each time the player makes a wager and
   can result in a feature game if a start condition is met
   that "triggers" the feature game. Depending on the
10 embodiment, the trigger event may be, a symbol combination
   in the game, occurrence of a specific symbol in the game,
   purchased, be caused by another connected system, based on
   turnover, based on a random evaluation, etc. In one
   example, the trigger event is the occurrence of three or
15 more scatter symbols in the base game. In some
   embodiments, an eligibility criteria may be applied by the
   game controller to determine whether the feature game can
   be triggered, for example that the player has made a
   certain sized wager, made an ante bet, selected all win
20 lines, played sufficient games, or the player is a member
   of a loyalty program.
   In an embodiment, the symbol selector 622A of outcome
   generator 622 selects symbols from a set of base game
25 symbols 641A specified by symbol data 641 using random
   number generator 621 to form a base game outcome. The
   selected symbols are communicated to the display
   controller 625 which causes them to be displayed on
   display 54 at a set of display positions.
30
   One example of selecting symbols is for the symbol
   selector 622A to select symbols for display from a
   plurality of symbol sets corresponding to respective ones
   of a plurality of spinning reels. In this embodiment, the
35 base symbol set 641A specifies a sequence of symbols for
   each reel such that the symbol selector 622A can select
   all of the symbols by selecting a stopping position in the
                                             10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

                              - 20
   sequence. In one example, three symbols of each of five
   reels may be displayed such that symbols are displayed in
   five columns with a total of fifteen display positions on
   display 54. It is known to use a probability table stored
 5 in memory 64 to vary the odds of a particular stop
   position being selected. Other techniques can be used to
   control the odds of particular outcomes occurring to
   thereby control the return to player of the game.
10 Once the base game symbols 641A are selected, they are
   evaluated by outcome evaluator 623.   In particular, symbol
   combination evaluator 623B compares the selected symbols
   with the symbol combinations 643A defined in pay table 643
   on the basis of the player's wager to determine whether to
15 make an award and the quantum of any award.         Further, the
   trigger monitor 623A determines whether the selected
   symbols satisfy a trigger condition.   As indicated above,
   this may be that the selected symbols include a defined
   number of scatter symbols.   In an embodiment, the
20 occurrence of a trigger condition in a base game outcome
   represents a start condition for conducting free games as
   a feature game.
   In an embodiment, the free games are conducted by the game
25 controller 60 until either a first or a second end
   condition is met.  In other embodiments, there may be
   additional end conditions 645, for example, a defined
   number of free games which represents the maximum number
   of free games that will be conducted before the feature
30 game ends.  In some embodiments, different numbers of free
   games may be awarded by the game controller depending on
   the nature of the trigger.   For example, free games may be
   awarded in proportion to the number of scatter symbols.
35 In each game round of the free games, the symbol selector
   622A selects symbols in a similar manner to that described
   in relation to the base game.   In an embodiment, the reels
                                             10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

                              - 21
   used in the feature game may be different to those used in
   the base game and hence, the symbol selector 622A selects
   symbols from the feature game symbols 641B.         In this
   respect, it will be appreciated by a person skilled in the
 5 art that the individual symbols used to make up the set of
   reels could be the same and the variance between the
   symbol set could result from differences in the
   distribution of the symbols, differences in the numbers of
   symbols, the number of symbols on the reels, etc. In other
10 embodiments, the symbols that are used may change during
   the feature game. In other embodiments the reels may be
   the same for the base and feature games.
   In the embodiment, when the feature game is triggered, the
   display controller 625 of game controller 60 adds a first
15 display area 54B to the display  (the reels being displayed
   in reel display area 54A).  In the embodiment, the feature
   game symbols include a subset of symbols which are
   designated as first symbols.   These symbols can be themed
   in accordance with the game.   In one embodiment, the first
20 symbols are themed as "enemies".   In one example, there
   may be four different enemies in the set of first symbols.
   In an embodiment, a defined number of these enemy symbols
   are added by the first symbol adjustor 622B to the first
   display area 54B on the display in response to the trigger
25 condition being met as monitored by trigger monitor 623A.
   In one example, one of each enemy symbol is added to the
   first display area 54B by the first symbol adjustor 622B.
   The first symbol display area is arranged so as to be able
   to display each type of enemy symbol separately so that
30 the player can readily view both the current number of
   types of enemy symbols and the current total of each type
   of enemy symbol.
   The symbol selector 622A then selects a set of symbols for
35 display in reel display area 54A.   In one embodiment,
   these symbols are evaluated by symbol combination
   evaluator 623B based on symbol combinations in pay table
                                             10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

                               - 22
   643A.   In another embodiment, the individual symbol
   combinations are not evaluated during the feature game. In
   an embodiment, the first symbol adjustor 622B adjusts the
   symbols displayed in first symbol display area 54B based
 5 on whether the selected symbols include any of the defined
   first, enemy symbols.   The first symbol adjustor adds a
   first symbol to the first symbol display area 54B for each
   occurrence of a first symbol in the symbols displayed in
   symbol display area 54A.   For example, if the selected
10 symbols 54A include two first symbols corresponding to a
   first enemy and one first symbol corresponding to a third
   enemy  (assuming, for this example, four different
   enemies),  the first symbol adjustor adjusts the number of
   symbols displayed by adding two first enemy symbols and
15 one third enemy symbol to the first symbol display area.
   The first symbol adjustor 622B, also updates a first
   symbol counter 642 in memory which defines the number of
   each type of symbols that have been accumulated.
20 In the embodiment, the first symbol adjustor 622B updates
   the first symbol display area 54B so that each of the
   types of first symbol are grouped together. Thus, if the
   above outcome were to be the first occasion on which the
   symbols were adjusted, the first display would show three
25 first enemy symbols, one second enemy symbols, two third
   enemy symbols, and one fourth enemy symbol -        i.e. a total
   of seven enemy symbols.
   In an embodiment, the end condition monitor 623C
30 determines whether the adjusted number of symbols meets a
   first end condition which is that the addition of first
   symbols to the first symbol display area 54B has led to a
   total number of enemy symbols reaching a defined number.
   For example, that there are sixteen or more first symbols
35 as a result of the generation of the outcome.           If so, the
   series of free games ends and the player is required to
   place a further wager to initiate a new play of the base
                                             10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

                              - 23
   game.
   In an embodiment, after the end condition monitor 623C
   determines whether the first end condition is met, the
 5 first symbol adjustor 622B determines whether the make an
   adjustment to the first symbols based on the occurrence of
   any second symbols in the symbols selected by a symbol
   selector 622 and displayed in reel display area 54A.                    In
   one example, these second symbols are themed as "hero"
10 symbols.  Depending on the embodiment, there may be one or
   more hero symbols.  In the embodiment, the occurrence of a
   hero symbol results in the removal of a group of first
   symbols. That is in the case where there are four
   different symbols, the occurrence of a hero symbol will
15 result in removal of all occurrences of one of the first,
   second, third or fourth enemy symbols.  In an embodiment,
   the first to fourth enemy symbols are allocated a ranking
   and all symbols of the lowest ranked group of symbols
   having a non-zero value is removed.  In an embodiment, the
20 enemy symbols are displayed in the first symbol area based
   on their ranking. This also involves the game controller
   60 resetting the first symbol counter for that group to
   zero.  Accordingly, assuming the lowest ranked symbol is
   the first enemy symbol and the highest ranked symbol is
25 the fourth enemy symbol, and at the time the hero symbol
   occurs there are one or more first enemy symbols all
   occurrences of the first enemy symbol will be removed from
   the first symbol display area 54B by the first symbol
   adjustor 6224.  If two hero symbols occur two groups of
30 enemy symbols will be removed by the first symbol adjustor
   622B.  If a current value of the lowest ranked symbol is
   zero, the first symbol adjustor 622b of game controller 60
   removes the next highest ranked group of symbol.
35 In an embodiment, the outcome evaluator includes a first
   symbol removal evaluator 623C which determines an amount
   of a removal award based on removal award data 643B stored
                                            10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

                               - 24
   in pay table.   The removal awards of the embodiment are
   based on the number of symbols that are removed and their
   relative value.   In an embodiment, higher values are
   associated with a higher ranked symbol.
 5
   The end condition monitor 623D determines whether the
   adjustment of the symbols caused by the appearance of any
   hero symbols results in the satisfaction of a second end
   condition.  In an example, this is that there are no more
10 enemy symbols displayed in first symbol display area.
   Accordingly, it will be appreciated that in the above
   example of four different first symbols, at least four
   hero symbols must occur before all enemy symbols can be
15 removed (and hence all first symbol counters 642 can be
   reset to zero because all enemy symbols have been
   removed).  Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that it is possible that after a particular enemy symbol
   has been removed, the relevant enemy symbol may occur in
20 an outcome of another game round generated by outcome
   generator 622 resulting in that symbol being added to the
   first symbol display area by the first symbol adjustor
   622B needing to be removed again in order for the second
   end condition to be met.
25
   In an embodiment, the second end condition, is a winning
   end condition and results in an additional prize being
   awarded to a player in addition to the prizes for first
   symbol removal.
30
   All awards that occur during a free game are transferred
   to a win meter, stored in meter data 644 and will be
   transferred to a credit meter at the end of a game.
35 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that there can
   be variations on the above embodiment.   For example, in
   some embodiments, the first symbol adjustor could act on
                                             10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

   the first end condition is met.
 5 Referring to Figure 7, there is shown a method 700 as
   carried out by the game controller of the gaming system.
   Initially, the gaming machine is waiting to determine
   whether it has received a wager 705.    If it has not
   received a wager, the gaming machine returns to a wait
10 state 710.  Upon receiving 705 a wager, the game
   controller conducts 715 a base game    and in addition to
   evaluating whether any winning outcomes have occurred in
   the base game for which an award is to be made, determines
   720 whether a trigger condition is met.    Upon a trigger
15 condition being met, the game controller 60 adds the first
   symbol display area 54B to the display and adds 730 a
   defined number of first symbols to the first symbol
   display area.   The game controller 60 then selects symbols
   735 and determines 740 whether the selected symbols
20 include first symbols.   If the selected symbols include
   first symbols, the game controller adds 745 first symbols
   to a first symbol display area.    The game controller
   determines 750 whether the number of first symbols has
   reached a defined number.    If it has, it ends 725 the
25 game.
   If the game controller determines that the addition of
   first symbols has not caused the defined number of first
   symbols to be reached or the outcome of the selection of
30 symbols 735 did not include first symbols, the game
   controller proceeds to determining 755 whether the
   selected symbols include one or more second symbols.                      If
   not, the game controller reverts to selecting 735a further
   set of symbols.   If the selected symbols of a particular
35 game round include one or more second symbols 755, the
   game controller removes a corresponding number of groups
   of first symbols 760 from the first symbol display area
                                              10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

                               - 26
   and makes 770 an award for each removal.      After each
   removal and/or addition of symbols the game controller
   updates the first symbol display area. The game controller
   then determines 775 whether a second end condition has
 5 been met which is whether all first symbols have been
   removed.   If not, the game controller reverts to selecting
   a further set of symbols 735.    If all the first symbols
   have been removed, the game controller awards 780 a prize
   and the game ends 725.

   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in another
   embodiment, the start condition for conducting a series of
   games may be the placement of a particular wager such that
   no base game is required and there is direct entry to the
15 feature game.
   Example
   In an embodiment, the feature game conducted by the game
20 controller consists of free games which are represented as
   a battle sequence occurring in the first symbol display
   area.   The first symbol display area 54B may be placed at
   the top of the screen above the reels.    In another
   embodiment, the first symbol display area may be displayed
25 on a separate display (for example, on a top box) of the
   gaming system.
   In an embodiment, during the free games, a scatter symbol
   substitutes for all symbols. In an embodiment, the feature
30 game cannot be retriggered during the free game.
   In an embodiment, a first symbol   (PIC 1) is designated as
   the "hero" and second to fifth symbols   (PIC2, PIC3, PIC4
   and PIC5) are designated as "enemies".    The enemy symbols
35 are ranked according to a symbol hierarchy with PIC2 being
   the highest and PIC5 being the lowest.    In an embodiment,
   when the feature game starts, one of each of the enemy
                                              10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

                               - 27
   symbols is placed on the screen in a first display area
   above the reels at the start of the feature.           In an
   embodiment, they are placed in an ordered row with a
   highest valued symbol (PIC2 823) on the far right as shown
 5 in Figure 8.
   As shown in Figure 8, there is an example layout of the
   first symbol display area 800 immediately after the
   feature game has triggered. There is one of each of a PIC5
10 811, PIC4 821, PIC3 831 and PIC2 841.    In the displayed
   order, symbols will be removed from left to right.
   If any of the four enemy symbols appear in the feature
   game, they are placed on top of the screen in the first
15 symbol display area such that the number of enemy symbols
   grows.  If a hero symbol appears in the selected symbols,
   a battle ensues in which the left most block, or group of
   symbols is removed for each hero symbol that appeared in
   the selected symbols.   Thus, if two heroes appeared in the
20 selected symbols, the two left most blocks or groups of
   enemies would be removed.    In this case, all PIC5 and PIC4
   symbols 811, 821.
   For each block of symbols that is removed by the game
25 controller, a prize is awarded in accordance with a battle
   prize table.   The prizes depend on the symbol and the
   number of the symbol in that removed block.
   Figure 9 shows an example of a possible appearance of the
30 first display area 900 during the feature game.               It will
   be apparent that there is a first group comprised of two
   PIC5 symbols 811, 812, a second group comprised of a
   single PIC4 symbol 821, a third group consisting of three
   PIC3 symbols 831 -  833, and a fourth group consisting of
35 two PIC2 symbols, 841, 842 resulting in a total of eight
   enemy symbols.
                                              10072480_1 (GHMatters) P99292.AU.2 14/03/18

                               - 28
   In the example, the feature game continues until all
   blocks have been removed from the screen by the game
   controller which is themed as a victory to the hero or,
   sixteen or more enemies in total are  (or would be),                in the
 5 first symbol display area which is themed as a victory to
   the villain.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
10 that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
   executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
   description certain steps are described as being carried
15 out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
   sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
20 such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
   may need to compute several values and compare those
   values.
   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
25 code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
    (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
   a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
30 server).  Further different parts of the program code can
   be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
   appreciate that program code provides a series of
   instructions executable by the processor.

                               - 29
    departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
    particular it will be apparent that certain features of
    embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
    further embodiments.
