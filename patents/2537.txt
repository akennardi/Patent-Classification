           The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent application
   number 2012322991, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
 5 Field of the Invention
           This invention relates to treating rheumatoid arthritis by inhibiting biological effects of
   granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor alpha subunit (GM-CSFRa), by
   administering an inhibitor such as the therapeutic antibody mavrilimumab.
10 Background
            Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory and destructive joint disease that
   affects approximately 1% of the population in the industrialised world. It affects approximately
   3 times more women than men and onset is generally between 40 - 60 years of age. RA is
   characterised by hyperplasia and inflammation of the synovial membrane, inflammation within
15 the synovial fluid, and progressive destruction of the surrounding bone and cartilage. It is a
   painful condition, can cause severe disability and ultimately affects a person's ability to carry
   out everyday tasks. Effects of RA vary between individuals, but the disease can progress
   very rapidly, causing swelling and damaging cartilage and bone around the joints. Any joint
   may be affected but it is commonly the hands, feet and wrists. Internal organs such as the
20 lungs, heart and eyes can also be affected.
           The cause of RA remains unknown, although studies have elucidated some aspects
   of the inflammatory processes underlying the disease.         RA is believed to be initiated and
   driven through a T-cell mediated, antigen-specific process.        In brief, the presence of an
   unidentified antigen in a susceptible host is thought to initiate a T-cell response that leads to
25 the production of T-cell cytokines with consequent recruitment of inflammatory cells, including
   neutrophils, macrophages and B-cells.
           Many pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are produced in the rheumatoid joint.
   Disease progression, reactivation and silencing are mediated via dynamic changes in
   cytokine production within the joint. In particular, TNF-a and IL-1 are considered to exert
30 pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of RA.
           GM-CSF      is a type I pro-inflammatory cytokine believed to contribute to the
   pathogenesis of RA through the activation, differentiation and survival of neutrophils and
   macrophages. Studies in rodent models have suggested a central and non-redundant role for
   GM-CSF in the development and progression of RA [1,           2, 3,    4,   5]. For example, in a
35 collagen induced arthritis (CIA) and monoarticular arthritis models in mice, administration of

                                            1a
murine anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody (mAb) significantly ameliorated disease severity.
In the CIA model, mAb treatment was effective in treating progression of established disease,
histopathology and

        WO 2013/053767                                                         PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                     2
   significantly lowering joint IL-1 and TNF-a levels. In addition, mAb treatment prior to arthritis
   onset lessened CIA disease severity [5, 6]. W02007/110631 proposed a novel RA therapy
   through inhibition of GM-CSFRa using a therapeutic antibody.
            Mavrilimumab (CAM-3001) is a human monoclonal antibody targeting the alpha subunit
 5 of GM-CSFR. A Phase 1 single ascending intravenous dose study of mavrilimumab in 32
   subjects with RA showed an adequate safety and tolerability profile, and initial indications of
   biologic activity, such as normalisation of acute phase reactants and possible reductions in
   Disease Activity Score 28-joint assessment (DAS28) in patients with moderate disease activity
   [7].
 o         The current drug management of RA includes palliative treatment, particularly
   analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and treatment to limit disease
   severity and progression, including disease modifying drugs (DMARDs) and biologics. The
   established management of RA using DMARDs includes the administration of single DMARDs,
   e.g. methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine or leflunomide, and their use in
 5 combination, for example methotrexate may be combined with sulfasalazine and/or
   hydoxychloroquine. Methotrexate is an antimetabolite and antifolate, although its efficacy in RA
   is believed to be due to the suppression of T cell activation and expression of adhesion
   molecule (ICAM-1) [8].
           Clinical use of biologic agents for RA mainly involves inhibitors of TNFa. These include
 o infliximab (Remicade@), etanercept (Enbrel@), adalimumab (Humira@), certolizumab pegol
   (Cimzia@) and golimumab (Simponi@). Infliximab is given by intravenous infusion whereas the
   other four are injected subcutaneously at home by the patient. An anti-interleukin 1 inhibitor,
   Kineret@, has also been developed. More recently, the anti-B lymphocyte drug rituximab
   (Mabthera@ or Rituxan@) has been approved for treatment of RA patients who have failed anti
25 TNF therapy. Mabthera@ is given as an initial treatment of two infusions 14 days apart. Those
   patients who experience improvement lasting up to six months can then have repeat infusions.
            Despite these advances, RA represents a significant unmet medical need. Although
   early diagnosis and treatment can improve the long term prognosis, there is currently no cure
   for RA. Improved therapies are needed to reduce the severity and progression of the disease
30 and to improve the quality of life of patients.
           A recent review by Campbell et al. [9] discusses development of the next generation of
   monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of RA.
            One measure of how well RA is being controlled is the Disease Activity Score (DAS) [10].
   The DAS is calculated by a medical practitioner based on various validated measures of
35 disease activity, including physical symptoms of RA. A reduction in DAS reflects a reduction in
   disease severity. A DAS of less than 2.6 indicates disease remission. DAS between 2.6 and
   3.2 indicates low disease activity. DAS greater than 3.2 indicates increased disease activity

        WO 2013/053767                                                            PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                         3
   and at this level a patient's therapy might be reviewed to determine whether a change in
   therapy is warranted. DAS greater than 5.1 indicates severe disease activity. Variations in
   calculating DAS can include assessing different numbers of joints in the patient and monitoring
   different blood components. DAS28 is the Disease Activity Score in which 28 joints in the body
 5 are assessed to determine the number of tender joints and the number of swollen joints[11].
   When the DAS28 calculation includes a measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) rather than
   erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), it is referred to as DAS28-CRP [12], [13]. CRP is
   believed to be a more direct measure of inflammation than ESR, and is more sensitive to short
   term changes [14]. CRP production is associated with radiological progression in RA [15] and
 0 is considered at least as valid as ESR to measure RA disease activity [16, 17].
            The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) proposed a set of criteria for classifying
   RA. The commonly used criteria are the ACR 1987 revised criteria [18]. Diagnosis of RA
   according to the ACR criteria requires a patient to satisfy a minimum number of listed criteria,
   such as tender or swollen joint counts, stiffness, pain, radiographic indications and
 5 measurement of serum rheumatoid factor. ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 are commonly used
   measures to express efficacy of RA therapy, particularly in clinical trials. ACR 20 represents a
   20 % improvement in the measured ACR criteria. Analogously, ACR 50 represents a 50 %
   improvement in the measured ACR criteria, and ACR 70 represents a represents a 70 %
   improvement in the measured ACR criteria.
 0          An individual, patient reported measure of disability in RA patients is the Health
   Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI). HAQ-DI scores represent physical
   function in terms of the patient's reported ability to perform everyday tasks, including the level of
   difficulty they experience in carrying out the activity. By recording patients' ability to perform
   everyday activities, the HAQ-DI score can be used as one measure of their quality of life.
25 Summary of the Invention
            The present invention relates to treatments for RA to provide clinical benefit including
   reducing DAS28-CRP and increasing the number of patients who obtain clinical benefit as
   determined by ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70. Further, the invention relates to methods and
   compositions for improving physical function of RA patients, as determined by the HAQ-DI.
30           Reported here for the first time are significant positive results from a Phase 2 clinical trial
   in which RA patients received the anti-GMCSFRa antibody mavrilimumab.
             In this double blind trial, RA patients with at least moderate disease activity according to
   DAS28-CRP and who were already undergoing treatment with stable doses of methotrexate
   were randomised to varying subcutaneous doses of mavrilimumab or placebo. In the group
35 treated with 100mg dose of mavrilimumab, the proportion of patients who achieved a decrease
   of more than 1.2 in DAS28-CRP was approximately double that of the control group. The ACR

       WO 2013/053767                                                            PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                       4
   scores, as well as their individual components, also showed significant improvements of similar
   magnitude. In the highest dose group (100 mg) of the European clinical trial, DAS28 remission
   criteria were met at day 85 in 23.1 % of patients, compared with 6.7 % of patients in the placebo
   group. For the combined European and Japanese clinical trials, the DA28 remission criteria for
 5 the 100mg dose was met at day 85 in 23.4% of patients compared with 7.6% of patients given
   placebo. No changes in respiratory function parameters, opportunistic infections, serious
   hypersensitivity reactions or laboratory abnormalities were observed in this study over the
   treatment period or during a 12 week follow up period, indicating a good safety profile.
            This is the first study showing that targeting GM-CSFRa in the treatment of RA can
 o provide a potential new therapeutic option with a rapid and profound onset of response,
   especially in the higher dose cohorts.
            Mavrilimumab is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody designed to modulate macrophage
   activation, differentiation and survival by targeting the GM-CSFRa. It is a potent neutraliser of
   the biological activity of GM-CSFRa and, without wishing to be bound by theory, may exert
 5 therapeutic effects by binding GM-CSFRa on leukocytes within the synovial joints of RA
   patients, leading to reduced cell survival and activation. W02007/110631 reports the isolation
   and characterisation of mavrilimumab and variants of it which share an ability to neutralise the
   biological activity of GM-CSFRa with high potency. The functional properties of these
   antibodies are believed to be attributable, at least in part, to binding a Tyr-Leu-Asp-Phe-Gln
 o motif at positions 226 to 230 of human GM-CSFRa as shown in SEQ ID NO: 206, thereby
   inhibiting association between GM-CSFRa and its ligand GM-CSF.
            Accordingly, in a first aspect, the invention is a method of treating RA in a patient to
   provide clinical benefit as measured by a decrease in DAS28-CRP by more than 1.2 and/or an
   improvement of at least 20 % treatment efficacy (ACR 20) as determined by the 1987 ACR
25 criteria, the method comprising administering a composition comprising a therapeutically
   effective amount of an inhibitor of GM-CSFRa to the patient.
            A further method according to the invention is a method of improving physical function of
   an RA patient, as determined by HAQ-DI, the method comprising administering a composition
   comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an inhibitor of GM-CSFRa to the patient.
30          Preferably, the inhibitor is mavrilimumab. Variants of mavrilimumab may also be used,
   and are described herein. The invention encompasses use of antibody molecules or other
   inhibitors which share functional properties of mavrilimumab, such as any one or more of:
   binding to the extracellular domain of GM-CSFRa, inhibiting binding of GM-CSF to GM-CSFRa,
   binding a Tyr-Leu-Asp-Phe-Gln motif at positions 226 to 230 of human GM-CSFRa as shown in
35 SEQ ID NO: 206, and/or binding to human GM-CSFRa extra-cellular domain with an affinity
   (KD) of 5 nM or less in a surface plasmon resonance assay.

            In a second aspect, the invention is a composition comprising the inhibitor of GM
   CSFRa for use in a method of treating rheumatoid arthritis in a patient to provide clinical benefit
   as measured by a decrease in DAS28-CRP by more than 1.2 and/or an improvement of at least
   20 % treatment efficacy (ACR 20) as determined by the 1987 ACR criteria, and/or for use in a
 5 method of improving physical function of an RA patient as determined by HAQ-DI.
            In a third aspect, the invention is a product or kit comprising
            (i) a composition comprising the inhibitor of GM-CSFRa packaged in a container, and
            (ii) a package insert or label with instructions for using the inhibitor in a method of
   treating rheumatoid arthritis in a patient to provide clinical benefit as measured by a decrease in
 0 DAS28-CRP by more than 1.2 and/or an improvement of at least 20 % treatment efficacy (ACR
   20) as determined by the 1987 ACR criteria, and/or for use in a method of improving physical
   function of an RA patient, as determined by HAQ-DI, wherein the method comprises
   administering a therapeutically effective amount of the inhibitor to the patient.
            In such a product or kit, the components are generally sterile and in sealed vials or other
 5 containers.
           A patient to be treated may have RA as determined according to the 1987 ACR criteria.
   The patient may test positive for rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide
   (CCP) IgG antibodies prior to treatment. RF positive and anti-CCP antibody positive status
   confirm diagnosis of RA. The patient may have had RA for a duration of at least 5 years or at
 0 least 7 years, for example between 5 and 10 years.
           The patient to be treated may have a baseline DAS28-CRP of at least 3.2 or at least 5.1,
   as measured before the start of treatment with the GM-CSFRa inhibitor. Inhibitors according to
   the invention have been shown to be effective even in patients with severe RA, including
   patients with a baseline DAS28-CRP of greater than 5.1 prior to treatment.
25         The treated patient may receive a stable dose of a DMARD, such as methotrexate, in
   combination with treatment with the GM-CSFRa inhibitor of the invention. Preferably, the
   treated patient will have received a stable dose of the DMARD, e.g. methotrexate, for at least 4
   weeks prior to the start of therapy with the inhibitor according to the invention. The dose of
   methotrexate is preferably between 7.5 to 25 mg per week.
30          Preferably, patients who are to be treated with an inhibitor according to the invention do
   not have respiratory disease. Patients may be tested prior to administration of the GM-CSFRa
   inhibitor to confirm that they do not have medically significant respiratory disease, e.g.
   pneumonitis. Methods of testing for respiratory disease include chest x-ray, and assessment of
   pulmonary function by spirometry and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Patients
35 also preferably do not have clinically significant chronic or recurrent infection, such as hepatitis
   C or chronic active hepatitis B infection. Patients may be tested for such infection prior to
   treatment according to the invention.

            Where treatment and clinical benefit are described here with reference to "a patient", it
   will be appreciated that this can include treatment of a group of patients. Patients are preferably
   human adults. Patients may for example be aged from 18 to 80 years old.
            Clinical benefit achieved in the methods described herein may comprise any one or
 5 more of the following outcomes.
            The clinical benefit may be a decrease in DAS28-CRP by more than 1.2. The reduction
   in DAS28-CRP may be achieved in at least 40 %, at least 50 % or at least 60 % of patients
   treated. The clinical benefit may comprise an increasing the proportion of patients who achieve
   a decrease in DAS28-CRP by more than 1.2, compared with control patients who are not
 0 treated with the inhibitor.
            The clinical benefit may comprise remission of RA. Typically, remission is defined by a
   DAS28-CRP of less than 2.6. Remission may be achieved in at least 10 % or patients, or at
   least 20 % of patients. In patients treated as described herein, the time to onset of remission
   may be reduced compared with patients who are not treated with a GM-CSFRa inhibitor
 5 according to the invention. Time to remission may be reduced by approximately 50 %.
            The clinical benefit may be an improvement of at least 20 %, at least 50 % or at least
   70 % treatment efficacy as determined by the 1987 ACR criteria, i.e. the clinical benefit may be
   achieving ACR 20, ACR 50 or ACR 70, respectively. Preferably, the clinical benefit comprises
   achieving ACR 20 in at least 40, 50, 60 or 70 % of patients. It may comprise achieving ACR 50
 0 in at least 20 % or at least 30 % of patients. It may comprise achieving ACR 70 in at least 5 %,
   10 % or 15 % of patients.
            A form of clinical benefit that is of particular value to RA patients is an improvement in
   their ability to perform everyday activities. Methods of the invention may comprise improvement
   in the patient's self-assessed disability measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire,
25 known as HAQ-DI. Methods comprising providing clinical benefit to an RA patient, wherein the
   clinical benefit comprises improving physical function of an RA patient as determined by HAQ
   DI, and compositions and kits for use in such methods, are all aspects of the invention. Clinical
   benefit may comprise improving physical function of an RA patient as determined by HAQ-DI.
   Preferably, a statistically significant improvement in HAQ-DI is achieved within twelve, ten, eight
30 or six weeks of starting treatment according to the invention, more preferably within four weeks,
   or more preferably within two weeks. The improvement may be at least a 0.25 improvement in
   HAQ-DI, i.e. a reduction of 0.25 or more in the patient's HAQ-DI score. Preferably, the
   improvement is at least a 0.30, 0.40 or 0.45 improvement in HAQ-DI score. Improvement is
   generally measured with reference to the patient's baseline average HAQ-DI score prior to
35 treatment with an inhibitor according to the invention. Where a group of patients is treated, the
   improvement may be observed in at least 50 %, at least 60 % or at least 70 % of treated
   patients.

       WO 2013/053767                                                          PCT/EP2012/070074

           The clinical benefit may be achieved sooner in treated patients compared with patients
   who are not treated with an inhibitor according to the invention. For example, patients who are
   treated with an inhibitor according to the invention in combination with methotrexate may
   achieve clinical benefit sooner than patients treated with methotrexate alone. The time to onset
 5 of response, or period of treatment before the clinical benefit is achieved, may be decreased by
   at least 10 %, at least 20 %, at least 30 %, at least 40 % or at least 50 % compared with
   patients who are not treated with the inhibitor. Preferably, the clinical benefit is achieved within
   85 days. So, for example, DAS28-CRP may be decreased by more than 1.2 within 85 days.
   More preferably, the onset of response occurs within 2 weeks. Thus, clinical benefit may be
 o achieved within 14 days of treatment with the inhibitor.
           The data from the clinical trial presented here show that an inhibitor according to the
   invention was associated with early onset of therapeutic action. A fast onset of DAS28-CRP
   response was observed as early as week 2, and the difference became significant at 29 days.
   An improvement in pain was observed by day 8, and an improvement of swollen and tender
 5 joints by day 29.
            Patients may be monitored during and/or following a course of treatment with the
   inhibitor, to assess the level of clinical benefit, for example by measuring DAS28-CRP and/or
   determining clinical benefit according to the ACR criteria and/or measuring HAQ-DI. The
   method may comprise determining that the clinical benefit is achieved, e.g. that the specified
 o reduction in DAS28-CRP, and/or achievement of ACR 20, ACR 50 or ACR 70 is met, and/or
   that the HAQ-DI score is improved, as discussed elsewhere herein.
           Clinical benefit may be enhanced relative to patients who are not treated with an
   inhibitor according to the invention. For example, the method may comprise treating patients by
   administering the inhibitor in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents, e.g. a
25 DMARD such as methotrexate, to provide enhanced clinical benefit compared with patients who
   receive the other therapeutic agent or agents, e.g. the DMARD and not the inhibitor. The
   enhanced clinical benefit may be a greater proportion of patients treated with the inhibitor.
   Preferably, at least 20 % more patients treated with an inhibitor as described herein (e.g. in
   combination with a DMARD such as methotrexate) achieve the clinical benefit compared with
30 patients who are not treated with the inhibitor (e.g. patients who receive the DMARD alone).
            Methods described herein may comprise administering the inhibitor to the patient in a
   therapeutically effective amount. The inhibitor may be administered at a dose of between 30 to
   150 mg, preferably 90 mg to 110 mg, more preferably 100 mg. These doses are preferably for
   subcutaneous administration, which is preferably in a volume of 1 ml. Preferably, the doses are
35 administered at intervals of 14 days (i.e. on day 1, day 15, day 29, etc). Alternatively, doses
   may be administered at intervals of 28 days. Further details of possible dosages and
   administration are described elsewhere herein. The method may comprise administering the

       WO 2013/053767                                                           PCT/EP2012/070074

   inhibitor to the patient, preferably by doses at intervals of 14 days, for a duration of at least 85
   days although treatment is preferably continued beyond 85 days, and patients may be
   maintained on the treatment indefinitely provided that they are suitably monitored. Preferably
   clinical benefit is achieved by day 85, more preferably by day 14, of the treatment. Preferably
 5 clinical benefit is achieved after only a single dose, or after only two doses, of treatment with the
   inhibitor.
            As shown by the trial data reported here, clinical benefits obtained through treatment
   with an inhibitor were maintained until at least the end of the 85 day course of treatment in the
   clinical trial. Accordingly, when clinical benefit has been achieved according to the invention,
 0 that benefit may be maintained over a period of continued treatment with the inhibitor, e.g. the
   results of treatment according to the invention may be maintained in the patient by continuation
   of treatment with the inhibitor over a period of at least a month, two months, three months, six
   months, a year or more.
            The inhibitor may be administered by any suitable method. Typical methods for antibody

   Inhibitors
            Described herein are inhibitors that bind human GM-CSFRa and inhibit binding of
 o human GM-CSF to GM-CSFRa. Generally, inhibitors bind the extracellular domain of GM
   CSFRa. The inhibitor preferably binds at least one residue of Tyr-Leu-Asp-Phe-Gln (YLDFQ),
   SEQ ID NO: 201, at positions 226 to 230 of mature human GM-CSFRa (SEQ ID NO: 206). The
   inhibitor may bind at least one residue in the YLDFQ sequence of human GM-CSFRa, e.g. it
   may bind one, two, three or four residues of the YLDFQ sequence. Thus, the inhibitor may
 5 recognise one or more residues within this sequence, and optionally it may also bind additional
   flanking residues or structurally neighbouring residues in the extra-cellular domain of GM
   CSFRa.
            Binding may be determined by any suitable method, for example a peptide-binding scan
   may be used, such as a PEPSCAN-based enzyme linked immuno assay (ELISA), as described
 o in detail elsewhere herein. In a peptide-binding scan, such as the kind provided by PEPSCAN
   Systems, short overlapping peptides derived from the antigen are systematically screened for
   binding to an inhibitor. The peptides may be covalently coupled to a support surface to form an
   array of peptides. Briefly, a peptide binding scan (e.g. "PEPSCAN") involves identifying (e.g.
   using ELISA) a set of peptides to which the inhibitor binds, wherein the peptides have amino
25 acid sequences corresponding to fragments of SEQ ID NO: 206 (e.g. peptides of about 15
   contiguous residues of SEQ ID NO: 206), and aligning the peptides in order to determine a
   footprint of residues bound by the inhibitor, where the footprint comprises residues common to
   overlapping peptides. In accordance with the invention, the footprint identified by the peptide
   binding scan or PEPSCAN may comprise at least one residue of YLDFQ corresponding to
30 positions 226 to 230 of SEQ ID NO: 206. The footprint may comprise one, two, three, four or all
   residues of YLDFQ. An inhibitor according to the invention may bind a peptide fragment (e.g. of
   15 residues) of SEQ ID NO: 206 comprising one or more, preferably all, of residues YLDFQ
   corresponding to positions 226 to 230 of SEQ ID NO: 206, e.g. as determined by a peptide
   binding scan or PEPSCAN method described herein. Thus, an inhibitor of the invention may
35 bind a peptide having an amino acid sequence of 15 contiguous residues of SEQ ID NO: 206,
   wherein the 15 residue sequence comprises at least one residue of, or at least partially overlaps

       WO 2013/053767                                                           PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                      18
   with, YLDFQ at positions 226 to 230 of SEQ ID NO: 206. Details of a suitable peptide-binding
   scan method for determining binding are set out in detail elsewhere herein. Other methods
   which are well known in the art and could be used to determine the residues bound by an
   antibody, and/or to confirm peptide-binding scan (e.g. PEPSCAN) results, include site directed
 5 mutagenesis, hydrogen deuterium exchange, mass spectrometry, NMR, and X-ray
   crystallography.
           Additionally, binding kinetics and affinity for human GM-CSFRa may be determined, for
   example by surface plasmon resonance e.g. using BlAcore. Inhibitors for use in the invention
   normally have a KD of less than 5 nM and more preferably less than 4, 3, 2 or 1 nM. Preferably,
 o KD is less than 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 or 0.15 nM.
           Typically, an inhibitor for use according to the present invention is a binding member
   comprising an antibody molecule e.g. a whole antibody or antibody fragment, as discussed in
   more detail below. Preferably the antibody molecule is a human antibody molecule. Typically,
   the antibody will be a whole antibody, preferably IgG1, IgG2 or more preferably IgG4.
 5         The inhibitor normally comprises an antibody VH and/or VL domain. VH domains and
   VL domains of binding members are also provided as part of the invention. Within each of the
   VH and VL domains are complementarity determining regions ("CDRs"), and framework regions,
   ("FRs"). A VH domain comprises a set of HCDRs and a VL domain comprises a set of LCDRs.
           An antibody molecule typically comprises an antibody VH domain comprising a VH
 o CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 and a framework. It may alternatively or also comprise an antibody VL
   domain comprising a VL CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 and a framework. Thus, a set of HCDRs
   means HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3, and a set of LCDRs means LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3.
   Unless otherwise stated, a "set of CDRs" includes HCDRs and LCDRs.
           A VH or VL domain framework comprises four framework regions, FR1, FR2, FR3 and
25 FR4, interspersed with CDRs in the following structure:
                             FR1   - CDR1  - FR2  - CDR2   - FR3  - CDR3 - FR4.
            Examples of antibody VH and VL domains, FRs and CDRs according to the present
   invention are as listed in the appended sequence listing that forms part of the present disclosure.
           WO2007/110631 described antibody molecules and other inhibitors, including the
30 antibody now known as mavrilimumab, which was isolated as one of a panel of optimised
   antibodies termed Antibody 1, Antibody 2 and Antibodies 4-20 (all derived from parent Antibody
   3). Sequences of these antibody molecules are shown in the appended sequence listing.
            Mavrilimumab is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody comprising a VH domain for which
   the amino acid sequence is set out in SEQ ID NO: 52 (encoded by SEQ ID NO: 51) and a VL
35 domain for which the amino acid sequence is set out in SEQ ID NO: 218 (encoded by SEQ ID
   NO: 217). The VH domain comprises heavy chain CDRs, in which HCDR1 is SEQ ID NO: 53,
   HCDR2 is SEQ ID NO: 54 and HCDR3 is SEQ ID NO: 55. The VL domain comprises light

       WO 2013/053767                                                         PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                    19
   chain CDRs, in which LCDR1 is SEQ ID NO: 58, LCDR2 is SEQ ID NO: 59 and LCDR3 is SEQ
   ID NO: 60. Sequences of the framework regions are VH FR1 SEQ ID NO: 251, VH FR2 SEQ
   ID NO: 252, VH FR3 SEQ ID NO: 253; VH FR4 SEQ ID NO: 254; VL FR1 SEQ ID NO: 255, VL
   FR2 SEQ ID NO: 256, VL FR3 SEQ ID NO: 257 and VL FR4 SEQ ID NO: 258, as shown in the
 5 appended sequence listing and listed in the associated key.
           In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the inhibitor is mavrilimumab, or is an
   antibody molecule comprising the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of
   mavrilimumab, e.g. comprising the VH and VL domains of mavrilimumab. Variants of
   mavrilimumab may be used, including variants described herein.
 0         As described in more detail in W02007/110631, certain residues within the CDRs of the
   VH and VL domains are especially important for receptor binding and neutralisation potency.
   Since the CDRs are primarily responsible for determining binding and specificity of a binding
   member, one or more CDRs having the appropriate residues as defined herein may be used
   and incorporated into any suitable framework, for example an antibody VH and/or VL domain
 5 framework, or a non-antibody protein scaffold, as described in more detail elsewhere herein.
   For example, one or more CDRs or a set of CDRs of an antibody may be grafted into a
   framework (e.g. human framework) to provide an antibody molecule or different antibody
   molecules. For example, an antibody molecule may comprise CDRs as disclosed herein and
   framework regions of human germline gene segment sequences. An antibody may be provided
 o with a set of CDRs within a framework which may be subject to germlining, where one or more
   residues within the framework are changed to match the residues at the equivalent position in
   the most similar human germline framework. Thus, antibody framework regions are preferably
   germline and/or human.
           As described in W02007/110631, the following positions were identified as contributing
25 to antigen binding: Kabat residues 27A, 27B, 27C, 32, 51, 52, 53, 90, 92 and 96 in the VL
   domain and Kabat residues 17, 34, 54, 57, 95, 97, 99 and 100B in the VH domain. In preferred
   embodiments of the invention, one or more of these Kabat residues is the Kabat residue
   present at that position for one or more of the antibody clones numbered 1, 2 and 4-20 whose
   sequences are disclosed in the appended sequence listing. In various embodiments the
30 residue may be the same as, or may differ from, the residue present at that position in antibody
   3.
           4 residue positions in the CDRs were found to have a particularly strong influence on
   receptor binding: H97, H100B, L90 and L92 (Kabat numbering). Preferably, H97 of VH CDR3
   is S. The serine residue at this position was observed in all 160 clones and therefore
35 represents an important residue for antigen recognition.
           Preferably, a VH CDR3 comprises one or more of the following residues:
   V, N, A or L at Kabat residue H95, most preferably V;

        WO 2013/053767                                                         PCT/EP2012/070074

   S. Kabat residue H94 is preferably I or a conservative substitution thereof (e.g. L, V, A or M).
   Normally H94 is 1.
            Preferably, a VL CDR3 comprises one or more of the following residues:

            In a preferred embodiment, an inhibitor used in the inventino is a binding member
   comprising one or more CDRs selected from the VH and VL CDRs, i.e. a VH CDR1, 2 and/or 3
   and/or a VL CDR 1, 2 and/or 3 of any of antibodies 1, 2 or 4 to 20 as shown in the sequence
25 listing. In a preferred embodiment a binding member of the invention comprises a VH CDR3 of
   any of the following antibody molecules: Antibody 1 (SEQ ID NO 5); Antibody 2 (SEQ ID NO
   15); Antibody 3 (SEQ ID NO 25); Antibody 4 (SEQ ID NO 35); Antibody 5 (SEQ ID NO 45);
   Antibody 6 (SEQ ID NO 55); Antibody 7 (SEQ ID NO 65); Antibody 8 (SEQ ID NO 75); Antibody

   VH CDR1 of SEQ ID NO: 3.

       WO 2013/053767                                                         PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                    21
           Preferably the binding member comprises a set of VH CDRs of one of the following
   antibodies: Antibody 1 (Seq ID 3-5); Antibody 2 (SEQ ID 13-15); Antibody 3 (SEQ ID 23-25);
   Antibody 4 (SEQ ID 33-35); Antibody 5 (SEQ ID 43-45); Antibody 6 (SEQ ID 53-55); Antibody 7

   one of these antibodies, and the VL CDRs may be from the same or a different antibody as the
 o VH CDRs. Generally, a VH domain is paired with a VL domain to provide an antibody antigen
   binding site, although in some embodiments a VH or VL domain alone may be used to bind
   antigen. Light-chain promiscuity is well established in the art, and thus the VH and VL domain
   need not be from the same clone as disclosed herein.
           A binding member may comprise a set of H and/or L CDRs of any of antibodies 1 to 20
 5 with one or more substitutions, for example ten or fewer, e.g. one, two, three, four or five,
   substitutions within the disclosed set of H and/or L CDRs. Preferred substitutions are at Kabat
   residues other than Kabat residues 27A, 27B, 27C, 32, 51, 52, 53, 90, 92 and 96 in the VL
   domain and Kabat residues 34, 54, 57, 95, 97, 99 and 100B in the VH domain. Where
   substitutions are made at these positions, the substitution is preferably for a residue indicated
 o herein as being a preferred residue at that position.
           In a preferred embodiment, a binding member of the invention is an isolated human
   antibody molecule having a VH domain comprising a set of HCDRs in a human germline
   framework, e.g. human germline framework from the heavy chain VH1 or VH3 family. In a
   preferred embodiment, the isolated human antibody molecule has a VH domain comprising a
25 set of HCDRs in a human germline framework VH1 DP5 or VH3 DP47. Thus, the VH domain
   framework regions may comprise framework regions of human germline gene segment VH1
   DP5 or VH3 DP47. The amino acid sequence of VH FR1 may be SEQ ID NO: 251. The amino
   acid sequence of VH FR2 may be SEQ ID NO: 252. The amino acid sequence of VH FR3 may
   be SEQ ID NO: 253. The amino acid sequence of VH FR4 may be SEQ ID NO: 254.
30         Normally the binding member also has a VL domain comprising a set of LCDRs,
   preferably in a human germline framework e.g. a human germline framework from the light
   chain Vlambda 1 or Vlambda 6 family. In a preferred embodiment, the isolated human antibody
   molecule has a VL domain comprising a set of LCDRs in a human germline framework
   VLambda 1 DPL8 or VLambda 1 DPL3 or VLambda 6_6a. Thus, the VL domain framework
35 may comprise framework regions of human germline gene segment VLambda 1 DPL8,
   VLambda 1 DPL3 or VLambda 6_6a. The VL domain FR4 may comprise a framework region of
   human germline gene segment JL2. The amino acid sequence of VL FR1 may be SEQ ID NO:

       WO 2013/053767                                                          PCT/EP2012/070074

   255. The amino acid sequence of VL FR2 may be SEQ ID NO: 256. The amino acid sequence
   of VL FR3 may be 257. The amino acid sequence of VL FR4 may be SEQ ID NO: 258.
           A non-germlined antibody has the same CDRs, but different frameworks, compared with
   a germlined antibody.
 5         Variants of the VH and VL domains and CDRs set out in the sequence listing can be
   obtained by means of methods of sequence alteration or mutation and screening, and can be
   employed in binding members for GM-CSFRa. Following the lead of computational chemistry in
   applying multivariate data analysis techniques to the structure/property-activity relationships
   [19] quantitative activity-property relationships of antibodies can be derived using well-known
 0 mathematical techniques such as statistical regression, pattern recognition and classification
   [20,21,22,23,24,25].     The properties of antibodies can be derived from empirical and
   theoretical models (for example, analysis of likely contact residues or calculated
   physicochemical property) of antibody sequence, functional and three-dimensional structures
   and these properties can be considered singly and in combination.
 5         An antibody antigen-binding site composed of a VH domain and a VL domain is formed
   by six loops of polypeptide: three from the light chain variable domain (VL) and three from the
   heavy chain variable domain (VH). Analysis of antibodies of known atomic structure has
   elucidated relationships between the sequence and three-dimensional structure of antibody
   combining sites [26,2 7]. These relationships imply that, except for the third region (loop) in VH
 0 domains, binding site loops have one of a small number of main-chain conformations: canonical
   structures. The canonical structure formed in a particular loop has been shown to be
   determined by its size and the presence of certain residues at key sites in both the loop and in
   framework regions [26,27].
           This study of sequence-structure relationship can be used for prediction of those
25 residues in an antibody of known sequence, but of an unknown three-dimensional structure,
   which are important in maintaining the three-dimensional structure of its CDR loops and hence
   maintain binding. These predictions can be backed up by comparison of the predictions to the
   output from lead optimization experiments. In a structural approach, a model can be created of
   the antibody molecule [28] using any freely available or commercial package such as WAM [29].
30 A protein visualisation and analysis software package such as Insight II (Accelerys, Inc.) or
   Deep View [30] may then be used to evaluate possible substitutions at each position in the CDR.
   This information may then be used to make substitutions likely to have a minimal or beneficial
   effect on activity.
           The techniques required to make substitutions within amino acid sequences of CDRs,
35 antibody VH or VL domains and binding members generally are available in the art. Variant
   sequences may be made, with substitutions that may or may not be predicted to have a minimal

   for any other desired property.
            Variable domain amino acid sequence variants of any of the VH and VL domains whose
   sequences are specifically disclosed herein may be employed in accordance with the present
 5 invention, as discussed. Particular variants may include one or more amino acid sequence
   alterations (addition, deletion, substitution and/or insertion of an amino acid residue), may be
   less than about 20 alterations, less than about 15 alterations, less than about 10 alterations or
   less than about 5 alterations, maybe 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1. Alterations may be made in one or more
   framework regions and/or one or more CDRs.
 0          Preferably alterations do not result in loss of function, so a binding member comprising a
   thus-altered amino acid sequence preferably retains an ability to bind and/or neutralise GM
   CSFRa. More preferably, it retains the same quantitative binding and/or neutralising ability as a
   binding member in which the alteration is not made, e.g. as measured in an assay described
   herein. Most preferably, the binding member comprising a thus-altered amino acid sequence
 5 has an improved ability to bind or neutralise GM-CSFRa compared with a binding member in
   which the alteration is not made.
            Alteration may comprise replacing one or more amino acid residue with a non-naturally
   occurring or non-standard amino acid, modifying one or more amino acid residue into a non
   naturally occurring or non-standard form, or inserting one or more non-naturally occurring or
 o non-standard amino acid into the sequence. Preferred numbers and locations of alterations in
   sequences of the invention are described elsewhere herein. Naturally occurring amino acids
   include the 20 "standard" L-amino acids identified as G, A, V, L, I, M, P, F, W, S, T, N, Q, Y, C,
   K, R, H, D, E by their standard single-letter codes. Non-standard amino acids include any other
   residue that may be incorporated into a polypeptide backbone or result from modification of an
25 existing amino acid residue. Non-standard amino acids may be naturally occurring or non
   naturally occurring. Several naturally occurring non-standard amino acids are known in the art,
   such as 4-hydroxyproline, 5-hydroxylysine, 3-methylhistidine, N-acetylserine, etc. [31]. Those
   amino acid residues that are derivatised at their N-alpha position will only be located at the N
   terminus of an amino-acid sequence. Normally in the present invention an amino acid is an L
30 amino acid, but in some embodiments it may be a D-amino acid. Alteration may therefore
   comprise modifying an L-amino acid into, or replacing it with, a D-amino acid. Methylated,
   acetylated and/or phosphorylated forms of amino acids are also known, and amino acids in the
   present invention may be subject to such modification.
            Amino acid sequences in antibody domains and binding members of the invention may
35 comprise non-natural or non-standard amino acids described above. In some embodiments
   non-standard amino acids (e.g. D-amino acids) may be incorporated into an amino acid
   sequence during synthesis, while in other embodiments the non-standard amino acids may be

       WO 2013/053767                                                         PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                    24
   introduced by modification or replacement of the "original" standard amino acids after synthesis
   of the amino acid sequence.
           Use of non-standard and/or non-naturally occurring amino acids increases structural and
   functional diversity, and can thus increase the potential for achieving desired GM-CSFRa
 5 binding and neutralising properties in a binding member of the invention. Additionally, D-amino
   acids and analogues have been shown to have better pharmacokinetic profiles compared with
   standard L-amino acids, owing to in vivo degradation of polypeptides having L-amino acids after
   administration to an animal.
           As noted above, a CDR amino acid sequence substantially as set out herein is
 o preferably carried as a CDR in a human antibody variable domain or a substantial portion
   thereof. The HCDR3 sequences substantially as set out herein represent preferred
   embodiments of the present invention and it is preferred that each of these is carried as a
   HCDR3 in a human heavy chain variable domain or a substantial portion thereof.
           Variable domains employed in the invention may be obtained or derived from any
 5 germline or rearranged human variable domain, or may be a synthetic variable domain based
   on consensus or actual sequences of known human variable domains. A CDR sequence of the
   invention (e.g. CDR3) may be introduced into a repertoire of variable domains lacking a CDR
   (e.g. CDR3), using recombinant DNA technology.
           For example, Marks et al. (1992) [32] describe methods of producing repertoires of
 o antibody variable domains in which consensus primers directed at or adjacent to the 5' end of
   the variable domain area are used in conjunction with consensus primers to the third framework
   region of human VH genes to provide a repertoire of VH variable domains lacking a CDR3.
   Marks et al.further describe how this repertoire may be combined with a CDR3 of a particular
   antibody. Using analogous techniques, the CDR3-derived sequences of the present invention
25 may be shuffled with repertoires of VH or VL domains lacking a CDR3, and the shuffled
   complete VH or VL domains combined with a cognate VL or VH domain to provide binding
   members of the invention. The repertoire may then be displayed in a suitable host system such
   as the phage display system of W092/01047 or any of a subsequent large body of literature,
   including ref. [33], so that suitable binding members may be selected. A repertoire may consist
30 of from anything from 104 individual members upwards, for example from 106 to 108 or 10"
   members. Other suitable host systems include yeast display, bacterial display, T7 display, viral
   display, cell display, ribosome display and covalent display. Analogous shuffling or
   combinatorial techniques are also disclosed by Stemmer (1994)[3 4], who describes the
   technique in relation to a p-lactamase gene but observes that the approach may be used for the
35 generation of antibodies.
           A further alternative is to generate novel VH or VL regions carrying CDR-derived
   sequences of the invention using random mutagenesis of one or more selected VH and/or VL

       WO 2013/053767                                                            PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                     25
   genes to generate mutations within the entire variable domain. Such a technique is described
   by Gram et al. (1992) [35], who used error-prone PCR. In preferred embodiments one or two
   amino acid substitutions are made within a set of HCDRs and/or LCDRs. Another method that
   may be used is to direct mutagenesis to CDR regions of VH or VL genes [36,3 7].
 5          A further aspect of the invention provides a method for obtaining an antibody antigen
   binding site for GM-CSFRa antigen, the method comprising providing by way of addition,
   deletion, substitution or insertion of one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequence of a
   VH domain set out herein a VH domain which is an amino acid sequence variant of the VH
   domain, optionally combining the VH domain thus provided with one or more VL domains, and
 0 testing the VH domain or VH/VL combination or combinations to identify a binding member or
   an antibody antigen-binding site for GM-CSFRa antigen and optionally with one or more
   preferred properties, preferably ability to neutralise GM-CSFRa activity. Said VL domain may
   have an amino acid sequence which is substantially as set out herein.
            An analogous method may be employed in which one or more sequence variants of a
 5 VL domain disclosed herein are combined with one or more VH domains.
            A substantial portion of an immunoglobulin variable domain will comprise at least the
   three CDR regions, together with their intervening framework regions. Preferably, the portion
   will also include at least about 50% of either or both of the first and fourth framework regions,
   the 50% being the C-terminal 50% of the first framework region and the N-terminal 50% of the
 0 fourth framework region. Additional residues at the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the
   substantial part of the variable domain may be those not normally associated with naturally
   occurring variable domain regions. For example, construction of binding members of the
   present invention made by recombinant DNA techniques may result in the introduction of N- or
   C-terminal residues encoded by linkers introduced to facilitate cloning or other manipulation
25 steps. Other manipulation steps include the introduction of linkers to join variable domains of the
   invention to further protein sequences including antibody constant regions, other variable
   domains (for example in the production of diabodies) or detectable/functional labels.
            Although in a preferred aspect of the invention binding members comprising a pair of VH
   and VL domains are preferred, single binding domains based on either VH or VL domain
30 sequences form further aspects of the invention. It is known that single immunoglobulin
   domains, especially VH domains, are capable of binding target antigens. For example, see the
   discussion of dAbs elsewhere herein.
            A binding member of the invention may compete for binding to GM-CSFRa with any
   binding member disclosed herein e.g. antibody 3 or any of antibodies 1, 2 or 4-20. Thus a
35 binding member may compete for binding to GM-CSFRa with an antibody molecule comprising
   the VH domain and VL domain of any of antibodies 1, 2 or 4-20. Competition between binding
   members may be assayed easily in vitro, for example by tagging a reporter molecule to one

        WO 2013/053767                                                         PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                     26
   binding member which can be detected in the presence of one or more other untagged binding
   members, to enable identification of binding members which bind the same epitope or an
   overlapping epitope.
            Competition may be determined for example using ELISA in which e.g. the extracellular
 5 domain of GM-CSFRa, or a peptide of the extracellular domain, is immobilised to a plate and a
   first tagged binding member along with one or more other untagged binding members is added
   to the plate. Presence of an untagged binding member that competes with the tagged binding
   member is observed by a decrease in the signal emitted by the tagged binding member.
   Similarly, a surface plasmon resonance assay may be used to determine competition between
 o binding members.
            In testing for competition a peptide fragment of the antigen may be employed, especially
   a peptide including or consisting essentially of an epitope or binding region of interest. A
   peptide having the epitope or target sequence plus one or more amino acids at either end may
   be used. Binding members according to the present invention may be such that their binding
 5 for antigen is inhibited by a peptide with or including the sequence given.
            Binding members that bind a peptide may be isolated for example from a phage display
   library by panning with the peptide(s).
            Where the inhibitor is an antibody molecule or other polypeptide, it may be produced by
   expression from encoding nucleic acid, for example from an expression vector in a recombinant
 o host cell in vitro. Suitable methods and cells are described in W02007/110631. Examples of
   encoding nucleic acid are provided in the appended sequence listing.
   Binding member
            This describes a member of a pair of molecules that bind one another. The members of
   a binding pair may be naturally derived or wholly or partially synthetically produced. One
25 member of the pair of molecules has an area on its surface, or a cavity, which binds to and is
   therefore complementary to a particular spatial and polar organisation of the other member of
   the pair of molecules. Examples of types of binding pairs are antigen-antibody, biotin-avidin,
   hormone-hormone receptor, receptor-ligand, enzyme-substrate. The present invention is
   concerned with antigen-antibody type reactions.
30          A binding member normally comprises a molecule having an antigen-binding site. For
   example, a binding member may be an antibody molecule or a non-antibody protein that
   comprises an antigen-binding site. An antigen binding site may be provided by means of
   arrangement of CDRs on non-antibody protein scaffolds such as fibronectin or cytochrome B
   etc. [39,40,41], or by randomising or mutating amino acid residues of a loop within a protein
35 scaffold to confer binding to a desired target. Scaffolds for engineering novel binding sites in
   proteins have been reviewed in detail [41]. Protein scaffolds for antibody mimics are disclosed

       WO 2013/053767                                                          PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                       27
   in WO/0034784 in which the inventors describe proteins (antibody mimics) that include a
   fibronectin type Ill domain having at least one randomised loop. A suitable scaffold into which
   to graft one or more CDRs, e.g. a set of HCDRs, may be provided by any domain member of
   the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. The scaffold may be a human or non-human protein.
 5          An advantage of a non-antibody protein scaffold is that it may provide an antigen-binding
   site in a scaffold molecule that is smaller and/or easier to manufacture than at least some
   antibody molecules. Small size of a binding member may confer useful physiological properties
   such as an ability to enter cells, penetrate deep into tissues or reach targets within other
   structures, or to bind within protein cavities of the target antigen.
 0          Use of antigen binding sites in non-antibody protein scaffolds is reviewed in ref. [38].
   Typical are proteins having a stable backbone and one or more variable loops, in which the
   amino acid sequence of the loop or loops is specifically or randomly mutated to create an
   antigen-binding site having for binding the target antigen. Such proteins include the IgG-binding
   domains of protein A from S. aureus, transferrin, tetranectin, fibronectin (e.g. 10th fibronectin
 5 type Ill domain) and lipocalins. Other approaches include synthetic "Microbodies" (Selecore
   GmbH), which are based on cyclotides - small proteins having intra-molecular disulphide bonds.
            In addition to antibody sequences and/or an antigen-binding site, a binding member
   according to the present invention may comprise other amino acids, e.g. forming a peptide or
   polypeptide, such as a folded domain, or to impart to the molecule another functional
 o characteristic in addition to ability to bind antigen. Binding members of the invention may carry
   a detectable label, or may be conjugated to a toxin or a targeting moiety or enzyme (e.g. via a
   peptidyl bond or linker). For example, a binding member may comprise a catalytic site (e.g. in
   an enzyme domain) as well as an antigen binding site, wherein the antigen binding site binds to
   the antigen and thus targets the catalytic site to the antigen. The catalytic site may inhibit
25 biological function of the antigen, e.g. by cleavage.
            Although, as noted, CDRs can be carried by scaffolds such as fibronectin or cytochrome
   B [39, 40, 41], the structure for carrying a CDR or a set of CDRs of the invention will generally
   be of an antibody heavy or light chain sequence or substantial portion thereof in which the CDR
   or set of CDRs is located at a location corresponding to the CDR or set of CDRs of naturally
30 occurring VH and VL antibody variable domains encoded by rearranged immunoglobulin genes.
   The structures and locations of immunoglobulin variable domains may be determined by
   reference to (Kabat, et al., 1987 [57], and updates thereof, now available on the Internet
   (http://immuno.bme.nwu.edu or find "Kabat" using any search engine).
            Binding members of the present invention may comprise antibody constant regions or
35 parts thereof, preferably human antibody constant regions or parts thereof. For example, a VL
   domain may be attached at its C-terminal end to antibody light chain constant domains including
   human CK or CX chains, preferably CX chains. Similarly, a binding member based on a VH

       WO 2013/053767                                                          PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                     28
   domain may be attached at its C-terminal end to all or part (e.g. a CH1 domain) of an
   immunoglobulin heavy chain derived from any antibody isotype, e.g. IgG, IgA, IgE and IgM and
   any of the isotype sub-classes, particularly IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4. IgG1, IgG2 or IgG4 is
   preferred. IgG4 is preferred because it does not bind complement and does not create effector
 5 functions. Any synthetic or other constant region variant that has these properties and
   stabilizes variable regions is also preferred for use in embodiments of the present invention.
            Binding members of the invention may be labelled with a detectable or functional label.
   Detectable labels include radiolabels such as    1311 or 99Tc, which may be attached to antibodies
   of the invention using conventional chemistry known in the art of antibody imaging. Labels also
 o include enzyme labels such as horseradish peroxidase. Labels further include chemical
   moieties such as biotin that may be detected via binding to a specific cognate detectable moiety,
   e.g. labelled avidin. Thus, a binding member or antibody molecule of the present invention can
   be in the form of a conjugate comprising the binding member and a label, optionally joined via a
   linker such as a peptide. The binding member can be conjugated for example to enzymes (e.g.
 5 peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase) or a fluorescent label including, but not limited to, biotin,
   fluorochrome, green fluorescent protein. Further, the label may comprise a toxin moiety such
   as a toxin moiety selected from a group of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE or a cytotoxic fragment
   or mutant thereof), Diptheria toxin (a cytotoxic fragment or mutant thereof), a botulinum toxin A
   through F, ricin or a cytotoxic fragment thereof, abrin or a cytotoxic fragment thereof, saporin or
 o a cytotoxic fragment thereof, pokeweed antiviral toxin or a cytotoxic fragment thereof and
   bryodin 1 or a cytotoxic fragment thereof. Where the binding member comprises an antibody
   molecule, the labelled binding member may be referred to as an immunoconjugate.
   Antibody molecule
           This describes an immunoglobulin whether natural or partly or wholly synthetically
25 produced. The term also covers any polypeptide or protein comprising an antibody antigen
   binding site. Antibody fragments that comprise an antibody antigen-binding site are molecules
   such as Fab, F(ab') 2, Fab', Fab'-SH, scFv, Fv, dAb, Fd; and diabodies.
            It is possible to take monoclonal and other antibodies and use techniques of
   recombinant DNA technology to produce other antibodies or chimeric molecules that retain the
30 specificity of the original antibody. Such techniques may involve introducing DNA encoding the
   immunoglobulin variable region, or the CDRs, of an antibody to the constant regions, or
   constant regions plus framework regions, of a different immunoglobulin. See, for instance, EP
   A-1 84187, GB 2188638A or EP-A-239400, and a large body of subsequent literature. A
   hybridoma or other cell producing an antibody may be subject to genetic mutation or other
35 changes, which may or may not alter the target binding of antibodies produced.

       WO 2013/053767                                                         PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                     29
            As antibodies can be modified in a number of ways, the term "antibody molecule" should
   be construed as covering any binding member or substance having an antibody antigen-binding
   site. Thus, this term covers antibody fragments and derivatives, including any polypeptide
   comprising an antibody antigen-binding site, whether natural or wholly or partially synthetic.
 5 Chimeric molecules comprising an antibody antigen-binding site, or equivalent, fused to another
   polypeptide are therefore included. Cloning and expression of chimeric antibodies are
   described in EP-A-01 20694 and EP-A-0125023, and a large body of subsequent literature.
            Further techniques available in the art of antibody engineering have made it possible to
   isolate human and humanised antibodies. Human and humanised antibodies are preferred
 0 embodiments of the invention, and may be produced using any suitable method. For example,
   human hybridomas can be made [42]. Phage display, another established technique for
   generating binding members has been described in detail in many publications such as ref. [42]
   and W092/01047 (discussed further below). Transgenic mice in which the mouse antibody
   genes are inactivated and functionally replaced with human antibody genes while leaving intact
 5 other components of the mouse immune system, can be used for isolating human antibodies
   [43].  Humanised antibodies can be produced using techniques known in the art such as those
   disclosed in for example W091/09967, US 5,585,089, EP592106, US 565,332 and
   W093/17105. Further, W02004/006955 describes methods for humanising antibodies, based
   on selecting variable region framework sequences from human antibody genes by comparing
 o canonical CDR structure types for CDR sequences of the variable region of a non-human
   antibody to canonical CDR structure types for corresponding CDRs from a library of human
   antibody sequences, e.g. germline antibody gene segments. Human antibody variable regions
   having similar canonical CDR structure types to the non-human CDRs form a subset of member
   human antibody sequences from which to select human framework sequences. The subset
25 members may be further ranked by amino acid similarity between the human and the non
   human CDR sequences. In the method of W02004/006955, top ranking human sequences are
   selected to provide the framework sequences for constructing a chimeric antibody that
   functionally replaces human CDR sequences with the non- human CDR counterparts using the
   selected subset member human frameworks, thereby providing a humanized antibody of high
30 affinity and low immunogenicity without need for comparing framework sequences between the
   non-human and human antibodies. Chimeric antibodies made according to the method are also
   disclosed.
            Synthetic antibody molecules may be created by expression from genes generated by
   means of oligonucleotides synthesized and assembled within suitable expression vectors [44,
35 45].
            It has been shown that fragments of a whole antibody can perform the function of
   binding antigens. Examples of binding fragments are (i) the Fab fragment consisting of VL, VH,

       WO 2013/053767                                                           PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                    30
   CL and CH1 domains; (ii) the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iii) the Fv
   fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single antibody; (iv) the dAb fragment [46,
   47, 48]   which consists of a VH or a VL domain; (v) isolated CDR regions; (vi) F(ab')2 fragments,
   a bivalent fragment comprising two linked Fab fragments (vii) single chain Fv molecules (scFv),
 5 wherein a VH domain and a VL domain are linked by a peptide linker which allows the two
   domains to associate to form an antigen binding site [49, 50]; (viii) bispecific single chain Fv
   dimers (PCT/US92/09965) and (ix) "diabodies", multivalent or multispecific fragments
   constructed by gene fusion (W094/13804; [51]). Fv, scFv or diabody molecules may be
   stabilised by the incorporation of disulphide bridges linking the VH and VL domains [52].
 0 Minibodies comprising a scFv joined to a CH3 domain may also be made [53].
            A dAb (domain antibody) is a small monomeric antigen-binding fragment of an antibody,
   namely the variable region of an antibody heavy or light chain [48]. VH dAbs occur naturally in
   camelids (e.g. camel, llama) and may be produced by immunising a camelid with a target
   antigen, isolating antigen-specific B cells and directly cloning dAb genes from individual B cells.
 5 dAbs are also producible in cell culture. Their small size, good solubility and temperature
   stability makes them particularly physiologically useful and suitable for selection and affinity
   maturation. A binding member of the present invention may be a dAb comprising a VH or VL
   domain substantially as set out herein, or a VH or VL domain comprising a set of CDRs
   substantially as set out herein. By "substantially as set out" it is meant that the relevant CDR or
 o VH or VL domain of the invention will be either identical or highly similar to the specified regions
   of which the sequence is set out herein. By "highly similar" it is contemplated that from 1 to 5,
   preferably from 1 to 4 such as 1 to 3 or 1 or 2, or 3 or 4, amino acid substitutions may be made
   in the CDR and/or VH or VL domain.
            Where bispecific antibodies are to be used, these may be conventional bispecific
25 antibodies, which can be manufactured in a variety of ways [54], e.g. prepared chemically or
   from hybrid hybridomas, or may be any of the bispecific antibody fragments mentioned above.
   Examples of bispecific antibodies include those of the BiTETM technology in which the binding
   domains of two antibodies with different specificity can be used and directly linked via short
   flexible peptides. This combines two antibodies on a short single polypeptide chain. Diabodies
30 and scFv can be constructed without an Fc region, using only variable domains, potentially
   reducing the effects of anti-idiotypic reaction.
            Bispecific diabodies, as opposed to bispecific whole antibodies, may also be particularly
   useful because they can be readily constructed and expressed in E.coli. Diabodies (and many
   other polypeptides such as antibody fragments) of appropriate binding specificities can be
35 readily selected using phage display (W094/13804) from libraries. If one arm of the diabody is
   to be kept constant, for instance, directed against GM-CSFRa, then a library can be made

       WO 2013/053767                                                         PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                    31
   where the other arm is varied and an antibody of appropriate target binding selected. Bispecific
   whole antibodies may be made by knobs-into-holes engineering [55].
   Antiqen-bindinq site
            This describes the part of a molecule that binds to and is complementary to all or part of
 5 the target antigen. In an antibody molecule it is referred to as the antibody antigen-binding site,
   and comprises the part of the antibody that binds to and is complementary to all or part of the
   target antigen. Where an antigen is large, an antibody may only bind to a particular part of the
   antigen, which part is termed an epitope. An antibody antigen-binding site may be provided by
   one or more antibody variable domains. Preferably, an antibody antigen-binding site comprises
 o an antibody light chain variable region (VL) and an antibody heavy chain variable region (VH).
   Kabat numbering
            Residues of antibody sequences herein are generally referred to using Kabat numbering
   as defined in Kabat etal., 1971 [56]. See also refs. [57, 58].
   GM-CSFRa and GM-CSF
 5          GM-CSFRa is the alpha chain of the receptor for granulocyte macrophage colony
   stimulating factor. The full length sequence of human GM-CSFRa is deposited under
   Accession number S06945 (gi:106355) [59] and is set out herein as SEQ ID NO: 202. The
   mature form of human GM-CSFRa, i.e. with the signal peptide cleaved, is set out herein as
   SEQ ID NO: 206. Unless otherwise indicated by context, references herein to GM-CSFRa refer
 o to human or non-human primate (e.g. cynomolgus) GM-CSFRa, normally human. GM-CSFRa
   may be naturally occurring GM-CSFRa or recombinant GM-CSFRa.
            The 298 amino acid extracellular domain of human GM-CSF receptor a has amino acid
   sequence SEQ ID NO: 205.
            Unless otherwise indicated by context, references herein to GM-CSF refer to human or
25 non-human primate (e.g. cynomolgus) GM-CSF, normally human.
            GM-CSF normally binds to the extracellular domain (SEQ ID NO: 205) of the mature
   GM-CSF receptor alpha chain (SEQ ID NO: 206). As described elsewhere herein, this binding
   is inhibited by binding members of the invention.
            Naturally occurring splice variants of GM-CSFRa have been identified - see for example
3o refs. [60 and 61]. The extracellular domain is highly conserved in these splice variants.
   Binding members of the invention may or may not bind to one or more splice variants of GM
   CSFRa, and may or may not inhibit GM-CSF binding to one or more splice variants of GM
   CSFRa.

   Binding affinity data usinq biosensor analysis
            Methods of determining binding affinity using surface plasmon resonance are known.
   See for example W02007/110631 for details of determining KD for antibody molecules. A
   BlAcore 2000 System (Pharmacia Biosensor) may be used to assess the kinetic parameters of
 5 the interaction with recombinant receptors. The Biosensor uses the optical effects of surface
   plasmon resonance to study changes in surface concentration resulting from the interaction of
   an analyte molecule with a ligand molecule that is covalently attached to a dextran matrix.
   Typically the analyte species in free solution is passed over the coupled ligand and any binding
   is detected as an increase in local SPR signal. This is followed by a period of washing, during
 0 which dissociation of the analyte species is seen as a decrease in SPR signal, after which any
   remaining analyte is stripped from the ligand and the procedure repeated at several different
   analyte concentrations. A series of controls are usually employed during an experiment to
   ensure that neither the absolute binding capacity or kinetic profile of the coupled ligand change
   significantly. A proprietary hepes buffer saline (HBS-EP) is typically used as the main diluent of
 5 analyte samples and dissociation phase solvent. The experimental data is recorded in
   resonance units (directly corresponding to the SPR signal) with respect to time. The resonance
   units are directly proportional to the size and quantity of analyte bound. The BlAevaluation
   software package can then be used assign rate constant to the dissociation phase (dissociation
   rate units s-1) and association phase (association rate units M-1 s-1). These figures then allow
 0 calculation of the Association and Dissociation Affinity Constants.
           As described in W02007/110631, the affinity of IgG4 can be estimated using a single
   assay in which the IgG4 is non-covalently captured by amine protein A surface. A series of
   dilutions of recombinant purification-tagged GM-CSF receptor extracellular domain, from 100 to
   6.25nM were then sequentially passed over the IgG4. The molarity of the receptor was
25 calculated using the concentration (Bradford) and the predicted non post-translationally
   modified mature polypeptide mass (39.7 kDa). Each of the two separate sets of data were
   analysed in identical formats. Reference cell corrected data was subject to fitting using the 1:1
   langmuir model set for simultaneous global calculation of the association and dissociation rates,
   with the Rmax value set to global. The level of IgG4 captured during each cycle was assessed
30 to ensure that the quantity captured remained stable during the entire experiment. Additionally,
   the dissociation rate of the IgG4 was assessed to determine if a correction for baseline drift was
   required. However, both the protein A interactions proved to be sufficiently reproducible and
   stable. The validity of the data was constrained by the calculated chi2 and T value (parameter
   value/offset), which had to be <2 and >100 respectively.

   Isolated
            Inhibitors or binding members, e.g. antibody molecules, are generally in isolated form.
   Isolated polypeptide binding members are free or substantially free of material with which they
   are naturally associated such as other polypeptides or nucleic acids with which they are found
 5 in their natural environment, or the environment in which they are prepared (e.g. cell culture)
   when such preparation is by recombinant DNA technology practised in vitro or in vivo. Inhibitors
   will be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents when used in therapy.
   Polypeptide binding members such as antibody molecules may be glycosylated, either naturally
   or by systems of heterologous eukaryotic cells (e.g. CHO or NSO (ECACC 85110503)) cells, or
 o they may be (for example if produced by expression in a prokaryotic cell) unglycosylated.
   Formulation and administration
            Anti-GM-CSFRa treatment may be given orally (for example nanobodies), by injection
   (for example, subcutaneously, intravenously, intra-arterially, intra-articularly, intraperitoneal or
   intramuscularly), by inhalation, by the intravesicular route (instillation into the urinary bladder),
 5 or topically (for example intraocular, intranasal, rectal, into wounds, on skin). The treatment
   may be administered by pulse infusion, particularly with declining doses of the inhibitor. The
   route of administration can be determined by the physicochemical characteristics of the
   treatment, by special considerations for the disease or by the requirement to optimise efficacy
   or to minimise side-effects. It is envisaged that anti-GM-CSFRa treatment will not be restricted
 0 to use in the clinic. Therefore, subcutaneous injection using a needle free device is also
   preferred. For subcutaneous administration, the inhibitor is usually administered in a volume of
   1 ml. Accordingly, formulations of the desired dose in individual volumes of 1 ml may be
   provided for subcutaneous administration.
            A composition may be administered alone or in combination with other treatments, either
25 simultaneously or sequentially dependent upon the condition to be treated. Normally, the
   different therapeutic agents are provided in separate compositions, although in some cases
   combined formulations may be used. Combination treatments may be used to provide
   significant synergistic effects, particularly the combination of an anti-GM-CSFRa binding
   member with one or more other drugs. An inhibitor according to the present invention may be
30 provided in combination or addition to one or more of the following: NSAIDs (e.g., cox inhibitors
   such as diclofenac or Celecoxib and other similar cox2 inhibitors), corticosteroids (e.g.
   prednisone oral and/or parenteral) and DMARDs e.g. Humira (adalimumab), methotrexate,
   Arava, Enbrel (Etanercept), Remicade (Infliximab), Kineret (Anakinra), Rituxan (Rituximab),
   Orencia (abatacept), gold salts, antimalarials e.g. antimalarials (e.g., chloroquine,
35 hydroxychloroquine), sulfasalazine, d-penicillamine, cyclosporin A, cyclophosphamide,

   (Simponi@).
            In accordance with the present invention, compositions provided may be administered to
   individuals. Administration is preferably in a "therapeutically effective amount", this being
 5 sufficient to show benefit to a patient. Such benefit may be at least amelioration of at least one
   symptom. The actual amount administered, and rate and time-course of administration, will
   depend on the nature and severity of what is being treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g.
   decisions on dosage etc, is within the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical
   doctors, and may depend on the severity of the symptoms and/or progression of a disease
 o being treated. Appropriate doses of antibody are well known in the art [62,6 3]. Specific
   dosages indicated herein, or in the Physician's Desk Reference (2003) as appropriate for the
   type of medicament being administered, may be used. A therapeutically effective amount or
   suitable dose of an inhibitor of the invention can be determined by comparing its in vitro activity
   and in vivo activity in an animal model. Methods for extrapolation of effective dosages in mice
 5 and other test animals to humans are known. The precise dose will depend upon a number of
   factors, including whether the antibody is for diagnosis or for treatment, the size and location of
   the area to be treated, the precise nature of the antibody (e.g. whole antibody, fragment or
   diabody), and the nature of any detectable label or other molecule attached to the antibody.
           A typical antibody dose will be in the range 10 - 150 mg, 50 - 150 mg, 80 - 140 mg or
 o 90 - 110 mg, or most preferably 100 mg. These doses may be provided for subcutaneous
   administration in a volume of 1 ml. This is a dose for a single treatment of an adult patient,
   which may be proportionally adjusted for children and infants, and also adjusted for other
   antibody formats in proportion to molecular weight. Dose and formulation can be adjusted for
   alternative routes of administration. For example, intravenous administration of mavrilimumab
25 at up to 10 mg/kg has been described [7].
           Treatments may be repeated at daily, twice-weekly, weekly or monthly intervals, at the
   discretion of the physician. In a preferred treatment regimen, the inhibitor is administered at
   intervals of 14 days. Treatment may need to be continued in order to maintain or further
   improve clinical benefit and/or to sustain or further improve a reduce the patient's HAQ-DI score.
30 Preferably, duration of treatment is at least 85 days, and may be continued indefinitely.
           The data shown herein additionally indicate that patients treated with an inhibitor
   according to the invention may continue to benefit from effects of the treatment for a sustained
   period after administration of the inhibitor, including clinical benefits such as a reduced DAS28
   CRP. Clinical benefit may be maintained at the same level, or in some cases at a lower but still
35 significant level of benefit, for a period of at least one month, at least two months, or at least
   three months following administration of the inhibitor, for example following administration of at
   least three regular doses of the inhibitor. Thus, in some embodiments, methods of the invention

       WO 2013/053767                                                            PCT/EP2012/070074
                                                        35
   may accommodate one or more           pauses  in treatment where required, while continuing to provide
   a therapeutic benefit to the patient for at least one month, at least two months, or at least three
   months.
            Where treatment is combined with surgery, the treatment may be given before, and/or
 5 after surgery. The treatment may optionally be administered or applied directly at the
   anatomical site of surgical treatment.
             Inhibitors will usually be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, which
   may comprise at least one component in addition to the binding member. Thus pharmaceutical
   compositions for use in accordance with the present invention may comprise, in addition to
 0 active ingredient, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer, stabiliser or other
   materials well known to those skilled in the art. Such materials should be non-toxic and should
   not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The precise nature of the carrier or other
   material will depend on the route of administration, which may be oral, or by injection, e.g.
   intravenous. Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be in tablet, capsule,
 5 powder, liquid or semi-solid form. A tablet may comprise a solid carrier such as gelatin or an
   adjuvant. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally comprise a liquid carrier such as water,
   petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil. Physiological saline solution,
   dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or
   polyethylene glycol may be included. For intravenous injection, or injection at the site of
 0 affliction, the active ingredient will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution
   which is pyrogen-free and has suitable pH, isotonicity and stability. Those of relevant skill in the
   art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using, for example, isotonic vehicles such as
   Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Lactated Ringer's Injection. Preservatives,
   stabilisers, buffers, antioxidants and/or other additives may be included, as required. Binding
25 members of the present invention may be formulated in liquid, semi-solid or solid forms
   depending on the physicochemical properties of the molecule and the route of delivery.
   Formulations may include excipients, or combinations of excipients, for example: sugars, amino
   acids and surfactants. Liquid formulations may include a wide range of antibody concentrations
   and pH. Solid formulations may be produced by lyophilisation, spray drying, or drying by
30 supercritical fluid technology, for example. Formulations of anti-GM-CSFRa will depend upon
   the intended route of delivery: for example, formulations for pulmonary delivery may consist of
   particles with physical properties that ensure penetration into the deep lung upon inhalation;
   topical formulations may include viscosity modifying agents, which prolong the time that the
   drug is resident at the site of action. In certain embodiments, the binding member may be
35 prepared with a carrier that will protect the binding member against rapid release, such as a
   controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated
   delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl

   DAS28-CRP
 5         Clinical benefit may be determined based on reduction in DAS28-CRP, for example
   decreasing DAS28-CRP by more than 1.2, and/or reducing DAS28-CRP to less than 2.6.
           DAS28-CRP can be determined as described previously [12], [13]. As described by
   Wells et al. [13], the DAS28 considers 28 tender and swollen joint counts, general health (GH;
   patient assessment of disease activity using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) with 0=best,
 o 100=worst), plus levels of an acute phase reactant (either ESR (mm/h) or CRP (mg/litre)).
   DAS28 values are calculated as follows:
   DAS28-CRP = 0.56*(TJC28)+0.28*(SJC28)+0.014*GH+0.36*ln(CRP+1)+0.96;
   where TJC=tender joint count and SJC=swollen joint count.
   ACR criteria
 5         Clinical benefit may be determined based on the ACR criteria. The RA patient can be
   scored at for example, ACR 20 (20 percent improvement) compared with no treatment (e.g
   baseline before treatment) or treatment with placebo. Typically it is convenient to measure
   improvement compared with the patient's baseline value. The ACR 20 criteria may include 20%
   improvement in both tender (painful) joint count and swollen joint count plus a 20%
 o improvement in at least 3 of 5 additional measures:
   1. patient's pain assessment by visual analog scale (VAS),
   2. patient's global assessment of disease activity (VAS),
   3. physician's global assessment of disease activity (VAS),
   4. patient's self-assessed disability measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ),
25 and
   5. acute phase reactants, CRP or ESR.
           The HAQ, introduced in 1980, was among the first patient-reported outcome instruments
   designed to represent a model of patient-oriented outcome assessment [65].
           The ACR 50 and 70 are defined analogously. Preferably, the patient is administered an
30 amount of a CD20 antibody of the invention effective to achieve at least a score of ACR 20,
   preferably at least ACR 30, more preferably at least ACR 50, even more preferably at least ACR
   70, most preferably at least ACR 75 and higher.

   Study design overview
            A total of 516 subjects were screened, with 239 European subjects and 51 Japanese
   subjects subsequently being randomised into the four cohorts. Of these, 284 were included in
 5 the ITT population. All cohorts were well balanced in terms of baseline and disease
   characteristics.

                            moderately to severely active RA
 5          A Phase 2 randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multiple ascending dose study
   was performed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of mavrilimumab in subjects with
   RA. The trial permitted evaluation of a number of factors including clinical outcomes in RA, the
   relationship between dosage and safety and efficacy, and the pharmacokinetics and
   immunogenicity of mavrilimumab.
 o          Subjects with at least moderately active RA received multiple doses of mavrilimumab
   administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate, or received methotrexate alone,
   over an 85 day dosing period in which mavrilimumab or placebo was administered every 14
   days. Stable doses of methotrexate were maintained, with supplemental folic acid 5 mg/week.
   Subjects were also monitored over a further 12 week followup period.
25          Subjects were permitted to receive stable doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
   and oral corticosteroids (510 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent).
            The target population were female or male 18 - 80 year olds with RA as defined by the
   1987 ACR classification criteria [18] of at least 3 months' duration, despite treatment with
   methotraxate, with moderate to severe disease activity defined by DAS28         3.2 at screening
30 and baseline, receiving methotrexate at 7.5 - 25 mg/week for at least 12 weeks prior to
   screening, with supplemental folic acid 5mg/week and with the methotrexate kept at a stable
   dose for at least 4 weeks prior to screening, and were positive for rheumatoid factor and/or anti
   CCP IgG antibodies.
            Due to a potential risk that inhibition of the GM-CSF pathway could suppress alveolar
35 macrophage function [66], additional pulmonary tests were added to closely monitor lung
   function

            Efficacy assessments were performed at baseline and every 2 weeks during the
   treatment period. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of combined
   mavrilimumab-treated subjects achieving an improvement of 1.2 from baseline in DAS28-CRP
   [13] versus placebo at Week 12. Response rate was calculated, where a responder was
 5 defined as a subject showing a decrease of more than 1.2 from their baseline DAS28-CRP.
           Secondary efficacy endpoints were ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses, remission
   rate (DAS28-CRP < 2.6) and DAS-28-CRP EULAR response criteria. Additional assessments
   included the time to onset of remission, an improvement of 1.2 points from baseline, swollen
   and tender joint count and measurements of acute phase reactants (CRP and ESR). Patient
 o reported outcomes including the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)
   [6 7] were also measured.
   Statistical methods
            Sample size calculations were based on the primary efficacy endpoint (change of 1.2
   points in DAS28-CRP at Week 12). A placebo response rate of 10%, a 15% drop-out rate, a
 5 two-sided Type 1 error of 0.05, and a 2:1 (active:placebo) randomization ratio were assumed,
   providing a total sample size of 216 subjects with 86% power to detect a 20% difference in
   response rates for an analysis based on a two-sided Fisher's exact test. A further 48 subjects
   were required in the Japan cohorts to give an overall planned sample size of 264 subjects.
           All response rates, including the primary endpoint, ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70, were
 o analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Changes from baseline in DAS28 score were analyzed using
   a mixed-model repeated measures analysis with a covariate for baseline DAS28. The DAS28
   European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria were analyzed using a
   Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Improvement in DAS28 was categorised using the EULAR
   response criteria as shown below:

30 Sensitivity analyses were conducted using the per protocol (PP) population. Each analysis was
   conducted to compare the combined placebo and combined mavrilimumab groups, followed by
   comparison of the combined placebo group with each of the mavrilimumab dose cohorts.

  Analysis of safety data was carried out on the safety population, defined as all subjects who
  received any dose of study medication.
          For the primary endpoint as well as the other responder analyses, a non-responder
  imputation was used for subjects who withdrew from study treatment, changed the dose of
5 background methotrexate or received other RA medication. Other missing data points were
  imputed using last-observation-carried-forward methodology. No imputation was applied for the
  DAS28 change from baseline analysis.

   Summary of results and conclusions
 5 Results: At Week 12, 55.7% of mavrilimumab-treated subjects achieved a DAS28-CRP
   response vs 34.7% in the placebo group (p=0.003). In the individual cohorts 41.0% (10mg;
   p=0.543), 61.0% (30mg; p=0.011), 53.8% (50mg; p=0.071) and 66.7% (100mg; p=0.001) of
   subjects, respectively, were responders. A fast onset of response was observed as early as
   Week 2, and the difference became significant at 29 days (p=0.01 7). The 100 mg dose
 0 delivered significant improvements compared with placebo in DAS28-CRP remissions (23.1%
   vs 6.7%, p=0.01 6), all categories of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response
   criteria (ACR20: 69.2% vs 40.0%, p=0.005; ACR50: 30.8% vs 12.0%, p=0.021; ACR70: 17.9%
   vs 4.0%, p=0.030) and the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) (-0.48
   mean improvement vs -0.25, p=0.005).       Mavrilimumab was associated with normalisation
L5 rather than suppression of acute phase reactants (CRP and ESR). Adverse events were
   generally mild or moderate in intensity. No significant hypersensitivity reactions, serious or
   opportunistic infections or changes in pulmonary parameters were reported. Treatment with
   mavrilimumab was not associated with any specific safety risks.
20 Conclusions: Mavrilimumab showed a rapid and profound onset of response, especially in the
   higher dose cohorts. Efficacy was maintained for 12 weeks with an acceptable safety profile to
   support further clinical development.

   Efficacy
            In each treatment group, response rate was determined as the percentage of subjects
   meeting the defined criteria, e.g. achieving a reduction in DAS28-CRP by more than 1.2, or
 5 achieving ACR 20, ACR 50 or ACR 70.
            Response rate was determined by DAS28-CRP improvement > 1.2 for each treatment
   group over the 85 day treatment period (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3). Overall, 60.5 % of
   subjects receiving mavrilimumab in the 30 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg dose cohorts showed an
   improvement (i.e. reduction) in DAS28-CRP of more than 1.2. In the 100 mg dose cohort, this
 o figure was 66.7 %. These response rates compared with a 30.4% response rate in the
   corresponding control (placebo) cohorts. These figures indicate that treatment with
   mavrilimumab approximately doubled the proportion of subjects showing a reduction of DAS28
   CRP by more than 1.2, compared with those who did not receive mavrilimumab. The group
   receiving 100 mg mavrilimumab also showed overall the most rapid response and the biggest
 5 response rate. Time to onset of response for each subject is shown in Figure 4, using the
   Kaplan Meier method to calculate the values shown in the plot. Figure 5 is an empirical
   distribution plot of DAS28-CRP at day 85.
           Treatment with mavrilimumab (all doses combined, n=1 58) was associated with a
   significantly higher proportion of patients achieving a 1.2-point reduction in DAS28-CRP score
 o from baseline than placebo (n=75) at Week 12 (55.7% vs. 34.7% of those receiving placebo;
   p=0.003). The proportion of responders in the individual 10, 30, 50 and 100 mg cohorts were
   41.0% (p=0.543), 61.0% (p=0.01 1), 53.8% (p=0.071) and 66.7% (p=0.001), respectively. When
   the 10 mg dose and matching placebo were removed from the analysis, 60.5% of
   mavrilimumab-treated subjects achieved response criteria vs 30.4% on placebo (p<0.001). A
25 significant difference in terms of adjusted mean change from baseline in DAS28-CRP score for
   the 50 mg and 100 mg cohorts compared with placebo (p=0.013 and p=0.004, respectively) as
   early as Week 2 was also demonstrated.

   Safety
           All patients were monitored for adverse events (AE) including serious adverse events
   (SAE) throughout the study.
           Pulmonary function (FEV 1 , FVC, DLCO) tests and dyspnea scores were assessed to
L5 monitor any respiratory related adverse events due to the potential for modulation of alveolar
   macrophage function and surfactant homeostasis in the lung [68]. Other safety assessments
   included incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), serum
   chemistry, haematology, pregnancy testing for females of childbearing potential and urinalysis.
   Anti-drug antibodies were assessed at Weeks 5, 7 and 9 during the study treatment period, and
20 weekly throughout the follow-up period.
           Over the 12-week treatment period, 26 (32.9%) subjects receiving placebo and 73
   (45.6%) subjects receiving any dose of mavrilimumab experienced an AE. The most frequently
   reported AE was a decrease in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO), though these
   events were not concluded to be clinically significant following further investigation by an
25 independent pulmonologist. Nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections (mild-to
   moderate in severity) were the next most common events. Most AEs were mild or moderate,

  and only three subjects withdrew due to safety reasons. One subject receiving placebo
  withdrew due to worsening of RA. Two subjects discontinued dosing due to changes in DLCO
  as mandated by the protocol. There were no instances of clinically significant or persistent
  changes in lung function.
5         Treatment-related AEs occurred in 10/79 (12.7%) subjects receiving placebo and 27/160
  (16.9%) subjects receiving mavrilimumab. There were no deaths during the study, and there
  was no relationship between mavrilimumab dose and the frequency or severity of any AE.
          SAEs were reported in one (1.3%) subject in the placebo group (worsening of RA,
  described above) and three (1.9%) subjects receiving mavrilimumab (two [5.1%] in the 10 mg
0 cohort, one intervertebral disc disorder and one spontaneous abortion; and one [2.4%] in the 30
  mg cohort, a fracture of the humerus). We found none of the SAEs were related to the study
  medication, and observed no serious infections or infestations.
          No instances of anaphylaxis or serious injection site reactions (local or systemic) were
  reported during the treatment period and only one (2.5%) subject in the 50 mg cohort
5 experienced hypersensitivity. Anti-drug antibodies were detected across all treatment groups,
  including placebo. No effect of anti-drug antibodies on the efficacy, safety or tolerability of
  mavrilimumab was observed.

   Rapid Onset of Action and Sustained Efficacy
 5           In the clinical trial reported here, treatment with mavrilimumab ended on day 85. At the
   highest (100mg) dose, 23.1% of subjects achieved DAS28-CRP<2.6 (placebo: 6.7%) and
   17.9% showed and ACR70 response (placebo: 4.0%). Separation between the placebo and
   active groups was observed as early as week 4 for DAS28-CRP<2.6, suggesting a rapid onset
   of action.
 0           Monitoring of patients after the end of the 85 day treatment period showed that the
   clinical response was sustained over a prolonged period following the final administration of
   mavrilimumab, and the number of subjects achieving DAS28-CRP<2.6 and/or ACR70 response
   was still rising at 12 weeks, suggesting that peak efficacy may not have been achieved and
   indicating the beneficial effects of mavrilimumab therapy continue over a period of at least
L5 several weeks.
             Figure 21 shows mean DAS28-CRP for patients treated with mavrilimumab, and for the
   placebo group, as recorded on each treatment visit and on follow up visits until day 169. Figure
   22 shows response rate per visit until day 169. Response was defined as a DAS28-CRP
   decrease from baseline of at least 1.2 These data show that the effects of mavrilimumab on
2o DAS28-CRP extended beyond day 85 when treatment finished.
             A sustained ACR20 response was also observed beyond the end of treatment at day 85
   (Figure 23).
             Patients also sustained a significant reduction in HAQ-DI scores, compared with their
   baseline values, even after finishing treatment at day 85. This was particularly notable in the
25 100 mg treatment group. (Figure 24).

  An additional substudy was performed in Japan, following the same clinical trial protocol with a
  smaller group of subjects. 51 patients were screened and subsequently randomised into the
  four cohorts.
5 The primary endpoint was highly significant and was consistent between Europe and Japan. At
  week 12, 75.0% of subjects treated with 100mg mavrilimumab achieved DAS28-CRP
  improvement >1.2 compared to 23.5% of subjects taking placebo, a difference of 51.5% (Cl 8.2,

   Summary of results and conclusion
 5 The baseline characteristics between the European and Japanese cohorts were broadly similar
   except that there was a lower mean body weight in Japan (14kg), a lower dose of methotrexate
   was received in Japan (Japan median = 10mg/week; European median = 13.8 mg/week) and a
   lower disease activity was observed. The primary endpoint was highly significant and was
   consistent between Europe and Japan. Adverse events were generally mild or moderate in
 0 intensity. No significant hypersensitivity reactions, serious or opportunistic infections or changes
   in pulmonary parameters were reported. Treatment with mavrilimumab was not associated with
   any specific safety risks.
   Results: At Week 12, 54.2% of mavrilimumab-treated subjects (all doses combined) achieved
L5 a DAS28-CRP response vs 32.6% in the placebo group (p=0.001). In the individual cohorts
   37.5% (10mg; p=0.578), 63.3% (30mg; p=<0.001), 47.9% (50mg; p=0.099) and 68.1% (100mg;
   p=<0.001) of subjects, respectively, were responders. A rapid onset of response was observed
   as early as Week 2, with a significant difference vs placebo observed at this time point
   (p=0.022). The 100 mg dose delivered significant improvements at Week 12 compared with
20 placebo in DAS28-CRP (<2.6) remissions (23.4% vs 7.6%, p=0.01 5), ACR20 and ACR50
   (ACR20: 70.2% vs 37.0%, p<0.001; ACR50: 34.0% vs 12.0%, p=0.008; ACR70: 14.9% vs 5.4%,
   p=0.106) and the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) (-0.52 mean
   improvement vs -0.24, p<0.001).

   Conclusions: Mavrilimumab showed a rapid and profound onset of a clinical response,
   especially in the higher dose cohorts. Efficacy was maintained for 12 weeks with an acceptable
   safety profile to support further clinical development.
 5 Efficacy
           As in the European clinical trial, in each treatment group, response rate was determined
   as the percentage of subjects meeting the defined criteria, e.g. achieving a reduction in DAS28
   CRP by more than 1.2, or achieving ACR 20, ACR 50 or ACR 70.
            Response rate was determined by DAS28-CRP improvement > 1.2 for each treatment
 0 group over the 85 day treatment period . Overall, 59.7 % of subjects receiving mavrilimumab in
   the 30 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg dose cohorts showed an improvement (i.e. reduction) in DAS28
   CRP of more than 1.2. In the 100 mg dose cohort, this figure was 68.1 %. These response
   rates compare with under 30 % response rate in the corresponding control (placebo) cohorts.
   These figures indicate that treatment with mavrilimumab approximately doubled the proportion
 5 of subjects showing a reduction of DAS28-CRP by more than 1.2, compared with those who did
   not receive mavrilimumab. The group receiving 100 mg mavrilimumab also showed overall the
   most rapid response and the biggest response rate.
           Treatment with mavrilimumab (all doses combined, n=1 92 ) was associated with a
   significantly higher proportion of patients achieving a 1.2-point reduction in DAS28-CRP score
 o from baseline than placebo (n=92) at Week 12 (54.2% vs. 32.6% of those receiving placebo;
   p=<0.00 1). The proportion of responders in the individual 10, 30, 50 and 100 mg cohorts were
   37.5% (p=0.578), 63.3% (p=<0.001), 47.9% (p=0.099) and 68.1% (p=<0.001), respectively. A
   significant difference in terms of adjusted mean change from baseline in DAS28-CRP score for
   the 50 mg and 100 mg cohorts compared with placebo (p=0.021 and p<0.001, respectively) as
25 early as Week 2 was also demonstrated.

5         DAS28-CRP remission (<2.6) response rate was measured for each treatment group at
  screening and on day 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71 and 85 (Table 15). Overall, the group receiving 100
  mg mavrilimumab showed the biggest response rate by day 71 and day 85.

          We observed an increase in DAS28-CRP remissions over time in all cohorts. Analysis of
  the time to onset of DAS28-CRP remission showed a clear difference between the
  mavrilimumab cohorts and placebo as early as Week 4, and a significant difference in remission
  rate between placebo (7.6%) and the 100 mg mavrilimumab cohort (23.4%; p=0.01 5) at Week
5 12.
          Response rate (%) measured by ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 was determined in each
  treatment group. The proportion of subjects achieving ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 was again
  shown to be greatest in the group treated with 100 mg mavrilimumab. The group receiving 100
0 mg mavrilimumab showed the biggest response rate as determined by ACR 20, ACR 50 and
  ACR 70 at all time points measured. At Week 12, higher ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response
  rates were observed with mavrilimumab than placebo. Overall, the greatest response rates
  were observed in the 100 mg dose (ACR20=70.2%, p=<0.001; ACR50=34.0%, p=0.003;
  ACR70=14.9%, p=0.106) compared with placebo (ACR20=37.0%; ACR50=12.0%; ACR70=5.4).
5 Differences in the ACR20 response rates between placebo and mavrilimumab 100 mg (15.2%
  vs 29.8%, p=0.048) were first observed at Week 2.

tolerability profile. Improvements were seen in all primary and secondary endpoints for the
100mg dosing groups. A rapid onset of action was observed and was maintained after
treatment was stopped at 85 days.

        The VL domain nucleotide sequences of antibodies 1 to 20 do not include the gcg codon
shown at the 3' end in SEQ ID NOS: 6, 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 66, 76, 86, 96, 106, 116, 126, 136,
146, 156, 166, 176, 186 and 196. Correspondingly, the VL domain amino acid sequences do
not include the C-terminal Ala residue (residue 113) in SEQ ID NOS: 7, 17, 27, 37, 47, 57, 67,
77, 87, 97, 107, 117, 127, 137, 147, 157, 167, 177, 187 and 197, respectively. The Alal 13
residue and corresponding gcg codon were not expressed in Antibodies 1 to 20. A comparison
of the written sequences with germline gene segments, especially JL2, indicates that the Ala
residue and corresponding gcg codon do not form part of the VL domain.
        The Gly residue at position 112 was present in the expressed scFv and IgG sequences.
However, this residue is not present in human germline j segment sequences that form the
framework 4 region of the VL domain, e.g. JL2. The Gly residue is not considered a part of the
VL domain.
        To express the light chain of the IgG, a nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody light
chain was provided, comprising a first exon encoding the VL domain, a second exon encoding
the CL domain, and an intron separating the first exon and the second exon. Under normal
circumstances, the intron is spliced out by cellular mRNA processing machinery, joining the 3'
end of the first exon to the 5' end of the second exon. Thus, when DNA having the said
nucleotide sequence was expressed as RNA, the first and second exons were spliced together.
Translation of the spliced RNA produces a polypeptide comprising the VL and the CL domain.

                                                 65
After splicing, the Gly at position 112 is encoded by the last base (g) of the VL domain
framework 4 sequence and the first two bases (gt) of the CL domain.
         The VL domain sequences of Antibodies 1 to 20 are SEQ ID NOS: 186 to 246 as
indicated above. The VL domain nucleotide sequences end with cta as the final codon, and Leu
is the final amino acid residue in the corresponding VL domain amino acid sequences.
         Non-germlined VH and VL domain sequences of Antibody 6 are shown in SEQ ID NOS:
247 - 250, in addition to the germlined VH and VL domain sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS:
