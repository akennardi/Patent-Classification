               The XRPD pattern of CsA Form 2 differs significantly from the tetragonal
     form and orthorhombic form (FIG. 1). The major crystalline peaks for CsA form 2
     appear at (26) when scanned by an X-ray diffractometer with X-ray source as Cu

     embodiment, X in the above formula is 2.
             Form 2 appears to be a kinetically stable form of CsA in aqueous
     suspensions. Suspensions containing Form 2 show no conversion to other known
     polymorphic or pseudomorphic forms upon storage. It has been found that Form 1
15   and the amorphous form convert to Form 2 in the presence of water.
             The single crystal structure of the hydrate form of CsA Form 2 has been
     determined and the crystal structure parameters are listed in Table 2. These
     results indicate that Form 2 is unique compared to other known crystalline forms of
     cyclosporine A.

             The asymmetric unit of this CsA Form 2 contains one cyclosporine A
     molecule and two water molecules. It is possible that any small molecule that can
     hydrogen bond to water could play the role of space filler, which would give a
10   range of potential structures running from the orthorhombic dihydrate to distorted
     monoclinic dihydrate. The XRPD pattern calculated from the single-crystal
     structure is shown in Figure 9 and it matches the experimental pattern shown in
     Figure 2. These matching patterns further corroborate that Form 2 is a unique and
     pure crystalline form of cyclosporine A.
15           Without wishing to be bound by theory, thermogravimetric analysis
     combined with KF titration and vapor sorption desorption analysis (VSA) suggest

     analysis of Cyclosporine Form 2 indicates that water content in the new crystal
     form reversibly varies with relative humidity as shown in Fig. 3. Similar to the
     tetragonal form, the new CsA form undergoes a phase transition to a liquid crystal
     or amorphous form at 124.4 C prior to melting as indicated by the modulated
 5   differential calorimetric (MDSC) analysis (Figure 4).

             Cyclosporin A Form 2 may be obtained by suspending amorphous
     cyclosporin A in water containing Polysorbate 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan-mono
     olleate), followed by heating the solution in to a temperature of between about 55

     value.

 5   55 *C, about 56 *C, about 57 *C, about 58 *C, about 59 * C, about 60 *C, about 61

     OC, about 73 C, about 74 OC, or about 75 C.
             One can store the heated solution at one of the foregoing temperatures for
10   a length of time of between about 18 and about 48 hours, such as about 18 hours,
     about 19 hours, about 20 hours, about 21 hours, about 22 hours, about 23 hours,
     about 24 hours, about 25 hours, about 26 hours, about 27 hours, about 28 hours,

     about 44 hours, about 45 hours, about 46 hours, about 47 hours, or about 48
     hours.
             After preparing and heating the solution, and maintaining it at the desired
     temperature, the resulting precipitated solid may be recovered by any standard
20   method, such as by vacuum filtration. Following the recovery, the precipitate may
     then be washed and dried. For example, it may be washed with water and then
     dried under vacuum at an elevated temperature (for example, about 40 0C), then
     at room temperature. Other washing and drying techniques may also be used.
25   Using cyclosporin A Form 2 as a seed crystal
             Cyclosporin A Form 2 may also be formed using cyclosporin A Form 2 as a
     seed crystal. In this method, one can suspend amorphous.a cyclosporin A in
     aqueous solution of Polysorbate 80 and heat the solution as described above.
     One can then seed the solution with cyclosporin A Form 2, then maintain the
30   solution at the temperatures and for the durations described above, constantly
     stirring the solution while doing so. At the conclusion of this process, one can then
     recover the precipitate as described above.
             One can use between about 0.01 to about 1 g seed crystal / L water in this
     process. For example, one can use about 0.01 g/L, about 0.02 g / L, about 0.03 g

     seed crystal per liter of water.
 5           One can heat the suspension of amorphous cyclosporin A seed crystal of
     cyclosporin A Form 2 to a temperature of between about 45 *C to about 65 *C
     before adding it to the solution, or one can leave the seed crystal at room
     temperature before adding it. For example, one can heat the seed crystal of
     cyclosporin A Form 2 to about 45 0C, about 46 C, about 47 C, about 48 0C
10   about, about 49 0C, about 50 0C, about 51 C, about 52           C, about 53 0C, about 54

     *C, about 61 *C, about 62 *C, about 63 *C, about 64 *C, or about 65 *C before
     adding it to the solution.
              For example, one can suspend about 30 g cyclosporin A in a solution of
15   900 ml water containing 1% (w/v) Polysorbate 80. One can heat the solution to 65
     *C, and then seed it with 0.2 g of cyclosporin A Form 2 at a temperature of 52 0C.
     The solution is stirred for about 22 hours at a temperature of between about 61 *C
     and 65 *C. The resulting precipitate may be recovered as described above.
20   By heating and cooling in certain solvent systems
              In very general terms, cyclosporin A Form 2 may be obtained by 1)
     suspending cyclosporin A in either water, or in a solution of water and acetonitrile,
     1,4-dioxane, or ethanol; 2) heating the suspension at a certain rate; 3) cooling the
     suspension at a certain rate; 4) repeating the cycle of heating and cooling; 5) and
25   recovering the precipitate that results. The choice of solvent is critical: the
     inventors were able to find no structural feature or other property that predicted
     whether a solvent would or would not cause              Form 2 to form.

             One can use in this embodiment cyclosporin A of the liquid crystal,
     tetragonal, or orthorhombic form, or one can use an amorphous form. The choice
30   of starting material yields CsA Form 2 having very slightly different characteristics
     (see Figures X and Y), but the important point is that one can use different starting
     material and still obtain CsA Form 2.
              In the first step of this method, one prepares a solution by suspending the
     desired starting material (that is, liquid crystal, tetragonal, orthorhombic form, or

     material per liter of water. The desired solvent (acetonitrile, 1,4-dioxane, or
     ethanol) is added in that amount which results in the solution having a mole
10   fraction of water of between about 0.75 and 1. For example, the solvent is added
     in an amount resulting in the solution having a mole fraction of about 0.75, about

     Methods of treatment
15           CsA Form 2 obtained by the methods of the invention may be used to treat
     any condition of the eye which is known to be amenable to topical treatment with
     cyclosporin A (such as with Restasis@). For example, compositions of the
     invention may be used to treat patients suffering from dry eye, to treat blepharitis
     and meibomian gland disease, to restore corneal sensitivity that has been
20   impaired due to refractive surgery on the eye, to treat allergic conjunctivitis and
     atopic and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and to treat ptyregia, conjunctival and
     corneal inflammation, keratoconjuntivitis, graft versus host disease, post
     transplant glaucoma, corneal transplants, mycotic keratitis, Thygeson's superficial
     punctate keratitis, uveitis, and Theodore's superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis,
25   among other conditions.
             The International Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) defines dry eye as "a
     multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms of
                                                   13

     discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the
     ocular surface, accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and
     inflammation of the ocular surface." It includes those conditions, such as
     keratoconjunctivitis sicca, that are caused by tear deficiency or excessive
 5   evaporation of tears.
                 Blepharitis is a chronic disorder producing inflammation of the anterior and
     posterior lid margin, with involvement of skin and its related structures (hairs and
     sebaceous glands), the mucocutaneous junction, and the meibomian glands. It
     can also affect the conjunctiva, tear film, and the corneal surface in advanced
10   stages and may be associated with dry eye. Blepharitis is commonly classified
     into anterior or posterior blepharitis, with anterior affecting the lash bearing region
     of the lids, and posterior primarily affecting the meibomian gland orifices.
                 Meibomian gland disease most often occurs as one of three forms: primary
     meibomitis, secondary meibomitis, and meibomian seborrhea. Meibomian
15   seborrhea is characterized by excessive meibomian secretion in the absence of
     inflammation (hypersecretory meibomian gland disease). Primary meibomitis, by
     contrast, is distinguished by stagnant and inspissated meibomian secretions
     (obstructive hypersecretory meibomian gland disease). Secondary meibomitis
     represents a localized inflammatory response in which the meibomian glands are
20   secondarily inflamed in a spotty fashion from an anterior lid margin blepharitis.
                 Impaired corneal sensitivity often occurs after refractive surgery, such as
     photorefractive keratectomy, laser assisted sub-epithelium keratomileusis
     (LASEK), EPI-LASEK, customized transepithelial non-contact ablation, or other
     procedures in which the corneal nerves are severed. Impaired corneal sensitivity
25   may also occur after viral infection, such as by HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV viruses.
     Patients with impaired corneal sensitivity often complain that their eyes feel dry,

     perennially, that is, chronically throughout the year. Symptoms of seasonal and

     conjunctiva, lacrimation, tearing, conjunctival vascular dilation, itching, papillary
     hyperlasia, chemosis, eyelid edema, and discharge from the eye. The discharge
     may form a crust over the eyes after a night's sleep.
             Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is a chronic, severe form of allergic conjunctivitis
 5   that often leads to visual impairment. Symptoms include itching, burning, pain,
     redness, foreign body sensation, light sensitivity and blurry vision. There is often a
     discharge, especially on awakening from a night's sleep; the discharge may be
     stringy, ropy, and mucoid. The lower conjunctiva is often more prominently
     affected than the upper conjunctiva. The conjunctiva may range from pale,
10   edematous, and featureless to having the characteristics of advanced disease,
     including papillary hypertrophy, subepithelial fibrosis, formix foreshortening,
     trichiasis, entropion, and madurosis. In some patients the disease progresses to
     punctate epithelial erosions, corneal neovascularization, and other features of
     keratopathy which may impair vision. There is typically goblet cell proliferation in
15   the conjunctiva, epithelial pseudotubular formation, and an increased number of
     degranulating eosinophils and mast cells in the epithelium. CD25+T lymphocytes,
     macrophages, and dendritic cells (HLA-DR.sup.+, HLA-CD1+) are significantly
     elevated in the substantia propria.
             Like atopic keratoconjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis is a severe form
20   of allergic conjunctivitis, but it tends to affect the upper conjunctiva more
     prominently than the lower. It occurs in two forms. In the palpebral form, square,
     hard, flattened, closely packed papillae are present; in the bulbar (limbal) form, the
     circumcorneal conjunctiva becomes hypertrophied and grayish. Both forms are
     often accompanied by a mucoid discharge. Corneal epithelium loss may occur,
25   accompanied by pain and photophobia, as may central corneal plaques and
     Trantas' dots.
