FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 [0002]      The present invention relates to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists and
corresponding nucleic acids derived from TNF receptors and their use in the treatment of
inflammatory diseases. These proteins are soluble secreted decoy receptors that bind to TNF
a and prevent TNF-a from signaling to cells.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 [0003]      TNF-a is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that exists as a membrane-bound
homotrimer and is released as a homotrimer into the circulation by the protease TNF-a
converting enzyme (TACE). TNF-a is introduced into the circulation as a mediator of the
inflammatory response to injury and infection. TNF-a activity is implicated in the
progression of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative
colitis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (Palladino, M.A., et al., 2003, Nat. Rev. Drug Discov.
2:736-46). Acute exposure to high TNF-a levels, as experienced during a massive infection,
results in sepsis. Its symptoms include shock, hypoxia, multiple organ failure, and death.
Chronic low-level release of TNF-a is associated with malignancies and leads to cachexia, a
disease characterized by weight loss, dehydration and fat loss.
 [00041      TNF-a activity is mediated primarily through two receptors coded by two
different genes, TNF-a receptor type I (hereafter "TNFR1 ", exemplified by GenBank
accession number X55313 for human TNFR1) and TNF-a receptor type II (hereafter
"TNFR2", exemplified by GenBank accession number NM_001066 for human TNFR2).
TNFR1 is a membrane-bound protein with a molecular weight of approximately 55
kilodaltons (kDal), while TNFR2 is a membrane-bound protein with a molecular weight of
approximately 75 kDal. TNFR1 and TNFR2 belong to a family of receptors known as the
TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily. The TNFR superfamily is a group of type I
transmembrane proteins, with a carboxy-terminal intracellular domain and an amino-terminal
extracellular domain characterized by a common cysteine rich domain (CRD). TNFR1 and
TNFR2 have a unique domain in common, called the pre-ligand-binding assembly domain
(PLAD) that is required for assembly of multiple receptor subunits and subsequent binding to
TNF-cL.

       WO 2008/051306                                                      PCT/US2007/010556
  [00051       TNFR1 and TNFR2 also share a common gene structure, in which the coding
  sequence of each extends over 10 exons separated by 9 introns (Fuchs, et al., 1992, Genomics
  13:219; Santee, et al., 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 35:21151). Most of the transmembrane domain
  sequence is encoded by the seventh exon ("exon 7") (See FIG. 1).
  [0006]      Experiments in knockout mice lacking both TNFRI and TNFR2 demonstrated
  that the injury-induced immune response to brain injury was suppressed, suggesting that
  drugs that target the TNF signaling pathways may be beneficial in treating stroke or traumatic
  brain injury (Bruce, et al., 1996, Nat. Med. 2:788). TNFR2 knockout mice, but not TNFR1
  knockout mice, were resistant to experimentally-induced cerebral malaria (Lucas, R., et al.,
  1997, Eur. J. Immunol. 27:1719); whereas TNFR1 knockout mice were resistant to
  autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Suvannavejh, G.C., et al., 2000, Cell. Immunol., 205:24).
  These knockout mice are models for human cerebral malaria and multiple sclerosis,
  respectively.
  [0007]      TNFR2 is present at high density on T cells of patients with interstitial lung
  disease, suggesting a role for TNFR2 in the immune responses that lead to alveolitis
 (Agostini, C., et al., 1996, Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., 153:1359). TNFR2 is also
 implicated in human disorders of lipid metabolism. TNFR2 polymorphism is associated with
 obesity and insulin resistance (Fernandez-Real, et al., 2000, Diabetes Care, 23:831), familial
 combined hyperlipidemia (Geurts, et al., 2000, Hum. Mol. Genet 9:2067), hypertension and
 hypercholesterolemia (Glenn, et al., 2000, Hum. Mol. Genet., 9:1943). In addition, TNFR2
 polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to human narcolepsy (Hohjoh, H., et al., 2000,
 Tissue Antigens, 56:446) and to systemic lupus erythematosus (Komata, T., et al., 1999,
 Tissue Antigens, 53:527).
 10008]       To simplify further analysis and comparison, the human TNFR2 461 amino acid
 sequence provided in SEQ ID No: 4, GenBank accession number NP_00 1057, is used as a
 reference unless stated otherwise (FIG. 1). Amino acid 1 is the first amino acid of the full
 length protein human TNFR2, which includes the signal sequence. Amino acid 23 located in
 exon 1 is the first amino acid of the mature protein, which is the protein after cleavage of the
 signal sequence. The transmembrane region spans amino acids 258-287. The exon 6/7
junction is located within the codon that encodes residue 263, while the exon 7/8 junction is
 located within the codon that encodes residue 289.
 [0009]       Physiological, soluble fragments of both TNFR1 and TNFR2 have been identified.
 For example, soluble extracellular domains of these receptors are shed to some extent from
the cell membrane by the action of metalloproteases (Palladino, M.A., et al., 2003, Nat. Rev.
                                                -2-

      WO 2008/051306                                                       PCT/US2007/010556
 Drug Discov. 2:736-46). Additionally, the pre-mRNA of TNFR2 undergoes alternative
  splicing, creating either a full length, active membrane-bound receptor, or a secreted receptor
 that lacks exons 7 and 8 (Lainez et al., 2004, Int. Immunol., 16:169) ("Lainez"). The secreted
 protein binds TNF-a but does not elicit a physiological response, hence reducing overall
 TNF-a activity. Although an endogenous, secreted splice variant of TNFRI has not yet been
 identified, the similar genomic structure of the two receptors suggests that a TNFR1 splice
 variant can be produced.
  [0010]      The cDNA for the splice variant identified by Lainez contains the 113 bp deletion
 of exons 7 and 8. This deletion gives rise to a stop codon 17 bp after the end of exon 6.
 Consequently, the protein has the sequence encoded by the first six exons of the TNFR2 gene
 (residues 1-262) followed by a 6 amino acid tail of Ala-Ser-Leu-Ala-Cys-Arg.
  [00111      Additional soluble fragments of recombinantly-engineered TNF receptors are
 known. In particular, truncated forms of TNFRI or TNFR2 have been produced which have
 (1) all or part of the extracellular domain or (2) a TNFR extracellular domain fused to another
 protein.
  [00121      Smith discloses truncated human TNFR2s, including a protein with residues 23
 257, which terminates immediately before the transmembrane region, and a protein with
 residues 23-185 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,945,397). Both TNFR2 fragments are soluble and capable
 of binding TNF-a.
 100131       Craig discloses that an extracellular domain of human TNFR2 with residues 23
 257 fused to the Fc region of human IgGi (TNFR:Fc) is a TNF-a antagonist capable of
 reducing inflammation in rat and mice arthritis models (U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,690). TNFR:Fc
 is an FDA-approved treatment for certain forms of arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and
 psoriasis and is sold under the name etanercept (Enbrel@).
 [00141       Moosmayer demonstrated that soluble human TNFR2 proteins containing the
 entire intracellular domain are more active TNF antagonists than the extracellular domain
 alone (Moosmayer et al., 1996, J. Interferon Cytokine Res., 16:471). In those experiments,
 Moosmayer compared the activities of solubilized full length TNFR2 (1-461), with TNFR2
 lacking all but the three C-terminal amino acids of the transmembrane region (ATM) (1-258
joined to 283-461), TNFR extracellular domain (1-258), and TNFR:Fc. The inhibition of
 TNF-mediated cytotoxicity by the ATM protein and solubilized full length TNFR2 are
 comparable. However, their activities are approximately 60-fold higher than the TNFR2
 extracellular domain alone, but approximately seven-fold less than TNFR:Fc.
                                                  -3-

     WO 2008/051306                                                         PCT/US2007/010556
[0015]       Since excess TNF-a activity is associated with disease pathogenesis, particularly
for inflammatory conditions, there is a need for TNF-a antagonists and methods for their use
in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Concerns have been raised regarding the side
effects of currently approved protein-based TNF-a antagonists, including TNFR:Fc; these
concerns include exacerbation of latent tuberculosis, worsening of congestive heart failure,
and increased risk of lymphoma (Palladino, M.A., et al., 2003, Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2:736
46). Furthermore, there are patients who do not respond to currently approved TNF
antagonists. Therefore, there is a continuing need to identify new TNF-a antagonists.
[00161       To that end, Sazani et al. have shown, inter alia, that by using splice switching
oligonucleotides (SSOs) it is possible to generate alternatively spliced mRNA coding for
variant TNFR1 or TNFR2 proteins using the naturally-occurring exon and intron structure
(U.S. Apple. Ser. No. 11/595,485). In particular, the SSOs lead the cell to produce mRNAs
that encode novel TNFR proteins that lack only exon 7, which encodes most of the
transmembrane region of these proteins. Further characterization of the TNFR2 protein
 lacking only exon 7 surprisingly showed that it is a particularly stable, soluble decoy receptor
that binds to and inactivates extracellular TNF-a. This protein unexpectedly has anti-TNF-a
 activity that is at least equivalent to TNFR:Fc.
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

inflammatory disease or condition by administering SSOs to a patient or a live subject. The
SSOs that are administered alter the splicing of a mammalian TNFR2 pre-mRNA to produce
a TNFR2 A7. In another embodiment, the invention is a method of producing a TNFR2 A7
in a cell by administering SSOs to the cell.

in detail in the drawings herein and the specification set forth below.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0023]       FIG. 1 schematically depicts the human TNFR2 structure. Relevant exons and
introns are represented by boxes and lines, respectively. The signal sequence and the
transmembrane region are shaded. Residues that form the boundaries of the signal sequence,
the transmembrane region, and the final residue are indicated below the diagram. Exon
boundaries are indicated above the diagram; if the 3' end of an exon and the 5' end of the
following exon have the same residue number, then the splice junction is located within the
codon encoding that residue.
[0024]       FIG. 2A graphically illustrates the amount of soluble TNFR2 from SSO treated
primary human hepatocytes. The indicated SSO was transfected into primary human
hepatocytes at 50 nM. After -48 hrs, the extracellular media was analyzed by enzyme linked
immunosorbant assay (ELISA) for soluble TNFR2 using the Quantikine@ Human sTNF RII
ELISA kit from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Error bars represent the standard
deviation for 3 independent experiments.
[0025J       FIG. 2B: Total RNA was analyzed for TNFR2 splice switching by RT-PCR using
primers specific for human TNFR2. SSOs targeted to exon seven led to shifting from full
length TNFR2 mRNA (FL) to TNFR2 A7 mRNA (A7). SSO 3083 is a control SSO with no
TNFR2 splice switching ability.

hrs later. PCR primers were used to amplify from Exon 5 to Exon 9, so that "Full Length"
(FL) TNFR2 is represented by a 486 bp band. Transcripts lacking exon 7 (A7) is represented
by a 408 bp band.
[0027]       FIGs. 4A and 4B show the splicing products of mice treated with SSO 10-mers
targeted to mouse TNFR2 exon 7. The indicated SSOs were resuspended in saline, and
injected i.p. into mice at 25mg/kg/day for 5 days. Mice were prebled before SSO injection,
and 10 days after the final SSO injection and sacrificed. At the time of sacrifice, total RNA
from livers was analyzed for TNFR2 splice switching by RT-PCR. FL - full length TNFR2;
A7 - TNFR2 A7 (FIG. 4A). The concentration of TNFR2 A7 in the serum taken before (Pre)
and after (Post) SSO injection was determined by ELISA using the Quantikine@ Mouse
sTNF RII ELISA kit from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) (FIG. 413). Error bars represent
the standard error from 3 independent readings of the same sample.
 [00281      FIG. 5 depicts the splice switching ability of SSOs of different lengths. Primary
human hepatocytes were transfected with the indicated SSO and TNFR2 expression analyzed

exon 8 junction is shown in FIG. 613.
 [0030]      FIGs. 7A and 7B illustrate TNFR2 A7 mRNA induction in SSO treated primary
human hepatocytes. FIG. 7A: Total RNA from SSO 3379 treated cells were subjected to RT
PCR, and the products visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel. The sequence of the exon 6 - exon
 8 junction is shown in FIG. 7B.
 [00311      FIGs. 8A and 8B illustrate the dose dependence of TNFR2 pre-mRNA splicing
shifting by SSO 3378, 3379 and 3384. Primary human hepatocytes were transfected with 1
 150nM of the indicated SSO. After -48 hrs, the cells were harvested for total RNA, and the
extracellular media was collected. FIG. 8A: Total RNA was analyzed for TNFR2 splice
switching by RT-PCR using primers specific for human TNFR2. For each SSO, amount of
splice switching is plotted as a function of SSO concentration. FIG. 8B: The concentration of
soluble TNFR2 in the extracellular media was determined by ELISA and plotted as a function
of SSO. Error bars represent the standard deviation for at least 2 independent experiments.

  4 days (4/1 and 4/10) or 10 days (10/1). Mice were sacrificed either 1 day (4/1 and 10/1) or
  10 days (4/10) after the last injection and total RNA from liver was analyzed by RT-PCR for
  TNFR2 splice switching as described in Figure 3. SSO 3305 was injected at the indicated

  days after SSO treatment. Mice were injected i.p. with the indicated SSO or saline (n=5 per
 group) at 25 mg/kg/day for 10 days. Serum was collected 4 days before injections began and
 on the indicated days after the last injection. Sera was analyzed by ELISA as described in
 Figure 2. At day 10, mice were sacrificed and livers were analyzed for TNFR2 splice
 switching by RT-PCR (FIG. 11B) as described in Figure 10.

 days after SSO treatment. Mice were treated as described in Figure 11, except that serum
 samples were collected until day 27 after the last injection. SSOs 3083 and 3272 are control
 SSOs with no TNFR2 splice switching ability. At day 27, mice were sacrificed and livers
 were analyzed for TNFR2 splice switching by RT-PCR (FIG. 12B) as described in Figure 11.

ng/mL TNF-a, or TNF-a plus 10% serum from mice treated with the indicated SSO. Cell
viability was measured 24 hrs later and normalized to untreated cells.

  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
  [00431       Definitions:
  [00441       As used herein, the terms "tumor necrosis factor receptor", "TNF receptor", and
  "TNFR" refer to proteins having amino acid sequences of or which are substantially similar
  to native mammalian TNF receptor sequences, and which are capable of binding TNF
  molecules. In this context, a "native" receptor or gene for such a receptor, means a receptor
                                                  -8-

     WO 2008/051306                                                          PCT/US2007/010556
 or gene that occurs in nature, as well as the naturally-occurring allelic variations of such
 receptors and genes.
 [00451      The term "mature" as used in connection with a TNFR means a protein expressed
 in a form lacking a leader or signal sequence as may be present in full-length transcripts of a
 native gene.
 100461      The nomenclature for TNFR proteins as used herein follows the convention of
 naming the protein (e.g., TNFR2) preceded by a species designation, e.g., hu (for human) or

 deleted. For example, huTNFR2 A7 refers to human TNFR2 lacking exon 7. In the absence
 of any species designation, TNFR refers generically to mammalian TNFR.
 [0047]      The term "secreted" means that the protein is soluble, i.e., that it is not bound to
 the cell membrane. In this context, a form will be soluble if using conventional assays known

 with the membrane, e.g., in cellular supernatants or serum.
 [00481      The term "stable" means that the secreted TNFR form is detectable using
 conventional assays by one of skill in the art, such as, western blots, ELISA assays in
harvested cells, cellular supernatants, or serum.

coding region.
 [0056]      As used herein, the terms "transformation" or "transfection" refer to the insertion
of an exogenous nucleic acid into a cell, irrespective of the method used for the insertion, for

bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non
episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction
into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain
vectors, expression vectors, are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are
operably linked. In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are

concentration enabling identification and manipulation by standard biochemical methods, for
example, using a cloning vector.
[0060]       As used herein the term "purified protein" refers to a protein that is present in the
substantial absence of other protein. However, such purified proteins can contain other
proteins added as stabilizers, carriers, excipients, or co-therapeutics. The term "purified" as
used herein preferably means at least 80% by dry weight, more preferably in the range of 95
99% by weight, and most preferably at least 99.8% by weight, of protein present, excluding
proteins added as stabilizers, carriers, excipients, or co-therapeutics.
[00611       As used herein, the term "altering the splicing of a pre-mRNA" refers to altering
the splicing of a cellular pre-mRNA target resulting in an altered ratio of splice products.
Such an alteration of splicing can be detected by a variety of techniques well known to one of
skill in the art. For example, RT-PCR on total cellular RNA can be used to detect the ratio of
splice products in the presence and the absence of an SSO.
100621       As used herein, the term "complementary" is used to indicate a sufficient degree
of complementarity or precise pairing such that stable and specific binding occurs between an
oligonucleotide and a DNA or RNA containing the target sequence. It is understood in the
art that the sequence of an oligonucleotide need not be 100% complementary to that of its
target. For example, for an SSO there is a sufficient degree of complementarity when, under

 subcutaneous, or intramuscular injection or infusion, as well as those suitable for topical,
 ophthalmic, vaginal, oral, rectal or pulmonary administration (including inhalation or

  inflammatory disorder involving excessive activity of TNF, as discussed below. In the
 manufacture of a medicament according to the invention, the nucleic acids and proteins of the
 present invention are typically admixed with, inter alia, an acceptable carrier. The carrier
 must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with other ingredients in the
 formulation and must not be deleterious to the patient. The carrier may be a solid or liquid.
 Nucleic acids and proteins of the present invention are incorporated in formulations, which
 may be prepared by any of the well known techniques of pharmacy consisting essentially of
  admixing the components, optionally including one or more accessory therapeutic
 ingredients.
  [00831     Formulations of the present invention may comprise sterile aqueous and non
 aqueous injection solutions of the active compounds, which preparations are preferably
 isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient and essentially pyrogen free. These
 preparations may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes which render the
 formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Aqueous and non-aqueous
 sterile suspensions can include, but are not limited to, suspending agents and thickening
 agents. The formulations may be presented in unit dose or multi-dose containers, for
 example, sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in freeze-dried (lyophilized)
 condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or water
 for-injection immediately prior to use.
 [0084]      In the formulation the nucleic acids and proteins of the present invention may be
 contained within a particle or vesicle, such as a liposome or microcrystal, which may be
 suitable for parenteral administration. The particles may be of any suitable structure, such as
 unilamellar or plurilameller, so long as the nucleic acids and proteins of the present invention
 are contained therein. Positively charged lipids such as N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]
N,N,N-trimethyl-ammoniummethylsulfate, or "DOTAP," are particularly preferred for such
particles and vesicles. The preparation of such lipid particles is well known (See references

 [0085]      Expression Vectors and Host Cells:
 [0086]      The present invention provides expression vectors to amplify or express DNA
encoding mammalian TNFR of the current invention. The present invention also provides
host cells transformed with the foregoing expression vectors. Expression vectors are
replicable DNA constructs which have synthetic or cDNA-derived DNA fragments encoding
mammalian TNFR or bioequivalent analogues operably linked to suitable transcriptional or
translational regulatory elements derived from mammalian, microbial, viral, or insect genes.

A transcriptional unit generally comprises an assembly of (a) a genetic element or elements
having a regulatory role in gene expression, such as, transcriptional promoters or enhancers,
(b) a structural or coding sequence which is transcribed into mRNA and translated into
protein, and (c) appropriate transcription and translation initiation and termination sequences.
Such regulatory elements can include an operator sequence to control transcription, and a
sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding sites. The ability to replicate in a host,
usually conferred by an origin of replication, and a selection gene to facilitate recognition of
transformants, can additionally be incorporated.
 [00871      DNA regions are operably linked when they are functionally related to each other.
For example, DNA for a signal peptide (secretory leader) is operably linked to DNA for a
polypeptide if it is expressed as a precursor which participates in the secretion of the
polypeptide; a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if it controls the transcription
of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is
positioned so as to permit translation. Generally, operably linked means contiguous and, in
the case of secretory leaders, contiguous and in reading frame. Structural elements intended
for use in yeast expression systems preferably include a leader sequence enabling
extracellular secretion of translated protein by a host cell. Alternatively, where recombinant
protein is expressed without a leader or transport sequence, it may include an N-terminal
methionine residue. This residue may optionally be subsequently cleaved from the expressed
protein to provide a final product.
 [0088]      Mammalian TNFR DNA is expressed or amplified in a recombinant expression
system comprising a substantially homogeneous monoculture of suitable host
microorganisms, for example, bacteria such as E. coli or yeast such as S. cerevisiae, which
have stably integrated (by transformation or transfection) a recombinant transcriptional unit
into chromosomal DNA or carry the recombinant transcriptional unit as a component of a
resident plasmid. Recombinant expression systems as defined herein will express
heterologous protein either constitutively or upon induction of the regulatory elements linked
to the DNA sequence or synthetic gene to be expressed.
[00891       Transformed host cells are cells which have been transformed or transfected with
mammalian TNFR vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques. Transformed
host cells ordinarily express TNFR, but host cells transformed for purposes of cloning or
amplifying TNFR DNA do not need to express TNFR. Suitable host cells for expression of
mammalian TNFR include prokaryotes, yeast, fungi, or higher eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes
include gram negative or gram positive organisms, for example E. coli or bacilli. Higher

eukaryotic cells include, but are not limited to, established insect and mammalian cell lines.
Cell-free translation systems can also be employed to produce mammalian TNFR using
RNAs derived from the DNA constructs of the present invention. Appropriate cloning and
expression vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts are
well known in the art.
[0090]       Prokaryotic expression hosts may be used for expression of TNFR that do not
require extensive proteolytic and disulfide processing. Prokaryotic expression vectors
generally comprise one or more phenotypic selectable markers, for example a gene encoding
proteins conferring antibiotic resistance or supplying an autotrophic requirement, and an
origin of replication recognized by the host to ensure amplification within the host. Suitable
prokaryotic hosts for transformation include E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella
typhimurium, and various species within the genera Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, and
 Staphyolococcus, although others can also be employed as a matter of choice.
 [0091]      Useful expression vectors for bacterial use can comprise a selectable marker and
bacterial origin of replication derived from commercially available plasmids comprising
 genetic elements of the well known cloning vector pBR322 (ATCC 37017). These pBR322
 "backbone" sections are combined with an appropriate promoter and the structural sequence
 to be expressed. pBR322 contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance and thus
 provides simple means for identifying transformed cells. Such commercial vectors include,
 for example, the series of Novagen@ pET vectors (EMD Biosciences, Inc., Madison, Wis.).
 [0092]       Promoters commonly used in recombinant microbial expression vectors include
 the lactose promoter system, and the X PL promoter, the T7 promoter, and the T7 lac
 promoter. A particularly useful bacterial expression system, Novagen@ pET system (EMD
 Biosciences, Inc., Madison, Wis.) employs a T7 or T7 lac promoter and E. coli strain, such as
 BL21(DE3) which contain a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase gene.
  [00931      TNFR proteins can also be expressed in yeast and fungal hosts, preferably from
  the genus Saccharomyces, such as S. cerevisiae. Yeast of other genera, such as Pichia or
  Kluyveromyces can also be employed. Yeast vectors will generally contain an origin of
  replication from the 2p yeast plasmid or an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS),
  promoter, DNA encoding TNFR, sequences for polyadenylation and transcription termination
  and a selection gene. Preferably, yeast vectors will include an origin of replication and
  selectable marker permitting transformation of both yeast and E. coli, e.g., the ampicillin
  resistance gene of E. coli and S. cerevisiae TRPI or URA3 gene, which provides a selection

 marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan or uracil,
 respectively, and a promoter derived from a highly expressed yeast gene to induce
transcription of a structural sequence downstream. The presence of the TRPl or URA3
 lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting
transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan or uracil, respectively.
 [0094]      Suitable promoter sequences in yeast vectors include the promoters for
metallothionein, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes , such as enolase,
 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase,
phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate
kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase. Suitable
vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are well known in the art.
 [00951      Preferred yeast vectors can be assembled using DNA sequences from pUC 18 for
selection and replication in E. coli (Ampr gene and origin of replication) and yeast DNA
sequences including a glucose-repressible ADH2 promoter and a-factor secretion leader. The
yeast a-factor leader, which directs secretion of heterologous proteins, can be inserted
between the promoter and the structural gene to be expressed. The leader sequence can be
modified to contain, near its 3' end, one or more useful restriction sites to facilitate fusion of
the leader sequence to foreign genes. Suitable yeast transformation protocols are known to
those of skill in the art.
 [0096]      Host strains transformed by vectors comprising the ADH2 promoter may be
grown for expression in a rich medium consisting of 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 1%
or 4% glucose supplemented with 80 ptg/ml adenine and 80 pig/ml uracil. Derepression of the
ADH2 promoter occurs upon exhaustion of medium glucose. Crude yeast supernatants are
harvested by filtration and held at 4"C. prior to further purification.
[00971       Various mammalian or insect cell culture systems are also advantageously
employed to express TNFR protein. Expression of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells
is particularly preferred because such proteins are generally correctly folded, appropriately
modified and completely functional. Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include
the COS-7 lines of monkey kidney cells, and other cell lines capable of expressing an
appropriate vector including, for example, L cells, such as L929, C127, 3T3, Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO), HeLa and BHK cell lines. Mammalian expression vectors can comprise
nontranscribed elements such as an origin of replication, a suitable promoter, for example, the
CMVie promoter, the chicken beta-actin promoter, or the composite hEF1 I-HTLV promoter,
                                              -19-

      WO 2008/051306                                                       PCT/US2007/010556
and enhancer linked to the gene to be expressed, and other 5' or 3' flanking nontranscribed
sequences, and 5' or 3' nontranslated sequences, such as necessary ribosome binding sites, a
polyadenylation site, splice donor and acceptor sites, and transcriptional termination
sequences. Baculovirus systems for production of heterologous proteins in insect cells are
known to those of skill in the art.
[0098]       The transcriptional and translational control sequences in expression vectors to be
used in transforming vertebrate cells can be provided by viral sources. For example,
commonly used promoters and enhancers are derived from Polyoma, Adenovirus 2, Simian
Virus 40 (SV40), human cytomegalovirus, such as the CMVie promoter, HTLV, such as the
composite hEF1-HTLV promoter. DNA sequences derived from the SV40 viral genome, for
 example, SV40 origin, early and late promoter, enhancer, splice, and polyadenylation sites
 can be used to provide the other genetic elements required for expression of a heterologous
 DNA sequence.
 [00991       Further, mammalian genomic TNFR promoter, such as control and/or signal
 sequences can be utilized, provided such control sequences are compatible with the host cell
 chosen.
 [0100]       In preferred aspects of the present invention, recombinant expression vectors
 comprising TNFR cDNAs are stably integrated into a host cell's DNA.
  [01011      Accordingly one embodiment of the invention is a method of treating an
 inflammatory disease or condition by administering a stable, secreted, ligand-binding form of
 a TNF receptor, thereby decreasing the activity of TNF for the receptor. In another
 embodiment, the invention is a method of treating an inflammatory disease or condition by
  administering an oligonucleotide that encodes a stable, secreted, ligand-binding form of a
  TNF receptor, thereby decreasing the activity of TNF for the receptor. In another
  embodiment, the invention is a method of producing a stable, secreted, ligand-binding form
  of a TNF receptor.
  [01021       The following aspects of the present invention discussed below apply to the
  foregoing embodiments.
   [01031      The methods, nucleic acids, proteins, and formulations of the present invention are
  also useful as in vitro or in vivo tools.
   [0104]      Embodiments of the invention can be used to treat any condition in which the
  medical practitioner intends to limit the effect of TNF or a signalling pathway activated by it.
  In particular, the invention can be used to treat an inflammatory disease. In one embodiment,
   the condition is an inflammatory systemic disease, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic
                                                 -20-

     WO 2008/051306                                                         PCT/US2007/010556
arthritis. In another embodiment, the disease is an inflammatory liver disease. Examples of
inflammatory liver diseases include, but are not limited to, hepatitis associated with the
hepatitis A, B, or C viruses, alcoholic liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatosis. In yet
another embodiment, the inflammatory disease is a skin condition such as psoriasis.
101051       The uses of the present invention include, but are not limited to, treatment of
diseases for which known TNF antagonists have been shown useful. Three specific TNF
antagonists are currently FDA-approved. The drugs are etanercept (Enbrel@), infliximab
(Remicade@) and adalimumab (Humira@). One or more of these drugs is approved for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis,
ankylosing spondylitis, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative
colitis).
 [01061      Protein Expression and Purification:
 [01071      When mammalian or insect cells are used, properly expressed TNFR protein will
be secreted into the extracellular media. The protein is recovered from the media, and is
concentrated and is purified using standard biochemical techniques. After expression in
mammalian cells by lentiviral or AAV transduction, plasmid transfection, or any similar
procedure, or in insect cells after baculoviral transduction, the extracellular media of these
cells is concentrated using concentration filters with an appropriate molecular weight cutoff,
such as Amicon@ filtration units. To avoid loss of TNFR protein, the filter should allow
proteins to flow through that are at or below 50 kDal.
[0108]       When TNFR protein is expressed in bacterial culture it can be purified by standard
biochemical techniques. Bacteria are lysed, and the cellular extract containing the TNFR is
desalted and is concentrated.
[0109]       In either case, the TNFR protein is preferably purified by affinity
chromatography. The use of column chromatography with an affinity matrix comprising
TNF-a is preferred. Alternatively, an affinity purification tag can be added to either the N- or
the C-terminus of the TNFR protein. For example, a polyhistidine-tag (His-tag), which is an
amino acid motif with at least six histidines, can be used for this purpose (Hengen, P., 1995,
Trends Biochem. Sci. 20:285-86). The addition of a His-tag can be achieved by the in-frame
addition of a nucleotide sequence encoding the His-tag directly to either the 5' or 3' end of
the TNFR open reading frame in an expression vector. One such nucleotide sequence for the
addition of a C-terminal His-tag is given in SEQ ID No: 126. When a His-tag is incorporated
into the protein, a nickel or cobalt affinity column is employed to purify the tagged TNFR,
                                                -21-

     WO 2008/051306                                                       PCT/US2007/010556
 and the His-tag can optionally then be cleaved. Other suitable affinity purification tags and
methods of purificationof proteins with those tags are well known in the art.
 [01101      Alternatively, a non-affinity based purification scheme can be used, involving
fractionation of the TNFR extracts on a series of columns that separate the protein based on
size (size exclusion chromatography), charge (anion and cation exchange chromatography)
and hydrophobicity (reverse phase chromatography). High performance liquid
chromatography can be used to facilitate these steps.
 [01111      Other methods for the expression and purification of TNFR proteins are well
known (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,690 to Jacobs).
 [01121      Use of proteins for the treatment of inflammatory diseases:
 [01131      For therapeutic use, purified TNFR proteins of the present invention are
administered to a patient, preferably a human, for treating TNF-dependent inflammatory
 diseases, such as arthritis. In the treatment of humans, the use of huTNFRs is preferred. The
TNFR proteins of the present invention can be administered by bolus injection, continuous
infusion, sustained release from implants, or other suitable techniques. Typically, TNFR
therapeutic proteins will be administered in the form of a composition comprising purified
protein in conjunction with physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents. Such
carriers will be nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed.
Ordinarily, the preparation of such compositions entails combining the TNFR with buffers,
antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, polypeptides, proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates
including glucose, sucrose or dextrins, chelating agents such as EDTA, glutathione and other
stabilizers and excipients. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with conspecific serum
albumin are exemplary appropriate diluents. Preferably, product is formulated as a
lyophilizate using appropriate excipient solutions, for example, sucrose, as diluents.
Preservatives, such as benzyl alcohol may also be added. The amount and frequency of
administration will depend of course, on such factors as the nature and the severity of the
indication being treated, the desired response, the condition of the patient and so forth.
[01141       TNFR proteins of the present invention are administered systemically in
therapeutically effective amounts preferably ranging from about 0.1 mg/kg/week to about 100
mg/kg/week. In preferred embodiments, TNFR is administered in amounts ranging from
about 0.5 mg/kg/week to about 50 mg/kg/week. For local administration, dosages preferably
range from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 1.0 mg/kg per injection.

      WO 2008/051306                                                      PCT/US2007/010556
[0115]       Use of expression vectors to increase the levels of a TNF antagonist in a mammal:
[01161       The present invention provides a process of increasing the levels of a TNF
antagonist in a mammal. The process includes the step of transforming cells of the mammal
with an expression vector described herein, which drives expression of a TNFR as described
herein.
[0117]       The process is particularly useful in large mammals such as domestic pets, those
used for food production, and primates. Exemplary large mammals are dogs, cats, horses
cows, sheep, deer, and pigs. Exemplary primates are monkeys, apes, and humans.
[01181       The mammalian cells can be transformed either in vivo or ex vivo. When
transformed in vivo, the expression vector are administered directly to the mammal, such as
by injection. Means for transforming cells in vivo are well known in the art. When
transformed ex vivo, cells are removed from the mammal, transformed ex vivo, and the
transformed cells are reimplanted into the mammal.
 [01191      Splice-switching oligomers (SSOs):
 [01201      In another aspect, the present invention employs splice switching oligonucleotides
or splice switching oligomers (SSOs) to control the alternative splicing of TNFR2 so that the
amount of a soluble, ligand-binding form that lacks exon 7 is increased and the amount of the
integral membrane form is decreased. The methods and compositions of the present
 invention can be used in the treatment of diseases associated with excessive TNF activity.
 [0121]      Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention is a method of treating an
 inflammatory disease or condition by administering SSOs to a patient. The SSOs that are
 administered alter the splicing of a pre-mRNA to produce a mammalian TNFR2 protein that
 lacks exon 7. In another embodiment, the invention is a method of producing a mammalian
 TNFR2 protein that lacks exon 7 in a cell by administering SSOs to the cell.
 [01221      The length of the SSO (i.e. the number of monomers in the oligomer) is similar to
 an antisense oligonucleotide (ASON), typically between about 8 and 30 nucleotides. In
preferred embodiments, the SSO will be between about 10 to 16 nucleotides. The invention
 can be practiced with SSOs of several chemistries that hybridize to RNA, but that do not
 activate the destruction of the RNA by RNase H, as do conventional antisense 2'-deoxy
 oligonucleotides. The invention can be practiced using 2'O modified nucleic acid oligomers,
 such as where the 2'O is replaced with -O-CH 3, -O-CH 2 -CH 2-0-CH 3, -O-CH 2-CH 2-CH 2
 NH 2 , -O-CH 2 -CH 2 -CH 2-OH or -F, where 2'O-methyl or 2'O-methyloxyethyl is preferred.
 The nucleobases do not need to be linked to sugars; so-called peptide nucleic acid oligomers
 or morpholine-based oligomers can be used. A comparison of these different linking
                                                - 23 -

     WO 2008/051306                                                       PCT/US2007/010556
chemistries is found in Sazani, P. et al., 2001, Nucleic Acids Res. 29:3695. The term splice
switching oligonucleotide is intended to cover the above forms. Those skilled in the art will
appreciate the relationship between antisense oligonucleotide gapmers and SSOs. Gapmers
are ASON that contain an RNase H activating region (typically a 2'-deoxyribonucleoside
phosphorothioate) which is flanked by non-activating nuclease resistant oligomers. In
general, any chemistry suitable for the flanking sequences in a gapmer ASON can be used in
an SSO.
[0123]       The SSOs of this invention may be made through the well-known technique of
solid phase synthesis. Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally
or alternatively be used. It is well known to use similar techniques to prepare
oligonucleotides such as the phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives.
[0124]       The bases of the SSO may be the conventional cytosine, guanine, adenine and
uracil or thymidine. Alternatively, modified bases can be used. Of particular interest are
modified bases that increase binding affinity. One non-limiting example of preferred
modified bases are the so-called G-clamp or 9-(aminoethoxy)phenoxazine nucleotides,
cytosine analogues that form 4 hydrogen bonds with guanosine. (Flanagan, W.M., et al.,
1999, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 96:3513; Holmes, S.C., 2003, Nucleic Acids Res. 31:2759).
Specific examples of other bases include, but are not limited to, 5-methyleytosine (MCC),
isocytosine, pseudoisocytosine, 5-bromouracil, 5-propynyluracil, 5-propyny-6, 5
methylthiazoleuracil, 6-aminopurine, 2-aminopurine, inosine, 2,6-diaminopurine, 7-propyne
7-deazaadenine, 7-propyne-7-deazaguanine and 2-chloro-6-aminopurine.
[0125]       A particularly preferred chemistry is provided by locked nucleic acids (LNA)
(Koshkin, A.A., et al., 1998, Tetrahedron 54:3607; Obika, S., et al., 1998, Tetrahedron Lett.
39:5401). As used herein, the terms "LNA unit", "LNA monomer", "LNA residue", "locked
nucleic acid unit", "locked nucleic acid monomer" or "locked nucleic acid residue", refer to a
bicyclic nucleoside analogue. LNA units and methods of their synthesis are described in
inter alia WO 99/14226, WO 00/56746, WO 00/56748, WO 01/25248, WO 02/28875, WO
03/006475 and WO 03/095467. The LNA unit may also be defined with respect to its
chemical formula. Thus, an "LNA unit", as used herein, has the chemical structure shown in
Formula I below:

 [0127]      X is selected from the group consisting of 0, S and NRH, where R is H orCi-Ce
 alkyl;
 [0128]      Y is (-CH 2 )r, where r is an integer of 1-4; and
 [01291      B is a base of natural or non-natural origin as described above.
 [01301      In a preferred embodiment, r is 1 or 2, and in a more preferred embodiment r is 1.
 [01311      When LNA nucleotides are employed in an SSO it is preferred that non-LNA
 nucleotides also be present. LNA nucleotides have such high affinities of hybridization that
 there can be significant non-specific binding, which may reduce the effective concentration
 of the free-SSO. When LNA nucleotides are used they may be alternated conveniently with
 2'-deoxynucleotides. The pattern of alternation is not critical. Alternating nucleotides,
alternating dinucleotides or mixed patterns, e.g., LDLDLD or LLDLLD or LDDLDD can be
used. For example in one embodiment, contains a sequence of nucleotides selected from the
group consisting of: LdLddLLddLdLdLL, LdLdLLLddLLLdLL, LMLMMLLMMLMLMLL,
LMLMLLLMMLLLMLL, LFLFFLLFFLFLFLL, LFLFLLLFFLLLFLL, LddLddLddL,

MLMLMLMLML, LMLMLMLML, FLFLFLFLFL, LFLFLFLFL, where L is a LNA unit, d
is a DNA unit, M is 2'MOE, F is 2'Fluoro.
[0132]       When 2'-deoxynucleotides or 2'-deoxynucleoside phosphorothioates are mixed
with LNA nucleotides it is important to avoid RNase H activation. It is expected that
between about one third and two thirds of the LNA nucleotides of an SSO will be suitable.
When affinity-enhancing modifications are used, including but not limited to LNA or G
clamp nucleotides, the skilled person recognizes it can be necessary to increase the proportion
of such affinity-enhancing modifications.
[01331       Numerous alternative chemistries which do not activate RNase H are available.
For example, suitable SSOs can be oligonucleotides wherein at least one of the
                                                 -  25 -

internucleotide bridging phosphate residues is a modified phosphate, such as methyl
phosphonate, methyl phosphonothioate, phosphoromorpholidate, phosphoropiperazidate, and
phosphoroamidate. For example, every other one of the internucleotide bridging phosphate
residues may be modified as described. In another non-limiting example, such SSO are
oligonucleotides wherein at least one of the nucleotides contains a 2' lower alkyl moiety
(e.g., CI-C 4 , linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, ethenyl,
propyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, and isopropyl). For example, every other one of the
nucleotides may be modified as described. (See references in U.S. Pat. 5,976,879 col. 4). For
in vivo use, phosphorothioate linkages are preferred.
[01341       The length of the SSO will be from about 8 to about 30 bases in length. Those
skilled in the art appreciate that when affinity-increasing chemical modifications are used, the
SSO can be shorter and still retain specificity. Those skilled in the art will further appreciate
that an upper limit on the size of the SSO is imposed by the need to maintain specific
recognition of the target sequence, and to avoid secondary-structure forming self
hybridization of the SSO and by the limitations of gaining cell entry. These limitations imply
that an SSO of increasing length (above and beyond a certain length which will depend on the
affinity of the SSO) will be more frequently found to be less specific, inactive or poorly
active.
 101351      SSOs of the invention include, but are not limited to, modifications of the SSO
involving chemically linking to the SSO one or more moieties or conjugates which enhance
the activity, cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the SSO. Such moieties include, but are
not limited to, lipid moieties such as a cholesterol moiety, cholic acid, a thioether, e.g. hexyl
S-tritylthiol, a thiocholesterol, an aliphatic chain, e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues, a
phospholipids, e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or triethylammonium 1,2-di-0-hexadecyl-rac
glycero-3-H-phosphonate, a polyamine or a polyethylene glycol chain, an adamantane acetic
acid, a palmityl moiety, an octadecylamine or hexylamino-carbonyl-oxycholesterol moiety.
[0136]       It is not necessary for all positions in a given SSO to be uniformly modified, and
in fact more than one of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single
compound or even at a single nucleoside within an SSO.
[01371       The SSOs may be admixed, encapsulated, conjugated, or otherwise associated
with other molecules, molecule structures, or mixtures of compounds, as for example
liposomes, receptor targeted molecules, oral, rectal, topical or other formulation, for assisting
in uptake, distribution, and/or absorption.

101381       Those skilled in the art appreciate that cellular differentiation includes, but is not
limited to, differentiation of the spliceosome. Accordingly, the activity of any particular SSO
can depend upon the cell type into which they are introduced. For example, SSOs which are
effective in one cell type may be ineffective in another cell type.
[0139]       The methods, oligonucleotides, and formulations of the present invention are also
useful as in vitro or in vivo tools to examine splicing in human or animal genes. Such
methods can be carried out by the procedures described herein, or modifications thereof
which will be apparent to skilled persons.
[01401       The SSOs disclosed herein can be used to treat any condition in which the medical
practitioner intends to limit the effect of TNF or the signalling pathway activated by TNF. In
particular, the invention can be used to treat an inflammatory disease. In one embodiment,
the condition is an inflammatory systemic disease, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic
arthritis. In another embodiment, the disease is an inflammatory liver disease. Examples of
inflammatory liver diseases include, but are not limited to, hepatitis associated with the
hepatitis A, B, or C viruses, alcoholic liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatosis. In yet
another embodiment, the inflammatory disease is a skin condition such as psoriasis.
[0141]       The uses of the present invention include, but are not limited to, treatment of
diseases for which known TNF antagonists have been shown useful. Three specific TNF
antagonists are currently FDA-approved. The drugs are etanercept (Enbrel@), infliximab
(Remicade@) and adalimumab (Humira@). One or more of these drugs is approved for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis,
ankylosing spondylitis, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative
colitis).
[0142]       The administration of the SSO to subjects can be accomplished using procedures
developed for ASON. ASON have been successfully administered to experimental animals
and human subjects by intravenous administration in saline in doses as high as 6 mg/kg three
times a week (Yacysyhn, B.R., et al., 2002, Gut 51:30 (anti-ICAM-1 ASON for treatment of
Crohn's disease); Stevenson, J., et al., 1999, J. Clinical Oncology 17:2227 (anti-RAF-1
ASON targeted to PBMC)). The pharmacokinetics of 2'O-MOE phosphorothioate ASON,
directed towards TNF-a has been reported (Geary, R.S., et al., 2003, Drug Metabolism and
Disposition 31:1419). The systemic efficacy of mixed LNA[DNA molecules has also been
reported (Fluiter, K., et al., 2003, Nucleic Acids Res. 31:953).
[01431       The systemic activity of SSO in a mouse model system was investigated using
2'O-MOE phosphorothioates and PNA chemistries. Significant activity was observed in all
                                                -27 -

tissues investigated except brain, stomach and dermis (Sazani, P., et al., 2002, Nature
Biotechnology 20, 1228).
[0144]      In general any method of administration that is useful in conventional antisense
treatments can be used to administer the SSO of the invention. For testing of the SSO in
cultured cells, any of the techniques that have been developed to test ASON or SSO may be
used.
[01451      Formulations of the present invention comprise SSOs in a physiologically or
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as an aqueous carrier. Thus formulations for use in
the present invention include, but are not limited to, those suitable for parenteral
administration including intraperitoneal, intraarticular, intravenous, intraarterial,
subcutaneous, or intramuscular injection or infusion, as well as those suitable for topical,
ophthalmic, vaginal, oral, rectal or pulmonary (including inhalation or insufflation of
powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer, intratracheal, intranasal delivery) administration.
The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by
any of the methods well known in the art. The most suitable route of administration in any
given case may depend upon the subject, the nature and severity of the condition being
treated, and the particular active compound which is being used.
[01461      Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited
to, physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts ,i.e, salts that retain the desired
biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological
properties. Examples of such salts are (a) salts formed with cations such as sodium,
potassium, NI-4*, magnesium, calcium, polyamines such as spermine and spermidine, etc.;
(b) acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids, for example, hydrochloric acid,
hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and the like; and (c) salts formed
with organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid,
maleic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, citric acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid,
tannic acid, palmitic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, napthalenesulfonic acid,
methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, napthalenedisulfonic acid, polygalacturonic
acid, and the like.
[01471      The present invention provides for the use of SSOs having the characteristics set
forth above for the preparation of a medicament for increasing the ratio of a mammalian
TNFR2 protein that lacks exon 7 to its corresponding membrane bound form, in a patient
afflicted with an inflammatory disorder involving TNF-a, as discussed above. In the
manufacture of a medicament according to the invention, the SSOs are typically admixed
                                               - 28 -

with, inter alia, an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense
of being compatible with any other ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious
to the patient. The carrier may be a solid or liquid. SSOs are incorporated in the
formulations of the invention, which may be prepared by any of the well known techniques of
pharmacy consisting essentially of admixing the components, optionally including one or
more accessory therapeutic ingredients.
101481       Formulations of the present invention may comprise sterile aqueous and non
aqueous injection solutions of the active compounds, which preparations are preferably
isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient and essentially pyrogen free. These
preparations may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes which render the
formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Aqueous and non-aqueous
sterile suspensions can include, but are not limited to, suspending agents and thickening
agents. The formulations may be presented in unit dose or multi-dose containers, for
example, sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in freeze-dried (lyophilized)
condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or water
for-injection immediately prior to use.
[0149]        In the formulation the SSOs may be contained within a particle or vesicle, such as
a liposome, or microcrystal, which may be suitable for parenteral administration. The
particles may be of any suitable structure, such as unilamellar or plurilameller, so long as the
SSOs are contained therein. Positively charged lipids such as N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]
N,N,N-trimethyl-ammoniummethylsulfate, or "DOTAP," are particularly preferred for such
particles and vesicles. The preparation of such lipid particles is well known. [See references
in U.S. Pat. 5,976,879 col. 6]
[0150]        The SSO can be targeted to any element or combination of elements that regulate
splicing, including the 3'splice site, the 5' splice site, the branch point, the polypyrimidine
tract, exonic splicing ehancers, exonic splicing silencers, intronic splicing enhancers, and
intronic splicing silencers.
[0151]       Those skilled in the art can appreciate that the invention as directed toward human
TNFR2 can be practiced using SSO having a sequence that is complementary to at least 8, to
at least 9, to at least 10, to at least 11, to at least 12, to at least 13, to at least 14, to at least 15,
preferably between 10 and 16 nucleotides of the portions of the TNFR2 gene comprising
exons 7 and its adjacent introns. SEQ ID No: 13 contains the sequence of exon 7 of TNFR2
and 50 adjacent nucleotides of the flanking introns. For example, SSO targeted to human
TNFR2 can have a sequence selected from the sequences listed in Table 1. When affinity

enhancing modifications are used, including but not limited to LNA or G-clamp nucleotides,
the skilled person recognizes the length of the SSO can be correspondingly reduced. The
pattern of alternation of LNA and conventional nucleotides is not important.

 [01521      Those skilled in the  art will also recognize that the selection of SSO sequences
must be made with care to avoid a self-complementary SSO, which may lead to the formation
 of partial "hairpin" duplex structures. In addition, high GC content should be avoided to
minimize the possibility of non-specific base pairing. Furthermore, SSOs matching off-target
 genes, as revealed for example by BLAST, should also be avoided.
 [0153]      In some situations, it may be preferred to select an SSO sequence that can target a
human and at least one other species. These SSOs can be used to test and to optimize the
invention in said other species before being used in humans, thereby being useful for
regulatory approval and drug development purposes. For example, SSOs with sequences
 selected from SEQ ID Nos: 14, 30, 46, 70 and 71 which target human TNFR2 are also 100%
 complementary to the corresponding Macaca Mullata sequences. As a result these sequences
can be used to test treatments in monkeys, before being used in humans.
 [0154]      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various omissions, additions
and modifications may be made to the invention described above without departing from the
scope of the invention, and all such modifications and changes are intended to fall within the
scope of the invention, as defined by the appended claims. All sequence citations, references,
patents, patent applications or other documents cited referred to herein are incorporated by

alternating 2'deoxy- and 2'O-4'-(methylene)-bicyclic-ribonucleoside phosphorothioates and
having sequences as described in U.S. Apple. No. 11/595,485. These were synthesized by
Santaris Pharma, Denmark. For each SSO, the 5'-terminal nucleoside was a 2'O-4'
methylene-ribonucleoside and the 3'-tenninal nucleoside was a 2'deoxy-ribonucleoside.
Table 4 shows the sequences of chimeric LNA SSOs with alternating 2'-O-methyl

hrs later. Oligonucleotides were complexed, at the indicated concentrations, with 2 ptL of
LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's directions.
The nucleotide/lipid complexes were then applied to the cells and incubated for 24 hrs. The
media was then aspirated and cells harvested with TRI-ReagentTM (MRC, Cincinnati, OH).
[01571       RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated with TRI-Reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH) and
TNFRI or TNFR2 mRNA was amplified by GeneAmp@ RT-PCR using rTth polymerase
(Applied Biosystems) following supplier directions. Approximately 200 ng of RNA was
used per reaction. Primers used in the examples described herein are included in Table 2.
Cycles of PCR proceeded: 95*C, 60 sec; 56*C, 30 sec; 72'C, 60 sec for 22-30 cycles total.
[0158]       In some instances a CyS-labeled dCTP (GE Healthcare) was included in the PCR
step for visualization (0.1 tL per 50 pL PCR reaction). The PCR products were separated on
a 10% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and Cy5-labeled bands were visualized with a
TyphoonTM 9400 Scanner (GE Healthcare). Scans were quantified with ImageQuantTM (GE
Healthcare) software. Alternatively, in the absence of the inclusion of Cy5 -labeled dCTP, the
PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing trace amounts of ethidium
bromide for visualization.
[0159]       PCR. PCR was performed with Platinum@ Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's directions. For each 50 pL reaction, approximately 30 pmol
of both forward and reverse primers were used. Primers used in the examples described
herein are included in Table 2. The thermocycling reaction proceeded, unless otherwise
stated, as follows: 94*C, 3 minutes; then 30-40 cycles of 94*C, 30 sec; 55*C, 30 see; and
72'C, 105 sec; followed by 72*C, 3 minutes. The PCR products were analyzed on 1.5%
agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide.

coated plates at 1.0 x 105 cells per well. Typically, cell viability was 85-93%. After
approximately 24 hrs, the media was replaced with maintenance media (seeding media
without FBS).
 [0176]     For delivery of each of the SSOs to the hepatocytes, SSOs were diluted into 50 pL
of OPTI-MEMTM, and then 50 ptL LipofectamineTM 2000 mix (1 part LipofectamineTM 2000
to 25 parts OPTI-MEMTM) was added and incubated for 20 minutes. The SSOs were then

applied to the cells in the 24-well plates. The final SSO concentration ranged from 1 to 150
nM. After 48 hrs, cells were harvested in 800 ptL TRI-Reagent TM.
[0177]       Total RNA from the cells was analyzed by RT-PCR using the forward primer
TR047 (SEQ ID No: 84) and the reverse primer TR048 (SEQ ID No: 85) (FIG. 8A). The
concentration of soluble TNFR2 A7 in the serum was measured by ELISA (FIG. 8B). Both
huTNFR2 A7 mRNA (FIG. 8A) and secreted huTNFR2 A7 protein (FIG. 8B) displayed dose
dependent increases.

                     Secretion of TNFR2 Splice Variants from Murine Cells
[01781       The ability of SSOs to induce soluble TNFR2 protein production and secretion
into the extracellular media was tested. L929 cells were treated with SSOs as described in
Example 1, and extracellular media samples were collected -48 hrs after transfection. The
concentration of soluble TNFR2 in the samples was measured by ELISA (FIG. 9). SSOs that
best induced shifts in RNA splicing, also secreted the most protein into the extracellular
media. In particular, SSOs 3305, 3312, and 3274 increased soluble TNFR2 at least 3.5-fold
over background. Consequently, induction of the splice variant mRNA correlated with
production and secretion of the soluble TNFR2.

              In Vivo Injection of SSOs Generated muTNFR2 A7 mRNA in Mice
[01791       SSO 3305 in saline was injected intraperitoneal (i.p.) daily for 4 days into mice at
doses from 3 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg. The mice were sacrificed on day 5 and total RNA from the
liver was analyzed by RT-PCR. The data show splice switching efficacy similar to that found
in cell culture. At the maximum dose of 25 mg/kg, SSO 3305 treatment induced almost full
conversion to A7 mRNA (FIG. 10, bottom panel).
[01801       A similar experiment with SSO 3274 induced about 20% conversion to A7
mRNA. To optimize SSO 3274 induction of A7 mRNA, both the dose regimen and the time
from the last injection to the sacrifice of the animal were varied. SSO 3274 was injected
(i.p.) into mice daily for 4 days. SSO treatment induced about 30% conversion to A7 mRNA
in mice analyzed on day 15, whereas a 20% shift was observed in mice analyzed on day five
(FIG. 10, top panel). Furthermore, mice given injections for 10 days, and sacrificed on day
 I1 showed a 50% induction of A7 mRNA (FIG. 10, top). These in vivo data suggest that
TNFR2 SSOs can produce muTNFR2 A7 mRNA for at least 10 days after administration.

after the last injection. The concentration of soluble TNFR2 A7 in the serum was measured.
SSO treatment induced soluble TNFR2 A7 protein levels over background for at least 10 days
(FIG. 11).
[0182]       To test the effects at longer time points, the experiment was repeated, except that
serum samples were collected until day 27 after the last injection.. The results show only a
slight decrease in soluble TNFR2 A7 levels 27 days after the last SSO injection (FIG. 12).

10183]       The anti-TNF-a activity of serum from SSO 3274 treated mice was tested in an
L929 cytotoxicity assay. In this assay, serum is assessed for its ability to protect cultured
L929 cells from the cytotoxic effects of a fixed concentration of TNF-a as described in
Example 1. Serum from mice treated with SSO 3274 but not control SSOs (3083 or 3272)
increased viability of the L929 cells exposed to 0.1 ng/mL TNF-a (FIG. 13). Hence, the SSO
3274 serum contained TNF-a antagonist sufficient to bind and to inactivate TNF-a, and
thereby protect the cells from the cytotoxic effects of TNF-a. This anti-TNF-a activity was
present in the serum of animals 5 and 27 days after the last injection of SSO 3274.

gL of serum-free MEM, 0.1 ng/ml TNF-a and 1 pg/ml of actinomycin D, with either (i)
recombinant soluble protein (0.01-3 pg/mL)) from Sigma@ having the 236 amino acid
residue extracellular domain of mouse TNFR2, (ii) serum from SSO 3274 or SSO 3305
treated mice (1.25-10%, diluted in serum from untreated mice; the concentration of TNFR2
A7 was determined by ELISA) or (iii) Enbrel@ (0.45-150 pg/ml) to a final volume of 100 pil
with a final mouse serum concentration of 10%. The samples were incubated at room
temperature for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the samples were applied to the plated cells and
incubated for -24 hrs at 37*C in a 5% CO 2 humidified atmosphere. Cell viability was
measured by adding 20 pL CellTiter 96@ AQ,,,u         One Solution Reagent (Promega) and
measuring absorbance at 490 nm with a microplate reader. Cell viability was normalized to
untreated cells and plotted as a function of TNF antagonist concentration (FIG. 14).

[01851      Mice were treated with either SSO 3274 or 3272 (control) (n=5) by i.p. injection
at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day daily for five days . Mice were bled before injection and again 5,
15, 22, 27, and 35 days after the last injection. The concentration of soluble TNFR2 A7 in
the serum was measured (FIG. 15A). Splice shifting of TNFR2 in the liver was also
determined at the time of sacrifice by RT-PCR of total RNA from the liver (FIG. 15B).
Combined with data from Example 7, a time course of TNFR2 mRNA levels after SSO
treatment was constructed, and compared with the time course of TNFR2 A7 protein in serum
(FIG. 16). The data show that TNFR2 A7 mRNA in vivo decays at a rate approximately 4
times faster than that of TNFR2 A7 protein in serum. On day 35, TNFR2 A7 mRNA was
only detectable in trace amounts, whereas TNFR2 A7 protein had only decreased by 20%
from its peak concentration.

[0186]      A plasmid containing the full length human TNFR2 cDNA was obtained
commercially from OriGene (Cat. No: TC 119459, NM_001066.2). The cDNA was obtained
by performing PCR on the plasmid using reverse primer TROO1 (SEQ ID No: 74) and
forward primer TROO2 (SEQ ID No: 75). The PCR product was isolated and was purified
using standard molecular biology techniques, and contains the 1383 bp TNFR2 open reading
frame without a stop codon.
[0187]      Alternatively, full length human TNFR2 cDNA is obtained by performing RT
PCR on total RNA from human mononuclear cells using the TRO01 reverse primer and the
TROO2 forward primer. The PCR product is isolated and is purified using standard molecular
biology techniques.
[0188]      To generate human TNFR2 A7 cDNA, two separate PCR reactions were
performed on the full length human TNFR2 cDNA, thereby creating overlapping segments of
the TNFR2 A7 cDNA. In one reaction, PCR was performed on full length TNFR2 cDNA
using the forward primer TROO3 (SEQ ID No: 76) and the reverse primer TROO4 (SEQ ID
No: 77). In the other reaction, PCR was performed on full length TNFR2 cDNA using the

overlapping segments were combined, and PCR was performed using the TROO2 forward

standard molecular biology techniques, and was expected to contain the 1308 bp TNFR2 A7
open reading frame with a stop codon (SEQ ID No: 9).

[0189]       Similarly, by using the TROOl reverse primer instead of the TRO04 reverse primer
in these PCR reactions the 1305 bp human TNFR2 A7 open reading frame without a stop

PCR is performed on full length TNFR1 cDNA using the TROO9 reverse primer (SEQ ID No:
91) and the TRO10 forward primer (SEQ ID No: 92). Finally, the 2 overlapping segments are
combined, and PCR is performed using the TRO10 forward primer and the TRO06 reverse
primer. The PCR product is isolated and is purified using standard molecular biology
techniques, and contains the 1254 bp human TNFR1 A7 open reading frame with a stop
codon (SEQ ID No: 5).
[0193]      Alternatively, by using the TROl 1 reverse primer (SEQ ID No: 93) instead of the
TRO06 reverse primer in these PCR reactions the 1251 bp human TNFR1 A7 open reading
frame without a stop codon is generated. This allows for the addition of in-frame C-terminal

 (Invitrogen) were blunt-end ligated and isolated according to the manufacturer's directions.

1230-1 contain the TNFR2 A7 open reading frame followed immediately by a stop codon.
The sequence of the His-tag from the plasmid is given in SEQ ID No: 126. The sequences of
the TNFR2 A7 open reading frames of clones 1230-1 and 1319-1 were identical to SEQ ID

by a single nucleotide at position 1055 in exon 10, with an A in the former and a G in the
later. This single nucleotide change causes the amino acid 352 to change from a glutamine to
an arginine.

                  Expression and Purification of TNFR2 A7 in Mammalian Cells
 [02281       The plasmids generated in Example 15 and Example 23 were used to express and
purify TNFR2 A7 from mammalian HeLa cells. HeLa cells were plated in 6-well plates at 5
x 105   cells per well, and grown overnight at 37*C, 5% CO 2 , in humidified atmosphere. Each
well was then transfected with 1.5 pg of plasmid DNA using either 1144-4 (mouse TNFR2
A7 with His-tag), 1145-1 (mouse TNFR2 A7, no His-tag), 1230-1 (human TNFR2 A7, no
His-tag) or 1319-1 (human TNFR2 A7 with His-tag) plasmids. Media was collected -48 hrs
after transfection and concentrated approximately 40-fold using Amicon MWCO 30,000
filters. The cells were lysed in 120 ptL of RIPA lysis buffer (Invitrogen) with protease
inhibitors (Sigma-aldrich) for 5 minutes on ice. Protein concentration was determined by the
                                               - 53 -

Bradford assay. Proteins were isolated from aliquots of the cell lysates and the extracellular
media and analyzed by western blot for TNFR2 as described in Example 1 (FIG. 18).
102291      Human and mouse TNFR2 A7 with a His-tag (clones 1319-1 and 1144-4,
respectively) were purified from the above media by affinity chromatography. HisPurTM
cobalt spin columns (Pierce) were used to purify mouse and human TNFR2 A7 containing a
His-tag from the above media. Approximately 32 mL of media were applied to a I mL
HisPurTM column equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 10
mM imidazole buffer (pH 7.4) as recommended by the manufacturer. The column was then
washed with two column volumes of the same buffer and protein was eluted with 1 mL of 50
mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 150 mM imidazole buffer (pH 7.4). Five
ptL of each eluate were analyzed by Western blot as described above (FIG. 19). TNFR2 A7
appears in the eluate and the multiple bands represent variably glycosylated forms of TNFR2
A7. As negative controls, the TNFR2 A7 proteins expressed from plasmids 1230-1 or 1145-1
which do not contain a His-tag where subjected to the above purification procedure. These
proteins do' not bind the affinity column and do not appear in the eluate (FIG. 19).
