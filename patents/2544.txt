     GENERAL DESCRIPTION
              The present    disclosure provides, in accordance with its broadest        aspect,
     particulate matter comprising particles carrying an essentially dry combination of
     components comprising at least one natural oil and at least one surfactant, the
     components being selected such that upon contact with water, an oil in water emulsion
     is formed. Preferably, the oil in water emulsion is a stable emulsion with no phase
     separation for at least 24 hours from its preparation.
              The present disclosure also provides a composition comprising particulate
     matter as defined herein. The composition comprises, in addition to the particulate

     facilitate the use of the particulate matter in agriculture.
              The particulate matter may comprise a single population of particles having one
     or more natural (e.g. essential) oils carried on the same particles, or a combination of
     populations, namely, one population of particles carried one type or one group of oils
     and at least one other population carrying another type or another group of oils, both
     types of population being as further discussed below.
              In some embodiments, the at least one natural oil is one being characterized with
     anti-microbial activity.
              Therefore, the present disclosure also provides the use of the particulate matter
     as defined for the preparation of an anti-microbial emulsion.
              Further, the present disclosure provides a method of producing an anti-microbial
     emulsion comprising mixing the particulate matter with an aqueous solution to form
     said anti-bacterial emulsion.
              Finally, the present disclosure provides a method of treating a plant, the method
     comprising, mixing the particulate matter with an aqueous solution to form an emulsion;

     and applying said emulsion onto at least part of the plant or to soil surrounding the
     plant.
             When requiring anti-microbial activity, the emulsion may be combined or used
     in combination with other anti-microbial agents as known in the art.
     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
             The present invention is based on the development of particulate material
     comprising a particulate carrier having absorbed thereon functional oils such that upon
     contact with water or water based solutions, a stable emulsion is formed.
             Thus, in its broadest aspect, the present disclosure provides particulate matter
     comprising particles carrying an essentially dry combination of components, the
     combination comprising at least one oil and at least one surfactant, and the components
     being selected such that upon contact with water, oil in water emulsion is formed.
             In the context of the present disclosure, the term "particulatematter" is used to
     denote a substance in the form of plurality of particle. The particles may be in any
     particulate form, including, without limited thereto, from finely rounded beads to
     amorphous structures. The particulate matter also includes any form of a powder.
             In some embodiments, the particulate matter comprise silica dioxide (SiO 2 ,
     referred to herein as silica). The silica may be naturally occurring silica particles such as
     bentonite clay beads, as well as synthetic silica beads, as known in the art.
             In some embodiments, the particulate matter comprises synthetic silica. There is
     a variety of synthetic silica that may be used in the context of the present disclosure. For
     example, the particulate matter may comprise precipitated synthetic amorphous silica
     beads, such as the commercially available products Tixosil and Aerosil 200.
             In some other embodiments, the particulate matter comprises synthetic or nature
     derived beads with a capacity to absorb natural oils. Such beads may include, without
     being limited thereto Latex beads; calcium carbonate sorbent particle; cellulose beads;
     polystyrene   adsorbents beads e.g. Amberlite@ XAD*-2 which is a hydrophobic
     crosslinked polystyrene copolymer absorbent resin; charcoal;           SepharoseTM beads;
     emulsan-alginate    beads;     chitosan   beads;  sodium    alginate; styrene-maleic     acid
     copolymer beads and styrene-divinylbenzene beads; cellulose paper beads.

WO 2014/170893                                                                  PCT/IL2014/050346
                                                   -4
              To allow good distribution of the final emulsion and in accordance with some
     embodiments the particulate matter (particles) has a size distribution in the range of
     10-25pm, at times 15 to 22pm.
              The particulate matter may also be characterized, without being limited thereto,
     by its surface area, in some embodiments, the particulate matter has a specific surface
     area (N 2) in the range of 400-550m 2 /g , at times, in average 500 m 2/g.
              In some further embodiments, particulate matter may also be characterized,
     without being limited thereto, by its DBP absorption. The DBP absorption (DOA
     absorption) is commonly used numerical value used to indicate absorption capacity of
     fillers and in the present disclosure indicates the oil capacity of the particulate matter. In
     some embodiments, the DBP is in the range of 250-350 ml/100gram particles, at times,
     280-320ml/100gram.
              The first component comprises the particulate matter that holds one or a
     combination of natural oils. In the context of the present disclosure it is to be
     understood that "naturaloil" encompasses any organic oil obtained from nature.
              The natural oil is preferably oil derived from a plant. In some embodiments, the
     natural oils are essential oils. Essential oils are preferably those known to exhibit
     antimicrobial (e.g. antibacterial) properties. In this context, when referring to anti
     microbial properties of the essential oils, it is to be understood as being effective against
     any microbial pathogen, as further discussed below.
              There are a variety of essential oils. Without being limited thereto, essential oils
     to be used in accordance with the present disclosure, may be those derived from the
     plants Origanum vulgare and Origanum spp., (e.g. Oregano), Mentha spp. (mint),
     Thymus spp. (Thyme), Myrtus spp., Ocimun spp. (e.g. Ocimun basilicum, also known
     as Basil), Lavandula spp. (e.g. Lavender), Micromeria spp., Coriandum spp. (e.g.
     Coriander/Parsley),    Aloysia    spp.,  Melissa    spp.,  Salvia  spp.,   Petoselinum   spp.,
     Rosmarinus spp. (e.g. Rosemary), Prunella spp., Cuminum spp (e.g. Cumin).
              In some other embodiments, the natural oils are plant derived oils that are used
     as carbon source, e.g. as food/nutrient for the antagonistic microorganisms. These are
     referred to herein the term "carbon-base oil" or "carbon-rich nutrient oil". In some
     embodiments, the carbon-base oils are vegetable oils. Without being limited thereto, the

WO 2014/170893                                                                PCT/IL2014/050346
                                                  -5
     carbon-base oil is selected from the group consisting of Sesame oil, Olive oil, Peanut
     oil, Cottonseed oil, Soybean oil, Palm oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, canola oil, castor
     oil, coconut oil, groundnut oil.
              In some preferred embodiments, the natural oil is a combination of at least one
     essential oil and at least one carbon-base oil. As such, when referring to natural oil it is
     to be understood as also encompassing essential oil(s) and carbon-base oil(s). When in
     combination, the ratio between the at least one essential oil and at least one carbon-base
     oil is in the range of 60:40 and 100:0, at times the range is about 80:20.
              When a combination of oils is used it is to be understood that they may be
     absorbed onto the particulate matter together, i.e. the same particulate matter holds more
     than one type of oil. In some embodiments, each oil type is held separately on
     particulate matter such that different types of particulate matter are formed, each being
     characterized by the type of oil it is holding.
              Thus, when referring to particular matter providing essential oil (e.g. Oregano)
     and carbon base oil (e.g. Sesame) at a ratio of 80:20 it is to be understood as either a
     single population of particulate matter onto which the two types of oil have been
     absorbed at the recited ration or to a mixture of two populations of particulate matter,
     80% carrying only essential oil such as Oregano and 20% carrying carbon base oil, such
     as Sesame oil. Irrespective of the oil type, the particulate matter between 20% to 50%
     w/w of its total weight it provided by the oil loaded thereon.
              In some embodiments, the natural oil comprises at least Oregano oil in
     combination with at least one carbon-base oil. The Oregano oil is combined, at times,
     with at least Sesame oil.
              The amount of natural oils held by (absorbed by) the particles may vary,
     depending on the type(s) of natural oil used, the amount at loading, the type of particles
     used, the conditions of loading the natural oil onto the particulate matter, the surfactants
     and solvents used for loading etc.
              When referring to loading of oil onto the particles, it is to be understood as
     meaning any form of association between the oil and the particles (e.g. silica particles).
     Without being limited thereto, the oil is held by the particles by absorption onto and/or
     into the particles. The association between the particles and the oil is reversible, namely,

WO 2014/170893                                                               PCT/IL2014/050346
                                                 -6
     under suitable conditions, such as when brought into contact with water, the oil is
     released from the particles to form an emulsion.
             To this end, the present disclosure also provides a stable emulsion provided by
     said particulate matter, comprising the particles, at least one natural oil and at least one
     surfactant.
             In some embodiments, the particles hold between 20% to 50% w/w natural oil
     out of the total weight of the particulate matter (after loading). This is determined by
     conventional techniques such as HPLC or GC chromatography, as also exemplified
     below. In some other embodiments, the particles hold about 30% w/w natural oil at
     times, between 25-35%, at times between 28% to 32%, at times, around 30%.
             The particulate matter also comprises at least one surfactant. As appreciated, a
     surfactant is a compound that lowers the surface tension of a liquid and as such, the
     interfacial tension between two liquids to allow the formation of, e.g. an emulsion. It
     has been found by the inventors, as also shown in the following non-limiting examples,
     that the surfactant is essential in order to provide a stable emulsion, once the dry
     particulate matter is brought into contact with water.
             The surfactant may be of any kind known in the art as safe for use (e.g. non
     toxic to plants or animals) in agriculture.
             In some embodiments, the surfactant is a non-ionic surfactant, particularly those
     known to be suitable for agricultural applications.
             A non-limiting list of possible non-ionic surfactants to be used in accordance
     with the present disclosure includes Polyethylene glycol sorbitan trioleates (Tween)
     such   as Polyoxyethylenesorbitan      Trioleate  (Tween    85),  Polyoxyethylenesorbitan
     Tristearate (Tween 65), sorbitan fatty acid esters, such as Sorbitan monopalmitate (Span
     40)), Alcohol alkoxylate (BS1000).
             In some other embodiments, the surfactant comprises a salt of a fatty acid. The
     salt may comprise an alkaline such as potassium, calcium, sodium salts, as well as an
     ammonium salt.
             In some embodiments, the salt of a fatty acid comprises potassium salts of fatty
     acids (also known as soap salts), which are typically uses as insecticides, herbicides,

WO 2014/170893                                                                PCT/IL2014/050346
                                                  -7
     fungicides, and/or algaecides (these are at times considered non-ionic surfactants). In
     some embodiments, potassium salts of fatty acids may be obtained by adding potassium
     hydroxide to natural fatty acids such as those found in animal fats and in plant oils.
     Fatty acids may be extracted from vegetative sources such as olives, cotton seeds, soya
     beans, peanuts, sun flowers, coconuts Palrn, Rapcseed, Sesame, Amgaanth, Con,
      iaropha.
             The fatty acid forming the surfactant may also be a synthetic fatty acid as well as
     a semi-synthetic (e.g. a natural fatty acid that underwent a modification).
             In accordance with some embodiments, the surfactant is one being recognized or
     is labeled as having an insecticide and/or fungicide activity. Without being limited
     thereto, pesticidal and/or fungicidal surfactants may include the commercial products
     Zohar PT-50 and Zohar LQ-215, both produced by Zohar Dalia, Israel.
             In one particular embodiment, the surfactant is selected from Zohar PT-50 and
     Zohar LQ-215.
             The compositions of these surfactants are available from Zohar Dalia. For
     instance, Zohar PT-50 is known to have the following composition:

               The particulate matter is in an essentially dry form. When referring to "essential
     dry" it is to be understood that the particulate matter is either completely dry (as
     determined by conventional methods) or contain low amounts of water, i.e. no more

WO 2014/170893                                                               PCT/IL2014/050346
                                                 -9
     than 10% (w/w). In some other or additional embodiments, the water content in the
     particulate matter is within the range of 1% to 7% (w/w)).
             The particulate    matter may also contain      some trace amounts       of organic
     solvent(s). As will be further discussed below, the solvent is required for the preparation
     of the particulate matter and some residual amounts may remain in the final particulate
     matter. In some embodiments, the particulate matter comprises no more than 5%, 4%,
     3% or even 2% w/w organic solvent. The solvent is typically an organic volatile polar
     solvent, such as, without being limited thereto, a solvent selected from the group
     consisting of acetone, isopropyl alcohol, acetonitrile, ethanol and methanol.
             In one particular embodiment, the solvent is ethanol.
             The particulate matter is unique in its capability of forming a stable emulsion,
     once the particulate matter is brought into contact with water.
             In the context of the present disclosure, when referring to a stable emulsion it is
     to be understood as referring to dispersion of oil (the dispersed phase) in water (the
     dispersion medium) for a period of at least Ihour, at times, at least 2, 3, 4, 5 or even 10
     hours following the formation of the emulsion. In other words, the stability is
     determined by the lack of visible separation into an oil phase and a water phase.
             Without being     bound    by theory,   it  is the   inventor's position   that  the
     incorporation of a surfactant in the particulate matter contributes to the stability of the
     emulsion formed. This is also evident from the non-limiting examples provided
     hereinbelow, where the use of potassium salts of fatty acids showed an advantage in
     terms of stability and safety over other types of commercially available surfactants.
             To form the emulsion, the particulate matter is mixed with water. The amount of
     water depends on the amount of particulate matter. In some embodiments, for each
     gram of particulate matter (30% of which is oil), water is added to provide a one liter
     emulsion. As such, in a 1 liter emulsion, 0.1 gr particulate matter provides an oil
     concentration of 0.03% v/v). In some embodiments, the percentage of oil in the final
     emulsion is in the range of 0.03% and 2% v/v.
             In some embodiments, the mixing of the particulate matter with water provides
     an emulsion with a droplet size in the range of between 1 to 20pm and in some
     embodiments in the range between 3 to 10Ipm.

                                                - 10
              In some embodiments, the emulsion is an anti-microbial emulsion.
              The particulate matter may be used as is or in combination with other
     ingredients, to form a composition comprising the particulate matter. The additional
     ingredients may depend on the intended use of the particulate matter. For example, the
     particulate matter may be combined with other dry powders including antimicrobial
     activity, additional dry surfactants.
              In some embodiments, the composition may comprise a single type (population)
     of particulate matter. In some other embodiments, the particulate matter may comprise a
     combination of two or more populations of particulate matter, each population being
     different from the other at least in the type of essential oil absorbed therein. The
     composition is a dry composition comprising dry particulate matter.
              The present disclosure also provides a method of producing an anti-microbial
     emulsion comprising mixing the particulate matter or a composition comprising the
     particulate matter with an aqueous solution to form the emulsion, in particular, a stable
     emulsion. The thus formed emulsion is characterized, inter alia, with formation of
     droplets, with an average droplet size in the range of 3 to 10 m.
              The present disclosure also provides a method of treating a plant, the method
     comprises mixing particulate matter disclosed herein with an aqueous solution to form
     an emulsion and applying said emulsion onto at least part of the plant or to soil
     surrounding the plant.
              The application of the emulsion may be by any means known in agriculture,
     including, without being limited thereto, spraying the plant, irrigation.
              In yet some other embodiments, the treatment may include application onto the
     plant tubers, such as spraying of potato tubers (at times referred to as low spraying of
     tubers).
              The emulsion may be applied to a plant in combination with other active
     principles, such as one or more antimicrobial agents. To this end, the particulate matter
     is mixed with at least one antimicrobial agent prior to, concomitant with or subsequent
     to the formation of the emulsion.

             The final emulsion (with or without additional active principles) may be applied
     to the plant once, twice or more times. When more than one dose is applied, the doses
     may be provided with time intervals between applications of between one day interval
     to more than one days (two, three and more days interval). The different doses may be
     the same or different.
     DESCRIPTION OF NON-LIMITING EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Verifvine anti-bacterialeffect of essential oils
     Materials and Methods
             To verify the anti-bacterial effect of essential oil, the following assay was
     conducted.
             Oi: Oregano oil with the following particulars: country of origin: Bulgaria; plant
     parts: flowering plant; cultivation method: certified organics, method of extraction:
     steam distilled.
             Bacterial   strains: Escherichia  coli,  Staphylococcus     aureus,   Salmonella,
     Clavibacter and Xanthomonas campestris were obtained from the collection of Prof. G.
     Kritzman Israel.
             Disc Diffusion method: Bacteria were grown in nutrient broth test tubes at 27 0C
     for 24hrs. The paper discs were sterilized by autoclave in preparation for the disc
     diffusion method. Each bacteria (100 jil), was placed on Nutrient agar (NA) plates and
     allowed to dry for 3-5 minutes. The paper discs were saturated in 100% concentration of
     the oregano essential oil (20ul), and then placed onto each NA plate freshly coated with
     bacteria. The positive control used was 3% H 2 0 2 solution and the negative control was
     DI water. The plates were incubated at 270C for 48 hours. The zone of inhibition was
     measured by standard ruler.
     Results
             The anti-bacterial    effect of the commercial     organic  oils  on bacteria    is
     summarized in Table 1, showing a greater inhibition zone for the oregano oils treated
     bacteria as compared to the controls.

     Methods
     Powder preparation
             For laboratory scale production the powders         containing the natural oils,
     surfactants and the silica beads were prepared using common lab glassware set up
     including laboratory bottles of 20-50ml sizes, spatulas, magnetic stirrers and heating
     plates. Generally, the natural oil was weight and each was separately mixed with the
     selected surfactant in a 20ml vial, to which the solvent was added. The mixtures of each
     oil were mixed and heated to a temperature of about 40'C until homogeneous solutions
     were obtained. To the homogenous solutions the silica beads were added until the liquid
     was absorbed by the beads. The bottles were left in the fuming hood overnight until all
     solvent has evaporated.
             Loading of each of the oil in the final dry powders was 30-42%. The dry
     powders contained 2%-7% water.
             All ratios of ingredients for powders preparation are provided in Tables 2A-2D.

     mg/mL and Carvacrol standard solution was about 0.4 mg/mL.
     Sample solutions were prepared in duplicate as following:
             About 70 mg of powdered sample was weighted into a 25 mL volumetric flask,
     then brought up to volume with the acetone and mixed.
     Assay of Sesame oil in formulation using GC
             Sesame oil absorbed on silica beads was trans-methylated        overnight with
     methanolic HCl solution at 60'C. Heptadecanoic acid, used as an internal standard, was
     added to beads before derivatization. Methyl esters of fatty acids were extracted with
     hexane and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate prior to GC analysis.
             Calibration standards were prepared from different concentrations of sesame oil
     and blank beads. Conditions of derivatization and amount of internal standard were the
     same as described in sample preparation.
             Quantitative analysis of sesame oil in beads was performed using Agilent 7890
     gas chromatograph equipped with FID detector. Compounds were separated on DB-23
     capillary column.
     Results
             Conventional HPLC and GC analytical methods for Oregano and Sesame oils
     assay were employed.
             The chromatograms      of the tested   powders   showed that no degradation
     (according to the conventional markers, Thymol and Carvacrol aromatic compounds) of
     the oil was caused during the powder preparation and storage. Table 5 below provides
     % of Oregano oil and Sesame oil, respectively, in the powder based on Thymol and
     Carvacrol aromatic compounds analysis by HPLC.

             The water content measured using Karl Fisher titration found that the powder
     contains 5-7% of water. It appears the source of the water is from Zohar PT 50
     surfactant, which contents 50% of water.
             As to IPA content, GC Headspace precise analysis demonstrate the IPA content
     in the formulations, which is summarized in Table 6.

             As can be seen from the Table 6, the amount of IPA varies from 5 to 13%.
     However, in the field, the formulations were diluted for at least 30 times and as such,

     the content of IPA was reduced to 0.17-0.43%, which is negligible and very safe
     amount.
              The different types of dry powders prepared showed stable after long term (more
     than a year) storage. In addition to the above, it is noted that the powders have a
     characteristic odor. The oregano oil based formulations have off-white color and sesame
     oil based powders are white.
              Upon contact with water tested formulations (ORG-28 and SES-29 immediately
     form an emulsion, which were stable for 24 h. The emulsions consisted of the droplets
     of 3-10 microns. The spray-ability of the emulsions was good without clogging the
     filters.
              Safety studies in the field showed that the tested oil based powders were safe.
     This was determined by the presence (or not) of burns on the plants, as determined by
     conventional phytotoxicty parameters.
              Further,  long term (8     weeks)    stability of the powders   was determined.
     Specifically, the Oregano and Sesame based powders were separately sealed in
     aluminum foil bags and placed at accelerating storing conditions (40'C for 8 weeks).
     Assay of Oregano oil was measured via two major constituents- Carvacrol and Thymol
     in the beginning of the stability study (initial point) and after 8 weeks using HPLC-UV
     technique. The obtained values were normalized to the amounts of markers in the pure
     oregano oil.
              Assay of sesame oil was measured via two major constituents - C16:0 and
     C18:0 -in the beginning of the stability study (initial point) and after 8 weeks using
     GC-FID analysis of methylated fatty acids. Trans methylation was performed upon
     acidic catalysis (with MeOH/HCl) using C17:0 as an internal standard. The obtained
     values were normalized to the amounts of markers in the pure sesame oil.
              No significant changes were observed in the both formulations: amount of
     oregano and sesame oils were similar before and after stability studies.
              Water content was tested using Karl Fisher method. The amount of water was
     reduced on 42% after 8 weeks of storing in accelerating conditions in both formulations.

             Isopropanol content was tested using GC method. The amount of IPA was
     reduced on 36 % after 8 weeks of storing in accelerating conditions in oregano
     formulation, but it was preserved in the sesame formulation.
             Without being bound by theory, it appears that the containers were leaky and in
     order to reduce water or IPA loss, the containers may be more hermetically sealed.
             Powders stored 8 weeks at 40'C showed good ability to form a stable emulsion
     similar to those of the initial powders. The stability measurements are summarizedin

     Example 3: Solubilization and anti-bacterialactivity with different surfactants
             In order to create stable oil-in-water emulsion a surfactant (emulsifying agent)
     with HLB of 8-20 is required. Thus, in the following, two surfactants were tested Tween
     80 having an HLB value of 15 and potassium salt of fatty acids extracted from palm,
     coconut, olive, castor and cottonseed plants (potassium salt oleate having an HLB value
     of 20).
             It has been found that with the potassium salts of fatty acids the ratio of
     oil/surfactant required for obtaining a stable emulsion of oregano oils is 1:0.4 while
     with Tween 80, the required oil/surfactant ratio was 1:1.
             The correlation between HLB values         and solubilization   capacity of each
     surfactant was found in the current case of Oregano oil, i.e. better solubiilztion with
     potassium salts of fatty acids. Isopropanol was used as process aid compound, which
     also provided additional stability for producing emulsions.
             For anti-bacterial effect, several emulsifiers were tested with oregano oil and
     sesame oil, in water.
             The tested emulsifiers included: Tween 20; Tween 80; Triton X 100; Lecithin;
     SDS ; Sodium Stearate and Potassium fatty acid. Each emulsifiers was tested at the
     following concentrations (in percentage) 1;5;10;15;20 for a mixture of water containing
     25% oregano oil with 5% sesame oil.
             The stability during the first 24hours (i.e. lack of phase separation) and anti
     bacterial activity of each emulsion were determined. Anti bacterial activity was
     determined by measuring the inhibition zones of 20 p1 emulsion towards the following
     plant pathogenic bacteria: Clavi bacter; Xanthomonas and Streptomyces spp. and by
     spraying the emulsions on pepper plants as test plants for phytotoxicity symptoms.
             The results showed that potassium fatty acid was the most suitable material in
     creating stable emulsion at 10% concentration; the inhibition zone of the potassium salt
     of fatty acid was greater than the other tested emulsions and had no phytotoxicity on
     pepper plants. The data obtained (not shown) clearly demonstrated phytotoxicity on
     pepper plants when the emulsifiers were Tween 20 Tween 80 ,Triton X100 or SDS, as

WO 2014/170893                                                               PCT/IL2014/050346
                                                 - 26
     the plants sprayed with the emulsions created therewith died, while being very vital
     when sprayed with the sodium stearate potassium fatty acid.
             In a different set of experiments, the oregano oil and surfactant were absorbed
     on silica beads (with the air of isopropanol, as described above). Good anti-bacterial
     results were obtained when 0.5% of oregano-based powder was dispersed in water. This
     powder contained about 25% of oregano oil and 10% of potassium fatty acids
     emulsifier, namely, a concentration of 0.125% oregano oil in emulsion was active
     enough and needed only 0.05% of surfactant to be solubilized from the powder form.
             Surprisingly, even a lower concentration of powder was sufficient to produce
     good crop protection in a greenhouse study. Only 0.2% of powder and consequently
     0.05% of oregano oil was enough to disperse in water (to form an emulsion) and
     showed excellent and repeatable anti-bacterial effect with the plants being treated
     therewith remaining completely vital as compared to infected, but untreated control.

     mixing until a non-viscous homogenous solution was obtained. The solution was
     sprayed on the SiO 2 powder and mixing was peformed using low sheer force equipment
     until all liquid was absorbed and continued for an additional period of 15-30min. Then
     the powder was grind to breakdown aggregates and sieved through mesh 1,000m. For
     storage, the bag containing the powder was hermetically sealed and stored. Storage was
     for at least 2 years, at 15-30 0 C.
