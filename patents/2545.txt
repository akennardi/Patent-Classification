   PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES FOR PREPARING A MEDICAMENT
   Field of the invention
 5 The present invention relates to synthesis procedures and synthesis intermediates of
   substituted bicyclic compounds, especially compounds that are useful as medicaments,
   for instance Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitors such as ibrutinib.
   Background of the Invention
10 Ibrutinib is an organic small molecule having IUPAC name 1-[(3R)-3-[4-amino-3
   (4-phenoxyphenyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin- 1-yl]piperidin- 1-yl]prop-2-en-1-one. It is
   described in a number of published documents, including international patent
   application W02008/039218 (Example 1b), and is described as an irreversible inhibitor
   of Btk.
15
   Btk plays an essential role in the B-cell signaling pathway linking cell surface B-cell
   receptor stimulation to downstream intracellular responses. Btk is a key regulator of
   B-cell development, activation, signaling, and survival (Kurosaki, Curr Op Imm, 2000,
   276-281; Schaeffer and Schwartzberg, Curr Op Imm 2000, 282-288). In addition, Btk
20 plays a role in a number of other hematopoetic cell signaling pathways, e.g. Toll like
   receptor (TLR) and cytokine receptor-mediated TNF-a production in macrophages, IgE
   receptor (FcepsilonRI) signaling in Mast cells, inhibition of Fas/APO-1 apoptotic
   signaling in B-lineage lymphoid cells, and collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation.

30 Ibrutinib is therefore being studied in Phase II and III clinical trials for various
   hematological malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell
   lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma.
   There are various processes for preparing functionalised bicyclic heterocycles, for
35 example as described in US patent document US 2011/0082137, which includes
   syntheses to fused bicycles from pyrazoles and substituted hydrazines.

                                                -2
   Ibrutinib may be prepared in W02008/039218 (Example 1b) in accordance with the
   following scheme:

 5 First, 4-amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole[3,4-d]pyrimidine may be prepared in
   accordance with procedures described in W02008/039218, for instance by converting
   4-phenoxybenzoic acid to the corresponding acyl chloride (by using thionyl chloride),
   which latter product may be reacted with malononitrile to prepare 1,1 -dicyano-2
   hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene. The methoxy moiety is then methylated using
10 trimethylsilyldiazomethane, and that methylated product is the treated with hydrazine
   hydrate to provide 3-amino-4-cyano-5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)pyrazole, which is reacted
   with formamide to provide 4-amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole[3,4-d]
   pyrimidine, as illustrated in the following scheme:

    NC                     NC                   ,-   NC            -        N          \
              OH                     ON                                                   N
         CN                    CN    /              H2 N    N                   N      N
15                                                          H                          H
   Thereafter, the 4-amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole[3,4-d]pyrimidine may have
   the requisite piperidinyl moiety introduced at the 1H-position (i.e. on the -NH of the

                                                -3
   pyrazole moiety). As indicated in the above scheme, this is done by means of a
   Mitsunobu reaction - more specifically by converting the hydroxy moiety of the Boc
   protected 3-hydroxypiperidine-1-carboxylate to a better leaving group, thereby
   allowing a substitution reaction with the -NH moiety of the pyrazole (with inversion).
 5 Hence, the chirality of the hydroxypiperidine is translated into the product, which is
   then converted to the single enantiomer ibrutinib by Boc-deprotection and acylation
   with acryl chloride.
   This process has a number of disadvantages, such as those associated with cost,
10 efficiency and environmental disadvantages. For instance the Mitsunobu step may be
   wasteful, costly and cumbersome. It is therefore desired to find a new process that
   overcomes these disadvantages.
   There is now provided a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I,

                                   LN-Ri
 5 or a derivative thereof, wherein R 1 is as defined above,
   which process is hereinafter referred to as a "process of the invention".
   In the embodiment of the invention described above, it is indicated that RI may
10 represent hydrogen or a nitrogen-protecting group. The invention itself represents the
   process, i.e. the formation of the pyrazole as specified above. However, this inventive
   concept may be further divided into two: i.e. there may be two sub-embodiments of the
   invention in which:
        (i) R 1 represents hydrogen; and
15      (ii) R1 represents a nitrogen-protecting group,
   and the invention may be directed to either one of these two aspects (or sub
   embodiments). For instance, in aspect (ii), R1 is a nitrogen-protecting group, and the
   process of the invention may be performed on a compound of formula (III) in which R
   is a protecting group to provide a compound of formula (I) also containing that R1
20 protecting group. That RI protecting group may be removed at any convenient stage
   (e.g. in downstream steps) as described herein. This aspect (ii) is discussed herein, and
   is also described in the examples (see Example 1). In the other aspect (i), R, is
   hydrogen, and hence the compound of formula (III) represents a piperidine
   unsubstituted at the nitrogen atom, and this has the advantage that the compound of
25 formula (III) need not be protected, i.e. in which R 1 is hydrogen, in order to form a
   compound of formula (I) which is also not protected at the piperidine nitrogen atom.
   This may therefore have the advantage that this aspect avoids the need for additional
   protection and de-protection steps. This aspect (i) is also discussed herein, and is also
   described in the examples (see Example 2).
30
   In the processes of the invention described herein, it is indicated that "derivatives" may
   be employed, which includes salts and solvates. Hence, for instance the compound of
   formula (III), i.e. the hydrazine, may be in the form of the free base or in the form of a
   salt (e.g. a di-hydrogen chloride salt, although the hydrazine may be in another salt

                                                  -5
   form). Where appropriate, "derivative" may also encompass a relevant protecting
   group (which may be removed later in the synthesis scheme). It should also be noted
   that compounds mentioned herein may exhibit isomerism, e.g. tautomerism.
 5 It is further indicated above that R1 is a nitrogen protecting group. Such groups include
   those that result in the formation of:
         -   an amide (e.g. N-acetyl)
         -   optionally substituted N-alkyl (e.g. N-allyl or optionally substituted N-benzyl)
         -   N-sulfonyl (e.g. optionally substituted N-benzenesulfonyl)
10       -   a carbamate
         -   aurea
         -   trityl (triphenylmethyl), diphenylmethyl, or the like
   Hence, RI may, amongst other groups, represent:
15 -C(O)R       (in which R 1 may represent hydrogen, so forming -C(O)H, but preferably
   represents C1-6 alkyl or optionally substituted aryl);
   CI 6 alkyl, which alkyl group is optionally substituted by one or more substituents
   selected from optionally substituted aryl (e.g. preferably forming a benzyl moiety);
   -S(O) 2W 2 (in which R 2 preferably represents optionally substituted aryl); or, preferably,
20 -C(O)ORe (in which Re preferably represents optionally substituted aryl or, more
   preferably, optionally substituted C 1 _6 (e.g. C 14 ) alkyl, e.g. tert-butyl (so forming, for
   example, a tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group, i.e. when taken together with the
   amino moiety, a tert-butylcarbamate group) or a -CH 2phenyl group (so forming a
   carboxybenzyl protecting group);
25 -C(O)N(R 4 )R 5 (in which, preferably, R 4 and R 5 independently represent hydrogen,
   C 1 _6 alkyl, optionally substituted aryl or -C(O)R, and R 6 represents C1 _6 alkyl or
   optionally substituted aryl).
   Unless otherwise specified, alkyl groups as defined herein may be straight-chain or,
30 when there is a sufficient number (i.e. a minimum of three) of carbon atoms be
   branched-chain, and/or cyclic. Further, when there is a sufficient number (i.e. a
   minimum of four) of carbon atoms, such alkyl groups may also be part cyclic/acyclic.
   Such alkyl groups may also be saturated or, when there is a sufficient number (i.e. a
   minimum of two) of carbon atoms, be unsaturated.
35
   The term "aryl", when used herein, includes C6 _1 0 groups.               Such groups may be
   monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic and, when polycyclic, be either wholly or partly
   aromatic. C6 _10 aryl groups that may be mentioned include phenyl, naphthyl, and the

                                                 -6
   like. For the avoidance of doubt, the point of attachment of substituents on aryl groups
   may be via any carbon atom of the ring system.
   The term "heteroaryl", when used herein, includes 5- to 14-membered heteroaryl
 5 groups containing one or more heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen and/or
   sulfur. Such heteroaryl group may comprise one, two or three rings, of which at least
   one is aromatic. Preferably, such groups are 5- to 12-membered, e.g. 5- to 10
   membered.
10 Where mentioned herein, C1-6 alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl may be optionally substituted.
   Such substitution is possible if it does not affect the concept of the invention, i.e. the
   process(es) defined herein (which may be performed on certain compounds irrespective
   of the substitution pattern thereon). Such substituents include aryl (e.g. phenyl, itself
   optionally substituted by substituents selected from halo, alkyl and the like), alkyl,
15 halo, -CN and the like.
   It is indicated that X1 represents a suitable leaving group, and in particular may
   represent chloro, bromo, iodo, -OR (in which R represents optionally substituted
   alkyl, e.g. in which the optional substituent(s) include aryl such as phenyl, so forming
20 e.g. -OCH 3, -OCH 2 -phenyl or the like) or a sulfonate group (e.g. -O-S(O) 2 R4, , in which
   R4a represents optionally substituted alkyl or aryl, so forming e.g. -OS(O) 2 CF 3 ,
   -OS(O) 2 CH 3 or -S(O) 2 PhMe or the like, i.e. tosyl, mesyl or the like).
   Preferred compounds of formula (I) that may be prepared by a process of the invention
25 described herein include those in which:
   Ria represents -CN;
   R2a represents phenyl substituted at the 4-position by -O-R 2b; and/or
   R2b represents phenyl;

   wherein, preferably, XI represents -OR 3a, in which R 3a is preferably alkyl, more

                O-Ph
                     -                     (II)
    NC
              0
        CN    /
   For the avoidance of doubt, the compound of formula (III) is a single enantiomer
   containing a chiral centre that has an (R)-configuration. By single enantiomer, we
   mean that the compound is present in some enantiomeric excess (in this case, that there
10 is more (R)-enantiomer present than the (S)-enantiomer), for instance in greater than
   50% ee, e.g. greater than 60%ee. The chirality is retained in the process of the reaction,
   i.e. the reaction is stereospecific, and the compound of formula (I) thereby produced is
   also a single enantiomer with the same configuration at the relevant chiral centre.
   Downstream synthetic steps will also proceed with retention of the stereochemistry
15 (unless specified otherwise).
   Particularly preferred protecting groups that RI may represent include those forming
   carbamates (especially the tert-butoxycarbonyl or t-Boc group and the carboxybenzyl
   or Cbz group) and substituted alkyl moieties (especially the benzyl group). Such
20 protecting groups may be more easily introduced onto the compound of formula (III)
   and/or ultimately more easily removed from the relevant nitrogen atom in a
   downstream step.
   Such a process of the invention may be conducted using the free base of a compound of
25 formula (III) or salt thereof, e.g. a di-hydrogen chloride salt of the compound of
   formula (III). Further the protecting group R1 is preferably a non acid-labile protecting
   group (e.g. a group labile to base or removable though hydrogenation or the like) such

                                                -8
   as a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protecting group. However, the choice of this protecting
   group is influenced by the choice of the protecting group R 2 (e.g. the two are preferably
   mutually compatible) as indicated hereinafter.
 5 In this aspect of the process of the invention, the compound of formula (III) (or
   derivative thereof, e.g. di-HCl salt) may be added to the compounds of formula (II).
   Preferably less than two equivalents of the compound of formula (III) is employed
   compared to the compound of formula (II), more preferably less than 1.5 equivalents.
   However, the equivalents ratio of compound of formula (III) to compound of formula
10 (II) may be between 1.5 : 1 to 1: 1.5, preferably between 1.2 : 1 to 1 : 1.2 and in
   particular, the ratio is about 1 : 1.
   Preferably, this aspect of the process of the invention may be performed in a suitable
   solvent, such as in the presence of a polar solvent, such as an alcoholic solvent (e.g.
15 ethanol) and/or water, or mixtures thereof. It is preferred that a mixture of an alcohol
   (e.g. ethanol) and water is employed. Compared to the weight of the compound of
   formula (II) employed, at least one (e.g. at least five, but preferably less than 20)
   volume equivalent(s) of the solvent/alcohol and at least one (e.g. at least five, but
   preferably less than 20) volume equivalents of water are employed. Preferably about
20 13 volume equivalents of the alcohol and about 10 volume equivalents of water are
   employed.
   Preferably, the compound of formula (II) in the presence of a suitable solvent (as
   described above) is cooled to below room temperature, for example to below 10 C, e.g.
25 to about 5'C. The compound of formula (III) (or derivative thereof) is then added to
   the mixture of compound of formula (II) and solvent. Preferably this is done so as to
   maintain the temperature of the reaction mixture below room temperature (e.g. at below
   about 10 C, preferably between 5 and 10 C). For instance, this addition may be drop
   wise.
30
   This process aspect of the invention is preferably conducted in the presence of a base,
   such as an organic base, preferably an amine base such as a tertiary amine base (e.g.
   triethylamine). Preferably between one and four molar equivalents of base are
   employed in the process of the invention (compared to the molar equivalents of the
35 compound of formula (II) or (III)), and more preferably between 1.5 and 2.5
   equivalents are employed (e.g. about two equivalents). Preferably the base is added
   dropwise, and preferably the temperature is maintained at below room temperature (e.g.
   at below about 10 C, preferably between 5 and 10 C).

                                                  -9
   After the addition of the base, the reaction mixture is the preferably allowed to warm to
   about room temperature, after which it is allowed to stir at that temperature for a period
   of time (during which the conversion to desired product compound (I) may be
 5 monitored), which may depend on the conversion rate to product. Typically, the
   reaction mixture is allowed to stir for at least 20 minutes, for example for about one
   hour, after which further water may be added (e.g. between about 10 and 20 volume
   equivalents), the reaction mixture may be cooled (again) to below room temperature
   (e.g. to below about 10 C, preferably about 5'C or below, e.g. about 00 C). The desired
10 product may then solidify, and may therefore be separated/isolated by filtration. It may
   be further purified if required.
   Such an aspect of the process of the invention has several advantages. For instance, the
   fact that the substituted hydrazine of formula (III) (that may be employed in e.g. the
15 free base form, or in the salt form which may be formed in situ) is employed in the
   reaction has at least the following advantages:
        (i) the use of hydrazine hydrate is avoided, which is a hazardous reagent to
              handle, especially at high temperatures (for instance hydrazine is combustible
              even in the absence of oxygen);
20      (ii) the reaction leads to a IN-substituted pyrazole and hence downstream
              substitution at the IN-position is circumvented (when substitution is required
              at that position), for instance a downstream Mitsunobu reaction to introduce a
              substituent is circumvented, the latter reaction generating enormous amounts
              of waste (e.g. the Mitsunobu reaction may require two equivalents of the
25            3-hydroxy-N-Boc piperidine, due to a competing elimination reaction);
        (iii) the use of the expensive chiral 3-hydroxy-N-Boc piperidine is circumvented;
        (iv) the reaction of compound (II) with a non-symmetrical hydrazine may be
              expected to result in a variety of products (as opposed to reaction with the
              symmetrical hydrazine itself) but however, advantageously and unexpectedly,
30            the reaction proceeds in a regioselective manner. That is the process of the
              invention predominantly results in the formation of a pyrazole with a
              substitution pattern as depicted by the compound of formula (I), i.e. in the
              1(N)-position the piperidine, R group (e.g. 4-phenoxy-phenyl) in the
              3-position, etc, as opposed to a pyrazole with the piperidine at the 2-position
35            adjacent the R2a group. Advantageously, the desired regioisomer is present in
              higher quantity than the undesired regioisomer, and for instance is present in a
              ratio of greater than 75:25 compared to the undesired regioisomer, more

                                                   -10
             particularly, this ratio is greater than 90:10, and most advantageously there
             may be a negligible or undetectable amount of the undesired regioisomer.
   Hence, this aspect of the process of the invention may be advantageous in terms of
 5 economy (e.g. cost of goods), efficiency and environmental considerations (e.g. less
   waste).
   After the first process of the invention, the compound of formula (I) that is prepared
   may be converted to a compound of formula (IV),

   particular, the preparation routes are particularly suitable for corresponding compounds

   For instance, for compounds of formula (I) in which Ria represents -CN, a
   corresponding product of formula (IVA) in which X 2 represents -NH 2 may be produced
25 by reaction with either:

                                                 -11
        (i) formamide (HCONH 2 );
        (ii) formamidine or a formamidine salt H-C(=NH)-NH 3vX-, wherein X- represents a

 5      (iii) alkyl (e.g. ethyl) formimidate, or a salt thereof, such as ethyl formimidate HCl;
        (iv) ethylorthoformate followed by ammonium acetate.
   For the aspect of the invention where compounds of formula (I) in which RI represents
   hydrogen are concerned, such compounds may also be converted to a compound of
10 formula (IV) or a compound of formula (IVA), and in this instance, such a reaction
   may result in the replacement of the hydrogen at R1 , for example by reaction with
   formamide (HCONH 2 ), this may result in concurrent substitution (along with the
   desired cyclisation) at the R 1 position to a compound of formula (IV) or (IVA) in which
   RI represents -C(O)H. In such an instance, an additional step of deprotection (or
15 removal of the -C(O)H moiety) may be required at an appropriate stage in the sequence
   (for example as described in Example 2 hereinafter). Such an intermediate may also be
   used to ultimately prepare Ibrutinib as defined hereinafter.

10 iodine, diiodoethane, or preferably, N-iodosuccinimide, and sources of bromide and

25 -B(OH) 2 , -B(ORw) 2 or -Sn(Rw) 3 , in which each Rw independently represents a C 1 _6 alkyl
   group, or, in the case of -B(ORw) 2 , the respective Rw groups may be linked together to
   form a 4- to 6-membered cyclic group (such as a 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxa
   borolan-2-yl group, thereby forming e.g. a pinacolato boronate group), and wherein the
   coupling reaction may be performed in the presence of a suitable catalyst system, e.g. a
30 metal (or a salt or complex thereof) such as Pd, Cul, Pd/C, Pd(OAc) 2 , Pd(Ph 3P) 2Cl 2 ,
   Pd(Ph 3 P) 4 , Pd 2(dba) 3 and/or NiCl 2 (preferred catalysts include palladium) and a ligand
   such as PdCl 2 (dppf).DCM, t-Bu 3 P or the like, optionally in the presence of a suitable
   base (e.g. a carbonate base, hydroxide base, etc) and a suitable solvent.

   Where, e.g. for compounds of formula (IVA) as defined above in which X2 represents
   -NH 2 (or a protected derivative thereof) and R2a represents phenyl substituted at the
   4-positon by halo or -OH, then conversion to the compound of formula (IV) may be
 5 possible by a coupling reaction with X4-phenyl-O-phenyl or X4 -phenyl, for instance
   using similar catalytic coupling reactions to those mentioned above.
   Hence, ultimately compounds of formula (IV) may be prepared according to the
   processes mentioned above.
10
   The processes discussed above (including those to prepare compounds of formula (IV)
   and (IVA)) are also embraced by the concept of the invention, and are also processes
   that may be referred to herein as a "process of the invention".
15 There is therefore provided a process for the preparation of a compound of formula
   (IV) which process comprises a process for the preparation of a compound of formula
   (I) as hereinbefore defined followed by a process for the conversion of (I) to (IV) as
   hereinbefore described.
20 There is also provided a process for the preparation of a compound (IV) or (IVA),
   which process comprises reaction of a compound of formula (I) (as hereinbefore
   defined) with a formamidine salt defined at (ii) above. Such a process is also an aspect
   of the invention and has associated advantages compared with reaction with
   formamide. For instance, the use of the formamidine salt may be advantageous as it
25 circumvents the use of formamide, the latter being using in prior processes at high
   temperatures (e.g. at about 165 0 C, which represents a thermal hazard), whereas the use
   of the formamidine salt allows lower temperatures to be employed.
   This aspect of the invention (conversion of compound (I) to compound (IV) or (IVA))
30 is preferably performed by reaction of the compound (I) with a formamidine salt (as
   defined hereinbefore). The formamidine salt is preferably an acetate salt and is
   preferably employed in excess compared with the molar equivalents of compound of
   formula (I) employed (e.g. in greater than two equivalents compared to compound of
   formula (I), e.g. greater than five equivalents, such as greater than 10 equivalents and
35 preferably about fifteen equivalents).
   This aspect of the process of the invention may be performed in the presence of a
   suitable solvent, which may be selected from aromatic solvents (e.g. toluene), alcohols,

                                               -14
   ethers and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, or the like. Glycols ethers may be particularly
   preferred (e.g. due to high boiling points), and a particularly preferred solvent is
   therefore ethylene glycol monoethyl ether. The solvent is preferably de-gassed and the
   reaction is preferably carried out under an inert atmosphere. More than five volume
 5 equivalents of solvent is employed (e.g. more than ten, and preferably around 13).
   The resultant reaction mixture is then preferably heated to above room temperature, e.g.
   to above 40'C, e.g. above 60'C such as above 80'C. Most preferably it is heated to
   above 100 0 C. However, the temperature of the reaction mixture is preferably below
10 160'C, for instance the preferred temperature range is between 100 C and 140'C, most
   preferably between about 110 C and 130 C (e.g. about 120'C).
   The reaction mixture may be monitored for progress, consequently affecting the time
   period of the reaction. After adequate completion of the reaction, mixture may be
15 allowed to cool down and the reaction mixture worked up to provided the desired
   compound.
   There is further provided a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (III)
   as hereinbefore defined, which process comprises resolution of a corresponding
20 racemic mixture (or derivative, e.g. protected derivative, thereof), which may be
   performed by means of chiral chromatography (e.g. using chiral SFC), thereby
   advantageously obtaining a compound of formula (III) in greater than 50%ee, for
   example greater than 60%ee. Given that the process of the invention is stereoselective,
   it is possible to purify downstream so as to provide an enantiomerically pure
25 downstream compound.
   Advantageously, this may produce product (compound (III)) in greater than 50% ee, for
   instance greater than 60% ee. Introducing the chirality at this stage allows the
   processes hereinbefore described to be effected, thereby circumventing other methods
30 for introducing the chirality (e.g. using chiral 3-hydroxy-piperidine) and circumventing
   the undesired Mitsunobu reaction prior disclosed in a process for preparing ibrutinib.
   Compounds of formula (III), or protected derivatives thereof may be prepared by
   reaction of a compound of formula (VI),

   wherein R2 is hydrogen or a suitable nitrogen protecting group (which may be
   subsequently removed),
   which may also be referred to as an aspect of the invention. This aspect of the
10 invention may be conducted under standard dehydration reaction conditions optionally
   in the presence of a suitable solvent.
   In general, the protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or
   after any of the reaction steps described hereinbefore.

   Protecting groups may be removed in accordance with techniques which are well known
   to those skilled in the art and as described hereinafter.
   The use of protecting groups is described in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry",
20 edited by J.W.F. McOmie, Plenum Press (1973), and "Protective Groups in Organic
   Synthesis", 3 rd edition, T.W. Greene & P.G.M. Wutz, Wiley-Interscience (1999).

      Warm to 20~30 0C under N 2 and stir RI for 1 h at 20~30 0C. Add 1OV EA and then
      1 OV H20 into the reaction mixture. Separate the mixture and extract the aqueous phase
 5    with 1OV EA twice. Combine the organic phase and wash with 1OV H20. Switch the
      solvent to 13V EtOEtOH. Add l5eq formamidine acetate into the mixture. Heat to
      120 0 C and stir for 5hrs at 120 0 C. Cool the mixture to r.t. and add 15V EA and 15V
      H20 into the mixture. Separate the mixture and extract the aqueous phase with 1OV EA
      twice. Combine the organic phase and wash with 1OV H20 twice. Switch the solvent
10    to 1OV MeOH. Add Pd(OH2)/C(O.3eq) and stir the mixture at 55-60 0 C under 3Bar H2 .
      Filter the reaction mixture and wash the cake with MeOH. Combine the MeOH
      solution of crude I and concentrate to 2-3VAdd dropwise H20 (5-6V) into the MeOH
      solution (a lot of off-white solid separated out). Filter the mixture and wash the cake
      with MeOH/H20 (1V/1V). The solid was dried under vacuum at 40-45 0 C to obtain I in
15    80% yield (over 3 steps) in 92.5% purity.
      By comparing the HPLC, HNMR and CNMR of I with a reference of that compound
      e.g. known from the art (or derivatised therefrom), it could be concluded that I that is
      prepared by this synthesis had the same HPLC retention time, same HNMR and

      One batch to prepare XIII-Bn was carried out from 1.72g XI-Bn. In the first ring
      closure step, Conversion of XI-Bn was 100% and XIII-Bn was generated with 99.12%
10    LCMS purity. Even been stirred for 21hrs at 120'C, no decomposition could be
      observed. In the second step, we tried two conditions. One added 2eq of HCl (4M
      MeOH solution) and the other one was without HCl. The batch adding HCl was faster
      than the other one. However, conversion of XIII-Bn was only 20%. Procedure: Charge
      XI-Bn at r.t with formamidine acetate (15eq) and C 2 H 5 OC 2 H 4 OH (13V) under N 2 . Heat
15    to 120'C and stir the mixture at 120'C for 8hrs. Cool the reaction mixture to r.t. Add
      dropwise H 2 0 (13V) and EA (1 OV). Separate the mixture and extract the aqueous
      phase with 1OV EA for twice. Combine the organic phase and wash it with 1OV H 2 0
      for three times. Switch the solvent to MeOH from EA. Charge 0. 1eq Pd(OH) 2/C and

   This example represents a further embodiment of the invention. The compound Y20
   (the piperidine-hydrazine; also referred to herein as a compound of formula (III)),
 5 which corresponds to the general compound X in previous Example 1 (but wherein in
   that case the N atom of the piperidine is protected with -Boc, -Bn or -CBz), is
   unsubstituted at the piperidine N atom, and is directly mixed with the compound Y3
   (also referred to in Example 1 as compound VI, which is also a compound of formula
   (II) as defined herein). The reaction is similar to Step-4 in Example 1 but, unlike in
10 Example 1, this example shows that the piperidine-hydrazine need not be protected for
   the reaction with Y3 to proceed (see Procedure S-I below). Indeed, the resultant
   product Y4 (also referred to herein as a compound of formula (I) as hereinbefore
   described) is advantageously produced without the need to protect the piperidine
   hydrazine (and then subsequently deprotect it). The compound Y4 (which is still
15 unsubstituted at the piperidine N atom) may then be directly used in the next reaction
   step (i.e. without the need to add a protecting group), where a mixture containing Y4
   and formamide (or another suitable reagent that achieves the same result, as described
   herein) are allowed to react (see Procedure S-2 below) thereby forming a compound
   Y 16 (which is a protected version of a compound of formula (IV) as described herein
20 (or a protected version of compound I as specified in Example 1, i.e. XIII but in which
   R 1 represents -C(O)H). It is incidental that the N atom of the piperidine is acylated (by
   a -C(O)H group) during the cyclisation reaction to produce the pyrimidine moiety of
   the bicycle (pyrazole[3,4-d]pyrimidine), and this group may be removed by
   deprotection (for example as shown by the Procedure S-3 below).
