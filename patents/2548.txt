             MOUSE PADS AND LIGHTING DEVICES FOR MOUSE PADS
                                     TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] Various embodiments relate to mouse pads and lighting devices for mouse pads.
                                        BACKGROUND
[0002] Gaming peripherals with lighting features have become increasingly popular. On top
of being aesthetically pleasing, the lighting features may also convey ambience, or
information relating to gaming applications. Mouse pads with lighting features have also
become popular, as gamers seek to customize the appearance of their mouse pads to match
the rest of their computer set up. Such mouse pads are typically expensive, due to their
complex internal structure. Further, such mouse pads may also be significantly thicker than
normal mouse pads due to additional components that are embedded in the mouse pads.
                                          SUMMARY
[0003] According to various embodiments, there may be provided a mouse pad including: a
mat for receiving a computer mouse, the mat including an upper surface, a lower surface
opposite the upper surface and a side surface between the upper surface and the lower
surface; a fibre-optic cable secured to at least one of the upper surface or the side surface of
the mat, wherein the fibre-optic cable is a side glow fibre-optic cable; and a light emitter
configured to emit light into the fibre-optic cable.
[0004] According to various embodiments, there may be provided a lighting device for a
mouse pad having an upper surface, a lower surface opposite the upper surface and a side

                                        DESCRIPTION
[0029] It will be understood that any property described herein for a specific device may also
hold for any device described herein. Furthermore, it will be understood that for any device
described herein, not necessarily all the components or steps described must be enclosed in
the device, but only some (but not all) components or steps may be enclosed. Furthermore, it
will be understood that the embodiments described below may be combined, for example, a
part of one embodiment may be combined with a part of another embodiment.
[0030] In this context, the mouse pad or lighting device as described in this description may
include a memory which is for example used in the processing carried out in the mouse pad
or the lighting device. A memory used in the embodiments may be a volatile memory, for
example a DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) or a non-volatile memory, for
example a PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory), an EPROM (Erasable PROM),
EEPROM (Electrically Erasable PROM), or a flash memory, e.g., a floating gate memory, a
charge trapping memory, an MRAM (Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory) or a
PCRAM (Phase Change Random Access Memory).
[0031] In an embodiment, a "circuit" may be understood as any kind of a logic implementing
entity, which may be special purpose circuitry or a processor executing software stored in a
memory, firmware, or any combination thereof. Thus, in an embodiment, a "circuit" may be a
hard-wired logic circuit or a programmable logic circuit such as a programmable processor,
e.g. a microprocessor (e.g. a Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) processor or a
Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) processor). A "circuit" may also be a processor
executing software, e.g. any kind of computer program, e.g. a computer program using a
virtual machine code such as e.g. Java. Any other kind of implementation of the respective
functions which will be described in more detail below may also be understood as a "circuit"
in accordance with an alternative embodiment.
[0032] In the specification the term "comprising" shall be understood to have a broad
meaning similar to the term "including" and will be understood to imply the inclusion of a
stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or
                                                 3

step or group of integers or steps. This definition also applies to variations on the term
"comprising" such as "comprise" and "comprises".
[0033] The term "coupled" (or "connected") herein may be understood as electrically
coupled or as mechanically coupled, for example attached or fixed, or just in contact without
any fixation, and it will be understood that both direct coupling or indirect coupling (in other
words: coupling without direct contact) may be provided.
[0034] The reference to any conventional devices in this specification is not, and should not
be taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the referenced conventional
devices form part of the common general knowledge in Australia (or any other country).
[0035] In order that the invention may be readily understood and put into practical effect,
various embodiments will now be described by way of examples and not limitations, and
with reference to the figures.
[0036] Conventional mouse pads with lighting feature typically include red-green-blue
(RGB) light emitting diodes (LED) embedded in the mouse pad. These mouse pads may be
commonly known as RGB mouse pads. The RGB mouse pads may be bulky as compared to
normal mouse pads, due to the electrical circuitry lying underneath the working surface of the
mouse pad. The electrical circuitry may include electrical wires and LEDs embedded within
the substrate that serves as the mouse pad. The substrate may also be referred herein as a mat.
The working surface of the mouse pad may be the upper surface of the mat, where a user may
glide the computer mouse across. The working surface of the conventional mouse pad may
not be smooth, due to the underlying electrical circuitry.
[0037] According to various embodiments, a mouse pad may include lighting around its
periphery with the user of a fibre-optic cable. By having the fibre-optic cable arranged
outside of the mat, instead of within the mat, the smoothness and slim form factor of the mat
may be retained. The fibre-optic cable may be a side-glow fibre-optic cable, also referred
herein as a surface-flow fibre optic cable, and may also be commonly known as a side
emitting fibre-optic cable. A side-glow fibre-optic cable may be configured to leak light
through side surfaces of the fibre-optic cable, unlike the classic end-emitting optic fibre that
propagates light from one end to another end with minimal leakage of light through side
surfaces of the fibre-optic cable. The fibre-optic cable may receive a light signal at one end,
and propagate as well as release the light signal along a length of the cable. The resulting
lighting effect may be a diffused glow along an entire length of the fibre-optic cable. The
fibre-optic cable may receive a second light signal at an opposing end, and may similarly
propagate as well as release the second light signal along the length of the cable. When the
                                                4

first light signal and the second light signal are identical, the resulting lighting effect may be
an enhanced, brighter glow. When the first light signal and the second light signal are of
different colours, the resulting lighting effect may be a blended colour glow. By arranging the
fibre-optic cable around the mat and at least substantially uniform lighting effect may be
provided along the perimeter of the mat, without requiring a strip of multiple LEDs. The
quantity of LEDs required may be reduced, and the LEDs may be located at one small area
rather than to be spread out across the periphery of the mouse mat. With the LEDs located at
one small area, the electrical wiring may be simplified. The fibre-optic cable may be
attached, or secured, to the mat using at least one of stitching, adhesive, or other securing
means.
[0038] FIG. 1 shows a top view of a mouse pad 100 according to various embodiments. The
mouse pad 100 may include a mat 102. The mat 102 may include a resilient material, such as
silicone or rubber. Alternatively, the mat 102 may include a rigid material, such as a hard
plastic or metal. The mat 102 may take on any shape, for example a rectangle, a square, a
circle or irregular shapes. The mat 102 may have a slim profile, for example, a thickness of at
least substantially in a range of about 1mm to about 5mm, for example between about 2.5mm
and about 3.5mm, for example between about 3mm and about 3.2mm. The mat 102 may have
an upper surface 112 for receiving a computer mouse, a lower surface 114 (not shown in FIG.
1) opposing the upper surface 112, and a side surface 116 (not shown in FIG. 1) between the
upper surface 112 and the lower surface 114. The upper surface 112 may be at least
substantially parallel to the lower surface 114. The side surface 116 may be at least
substantially perpendicular to each of the upper surface 112 and the lower surface 114. The
upper surface 112 may provide a suitable working surface for a user to glide a computer
mouse across. The upper surface 112 may be a smooth surface, in other words, low-friction
surface, such as polished plastic or metal. Alternatively, the upper surface 112 may be a
surface that provides grip, in other words, medium or high-friction surface, for example
fabric. A smooth surface may facilitate fast gliding of the computer mouse across the upper
surface 112, whereas a medium or high-friction surface may facilitate precise and accurate
movements of the mouse across the upper surface 112.
[0039] The mouse pad 100 may further include a fibre-optic cable 104. The fibre-optic cable
104 may include at least one optical fibre therein, for example, the fibre-optic cable 104 may
include a bundle of optical fibres. The optical fibres may be strands of clear material such as
glass, or polymer. The fibre-optic cable 104 may have a diameter of at least substantially in a
range of 0.1mm to 10mm, for example from about 1mm to about 5mm, for example about
                                                 5

2mm. The mouse pad 100 may include a securing member 180. The securing member 180 is
shown in dashed lines in FIG. 1 to indicate that the securing member 180 may not be visible.
Also, the position, size and shape of the securing member 180 shown in FIG. 1 is merely
representative and should not be understood to be limiting. The securing member 180 may be
configured to detachably secure the fibre-optic cable 104 to the mat 102. The securing
member 180 may be provided on the side surface 116, in other words, the periphery of the
mat 102. The securing member 180 may additionally, or alternatively, be provided on the
upper surface 112. The securing member 180 may for example, include a groove on the mat
102 for receiving the fibre-optic cable 104. The groove may extend along at least
substantially the entire perimeter of the mat 102. In another example, the securing member
180 may include a ferromagnetic or magnetic element for magnetic attracting a fibre-optic
cable 104 that includes magnetic or ferromagnetic material. In another example, the securing
member 180 may include at least one strap arranged along the perimeter of the mat 102, for
strapping the fibre-optic cable 104 to the mat 102 at various positions along the perimeter. In
yet another example, the securing member 180 may include stitching threads or knitting for
securing the fibre-optic cable 104 to the mat 102. Alternatively, the fibre-optic cable 104 may
be permanently adhered to the mat 102. The mouse pad 100 may further include a box 110.
The box 110 may include electrical circuitry, for example light emitters, wires, controller and
electrical interfaces. The mouse pad 100 may be connectable to a computing device, such as a
personal computer or a gaming machine, through an interface of the box 110.
[0040] FIG. 2 shows a close-up view 200 of the box 110 according to various embodiments.
The box 110 may include a light emitter 220. The box 110 may further include an interface
218. The box 110 may optionally include a controller 222. The controller 222 may be part of
the light emitter 220. The light emitter 220 and the controller 222 may housed within the box
110, in other words, enclosed by the box 110. The light emitter 220 and the controller 222 are
shown in FIG. 2 as dashed lines to indicate that they may not be visible by virtue of being
enclosed in the box 110. The light emitter 220 may be configured to emit light, or in other
words, generate light signals. The light emitter 220 may emit pulsed light, i.e. light in discrete
pulses, or may emit continuous light. The light emitter 220 may include at least one LED.
The light emitter 220 may also include other forms of light producing devices.
[0041] The interface 218 may be configured to receive data from the computing device. The
data may include instructions from the computing device, on how to operate the electrical
circuitry, for example, the light emitters 220 or the controller 222. The interface 218 may also
be configured to transmit data to the computing device, for example, a status report from the
                                                6

mouse pad 100, or an identifier of the mouse pad 100. The interface 218 may be a wired
connector, for example, any one of Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable, PS/2 cable and IEEE
1394 (FireWire) cable. The interface 218 may also be a wireless transceiver, for example,
configured to transmit and receive any one of Bluetooth, WiFi, ZigBee or infrared signals.
[0042] The controller 222 may be configured to control operations of the light emitter 220.
For example, the controller 222 may control at least one of the colour, duration, and
frequency of light produced by the light emitter 220. The controller 222 may receive
instructions for controlling the light emitter 220 from a computing device, through the
interface 218. In an alternative embodiment, the box 110 may not include the controller 222.
In the absence of the controller 222, the light emitter 220 may directly receive the operation
instructions from the interface 218.
[0043] The box 110 may further include a cord holder 224. The cord holder 224 may be
shaped to retain the computer mouse cord. The cord holder 224 may include a groove where
the computer mouse cord may be inserted. The cord holder 224 may be a flexible clip.
Alternatively, the cord holder 224 may be provided at the side surface 116 of the mat 102,
instead of on the box 110. The box 110 may be fabricated out of plastic.
[0044] FIG. 3A shows a top internal view 300A of the box 110 according to various
embodiments. The light emitter 220 may include a first light bulb 330a and a second light
bulb 330b. The first light bulb 330a may be positioned at a first end of the fibre-optic cable
104. The second light bulb 330b may be positioned at a second end of the fibre-optic cable
104. Each of the first light bulb 330a and the second light bulb 330b may be embedded within
the first end and the second end of the fibre-optic cable 104 respectively. Both the first light
bulb 330a and the second light bulb 330b may be LEDs, or may produce light based on other
technologies. The first light bulb 330a may emit a first light signal into the first end of the
fibre-optic cable 104. The second light bulb 330b may emit a second light signal into the
second end of the fibre-optic cable 104. The fibre-optic cable 104 may propagate the first
light signal from the first end to the second end, and also propagate the second light signal
from the second end to the first end. As each of the first light signal and the second light
signal is propagated along the length of the fibre-optic cable 104, the fibre-optic cable 104
may "leak" or lose part of the light energy from each of the first light signal and the second
light signal through its surfaces along its length. The fibre-optic cable 104 may be "lossy"
through its surface, such that the light energy that it propagates may leak out and thus the
fibre-optic cable 104 may glow along its entire length. The second light signal may be at least
substantially identical to the first light signal, such that the second light signal serves to
                                                7

enhance the intensity or brightness of the glow in the fibre-optic cable 104. Alternatively, the
second light signal may differ from the first light signal, for example different in colour or
pulse intensity. The light emitter 220 may produce special lighting effects, by having the
second light signal in a different colour from the first light signal such that the fibre-optic
cable 104 glows with a plurality of colours that form a colour gradient along the length of the
fibre-optic cable 104. The box 110 may include holders 326 that may secure the light emitter
220, or the first light bulb 330a and the second light bulb 330b, to the inner surface of the box
110. The box 110 may further include attachment members for securing the portions of the
fibre-optic cable 104 that are located within the box 110. The holders 326 and the attachment
members may be made of plastic. Alternatively, the light emitter 220 and the portions of the
fibre-optic cable 104 located within the box 110 may be adhered to the box 110 with
adhesive. The portions of the fibre-optic cable 104 that are arranged within the box 110 may
be covered with a jacket 328. The jacket 328 may fit on the fibre-optic cable 104 tightly, for
example, may be a shrink on jacket. The jacket 328 may be opaque, for example black in
colour. The jacket 328 may also have a reflective inner surface facing the fibre-optic cable
104. The jacket 328 may be made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or any other suitable material.
The jacket 328 may prevent light from escaping through the portions of the fibre-optic cable
104 that is arranged within the box 110. Light energy escaping through the box 110 may be
minimized. Thus, the light energy emission throughout the rest of the fibre-optic cable 104, in
other words, light glow from the exposed portion of the fibre-optic cable 104, may be
maximized. In other words, brightness of the emitted light for the portion of the fibre-optic
cable 104 around the periphery of the mat 102 may be maximized.
[0045] FIG. 3B shows a perspective internal view 300B of the box 110 according to various
embodiments. The box 110 may include a base 334. The base 334 may be anchored, or
attached to the mat 102. The base 334 may include grooves 332 for routing the fibre-optic
cable 104 to the light emitter 220 or the respective light bulbs 330a and 330b. The grooves
332 may extend through the entire thickness of the base 334. Alternatively, the grooves 332
may extend only partially through the thickness of the base 334. The base 334 may include
through holes that lead to the grooves 332, such that the fibre-optic cable 104 may be
threaded through the through holes into the grooves 332, to be connected to the light bulbs
330a and 330b. The grooves 332 may vary in depth along its length, such that the ends of the
fibre-optic cable 104 may lie partially within the grooves 332 at an inclined angle. The base
334 may include a cord holder 224 for retaining a cord or cable of a computer mouse. The
base 334 may include a base cover 338. The holders 326 and the light bulbs 330a, 330b, may
                                                8

be attached to a top surface of the base cover 338. The cord holder 224 may also be coupled
to the base cover 338, or may be formed integral with the base cover 338.
[0046] FIG. 4A shows a perspective view 400A of the box 110 according to various
embodiments.
[0047] FIG. 4B shows another perspective view 400B of the box 110 according to various
embodiments.
[0048] FIG. 4C shows a bottom view 400C of the box 110 according to various
embodiments.
[0049] FIG. 5A shows an exploded view 500A of the box 110 according to various
embodiments. The box 110 may include the base 334, the base cover 338, and a roof 540. An
adhesive tap 538 may be overlaid on the base cover 338. The roof 540 may enclose the upper
surface of the base cover 338, such that the light emitter 220 and the connection between the
fibre-optic cable 104 and the light emitter 220 is concealed, or enclosed within the box 110.
The roof 540 may protect the circuitry of the mouse pad 100, for example from unintentional
user contact, or atmospheric dust and humidity.
[0050] FIG. 5B shows an exploded view 500B of the box 110 according to various
embodiments. In addition to the base 334, the base cover 338 and the roof 540, the box 110
may further include a weight 546. The box 110 may also include a back plate 548. The
weight 546 may be a flat layer that at least substantially overlaps the base cover 338. The
base cover 338 may include at least one slit 542 formed therein. The slit 542 may be arranged
to at least partially overlap the grooves 332 of the base 334, such that the two ends of the
fibre-optic cable 104 that are partially embedded in the grooves 332 may extend out of the slit
542 to connect to the light emitter 220. The base cover 338 may optionally include at least
one fastening hole 544. The fastening holes 544 may correspond in position, to further
fastening holes on the base 334, such that the base cover 338 may be attached to the base 334
by fasteners, such as screws or nails. Alternatively, the base cover 338 may exclude the
fastening holes 544 and may be adhered to the base 334. The weight 546 may be made of
metal. The weight 546 may add to the mass of the box 110. The weight 546 may make the
box 110 heavier such that the mouse pad 100 stays on a working surface such as a table top,
even as the user moves the mouse on the mouse pad 100. The back plate 548 may be attached

[0054] The mouse pad 100 may be produced at a lower cost as compared to conventional
RGB mouse pads, as the mouse pad 100 may only require one fibre-optic cable 104 and at
least one light emitter whereas conventional RGB mouse pads may require a plurality of
LEDs to be embedded within the mouse pad. Also, as the mat 102 is free from being
embedded with additional layers such as electrical circuits and LEDs, the mouse pad 100 may
have a small thickness, and may have a uniform thickness throughout. By virtue of being free
from embedded layers, the mat 102 may be made of a flexible and soft material, unlike
conventional RGB mouse pads which are restricted to hard and rigid materials to prevent
damage to the LEDs embedded within the mat.
