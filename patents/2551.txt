FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]     The present invention relates generally to coupling devices used to facilitate quick
changeover between different work implements attached to machinery. While the invention
is described with particular reference to earthmoving excavators or diggers it may also be
applied to other types of heavy machinery where selective connection of equipment is
required.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]     The following discussion of the prior art is intended to facilitate an understanding
of the invention and to enable the advantages of it to be more fully understood. It should be
appreciated, however, that any reference to prior art throughout the specification should not
be construed as an express or implied admission that such prior art is widely known or
forms part of common general knowledge in the field.
[0003]     Generally, excavators or diggers include an excavator body having a dipper arm
for manipulating a work tool attached to the distal end of the arm.            Whilst historically,
available work tools may have been limited to digging buckets, modern excavators have a
wide variety of work tools and implements adapted for attachment to the arm, thereby
increasing the efficiency and versatility of the host machine excavator.
[0004]     These tools maybe selectively attached and detached from the excavator by way
of coupler, or hitch, disposed on the distal end of the arm. This coupler mates with a cleat
having a set of mounting formations located on each implement.            Initially couplers were
highly manual requiring insertion of bolts to secure each implement.               However more
recently, couplers include powered locking systems designed to speed up the attachment
and detachment process. These couplers are known as quick couplers or quick hitches.
[0005]     While current quick coupler design is adequate in its function, as will be seen, it
relies on the manual insertion of a safety pin during operation to safeguard against
inadvertent implement decoupling.        Furthermore, in practice many operators neglect to
insert the pin because it slows down operation, particularly if the operator must exit the
excavator and personally insert the pin.

                                               2
[0006]     Referring to Figure 1, a typical excavator coupler device 901 is attached to the
distal end of an excavator's dipper arm 902 to enable mounting of a working implement or
tool 903. The coupler includes a coupler chassis 904 having a bracket 905 for attaching the
coupler 901 to the arm 902 via pins 906 & 907. The bracket 905 and coupler chassis 904
are connected together by means of a pivot 908 which provides lateral pivoting of the
coupler chassis 904 with respect to the dipper arm 902 if desired. In many embodiments
however, no pivot is provided and the bracket 905 is attached directly to the chassis 904.
[0007]     The chassis 904 includes a mounting assembly 909 for selective releasable
engagement with a fixed cleat 910 disposed on each tool or implement 903. As can be
seen in more detail in Figure 2, mounting assembly 909 includes a locating slot 911 and a
latch mechanism 912.        The slot and latch mechanism co-operate to captively retain
respective engagement formations of cleat 910 in the form of pins 913 & 914.
[0008]     The locating slot 911 is fixed and accepts the corresponding pin 913 of cleat 910.
The latch mechanism 912 forms an openable retaining slot 915 for releasably retaining pin
914. The mechanism 912 includes an abutment surface 916 on the coupler chassis 904
and latch 917 moveable between an open position and a closed position as shown in
Figure 2.
[0009]     The latch 917 is hingedly mounted to the chassis about bearing 918 and may be
moved between the open and closed positions by hydraulic actuator 919.
[0010]     A safety locking pin 920 is provided to prevent the latch 917 inadvertently moving
from the closed to the open position thereby releasing pin 914 and securement of
implement 903.
[0011]     A typical coupling process involves the excavator operator manoeuvring the
excavator's arm 902 and coupler to capture the front pin 913 of the working implement
within the fixed locating slot 911 on the coupler. Ensuring the latch 917 is in the open
position, the operator then further manoeuvres the arm 902, to rotate the implement 903
about the front pin 913 in the locating slot 911 such that pin 914 is seated appropriately
against the abutment surface 916. This can be achieve by either pressing the implement
against the ground or other object, or lifting the implement so that it rotates under its own
weight. Either way, at this point the operator activates the coupler's hydraulic actuator 919
to close the latch 917 thereby capturing pin 914 and securing the implement 903 to the arm
902.

                                                   3
[0012]       To prevent the latch from inadvertently moving into the open position and
releasing pin 914, the operator (or another person nearby) manually inserts the safety pin
920 into a receiving hole in the chassis.
[0013]       Referring to Figure 2, it will be appreciated that as depicted in the figure, a portion
of the weight force of implement 903 is supported through pin 914 and latch 917. The latch
is held in place by hydraulic actuator 919 and, which is locked and supported by safety pin
920. However if safety pin is not inserted for reasons previously noted, and the latch or
actuator fail, or the operator inadvertently releases the actuator, the latch may move to the
open position leaving pin 914 unsupported and the implement unsecured. This may result
in one side of the implement suddenly falling, pivoting around pin 913 and/or slipping
entirely from the coupler altogether.          Such an occurrence is potentially hazardous to
personnel and/or other equipment in the vicinity of the tool and may result in a serious injury
or fatality.
[0014]       While some designs for quick couplers with automatic locking have been
developed, generally they require complex locking and unlocking procedures, and in many
cases rely on a secondary lock to prevent the first pin dislodging whilst still allowing the
second to be released. This may prevent the implement wholly detaching and falling, but
may not prevent the implement suddenly shifting when the rear pin is inadvertently
released.
[0015]       Alternative quick coupler designs rely on complex mechanisms which are prone to
failure and/or require multiple actuators.       Fouling and jamming can also be a significant
problem for many designs where the components are not positively forced into position.
[0016]       It is an object of the present invention to overcome or substantially ameliorate one
or more of the deficiencies of the prior art, or at least to provide a useful alternative.

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
[0065]     Referring to Figure 3A, the invention consists of an automatic quick coupler 1 for
mounting a working tool implement 2 to the distal end of an excavator's dipper or working
arm 3. In Figure 3A, the coupler 1 is illustrated on the end of a working arm 3 to attach a
digging bucket 2. While a bucket is shown in the Figures, the couple may equally be used
to attach other implements, either powered or unpowered. For instance, other implements
may include but are not limited to graders, rakes, grapples, compactors, hammers, rippers,
truss booms, slashers, augers, tillers, brooms, loaders, back-hoes, snow-blowers and
borers.
[0066]     The coupler 1 includes a coupler chassis 4 having a proximal section forming a
bracket 5 for attaching the coupler to the working arm by means of rotatable pin-joints 6,
and a distal section including a mounting assembly 7 for selectively, releasably engaging
the coupler 1 to a cleat 8 on the implement 2. The pin-joints 6 on the bracket 5 enable
pivoting of the coupler about a lateral rotation axis CR with respect to the dipper arm 3.
[0067]     The cleat 8 on the working implement 2, includes a pair of spaced, fixed mounting
formations.    In this embodiment these mounting formations are in the form of parallel
spaced mounting pins 9 & 10 each pin extending along a respective parallel and spaced pin
axis. In this way the spacing between the pins provides for stability of the attachment on a
first mounting plane while the length of each pin allows for stability on a orthogonal, lateral
mounting plane.
[0068]     The shape, spacing and configuration of these mounting formations is generally
particular to a connector standard.       This enables compatibility across that connection
standard so that different implements may be used with different machines configured for
that standard.    However, in this regard the invention is not intended to be limited to any
particular configuration, size and spacing of mounting formations. For instance, while the
drawings and description generally describe the invention as having a pair of pins on
respective, spaced pin axes, the invention is not limited to this particular configuration. In

                                               10
alternative embodiments, one or both of the pins may be split into two or more laterally
spaced sections thereby providing lateral stability in the coupler and cleat mounting.
[0069]     While not shown in the illustrations, in other embodiments, the upper bracket 5 of
chassis 4 may be divided from the lower mounting assembly 7 by a lateral pivot similar to
that displayed in the prior art example as 908 in Figure 1. In this embodiment however, for
the sake of simplicity, the chassis is fixed such that the upper bracket 5 and the lower
mounting assembly 7 are at a fixed lateral orientation.
[0070]     Figure 3B is a part sectional schematic side view of the bucket and coupler shown
in Figure 3A. In this figure, the bucket 2 and cleat 8 are sectioned on the bucket's central
plane to reveal the mounting assembly 7 and pins 9 & 10.            The mounting assembly 7
comprises a pair of spaced docks for complementary engagement and locating the
corresponding pair of mounting pins 9 & 10.         The mounting assembly 7 includes a first
component 11 on which a first locating dock 12 is disposed. The first dock 12 is configured
for receiving and locating the first locating pin 9 of the pair of mounting pins.      In this
embodiment, the locating dock 12 takes the form of a recess or notch in the first
component.
[0071]     The mounting assembly 7 also includes a second component 13 forming wholly or
part of a second retaining dock 14. The second retaining dock 14 is configured for receiving
and retaining a second retaining pin 10 of the pair of mounting pins.
[0072]     The first and second components are moveable with respect to one another to
define open and closed configurations of the mounting assembly 7. In this embodiment, as
will hereinafter be described and shown in the figures, the first dock 12 is formed on the
chassis 4 such that the first component 11 is integral with the coupler chassis and fixed
thereto.   The second component 13 forming wholly or part of the second dock 14 is
moveable with respect to the first component and chassis. As such it is movement of the
second component 13 between open and closed positions which define the open and a
closed configuration of the mounting assembly 7. However equally, the first component can
be configured to be moveable and the second component fixed, or both components may
be moveable with respect to one another and the chassis.
[0073]     Returning to the preferred embodiment, when the first pin 9 is located in the
locating dock 12, the second pin 10 is generally unimpeded by the second component 13
when the mounting assembly 7 is in the open configuration.         However with the mounting

                                               11
assembly 7 in the closed configuration, the pins 9 and 10 are cooperatively and captively
held in the first locating 12 and second retaining 14 docks respectively, thereby securing the
implement to the coupler.
[0074]     Figure 4A to 4D show a top view (Figure 4A) and various sectional views of the
coupler 1. Figure 4B is a section view taken on plane A-A of the coupler chassis only.
Figures 4C also shows a section on plane A-A but with the locking assembly components
installed.   Figures 4D is a cross section on plane B-B effectively removing the near side
chassis plate to reveal the locking assembly components.
[0075]     It will be noted immediately that the coupler, and many of the components which
form the coupler and mounting assembly, are generally bilaterally symmetrical about the
centre longitudinal axis, (shown as plane A-A in Figure 4A).         In view of this, in some
instances, the following description parts of the coupler may be described in singular terms
principally because they are seen in the side view illustrations as a single component.
However, it will be appreciated that some parts may be paired on either lateral side of the
coupler. In other cases, the part may be a single component but bifurcated such that only
one half is seen in illustration.
[0076]     The various components of the coupler 1 and mounting assembly 7, including the
second component 13 can readily be seen in the exploded perspective view shown in
Figure 5.    As previously noted, the chassis 4 includes bracket 5 and a lower mounting
assembly 7. The mounting assembly 7 further includes an actuator 16 (shown here in two
parts) for moving the mounting assembly between open and closed configurations, and a
locking mechanism 17 for locking the mounting assembly in the closed configuration under
specific conditions.
[0077]     The locking mechanism 17 includes a pair of locking members 18 and a
connecting linkage 19.       The locking member/s 18 are moveable between an unlocked
position allowing free movement of the mounting assembly between the open and closed
configurations, and a locked position generally preventing movement of the mounting
assembly from the closed configuration into the open configuration. As will be described,
the locking members 18 include locking bias means for biasing the locking member 18
toward the locked position or unlocked position.
[0078]     The locking bias means is provided by the weight force of a locking ballast and in
this embodiment, the locking ballast is the inherent mass of the locking member 18 itself.

                                                12
As will be seen, the mass, shape and attachment configuration of the locking member 18
determine the biasing force direction along with the angular orientation of the coupler.
Notably, the locking member is configured to be urged toward the locked position by the
ballast over a predetermined first angular orientation range of the coupler thereby
preventing decoupling of an implement coupled with the coupler within the first angular
orientation range, and urged toward the unlocked position within a second angular
orientation range. A transition between said first and second ranges is at a locking bias
transition angle of the coupler.
[0079]     The orientation of the coupler also dictates the orientation of the working
implement.     Accordingly, configuring the locking ballast with regard to the locking bias
transition angle, the first angular range may be matched to the angular range predetermined
as dangerous for implement decoupling, thereby preventing decoupling when the coupler is
at a dangerous angular orientation. Conversely, the second angular range may be matched
to the angular range deemed acceptable for decoupling.
[0080]     In alternative embodiments, the locking ballast may be a component or
components separate from, but linked to the locking members 18 and disposed to apply a
gravitational locking bias to the locking members 18.         Such a configuration allows the
locking ballast to be positioned in an advantageous position on the coupler.
[0081]     One concern of relying on gravitational bias is that the magnitude of the biasing
force is dependent on the mass of the biasing ballast. The displacement between the offset
of the center of mass and the pivot location, which gives the lever arm is also important
however this is effected by the orientation angle of the pivot and locking member. In any
event it will be understood that there are practical limits both on the size and mass of the
ballast mass and corresponding limits on the bias force. If dirt and/or debris, which are
common in the working environment of couplers, become entrapped in the locking
mechanism, the bias force may not be sufficient to clear the debris thus causing
malfunction. In particular, if both of the locking members are prevented from moving into
the locked position, the automatic locking capability of the coupler may be lost.
[0082]     One solution is to carefully design the locking mechanism to reduce the likelihood
of dirt and debris interfering with the locking operation.  This can be achieved for instance
by minimising points on which dirt and debris may collect and/or by providing appropriate
shielding to the locking mechanism so that debris is deflected away.         Another solution
employed by the invention, is to actively force the locking member into the locked position

                                               13
under certain circumstances. Accordingly, the locking mechanism is moveable between a
secured and unsecured position such that in the secured position the locking mechanism
positively urges and confines the locking members into their locked positions when the
coupler mounting assembly is in the closed configuration. In the unsecured position the
locking mechanism has no influence on the locking members and they are allowed to move
as determined by the locking bias.
[0083]     In this embodiment the locking mechanism includes confinement means in the
form of a confinement tab located on the connecting linkage 19 of the mechanism 17.
Moving the locking mechanism to the secured position also moves the confinement tab to
apply a confining force on the locking members into their locked positions. Thus, whist the
mounting assembly is in the closed configuration and the locking mechanism in the secured
position, the locking members 18 are confined to the locked position.
[0084]     Furthermore as will be seen, by configuring the confinement tab to be part of the
locking mechanism, the force applied to the locking members is generated by the same
actuator 16 which moves the mounting assembly between open and closed configurations.
This provides the advantage that the function of the locking mechanism and confinement
tab are inherent in the operation of the mounting assembly.          This greatly reduces the
likelihood that the locking mechanism will fail in isolation to the mounting assembly, which
would otherwise allow the mounting assembly to function without the safety of the locking
mechanism.      However in alternative embodiments, the confinement means may be a
separate mechanism from the connecting linkage.
[0085]     Referring again to Figure 5, the connecting linkage 19 includes an articulated arm
comprising a floating link 20 and a swing link 21. A secondary lock and operator indicator
function is provided by the locking mechanism 17 and connecting linkage 19. In the locked
position of the locking mechanism, the swing link 21 extends to obstruct access to the first
dock 12. In the unlocked position, the swing link 21 withdraws from the first dock to allow
access. In addition, the locking mechanism 17 may provide a visual indicator of the position
of the locking assembly.
[0086]     A detailed explanation of the features and function of the preferred embodiment of
the invention will now be provided.
[0087]     Beginning with Figure 6, a pictorial view of the coupler chassis 4, without the
internal components is illustrated. A cross sectional side view can also been seen in Figure

                                                   14
4B. As previously noted the chassis 4 includes an upper bracket section 5 and a lower
mounting assembly 7. Each of these sections includes respective pairs of parallel plates
generally aligned as left and right side mirror images of one another. A pair of laterally
spaced bracket plates 22 form the upper proximal bracket 5, and include reinforced
mounting bushings 23 for the pin joints 6, while laterally spaced lower distal section plates
24 form part of, and a housing for, the mounting assembly 7.
[0088]      As previously noted, in this embodiment, the upper bracket section of the
chassis 4 is fixedly attached to the lower mounting assembly section and as such each side
upper plate 22 is fixedly attached or integral with the respective lower section plate 24 to
form each lateral side of the chassis 4. Each of these two sides is then connected by one
or more cross members to provide rigidity to the chassis 4.
[0089]      In the embodiment shown cross members include: a forward positioned, semi
circular, first dock cross member 25 at the front end of the chassis adjacent the first dock
12; a rear cross member 26 disposed at the other end of the chassis referred to herein as
the rear end; and an upper cross member 27 positioned generally above the first dock 12.
Cross members 25, 26 and 27 are clearly marked in the section view of the chassis shown
in Figure 4B.
[0090]      In addition to providing the rigidity to the chassis structure, various surfaces of the
cross members provide functional purposes used in operation of the mounting assembly
and locking mechanism.        For instance, the cross members may include a stop surfaces
used to limit travel of various moving components. While their function will be made clear
from the description of the coupler in operation to follow; for the time being these surfaces
are rest surface 30 on the top face of the dock cross member 25; rear travel stop 31 on a
projection of the rear cross member 26 and first secured position stop 32, and first
unsecured position stop 33 each on the underside surface of the upper cross member 27.
[0091]      As previously noted, in the preferred embodiment the first component 11, which
includes the first dock 12, is integral to and formed of the chassis itself. In this regard, each
plate 24 includes a slot or recess 35 and a retaining jaw 36, which, together with cross
member 25, define the first dock 12 for receiving and locating the first mounting pin 9.
Access to the dock for pin insertion is provided by a forward facing open mouth. In this
way, the pin can only enter or exit the first dock 12 through the open mouth of the recess
from the forward direction.

                                              15
[0092]     The chassis also includes a pair of guide rails 37 and a pair of mounting holes 38
for mounting components of the locking mechanism 17. In this embodiment, the rails 37 are
in the form of slots disposed on the respective inner surfaces of each plate. The orientation
of theses rails 37 define a sliding engagement axis Cs along which the second component
moves. This axis is parallel with the central longitudinal axis of the chassis. Each slot runs
from an open end 39 at the rear of the chassis to terminate at an abutment surface 40. The
mounting holes 38 in each plate 24, are coaxially aligned for receiving a mounting axel or
pin. A pair of guide nubs 41 help to define the second dock.
[0093]     Shown in Figure 7, the second component 13 is formed as a shuttle having a
shuttle body 45 for slideably engaging with the chassis 4. Like many other components, the
second component is generally axially symmetrical about a longitudinal vertical plane. A
pair of hook formations 46 connected by a web 47 (Figure 4C) extend from the body to form
latch 48. The latch 48 includes a slot or recess 49 which defines the second dock 14.
Access to the dock for pin insertion is provided by a rearward facing open mouth. In this
way, the pin can generally only enter or exit the second dock 14 through the open mouth,
from the rearward direction.
[0094]     A pair of rib formations 50 extend longitudinally along each side of the shuttle 45
for slidably engaging with the guide rails 37 of the chassis 4 enabling sliding movement of
the second component 14 with respect to the chassis 4. The ribs 50, together with the
chassis rails 37 on which they engage, define the sliding engagement axis along which the
shuttle moves. Of course it will be appreciated that sliding engagement may be provided by
other sliding engagement means.
[0095]     Other parts of the second component disposed on the body include a rear
mounting boss 51, and a pair of arms 52 extending longitudinally forward from each side of
the body. Each of the arms 52 includes a first locking surface 53 located on its tip and an
inclined top deflection surface 54. A pair of rear travel stops 55 extend upwardly from the
body. The function of these parts will be described later.
[0096]     In this embodiment, the second component and latch 48 generally define the
bounds and shape of second dock 14. On one side, the second dock is limited by the body
45 of the second component while the hook formations 46 surround the dock on the forward
and bottom.     In alternative embodiments, the second dock 14 is defined partly by the
chassis 4 and partly by the retaining latch 48. In such cases the latch may be configured to
form a gate or door which opens and closes to allow access to the dock.

                                               16
[0097]     With reference to Figure 4D, it is noted that in this embodiment, each respective
mouth of the first and second dock are generally aligned with the sliding axis of the shuttle
Cs although face outwardly in opposite directions. It will be appreciated that in this way,
when in the closed configuration as shown, because the pins 9 and 10 are fixed to the cleat
neither is able to move forward or aft because of the other.          In addition, while in this
embodiment the second component is adapted for sliding movement, it is also possible that
the second component 13 is disposed for pivoting movement between the open and closed
positions such as is shown in Figure 2.
[0098]     Figures 8A, 8B & 8C show perspective views from different directions of an
assembly comprising the second component 13, the actuator 16 and the locking
mechanism 17, configured for mounting within and to the chassis 4. As will be seen, the
locking mechanism 17 is generally anchored to the chassis 4 at the forward end by pivot pin
60 within mounting holes 38 in the chassis 4. At the rear, the shuttle body 45 is configured
for sliding engagement with the rails 37 on the chassis 4, whilst the actuator connects the
body 45, to the locking mechanism 17. The body 45 of second component 13 is configured
to partly house actuator 16. In this embodiment the actuator 16 is a conventional, hydraulic,
linear actuator including a cylinder body 61 and hydraulic piston 62. However other types of
actuators may be applied including screw-drive actuators, rack and pinion actuators and the
like.
[0100]     Turning now to the exploded view of Figure 9, one end of the actuator 16, and in
this embodiment the piston 62 end, includes a piston boss 63 for attachment to the shuttle
body 45 of the second component 13 by means of mounting boss 51 and pin fastener 64.
The fastener allows for a small amount of rotational movement of the actuator with respect
to the second component. Otherwise, the piston 62 is fixed to and moves with the second
component 13.
[0101]     At the cylinder 61 end of the actuator 16, a cylinder boss 65 is provided for
attaching the cylinder 61 to the chassis 4 via the locking mechanism 17 and more precisely,
the connecting linkage 19. The connecting linkage 19 includes two arm sections. The
swing link 21 forms a proximal arm section which is hingedly connected to the chassis 4 by
pivot pin 60 inserted into mounting holes 38. The floating link 20 forms a distal arm section
and is hingedly connected to the actuator by floating pivot pin 71 and cylinder boss 65. The
proximal and distal arm sections are hingedly connected to each other at an elbow pivot,
secured by elbow pivot pin 72.

                                               17
[0102]     Bending and straightening of connecting linkage 19 about the elbow pivot 72,
allows the locking mechanism to move between secured and unsecured positions. With
reference to Figure 4C, bending of the linkage draws pivot pin 71 towards the pivot pin 60
thereby allowing a degree of longitudinal movement of the actuator cylinder 61 and/or the
second component with respect to the chassis 4, potentially without operation of the
actuator.
[0103]     It follows that forces applied to the second component along the sliding
engagement axis Cs, may also pass through the actuator to the connecting linkage 19 and
chassis 4. Such forces include those generated by the actuator 16 itself. In this regard,
referring again to Figure 4C, expansion forces generated by the actuator 16 act to push the
cylinder section away from the piston section and second component. These forces act
through the connecting linkage 19 which bends at the elbow pivot 72, allowing pivot pin 71
to move forward toward pivot pin 60. This closes the included drawn between the pivot 60
and pivot 12 and pivot 72 and pivot 71 shown as the angle a, forcing the locking mechanism
into the unsecured position as illustrated. Conversely, retracting the actuator 16, pulls on
pivot pin 71, thereby straitening said connecting linkage 19 and opening included angle a.
[0104]     Figure 10 displays an enlarged perspective view of the locking members 18 and
the connecting linkage 19 including floating link 20 and swing link 21. It will be appreciated
that the design of the locking mechanism, like much of the coupler, possesses bilateral
symmetry to provide lateral stability about the central axis of the coupler. In this regard, the
floating link 20 is of a bifurcated design having paired, bilaterally symmetrical arms 80
spaced on either side of the cylinder boss 65 to evenly distribute axial loads transmitted
through pivot pin 71. The arms 80 could be independent but in this embodiment are joined
at the elbow pivot end 81 of the floating link. This end 81 is received between and piviotally
mounted to side plates 82 of the swing link 21. The swing link 21 includes a transversely
disposed confinement means in the form of a confinement tabs 83 extending laterally
beyond the plates 82 and an indicator surface 84 (best seen in Figure 8B).
[0105]     Similarly, the locking member/s 18 generally possesses bilateral symmetry.
Although described herein in the singular, the locking member 18 comprises a pair of
locking members, one on each side of the coupler. However it will be appreciated that it
would be possible to implement the invention with a single locking member. Each locking
member is pivotally mounted to the chassis 4 by means of a mounting pivot 85 at one end
of the member. In this embodiment the members are mounted on the same pivot axis and
pivot pin 60 as the connecting linkage 19. However otherwise, the pivoting mounting of the

                                               18
locking members 18 is generally independent from the pivot mounting of the connecting
linkage 19. In some circumstance as will be seen, the pivoting movement of the locking
members is controlled by the connecting linkage.
[0106]     Each locking member 18 includes a number of functional surfaces on its
peripheral edge. A peripheral surface on the distal end 86 of the locking member opposite
the mounting pivot 85 end, provides a second locking surface 87. As will be seen, each
second locking surface 87 is designed to contact a respective first locking surface 53 on
each arm of the shuttle body 45 shown in Figure 7. Deflection finger 88 extends laterally
from the distal end 86 and includes a contact tip 89 for sliding contact with a respective
inclined top deflection surface 54 of shuttle body 45. A protrusion extends from adjacent
the mounting pivot 85 forming a catch 90.
[0108]     The mounting assembly also includes travel limiting means for limiting its
available range of movement.         The limiting means not only define the secured and
unsecured positions of the locking mechanism, they also prevent over extension in either
direction, beyond those positions. They also, to some degree, play a part in defining the
open and closed configurations of the mounting assembly.            In this embodiment, travel
limiting means is mechanically provided for increased reliability. Specifically, the locking
mechanism includes two pairs of travel limit stops.        One pair of travel limit stops, the
unsecured position stops, prevent movement of the locking mechanism beyond the
unsecured position and thereby define the unsecured position. Another pair of travel limit
stops, the secured position stops, limit the travel of the locking mechanism to the secured
position.
[0109]     Both pairs of travel limit stops provide respective, mutually opposable abutment
surfaces which limit movement of the mounting assembly when they are brought into
contact.    Each pair of surfaces are disposed on carrier components of the mounting
assembly which have different movement profiles such that movement of the locking
mechanism between secured and unsecured positions moves the carrier components,
thereby moving the respective abutment surfaces into and away from opposable contact
with each other.
[0110]     As previously noted, a first, secured position stop 32 is located on a portion of the
underside surface of upper cross member 27 of the chassis 4 (Figure 4B).             A second
secured position stop 95 is provided at the end of respective projections disposed on each
of the arms of the floating link 20.       As seen in Figure 4D, which shows the locking

                                                19
mechanism in the secured position, these secured position stops 32 & 95 are brought into
mutually opposable contact thereby limiting rotational movement of the floating link 20, and
thereby movement of the connecting linkage.
[0111]      Another portion of the underside surface of upper cross member 27 provides a
first, unsecured position stop 33 (Figure 4B). This unsecured position stop 33 is configured
to contact a second unsecured position stop 96 is provided on a surface of the swing link 21
when the locking mechanism is in the unsecured configuration. As will be seen, these
unsecured position stops 33 & 96 are brought into mutually opposable contact thereby
limiting movement of the floating link 20, and thereby connecting linkage.
[0112]      In other embodiments the travel limiting means may optionally include or be
provided by an electronic travel limiting means including sensors which monitor and limit the
travel of the locking assembly by controlling the actuator.
[0113]      The locking assembly also includes slide stops to limit sliding travel of the shuttle.
In the event of over travel, a forward safety stop is provided by abutment surface 40 on
each rail 37 on the chassis 4, while rearward safety stops 55 are configured to engage
removable safety bar 98 attached to chassis 4. This safety bar 98 is removable to allow the
shuttle to be inserted or removed from the rails 37.
[0114]      A typical coupling operation sequence will now be described with reference to
Figures 11 to 17.
[0115]      Prior to commencing the coupling, the coupler should be in the fully open
configuration as shown in Figures 11A & 11B. These figures display partial sectional side
views in which section planes are taken through the coupler in accordance with Figure 4A.
Figure 11A is a section through plane B-B which is parallel to, but offset from the central
axis of the coupler. This view effectively removes the near side, side plate 24 of the chassis
to reveal the components of the locking mechanism. Figure 11 B is a section taken on plane
A-A running through the central longitudinal axis of the coupler and displays the operation of
the actuator and relative positions of pivot pins 60, 71 and 72.
[0116]      In the open position, the second component 13 is located within the guide rails 37
toward the forward end of the chassis (top left in the Figures). The hydraulic actuator 16 is
retracted as evidenced by the position of piston 62 in Figure 11 B. As can be seen, the first
and second docks 12 & 14, are closely spaced to allow for insertion of the pins 9 and 10.

                                                20
[0117]      With reference to Figure 11A, further forward travel of the shuttle is limited by the
contact of each deflection surface 54 with respective contact tips 89 of the locking members
18. Moreover, the each locking member 18 is prevented from rotating downward and into
the first dock 10 thereby leaving access unobstructed.
[0118]      This can be seen more clearly in Figure 12, a detailed view Figure 11B which
displays the connecting linkage 19 and relative positions of pins 60, 71 and 72.                As
illustrated, force F16 from the actuator acts through the connecting linkage 19 and tends to
straighten the linkage rotating the swing link 21 (anticlockwise as shown on the page) out of
the mouth of the first dock 12. Further straightening of the linkage is prevented by contact
of the second unsecured position stop 96 on the confinement tabs 83 of the swing link 21
with the first unsecured position stop 33 on the upper cross member 27 of the chassis.
Thus as illustrated, the locking mechanism is in the unsecured position. The included angle
a between pivot points 60, 71 and 72 shown in Figure 12, of the extended connecting
linkage when the coupler is in the open configuration, may be contrasted against that shown
in Figure 4C which displays the coupler in the closed configuration and the locking
mechanism in the secured position.
[0119]      With the coupler fully open as described, as shown in Figure 13, the excavator
operator manoeuvres the excavator's dipper arm 3 and adjusts the coupler's orientation
around the lateral rotation axis to engage the first pin 9 of a given work implement 2 into the
first dock 12 of the coupler. It is noted that pin 9 is able to rotate within dock 12 allowing the
whole implement to rotate with respect to the coupler. As such, further manoeuvring by the
excavator operator is then required to adjust the orientation of the coupler to the position
shown in Figure 14. In this position, the second pin 10 of the implement seats against the
coupler chassis 4 due to a torque moment TM around pin 9 set by the mass weight-force Fm
of the implement acting through its centre of mass Cm. It is noted that in this position, the
implement is stable and its total weight is supported by the pin 9 in the first dock 12, and
with a reaction force against the implement being exerted by the chassis 4 on pin 10.
[0120]      The operator may then activate the hydraulic actuator 16 by means of a remote
control switch provided in the cabin of the excavator. Activation of the actuator 16 initiates
movement of the coupler from the fully open configuration shown in Figure 11A & 11B,
toward the closed position.
[0121]      Figures 15A & 15B show the initial movement of the mounting assembly caused
by extension of the hydraulic cylinder 16 and indicated by arrow F16 .

                                               21
[0122]     As the actuator 16 extends, it pushes the shuttle 45 of the second component 13
along the guide rails 37 (generally downwardly on the page in Figures 15). At the angular
orientation shown, with the second component free to slide in the rails of the chassis, the
weight force of the second component 13 and actuator 16 transfers to the pivot pin 60
located in the mounting holes 38 of the chassis. The weight force holds the connecting
linkage 19 generally extended so that the locking mechanism is biased toward the
unsecured position rather than the secured position. However as can be seen in Figure
15A, as the second component arms 52 and respective inclined defection surface 54 are
withdrawn from under the corresponding contact tips 89 of each respective defection finger
88, the locking members 18 are allowed to rotate clockwise on pivot 60 into the first dock
12.
[0123]      Further extension of the actuator 16 allows the locking members 18 to fall off the
respective arms 52 and rotate clockwise until they rest on rest surface 30 of cross member
25 as shown in Figures 16A & 16B. These figures also display the point at which the latch
48 of the second dock 14 on the second component surrounds the second pin 10 such that
the latch 48 contacts the pin 10 thereby inhibiting further sliding movement of the second
component.
[0124]      From this position, with the second component 13 now rests on pin 10 and shuttle
45 and actuator piston 62 are prevented from further travel on rails 3. Further expansion of
the actuator 16 can only lift the actuator cylinder 61 to the position shown in Figures 17A
&17B. This moves the locking mechanism 17 into the secured position by compressing the
connecting linkage 19, rotating the swing link 21 into the opening of the dock 10 and
pressing the confinement tabs 83 onto the rear edge of the locking member 18, positively
urging it against the rest surface 30 of cross member 25.
[0125]     At the same time, with reference to Figure 17B, the floating link 20 is caused to
rotate around pin 72 (anti clockwise as seen on the page). Rotation continues while the
actuator 16 expands, until the first and second secured position stops 32 & 95 on cross
member 27 and floating link 20 respectively, abut thereby preventing further rotation of the
floating link 20 and compression of the connecting linkage, and expansion of the actuator
16. At this point each of the first and second pins are held in the respective dock preventing
fore and aft movement and thus the working implement is securely held to the coupler by
the mounting assembly.

                                                 22
[0126]      The locking mechanism 17 is also tightly held in the secured position by the force
of the actuator. As such, the swing link 21 provides an added measure of securement in
that it extends into the mouth of the first dock 12 preventing inadvertent dislodgement of the
first pin. In addition each catch 90 on each locking member 18 is also held in the mouth of
the first dock. Furthermore, a particular advantage of the invention is that in this secured
position, the force of the actuator 16 is directed through the locking mechanism and
confinement tabs 83 to the locking members 18 thereby actively confining the locking
members in the locked position. The force of the actuator helps to dislodge any dirt or
debris that may otherwise jam the locking members 18 and prevent them seating against
the rest surface 30 of cross member 25.
[0127]      One other safeguard employed in the coupler is also provided by the swing link
21.    Since, as we have seen, movement of swing link 21 is directly coupled with the
movement of the locking mechanism 17, its position provides an important indication as to
the status of the locking mechanism 17. That is to say, if the locking cycle does not fully
complete, the swing link 21 will not fully rotate to block the dock 12. Accordingly, the
position of the swing link 21 provides a visual indication confirming that the coupling
sequence has completed correctly with the locking mechanism in the locked position.
[0128]      For instance, if the locking members 18 become obstructed due to dirt or debris
and, despite the urging locking force applied by the confinement tabs 83, are prevented
from moving into locked position, the locking mechanism will also be prevented from moving
into the secured position. In this scenario the unseated swing link 21 will not fully rotate into
dock 12.
[0129]      To aid this visual inspection, the indicator surface 84 of swing link 21 (or a portion
thereof) may be painted a distinctive colour. For instance Figures 18A and 18B show the
swing link 21 (with indicator surface 84 shaded) in the unlocked and locked positions
respectively. The indicator surface 84 is not visible unless the swing link 21 is extended into
the dock opening, and therefore the locking mechanism is in the secured position. In other
embodiments the indicator may include a sensor linked to a display or aural warning.
[0130]     A typical, planned, safe uncoupling operation is now explained and shown in
sequence, in Figures 19 through 23.
[0131]     As previously noted, a disadvantage of the prior art is that within a range of
orientation of the coupler, if the decoupling process is inadvertently initiated, the implement

                                               23
may suddenly fall or shift due to its weight force. In a safe angular orientation range, an
attached implement will generally remain in a stationary position with respect to the coupler
during the decoupling sequence, as the latch withdraws from the closed position. In an
unsafe range of coupler angular orientation, the weight force of the coupler may destabilise
the implement causing it to move during the decoupling sequence.              Accordingly, the
invention is designed to prevent decoupling of the implement, whether intentional or
inadvertent, within the unsafe range. However advantageously, the invention provides a
margin of safety.
[0132]     The unsafe, safe and provision for a margin of safety will now be defined with
reference to Figures 19A to 19D which show the coupler and implement at various
orientation angles.
[0133]     Referring to Figure 19A where an implement 2 is shown secured with the coupler,
it can be seen that the weight force Fm of the implement acts directly downwardly through
the implement's centre of mass Cm. Owing to the orientation of the coupler, and the open
bottom of the dock 14, it will be appreciated that the entire mass of the implement is
supported on pin 9 via the first dock 12.        Furthermore, due to the horizontal offset dL
between the centre of mass Cm of the implement and the support at pin 9, an anti-clockwise
torque moment TM is created about pin 9 which is reacted by contact of pin 10 against
coupler chassis 4 as shown by       FR   thereby balancing the force equation such that the
system is in equilibrium and stationary.
[0134]     In this position the implement 2 the implement is biased due to its weight force
such that pin 10 is held against the coupler chassis 4 at the second dock. The coupler can
be rotated anticlockwise by angle CDand the stable connection will remain provided the
weight force of the coupler acts to rotate the implement into engagement with the coupler
chassis. This can be seen with reference to Figure 14 where the coupler is shown in a
counter clockwise rotated orientation but the latch 15 and shuttle 28 are in the open
position. Specifically, while smaller, the displacement dL between the support point at pin 9
and the centre of mass CM still biases pin 10 of the implement 2 toward the coupler even if
the torque moment TM is reduced.
[0135]     Returning to Figure 19A, in view of Figure 14, it follows that since the latch 48 of
the second component 13 is not actively contributing toward supporting the implement,
should the decoupling process be initiated in this angular orientation, thereby effectively
withdrawing the latch, there will be generally no change in the force equation supporting the

                                                24
implement and thus no movement of the implement. Accordingly, the orientation shown in
Figure 19A may be considered to lie within a safe range of angular orientation where
decoupling is allowed. As will the orientation shown in Figure 14.
[0136]      In contrast, with reference to Figure 19B, the coupler is shown rotated on the arm
3 anti-clockwise from the position shown in Figure 19A. In this orientation, the horizontally
offset dL of the centre of mass Cm from pin 9 creates a clockwise torque moment Tm about
pin 9. The implement 2 is only prevented from rotating clockwise by reaction force          FR
exerted by the retaining latch 48 on pin 10. Thus it can be seen that in contrast to the
previous situation shown in Figure 19A, if the retaining latch 48 were to be removed, the
implement would rotate clockwise about pin 9 due to the torque moment Tm causing pin 10
to be biased away from the abutment with the chassis 4. Thus this orientation shown in
Figure 19B exemplifies the unsafe range of orientations for decoupling because the
implement will move if the mounting assembly is moved to the open configuration.
[0137]     At a particular orientation angle between the unsafe and safe (as exemplified by
Figure 19B & 19A respectively) ranges of orientations, there is a crossover or safe transition
angle. This transition angle of the coupler is shown in Figure 19C where the implement's
centre of mass Cm is directly below pin 9. In this orientation, because the weight force Fm of
the implement acts directly on the line of the pin 9, the lever arm dL is zero and the torque
moment TM about pin 9 is also effectively zero. If latch 48 were removed, the implement will
remain hanging in the same position as illustrated.
[0138]      It will be appreciated that each various implement that may be attached to the
coupler will have a centre of mass in a different position. For instance the bucket shown in
the figures will have a different centre of mass position in relation the pins 9 & 10 than a
truss boom. Moreover, the centre of mass of one implement may change depending on
use. For instance the centre of mass of the bucket shown in the figures will be different
depending on whether the bucket is loaded or unloaded. For this reason, the invention
provides a margin for safety by preventing decoupling beyond the safe transition angle and
well into the safe range.
[0139]     Accordingly while the margin for safety and locking member transition angle, in
this embodiment locking member transition angle is shown in Figure 19D where the coupler
and implement are rotated such that a centreline axis CL drawn between the respective
centres of the first and second docks 12 and 14 is generally inclined at an angle of 300 to
the vertical. That is the angle 8* between the centreline CL and the horizontal is 60'.

                                                 25
[0140]     In this position, as we have seen, the weight force Fm of the implement acts to
create an anti clockwise torque moment TM biasing the implement to rotate in an
anticlockwise direction around pin 9. The biasing torque acts to hold pin 10 of the
implement against the chassis of the coupler 4 such that the implement is stable
irrespective of whether the retaining latch is in the open or closed positions. As such the
implement will not move during the decoupling cycle.
[0141]     Of course, rotating the implement further into the safe range beyond the position
shown in Figure 19D, is also safe for implement detachment.
[0142]     In light of the above, in this embodiment, in order to decouple the implement from
the coupler, the excavator operator must first manoeuvre the machine's dipper arm 3 and
rotate the coupler's orientation into a range predetermined to be safe for decoupling such as
shown in Figures 19D.
[0143]     This same orientation is shown in detailed views of Figures 20A & 20B where
gravity is assumed to be acting downwardly on the page as indicated by arrow G. Once
within this predetermined range of orientation the operator would then activate the remote
control switch which signals the hydraulic cylinder to retract. Figures 20A & 20B display the
coupler in the locked configuration similar to Figures 17A and 17B. As shown, both the pins
9 and 10 are securely located and retained within the respective docks with the locking
assembly in the closed configuration, the locking mechanism is in the secured position with
the locking member 18 confined in the locked position held against cross member 25 by the
confinement tabs 83 on the swing link 21. The connecting linkage 19 is compressed so that
the swing link 21 itself extends into the mouth of the first dock 12 while the first and second
secured position stops 32 and 95 respectively, are in contact. As previously noted the
components are held in their respective positions by the force exerted by the hydraulic
cylinder 16.
[0144]     Figure 21 shows a detailed view of Figure 20A focussing particularly the locking
member 18. It can be seen that the protrusion 90 of each locking member 18 extend into
the mouth of the first dock 12 and more significantly the member itself is rotated about
hinged mount 60 to block the path of the shuttle 45 and second component 13. In the
                                        18
position shown, the weight force FM        of the locking member 18 acts through its centre of
gravity CG18 to create torque moment TM18 . As will be seen, unconstrained this torque will
bias the locking member 18 to rotate anticlockwise (as illustrated in Figure 21) into the
position shown in Figure 22A and 22B.               However as shown, because the locking

                                                 26
mechanism is in the secured position, the locking member is confined, against its gravity
induced bias, in the locked position.         It will further be appreciated that the angular
orientation of the coupler dictates the relative position of the center of mass of the locking
member with respect to its axis of rotation thereby determining the degree and direction of
torque moment TM18 gravitationally induced bias.
[0145]     Returning to Figure 20A and 20B, from this position, the operator activates the
cylinder 16 via the remote switch to begin the decoupling process.           In reverse to the
previously described coupling procedure, the initial cylinder stroke acts not to move the
second component 13 but rather to decompress the connecting linkage 19 so that the
locking mechanism moves out of the secured position. More precisely, as the actuator 16
retracts, initially, the weight of the second component 13 and actuator 16 pulls downwardly
on pin 60 opening angle a and straightening the connecting linkage 19. This retracts the
swing link 21 from the first dock 12 and rotates the floating link 20 pulling the second
secured position stop 95 away from the first secured position stop 32.
[0146]     The connecting linkage continues to extend until the swing link 21 rotates far
enough until the first and second unsecured position stops 33 and 96 engage and the
locking mechanism is in the unsecured position. This point is illustrated in Figure 22A and
22B where the connecting linkage is fully extended such that any further retraction of the
actuator cannot be taken up by the connecting linkage. Instead, from this point the piston of
the actuator will begin to lift the second component 13 and dock 14 away from pin 10. The
mass of the second component and actuator, previously supported by the pin 10 is now
transferred to pin 60 through articulated linkage 19.
[0147]     Importantly, in the initial movement between the positions shown in Figures 20
and 22 as the swing link 21 rotates, and the locking mechanism moving away from the
secured position, the confinement tabs 83 release the locking members 18. As noted
above, they are now unconstrained and free to rotate about shaft 60 under the bias of their
own weight force (Figure 21), away from the mouth of the first dock 12 and out of the sliding
path of the second component 13.
[0148]     Further retraction of the actuator as shown in Figures 23A and 23B lifts the
second component 13 and latch 48 completely away from the rear pin 10 of the implement.
In this position it is also noted that the locking members 18 are deflected by the deflection
surfaces 54 on the arms 52 of the second component.             This ensures that each locking
member 18, is held out of the sliding path of the second component even if the angular

                                                 27
orientation of the coupler is rotated. When the locking member 18 reaches the limit of its
rotation by contacting confinement tabs 83, the second component 13 is prevented from
further sliding travel because of the contact tip 89 pressing on defection surface 54 of the
arm 52. At this point the latch is in the open configuration and the operator can lay the
implement down to dislocate the first pin from the first dock in the reverse of the procedure
shown in Figure 13, thereby detaching the implement.
[0149]      The above description addresses the unlocking procedure in the range deemed
safe for detachment where the safety features of the coupler are not required.         Now a
description of the procedure will be described should the operator consciously or
inadvertently activate the decouple sequence, or the hydraulic cylinder lose pressure with
the coupler in the first range which has been predetermined as being unsafe for decoupling.
Figure 24 shows the coupler in the closed configuration however at an orientation where the
assembly is tilted anticlockwise into what has previously been defined as an unsafe angular
orientation in Figure 19C.         In this position, as has been noted, should the second
component 13 suddenly move from the closed position, the weight force of the implement
will cause one and/or both pins to dislodge from the respective dock and the implement to
rotate about pin 9 and/or fall from the coupler. This sudden and/or unexpected movement
of the implement is potentially hazardous.
[0150]      In Figure 24, notwithstanding angular orientation, the coupler is in the same
closed configuration as previously shown in Figure 22. The locking mechanism is in the
secured position such that the locking member 18 is forceably held by the confinement tabs
83 of the swing link in the locked position against the cross member 25. However, in this
position, the gravitational bias of the locking member 18 acts downwardly, (as illustrated by
arrow G on the page) and in contrast to Figure 21, biases the locking member 18 to rotate
clockwise about pivot 60 into the locked position as shown.
[0151]      If the decoupling sequence is initiated in this orientation, as seen from Figures
25A and 25B, rather than moving the locking mechanism from the secured position, the
initial retraction of the hydraulic actuator allows the piston and second component to fall
within the slides toward the cylinder because a component of the weight force of the
combined second component, actuator and implement is acting along the rail 37 axis.
However with reference to these Figures, the locking member 18 stays in the locked
position, both because it is still held by the confinement tabs 83 on the blocking member 21
and due to its own weight bias. Accordingly the second component 13 cannot travel far
along the rails until the first blocking surfaces 53 on the arms 52 on the second component,

                                                28
contact respective second locking surfaces 87 on the end of each locking member 18
thereby preventing further sliding travel. From here, as seen from Figures 26A and 26B the
actuator may contract further to take up any slack and straighten the connecting linkage.
However, once the swing link confinement tabs 83 second unsecured position stop 96
engages the first unsecured position stop 33 of cross member 27, further contraction of the
actuator is prevented. It is noted in this position that the coupler is "blocked" from further
decoupling.
[0152]     Figure 27 shows the same sequence with the coupler at an angular orientation
closer to, but not yet in the safe range.        In this case the weight force of the second
component and piston act in the opposite direction along the rail axis. Thus, similar to the
scenario shown in Figures 21, for the initial part of actuator contraction the weight force of
these components will pull on and extend the connecting linkage 19 moving the locking
mechanism out of the secured position rather than moving the second component 13 along
the rails. As the articulated linkage extends, the swing link 21 rotates out of the mouth of
the first dock 12 taking the confinement tabs 83 with it. This releases the locking members
18 so they are free to rotate about mounting pivot 60. However, as illustrated by arrow WF18
the mass distribution of the locking member 18 provides a gravitational induced bias toward
the locked position. Thus as illustrated, the locking members stay in the locked position
despite the locking mechanism being in the unsecured position.
[0153]     Once the connecting link fully extends, the second component will be pulled by
the actuator 16 up along the rails until the first blocking surfaces 53 on the arms 52 on the
second component, abut respective second locking surfaces 87 on the end of each locking
member 18 thereby preventing further sliding travel. Again, as illustrated in Figure 28, the
coupler is blocked from moving into the open configuration.
[0154]     In both scenarios shown in Figures 23 and 25, it will be noted that while the
mounting assembly is prevented from moving into the open configuration, the second
component is allowed to slide a short distance along the rails from the closed configuration
before being blocked by the locking members 18. As such while the latch 48 of the second
component 13 may partially disengage from the rear pin 10, the pin 10 is not completely
released from the dock 12. Accordingly while the implement remains securely attached to
the coupler, the connection may not be as rigid as when the coupler is in the closed
configuration. In this scenario, the non rigid or "loose" connection provides the operator
with a useful indication that the coupler is no longer in the fully closed configuration.

                                                29
[0155]      An additional indication that the coupler is no longer in the closed configuration is
provided by the indicator 84.         In both scenarios shown in Figures 23 and 25, the
detachment sequence has been initiated in the unsafe orientation such that the coupler is
prevented from moving into the open configuration by the locking members 18.              Under
these circumstances it is noted that whether due to the force of the actuator and/or the
weight force of second component and actuator, the locking mechanism has moved into the
unsecured position. As previously noted in this position the blocking 21 link is retracted
from the mouth of the first dock 12 and, as shown in Figure 18A, the indicator surface 84 is
retracted. This provides the operator with an indication that the decoupling sequence has
been initiated or the actuator has failed.         Importantly, the indicator provides positive
confirmation that the locking mechanism is secured.
[0156]      Should the operator fails to notice the loose connection and/or the indicator, and
manipulates the arm to move the implement from the unsafe range into the safe range, the
frictional load of the first blocking surfaces 53 on the arms 52 on the second component,
contacting respective second locking surfaces 87 on the end of each locking member 18
prevent the locking members moving out of the locked position.
[0157]      It will be appreciated that various components of the preferred embodiment may
be reconfigured without departing from the scope of the invention. For instance Figures 29
& 30 display schematic cut away side views of an alternative configuration of the invention.
As seen in Figure 29, the hydraulic actuator 16 has been reversed such that the actuator
piston 62 is connected to the linkage 19 and the actuator cylinder 61 to the second
component.
[0158]      Another embodiment of the quick coupler is shown in the exploded perspective
view in Figure 31, and subsequent Figures 32 - 34. In this embodiment, the hydraulic
actuator 116 also performs the function of the floating link 20 in the connecting linkage 19
thereby eliminating separate floating link component and the overall number of parts.
Several of the other components of the locking assembly are reconfigured, but generally
operate in the same or a similar manner as will be described.
[0159]      Referring to Figure 31, the actuator 116, including a cylinder body 161 and piston
162, is pivotally mounted to the shuttle body 145 of the second component 113 by means of
pin 164. This allows the entire actuator to "float" as an arm of the articulated arm and take
on the function of the floating link. A bifurcated mounting boss 165 on the cylinder part of
the hydraulic actuator 116 receives and allows for pivotal connection of the actuator 116 to

                                                30
the swing link 121 by means of pin 172. As before, the swing link 121 is pivotally mounted
to the first component by means of a pin 160 received in mounting holes 138 in the first
component.
[0160]     A locking member 118 is pivotally mounted to the first component. While the
locking member is mounted coaxially with the swing link on pin 160, otherwise, the pivoting
mounting of the locking member 118 is generally independent from the pivot mounting of
the connecting linkage 119 allowing the locking member 118 to pivot on pin 160 due to its
weight force.
[0161]     In addition the shuttle body includes arms 152 which a first locking surface 153 to
interact with respective second locking surface 187 on the locking member.
[0162]     The operation of the embodiment is summarised in Figures 32 to 35. Partial
cross sectional views Figures 32A & 32B, display the coupler in the closed configuration,
locked to pins 9 and 10 of an implement cleat (not shown). Figure 32A shows a partial
section through the central longitudinal plane of the coupler whereas Figure 32B effectively
removes the near side chassis plate to reveal the locking mechanism components.
[0163]     As shown in Figures 32, the mounting assembly is in the closed configuration with
the actuator 116 extended so that both the pins 9 and 10 are securely located and retained
within respective docks. Referring to Figure 32A, the force F, 16 of the actuator 116 acts
through pin 172 rotating the swing link 121 clockwise on the page as indicated by arrow
M121 . Furthermore, in this embodiment the confinement means is provided as the mounting
boss 165 of the actuator cylinder body 161 which abuts the locking member 118 forcible
holding it in the locked position. In the locked position, a catch 190 on the locking member
118 extends into the first dock 112. The catch 190 not only blocks the mouth of the dock, it
also acts as a visual indicator to the operator that the coupler is securely locked.
[0164]     The opening sequence is displayed in Figures 33, 34A and 34B.             In order to
decouple the implement from the coupler, the excavator operator must first manoeuvre the
machine's dipper arm and rotate the coupler's orientation into a range predetermined to be
safe for decoupling such as shown in Figure 33. The coupler is rotated on the arm into an
orientation which will allow decoupling, i.e. the safe range as previously discussed.
[0165]     Otherwise, Figure 33 displays the coupler in the locked configuration similar to
Figures 32A and 32B. As shown, both the pins 9 and 10 are securely located and retained

                                                 31
within the respective docks with the locking assembly in the closed configuration, the
locking mechanism is in the secured position with the locking member 118 confined in the
locked position. As previously noted the components are held in their respective positions
by the force exerted by the hydraulic cylinder 116. However, in this "safe" orientation, the
mass weight-force of the locking member FMI, and its center of mass CM118 being offset
from mounting pin 160, biases the locking member to rotate anti clockwise around mounting
pin 160, from the position shown due to moment       MM1 1 8.
[0166]     From this position, the operator activates the cylinder 116 via the remote switch to
begin the decoupling process. The initial cylinder stroke decompresses the connecting
linkage 119 so that the locking mechanism moves out of the secured position.              More
precisely, as the actuator 116 retracts, initially, the weight of the second component 113
and actuator 116 pulls downwardly on pin 160 straightening the connecting linkage 119 and
opening angle a. This rotates the swing link 121 anti-clockwise around pin 160, and the
actuator 116 clockwise around pin 164. The locking member 118 being released by the
actuator boss 165, is allowed to rotate under it mass bias from the position shown in Figure
33 (and in broken line in Figure 34B).
[0167]     Importantly, as the locking member 118 rotates, it withdraws from the path of the
arms 152 of the second component allowing the mounting assembly to move into the open
configuration for decoupling. At this point the operator can lay the implement down to
dislocate the first pin from the first dock and detach the implement.
[0168]     The above description addresses the unlocking procedure in the range deemed
safe for detachment where the safety features of the coupler are not required.          Now a
description of the procedure will be described should the operator consciously or
inadvertently activate the decouple sequence, or the hydraulic cylinder lose pressure with
the coupler in the first range which has been predetermined as being unsafe for decoupling.
Figures 32A and 32B show the coupler in the closed configuration however at an orientation
where the assembly is tilted anticlockwise into what has previously been defined as an
unsafe angular orientation.        In this position, as has been noted, should the second
component 113 suddenly move from the closed position, the weight force of the implement
will cause one and/or both pins to dislodge from the respective dock and the implement to
rotate about pin 9 and/or fall from the coupler. This sudden and/or unexpected movement
of the implement is potentially hazardous.

                                               32
[0169]     In addition, with the coupler in the orientation shown in Figures 32A and B, the
gravitational bias of the locking member 118 acts downwardly, biasing the locking member
118 to rotate clockwise about pivot 160 into the locked position as shown.
[0170]     If the decoupling sequence is initiated in this orientation, as seen from Figures
35A and 35B, irrespective of the movement of locking mechanism, the locking member 118
stays in the locked position, due to its own weight bias. Accordingly the second component
113 can only travel a short distance along the rails until the first locking surface 153 on the
arms 152 of the second component, contact the second lock surface 187 on the locking
member 118 thereby preventing further sliding travel. It is noted in this position that the
coupler is "blocked" from further decoupling.
[0171]     Figure 35A shows that the actuator may straighten the connecting linkage 119
and open angle a thereby rotating the swing link 121 anti-clockwise around pin 160, and the
actuator 116 clockwise around pin 164. However, despite the locking member 118 being
released by the confinement means actuator boss 165, it is held in position due to its mass
bias as shown in Figure 35B.
[0172]     It will be noted that while the mounting assembly is prevented from moving into
the open configuration, the anti-clockwise rotation of the swing link 121 retracts the indicator
surface indicating to the operator that the locking mechanism is no longer secured despite
the locking member being in the locked position.
[0173]     It will be appreciated that the mass distribution of the locking member may be
configured to adjust the first range where the member is urged toward the locked position,
the second range and the locking member transition angle.                In addition, it will be
appreciated that design of the locking mechanism, provide two additional safety features.
First, the locking mechanism includes measures for self clearing of obstructions by the
locking member being positive forced into the locked position.          Secondly, the invention
provides an indicator to indicate that the locking mechanism has correctly functioned and is
in the locked position.
[0174]     In the description provided herein, numerous specific details are set forth.
However, it is understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these
