            Improved caisson system and method for constructing shoring walls
Field of the invention
[001]             The present invention relates to placement of pile elements to construct shoring
walls in difficult ground or ground conditions on land or under water.
[002]             Shoring walls can be constructed using interconnected pile elements of various
types. The pile elements can be manufactured from various materials such as steel, stainless
steel, aluminium, glass fibre reinforced plastic, other composite materials or precast concrete.
Sheet pile comes in a variety of sections with a variety of clutches and is manufactured from
various materials, such as steel, stainless steel; aluminium; glass reinforced plastic or polymer,
glass fibre reinforced plastic, fibre reinforced plastic or polymer.
[003]             For the purpose of this specification and claims:
a: each pile element when constructed from material other than concrete will be referred to as
"the sheet" or "a sheet" each element constructed from concrete will be referred to as 'the
panel" or d panel
b: the means of attachment of one sheet or panel to another sheet or panel will be referred to as
"the clutch" or "a clutch";
c: the enclosing structure used to place the sheet or panel will be referred to as "the caisson or
casing" or "a caisson or casing";
d: the excavation means or assembly positioned inside the caisson will be referred to as "the
tool" or "a tool"; and
e: in the event of a drilling assembly positioned inside the caisson it to will be referred to as "the
tool" or "a tool"; and
f: if drilling means are contained in the tool they will be referred to as "drill bits" or if expandable
drill bits are used as "expandable bits".
[004]             By the expression "substantially conforms to" is meant a situation where the drill
bits whether expandable or not simply rotate wholly within the footprint of the caisson or casing.
Background of the invention
[005]             Various methods are currently used to construct pile walls, and these methods
include pushing, vibrating and hammering pile elements whether sheet or panel into the ground.
In hard ground, a mandrel or pre drilling may be required. When using glass fibre reinforced
plastic [GFRP] or composite sheet or aluminium sheets this problem is exacerbated. When
installing painted metal sheet into hard ground or abrasive ground, by any of the conventional
means, such conventional means will damage the integrity of the painted coating.

[006]           All of the methods mentioned in the preceding paragraph have their limitations
and costs. Noise and vibration can often the major limiting factors.
[007]           Any reference herein to known prior art does not, unless the contrary indication
appears, constitute an admission that such prior art is commonly known by those skilled in the
art to which the invention relates, at the priority date of this application.
Summary of the invention
[008]           The present invention provides a caisson or casing for installing a pile element,
such as a sheet or a panel, into a ground or underwater location, the caisson having a shaped
wall which is open for a predetermined length, which is adapted to receive and connect to an
excavation means within the confines of the caisson or casing.
[009]           The shaped wall can have its free sides each having a clutch, and a connecting
section which closes the caisson and or the shaped wall.
[010]           The connection section can have a wall portion with a mating clutch to join with a
clutch at the wall sides of the shaped wall.
[011]           The connection section can be formed from one or more wall portions having
clutches on it or them or can also include another wall portion which is at an angle to the first
mentioned wall portion and which terminates in a third clutch or join formation which is adapted
to engage another sheet or panel previously inserted in the ground or underwater location.
[012]           The connection section is a sheet pile or can be formed and or shaped as a
sheet pile so as to function as a sheet pile, which is adapted, in use, to be separable from the
shaped wall.
[013]           The connection section can have a first clutch and a second clutch, the first
clutch located at a side of the connection section and the second clutch located intermediate the
sides of the connection section, so that the first and second clutches are adapted to connect to
the two clutches at the free sides of the shaped wall.
[014]           The connection section can have a third join formation or clutch located at the
other side of the connection section to the first clutch, the third join formation or clutch being
adapted to engage another panel or sheet or sheet clutch being at a side of a sheet or panel
previously inserted in the ground or underwater location.
[015]           The third mating join formation or clutch on the connection section, by being
adapted to engage a panel or sheet or sheet clutch on a sheet or panel previously inserted in
the ground or underwater location, is adapted to act as a guide to guide the caisson or casing,
and an excavation means combined therewith, as excavation or drilling occurs.

[016]           The third join formation or clutch can be adapted to be located outside an
excavation footprint of an excavation means combined with the caisson or casing.
[017]           The caisson or casing can have a releasable locking mechanism interconnects
the connection section and the shaped wall.
[018]           The locking mechanism can include one of the following: a pin passing through
mating clutches on the shaped wall and the connections section which can be removed when
needed; one of the connection section or the shaped wall include a flange portion provided to
receive a removable pin.
[019]           The caisson or casing when combined with an excavation means can be adapted
to allow the excavation means to provide an excavation footprint which can overlap an
excavation footprint related to the sheet previously inserted in the ground or underwater
location.
[020]           After the caisson or casing has been positioned in the ground or underwater
location, the connection section is separable from the shaped wall.
[021]           The shaped wall can be adapted so that a sheet pile or panel can be made to
engage the clutch or join formation of a previous sheet or panel, and pushed or hammered or
vibrated into position.
[022]           The shaped wall can be removeable from the ground or the underwater location,
after the sheet pile or panel is positioned.
[023]           The caisson or casing described above can be combined with an excavation
means.
[024]           The excavation means can be a drilling assembly having two or more drill bits
which are adapted to be driven by a drilling or rotation motive device, the drill bits being adapted
to be arranged with respect to the caisson or casing in use, so as form a hole or bore which
substantially conforms to, or substantially overlaps with, the shape of the caisson or casing.
[025]           The drill bits can be adapted to be positioned ahead of a leading edge of the
caisson or casing or are positioned so as to drill from within the confines of the caisson or
casing.
[026]           The drilling bits can be expanding drilling bits or may be non-expanding drill bits.
[027]           The excavation means and or caisson or casing, allows the excavation means to
be withdrawn from the caisson or casing.
[028]           The excavation means has one or more of the following features: when in an
expanded condition, engages ground beyond part or all of a leading edge of the caisson or
casing; when in the expanded condition remains inside the caisson or casing opening or

opening footprint; when the excavation means or drilling bit is not an expanding excavation
means or drilling bit, they remain inside the caisson or casing opening or opening footprint.
[029]           The drill bits if present can be rotated by hydraulic motors located within the
caisson or casing.
[030]           The drill bits can be rotated by hydraulic motors located outside the caisson or
casing.
[031]           The drill bits can be rotated by other mechanical means whether individually or in
unison.
[032]           The excavation means can be mounted for being pulled towards or pushed away
from the caisson or casing.
[033]           The excavation means can be provided with a means of flushing by air, liquid,
slurry, mud or a combination of any two or more of these.
[034]            Part of the excavation means can be adapted to be positioned ahead of a leading
edge of the caisson or casing.
[035]           The excavation means can be adapted to be attached to the caisson or casing.
[036]           The excavation means can be releasably attachable to the caisson or casing.
[037]           The caisson or casing can be constructed from two or more vertical sections.
[038]           The excavation means can substantially close off an opening formed by an inner
periphery of the caisson or casing.
[039]           There can be 2 or more, or multiple, excavation means used for the caisson or
casing opening.
[040]           The excavation means excavates hard ground or drills hard ground, allowing the
caisson or casing to be positioned to a predetermined or required depth.
[041]           There can be a gap between an interior surface of the caisson or casing and a
body of the excavation means. The gap is of the order of 5 to 10 millimetres.
[042]           The connection section can be unconnected to the excavation means to be
associated with the caisson or casing.
[043]           The excavation means to be associated with the caisson or casing, is connected
to or is a releasable part of the shaped wall.

caisson or casing is open, overlapping the excavation area of the new sheet pile or panel with
that of an earlier installed sheet pile or panel; installing a sheet pile or panel including the
caisson or casing being present or not during this step.
[045]            The method can include the use of a connection section to close the caisson or
casing.
[046]            The connection section can enable the caisson or casing to be guided by the
earlier installed sheet pile or panel.
[047]            The connection section can also act as a sheet pile and remains in the ground or
underwater location.
[048]            The present invention also provides an excavation means for use with a
caisson or casing so as to drill in front of the leading edge of the caisson or casing, the

casing an excavation means as described above; advancing said excavation means to
excavate ground beneath said excavation means until said caisson or casing engages hard
ground; detaching said excavation means from said caisson or casing and drilling ahead of
said caisson or casing to a predetermined depth; withdrawing said excavation means from
said caisson or casing; rotating said excavation means through 180 degrees about a vertical
axis; inserting said excavation means into said caisson or casing; advancing said excavation
means to excavate ground beneath said excavation means to produce a series of
overlapped excavations into which said caisson or casing can positioned; repeating as many
times as needed to situate said caisson or casing to a desired depth.
[053]            The present invention also provides an excavation means and a caisson or
casing for insertion into soft bed or friable ground, the excavation means being able to

in a soft bed or friable ground, the method including the steps of: providing a caisson or
casing and an excavation means or assembly as described above; activating the excavation
means to excavate ground beneath the excavation means so as to produce a series of
overlapped excavations within the opening or opening footprint of the caisson or casing,
whereby the soft bed or friable ground allows the caisson or casing and the excavation
means or assembly to move through it.
[059]             A solution is to push, pull, hammer or lower a caisson or casing to a
predetermined depth. The caisson or casing is a hollow box shaped to accept a new panel.
[060]             After the caisson or casing is pushed, pulled, hammered or lowered to a depth
the new panel can be inserted and or formed inside the caisson or casing.
[061]             After the new panel is inserted in the caisson or casing, the caisson or casing is

                                                   9
[095]           The capping beam and structural element can be bolted or screwed together.
[096]           The method can further have one of the below features:
[097]            the capping beam includes one or more inserted or pre-cast reinforcement bars,
each to be inserted into a corresponding aperture in the structural element; or
[098]           the structural element includes one or more inserted or pre-cast reinforcement
bars, whereby each reinforcement bar is received by a corresponding aperture in the capping
beam; or
[099]           the structural element includes one or more inserted or pre-cast reinforcement
elements, and the capping beam is cast onto the structural element and around the
reinforcement elements.
[0100]          The method can include the step of including an anchoring tie in the capping
beam.
[0101]          The method can include the step of attaching a subsequent caisson or casing to
the caisson or casing.
[0102]          The present invention also provides an apparatus that allows a caisson or casing
to be pushed, pulled or lowered to a required depth.
[0103]          There can be a two or more expanding drill bits.
[0104]          The expanding drill bits can be located within a caisson or casing inner drilling
assembly.
[0105]          The expanding drill bits can be arranged so as to conform to the shape of the
caisson or casing.
[0106]          The caisson or casing inner drilling assembly can be located so that the drill bit
cutting edges extend below the leading edge of the caisson.
[0107]          The expanding drill bits utilised can be constructed using known bits. The
expansion and retraction of the cutting edges can be achieved by mechanical, hydraulic, or
other means, as well as by rotation.
[0108]          When rotated in a primary direction of rotation the expanding drill bit cutting
edges are retracted and remain wholly within the caisson or casing. In this retracted position the
inner assembly can be removed from the caisson casing.
[0109]          When located in the caisson or casing and rotated in the opposite direction to the
primary direction, the expanding drill bit cutting edges extend beyond the outer extremities of
the caisson or casing.

[0110]            When rotated in the extended or expanded position the expanding drill bits will
disturb or drill the ground and allow the caisson or casing to be pushed, pulled or lowered into
the disturbed or drilled ground.
[0111]            The drill bits can be provided with a means of flushing by the introduction of
either, liquid or air, or a combination of both, to assist the advance of the caisson or casing.
[0112]            The inner drilling assembly can be made to advance ahead of the caisson or
casing.
[0113]            Once the inner drilling assembly is advanced the caisson or casing can be made
to advance by retracting the inner drilling assembly and pushing, pulling or lowering the caisson
or casing. This process can then be repeated.
[0114]            When the caisson or casing has reached the required depth the rotation of the
expanding drill bits is reversed, retracting the cutting edges. The inner drilling assembly can
then be detached from the caisson or casing and then removed from the caisson or casing.
Once the required depth of caisson/casing is reached, a structural element, such as a poured
concrete element (such as a wall, a block, retainer), or a preformed concrete shape, can then
be placed inside the caisson or casing and the caisson or casing removed leaving the structural
element in position, and allowing the caisson to be re-used. The caisson or casing could also be
left in situ, as a final structural element. Furthermore, the caisson or casing could also be used
as formwork, to e.g. form or cast in place a concrete structural element.
[0115]            The structural elements placed inside the caisson or casing can be made from
concrete steel or any other material, including reinforcing made from fibre glass or non
corroding reinforcing material.
[0116]            The structural element can be provided with a drain hole, or drainage holes.
[0117]            The drainage holes in the element can be provided with a strip drain.
[0118]            The strip drain can be protected by geo fabric.
[0119]            The structural element can be provided with a lifting eye, or lifting eyes.
[0120]            The structural element can be provided with a grout tube, or tubes to allow grout,
or other medium, to be pumped to the base. The grouting can be done before during or after the
withdrawal of the caisson or casing.
[0121]            The structural element can be provided with a void or a multiple of voids to allow
a jet grouted pile, or piles to be constructed below the element.
[0122]            The structural element can be provided with a void, or voids to allow the
installation of a grouted rock dowel, or dowels below the element. The structural element can
also be provided with reinforcement bars to allow attachment of a capping beam. The structural

element can also be provided with cast in place penetrations to allow the reinforcement bars to
be grouted in place after casting.
[0123]            After the element is placed in the caisson or casing, a free flowing material either
granular or liquid can be placed in the caisson as it is withdrawn to fill the void left by the
caisson.

Detailed description of the embodiment or embodiments
[0248] The description and claims relate to the use of caissons or casings, and caissons and
casings, to place structural elements into soft ground without disturbing the surrounding
environment. For the purpose of this specification and attached claims, the word "caisson" is
meant to describe a hollow structure, which can be pressurized, that is, able to bear hydrostatic
pressure either as water is evacuated from inside, or air is pumped in, whereas the word
"casing" is meant to describe a hollow structure which is not pressurized, that is, water may be
on the inside of the hollow structure. The following description applies to both types unless it is
specified otherwise.
[0249] While the following description is in respect of an unpressurised caisson or casing,
driven vertically in marine sediment it will be readily understood that the invention and
embodiments thereof can be applied to pressurized caissons, and in directions other than
vertical and other ground types.
[0250] Illustrated in Figures 1.1 to 1.3 is a generally rectangular caisson or casing 1, which can
be of any desired height and or wall thickness. Inside of the caisson or casing 1 is mounted an
inner drilling assembly 3 with thee drill bits 4, being in a retracted condition. Not shown in these
Figures are the attachment of the inner drilling assembly to the caisson or casing, or the bit
drive, or flushing mechanism, but they are illustrated and described in respect of Figure 9. The
drill bits 4 are mounted for rotation in the drilling assembly 3, as described later in respect of
Figure 9. Itwill be noted from Figures 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 that the retracted size or diameter of the
drill bit 4 that is selected for use with the caisson/casing 1, is such as to fit within the inner wall
dimension of the caisson/casing 1. The expansion and retraction of the cutting edges can be
achieved by rotation, or by mechanical, hydraulic, or other means.
[0251] Illustrated in Figures 2.1 to 2.3 are a similar Figures to Figures 1.1 to 1.3 respectively,
showing the relative positioning of the caisson/casing 1's wall with the drill bits 4.1 being the
same as drill bits 4, except in an extended or expanded condition. It should be noted that the
drill bits now labeled 4.1 in their extended or expanded condition do not cover the complete
leading edge 2 of the caisson/casing 1, as is visible in each of Figures 2.1 to 2.3. However, it
will be noted that a substantial portion of the periphery of the caisson/casing perimeter is
overlapped by the outside diameter of the extended or expanded drill bits 4.1. In soft ground or
highly friable terrain, this will not hinder the advance, downward movement or insertion of the
caisson/casing 1's into such ground.

                                                    20
[0252] The caisson or casing 1 does not rotate whilst it is advanced or inserted into the ground.
The terrains in which the embodiments are used are friable ground whereby the "cuttings" or
bed are disturbed or plasticized, fluidised or worried, and are displaced by the drilling assembly
and/or the caisson or casing. The embodiments do not drill or function when rock is
encountered. The cuttings in these terrains are simply disturbed or moved away, and mixed with
water by the rotation action of the drilling bits 4, especially in e.g. a river bed. This enables the
caisson or casing to sink into the ground and reach the required or predetermined depth, under
the influence of gravity, by a pushing or a pulling force, or by hammering. For instance, as
shown in Figure 22, workers can apply a tension rather than a compressive force to lower the
caisson. This can be done by pulling on a rope, cable or similar 38, which is arranged around
pulleys 40 to transmit the pulling force into a downward force upon the caisson or casing 1.
[0253] The drill assembly 3 effectively closes off, or substantially closes off, the opening formed
by the inner periphery at the leading ledge of the caisson or casing.
[0254] It will be noted from Figure 2.2 and 2.3, that the outside diameter of the expanded drill
bits 4.1 do not overlap, ensuring the easy operation and obviates the need to synchronise the
bits 4.1 in their cutting action.
[0255] As the bits 4.1 when expanded, can be contracted to the positions shown in Figures 1.1
to 1.3, this means that when the caisson/casing 1 is in the desired position in the earth, river or
harbour bed, or other location, once brought to the retracted condition can be withdrawn from
the caisson/casing 1, with the friction with the caisson/casing 1 outer wall, ensuring that it does
not move when the drilling assembly 3 is withdrawn from the caisson/casing 1.
[0256] Illustrated in Figure 3.1 to 3.3 are respectively similar views to that of Figures 2.1 to 2.3
with the drill bits 4.1 and 4.2 in their extended or expanded conditions covering the complete
leading edge 2 or the whole periphery of the caisson/casing 1. Drill bit 4.2 is vertically positioned
lower with respect to the bits 4.1, so that the rotation of bit 4.2 does not conflict with the rotation
of other bits 4.1. Alternatively, the bit 4.2 can be positioned above other bits 4.1, in order to
achieve a similar functional effect.
[0257] Illustrated in Figures 4.1 to 4.3 are respectively similar illustration to that of Figures 3.1 to
3.3, with the drill bits 4.3 in their extended or expanded position, but the outer bits 4.3 being at a
90 degrees phase difference to the inner bit 4.3. The rotation of the drill bits in this assembly
would need to be synchronized to avoid conflict or inter-engagement. The synchronization could
be achieved by chains, gears or any other appropriate means.
[0258] Illustrated in Figures 5, 6 and 7 are caissons 1 and inner drilling assemblies 3 of various
shapes. The location of the drill bits 4.1 are as detailed in Figures 2.1 to 2.3. The drill bits 4.1 of
Figures 5, 6 and 7, could also be arranged as described in Figures 3.1 to 3.3 or 4.1 to 4.3.

                                                    21
[0259] Illustrated in Figures 8.1 to 8.4 are a caissons/casing 1 and an inner drilling assembly 3
of the shape which generally corresponds to the number "8". Two drilling bits 4.1, 4.2 are
provided in the drilling assembly 3. The drilling bits 4.1, 4.2, in their expanded condition overlap
with each other. Therefore, one drill bit 4.2 is positioned lower than the other drill bit 4.1.
[0260] It will be readily understood that structural elements of other shapes than those
illustrated in the Figures 1.3, 3.3, 4.3, 5 to 7, and 8.3 will require caissons/casings 1 of other
corresponding or matching shapes.
[0261] As illustrated in Figures 1.1 to 8.4, there is a gap 2.1 between the body of the inner
drilling assembly 3 and the interior surface of the caisson or casing 1. The body of the inner
drilling assembly 3 can further generally conform to the shape of the interior of the caisson 1.
This gap is usually of the order of 5 to 10 millimetres, but variations from this range are
possible. When the embodiment is used in a watery environment such as the ocean, harbour, or
river, water is allowed to ingress into the interior of the caisson/casing 1 through the gap 2.1.
Water ingress into the caisson or casing 1 is also possible through any other apertures or holes
provided on the wall of the caisson or casing 1. Thus in circumstances where the embodiment is
used in a watery environment, water is allow to enter and may fill the caisson/casing 1. The
water ingress helps the caisson/casing to sink into the friable ground.
[0262] Illustrated in Figure 9 is a caisson/casing 1 and an inner drilling assembly 3 with 3
expanding drill bits 4 driven by hydraulic motors 5. The motors 5 are kept in approximate
synchronization by the hydraulic flow divider 7. The flow divider 7 can be located within the
Inner drilling assembly 3 or as shown in Figure 9 where it is external to the caisson/casing 1.
The motors 5 have drive shafts 6 that pass through bearings 8 to the bits 4.
[0263] Flushing hoses 14 supply air or liquid to the bits 4 through the bearing 8 and the shaft 6
to a location past the base 9 of the bearing 8, and out through the flushing hole 15. Hydraulic
hoses 13 connect the divider 7 with the motors 5. A latch assembly 10 on the drilling assembly
3 locates the inner drilling assembly 3 with the caisson/case 1, and engages apertures 11 in the
caisson or casing 1. A lifting assembly 12 is provided to remove the inner drilling assembly 3
from the caisson/casing 1 when the bits 4 are retracted. The lifting assembly 12 is connected to
the latch assembly 10 so that when tension is applied to the lifting assembly the latch 10 will
automatically detach from the caisson 1. This attachment is not shown on the drawings.
[0264] In operation, the periphery of the body of the drilling assembly 3 conforms as close as
practical to the internal rim of the leading edge of the caisson 1, which will preferably, on its
inside, be of a constant cross section. This relationship of conformity precludes or reduces the
entry of material into the caisson 1. The drill bits 4, by their rotation, will worry, plasticise,
fluidise, or disturb the ground. The disturbance can be also helped or enhanced by the injection
of fluids through the flushing hole 15. The ground, so disturbed, is forced by the combined mass
P4943AU04

                                                  22
of the caisson 1 and the drilling assembly 3 to move outward from underneath the drilling
assembly 3 and upward as the assembly sinks.
[0265] Illustrated in Figure 10 are examples of two drill bits which are available and can be used
with the embodiments described above. Other types of expanding drill bits, some called under
the name 'reamers" or "under reamers" which may or may not require rotation to cause
expansion or counter-rotation to cause contraction, are also known which can also be used with
the embodiments of the present invention as described above.
[0266] In respect of the above embodiments, when the caisson or casing 1 has reached the
required depth, the rotation of the expanding drill bits 4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 are reversed in the
direction 16 of Figure 10, retracting the cutting edges. The inner drilling assembly 3 can then be
detached from the caisson/casing 1 and then removed from the caisson/casing 1. Once the
required depth of caisson/casing 1 is reached, a structural element, such as a poured concrete
element (such as a wall, a block, retainer), or a preformed concrete shape, can then be formed
or placed inside the caisson/casing 1 and then caisson/casing 1 removed leaving the structural
element in position, and allowing the caisson/casing 1 to be re-used.
[0267] The structural elements placed inside the caisson/casing 1 can be made from concrete,
steel or any other material, and may include reinforcing made from fibre glass or non-corroding
reinforcing material.
[0268] The structural element can be provided with a drain hole, or drainage holes.
[0269] The drainage holes in the structural element can be provided with a strip drain. The strip
drain can be protected by geo fabric.
[0270] The structural element can be provided with a lifting eye, or lifting eyes so it can be lifted
and deposited into position in the caisson/casing 1.
[0271] The structural element can be provided with a grout tube, or tubes to allow grout, or
other medium, to be pumped to the base. The grouting can be done before during or after the
withdrawal of the caisson/casing 1.
[0272] The structural element can be provided with a void or a multiple of voids to allow a jet
grouted pile, or piles to be constructed below the element.
[0273] The structural element can be provided with a void, or voids to allow the installation of a
grouted rock dowel, or dowels below the element. The structural element can also be provided
with reinforcement bars to allow attachment of a capping beam. The structural element can also
be provided with cast in place penetrations, i.e. through apertures, to allow the reinforcement
bars to be grouted in place after casting.

[0274] After the structural element is placed in the caisson/casing 1, a free flowing material
either granular or liquid can be placed in the caisson as it is withdrawn to fill the void left by the
caisson/casing 1. The caisson or casing could alternatively be left in situ, as a final structural
element. Furthermore, the caisson or casing could also be used as formwork, to e.g. form or
cast in place a concrete structural element.
[0275] In respect of the description of what is positioned inside the caisson/casing 1, after it has
achieved a desired depth, as described above in paragraphs [067] to [075] has not been
described in any detail, nor illustrated, as these aspects are not part of the invention described
in this specification, and further will be commonly and widely known by a person skilled in this
art.
[0276] Illustrated in Figure 11 is a manual release system to separate the drilling assembly 3
from the caisson/casing 1. In this manual release system the lifting cable 12 connects to a lifting
flange 12.1. The left side of Figure 11 shows the system when the drilling assembly 3 is locked
by latches 10 to latch holes 11 thus locking the two together. The lifting flange 12.1 has a lifting
bolt 12.3 which passes through an upper frame member or component of the drilling assembly
3, and is secured in place with an intervening compression spring 12.2, washer 12.4 and nut
12.5. The lifting flange 12.1 has a pivot connection 10.3 to pivotally connect the latch body 10.1,
and the latch body 10.1 is pivotally connected by pivot 10.2 to the mounting plate 10.4 which is
secured to the drilling assembly 3. Thus, according to the right hand side of Figure 11, when the
lift assembly 12 applies sufficient force to the lifting flange 12.1, so as to overcome the spring
force of the spring 12.2, this will move the bolt 12.3 upward relative to the drilling assembly 3,
which causes a rotation of the latch body 10.1 around relatively stationary pivot 10.2, thus
withdrawing the latch 10, out of latch hole 11, thus allowing the drilling assembly 3 being able to
be withdrawn from and relative to the caisson/casing 1.
[0277] Illustrated in Figure 12 is a caisson/casing 1 and drilling assembly 3, which is similar to
that of Figure 9, and like parts have been like numbered. The difference is that the drilling
assembly 3 is able to be moved downward relative to the caisson/casing 1, by means of spaced
hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders 100, which push or pull against the lifting frame 12, which is
held in place by the latches 10 in latch holes 11 in the caisson/casing 1. The same pushing and
pulling force could be provided by a similar apparatus external to the caisson or casing 1. At a
desired depth, the cylinders 100 are energised to extend so as to push (or pull) the drilling
assembly 3 downward. By retracting the cylinders 100, the caisson/casing 1 can be pulled
downward into the drilled hole. Then the drills active again, pushed downward by the extending
cylinders 100 etc.
[0278] It will be noted from Figures 1 to 11 that the body of the drilling assembly 3 is of a shape
and size which effectively, or substantially, closes off the opening formed by the inner periphery
P4943AU04

                                                  24
of the caisson or casing 1. This is the case whether the caisson or casing 1 is of a rectangular
or curved shape, or whether of a more complex shape such as an arc or T-shape.
[0279] It is to be noted, from the embodiments depicted, that there are two or more drilling
heads used to create an area that generally overlaps with the opening or footprint of a caisson
or casing having a single opening.
[0280] Figures 13.1 to 13.3 depict a method of grouting the vertical spaces between inserted
precast panels. Figure 13.1 shows a casing or caisson 1 which is advancing downwardly, aided
by the action of the drill bits 4. As discussed previously, once the drilling bits 4 and
caisson/casing 1 advance to the required depth, the drill bits 4 are retracted and removed. The
caisson or casing 1 supports any pre-existing sea-walls nearby or adjacent, while a preformed
structural panel 17 is inserted into the caisson/casing 1, before the caisson/casing 1 is removed.
When this process is repeated and a further panel is inserted adjacent the first panel, a gap in
the form of a vertical space 17.1 will be left between the panels 17.
[0281] To seal or close the gaps 17.1, the panels 17 will be grouted. To do this, a stocking 18 is
placed over a grout line 19 to be inserted in a gap 17.1 between the panels 17. The stocking 18
can be chosen from materials such as canvas, plastic, any appropriate nylon, or geo-textile. The
grout line 19 is then pushed to the bottom of the gap 17.1. As the grout material is being
pumped into the gap 17.1, the grout line 19 is withdrawn. As shown in Figure 13.2, the panels
17, on their vertical side edges, have grooves or formations. As the grout is pumped, the
material conforms to the space formed by the grooves or formations between adjacent panels
17, and forms a key 20 between adjacent panels 17.
[0282] Figures 14.1 to 14.3 depict a method of grouting the toes or lower portions of the
structural panels 17. The drilling assembly 3 and the caisson/casing 1 are larger than the panels
17. Therefore, after the caisson/casing 1 is withdrawn, the panel 17 is encapsulated by the
disturbed ground. Grouting the toes or lower portions of the panels 17 in the ground will
enhance the stability of the panels 17. A grout tube 21 is precast in each panel 17. The grout
tube 21 runs the whole length of height of the panel 17. Grout 22 is pumped into the grout tube
21. The grout 22 used for toe grouting generally has a specific gravity of approximately 2, which
is higher than the specific gravity of the disturbed, plasticised, worried, or fluidised portion of the
friable ground. As the grout 22 is denser than the disturbed, plasticised, worried, or fluidised
ground, the pumped grout will displace the disturbed ground to encapsulate the corresponding
panel 17. The grout 22 is pumped after the casing is taken out to at least the desired grout
height. The volume of the grout 22 to be pumped will therefore be determined by the difference
between the desired grout height multiplied by the difference between the cross sectional area
of the resulting hole and the cross sectional area of the panel. Once this is done, the grouting
procedure of Figures 13.1 to 13.3 can be employed to key in or lock adjacent panels together.

[0283] As shown in Figures 15.1 to 15.3, in some situations, one or more of the panels will be
placed over rocks or hard-ground 24 which is not friable or not friable enough. The
caisson/casing 1 will not sink into the hard ground 24. A panel 17 suitable for placement over
hard ground 24 can have cast into it a penetration 23, i.e. a through aperture. The penetration
23 is usually centrally located with respect to the panel 17. The rock cutting drill bit 4 is then
operated to drill a hole 25 into the hard ground 24 through the penetration 23, so that a hole 25
is drilled to coincide with the penetration 23. A reinforcement dowel 26 can be placed into the
hole 25, and grouted in place through the grout line 27 which extends to the bottom of the hole
25.
[0284] Any reinforcements are preferably of a non-corrodible type material, such as glass fibre,
reinforcing carbon fibre rods or stainless steel, etc.
[0285] Figures 16.1 to 16.6 depict securing or casting a capping beam 28 to the tops of the
structural panels 17. As shown in Figures 16.1 to Figure 16.3, the structural panels 17 can have
blind apertures or penetrations 29 accessible from the tops of the panels 17 Separate
reinforcement bars 30 adapted to be partially received by the blind apertures 29 are grouted into
place in the apertures 29. Alternatively, the panels 17 can have reinforcement bars 31 cast into
them. A capping beam 28 which has been pre-cast is then attached to the dowels 30, or
alternatively the capping beam is cast onto the dowels 30. The capping beam 28 will have holes
which correspond to the reinforcement bars 30, 31. The reinforcement bars 30, 31 are fitted into
the corresponding holes in the capping beam 28 as the capping beam 28 is attached. Figure
16.4 depicts the reverse scenario, where inserted dowels 30 or precast dowels 31 are provided
in a pre-cast capping beam 28. The capping beam 28 is then attached to the panels 17 which
have the required apertures to accept the dowels 30, 31.
[0286] More preferably, as shown in Figure 16.5, the capping beam 28 can cast directly into a
formwork provided around the tops of the panels 17, in which case the capping beam 28 will be
cast around the dowels 30, 31 and the panels 17. As shown in Figure 16.6, it is alternatively
possible to cast a capping beam 28 onto the panels 17 or attach a precast beam 28 to the
panels 17, and then drill securing bolts to secure the beam 28 and panels 17 together.
[0287] Figures 17.1 and 17.2 depict concrete caissons or casings 1 that are formed with
reinforcements 1.3 and that are left in situ rather than removed, after the drilling assembly 3 has
been retracted. The caissons are left as structural elements. The caisson/casing 1 may or may
not have a structural core. It can be left in situ as a structural element itself, or it may have a
cast in place concrete structural core 1.2 that is formed inside the caisson 1.
[0288] Referring to Figures 18.1 to 18.3, the panels 17 or capping beams 28 further include
anchoring ties 32 to stable land which is adjacent the panels 17. In Figure 18.1, holes are drilled
into the adjacent stable land to insert the ends of the ties that are distal from the panels 17. The
P4943AU04

                                                  26
proximal ends of the ties are bolted or otherwise secured to the capping beams 28 or panels 17.
The anchoring ties 32 helps secure the panels 17 against the weight of the friable land pushing
directly or indirectly against the panels 17. In Figure 18.2, the panels 17 are installed next to
wall members 17.2 which are pre-existing and deteriorating, with the panels 17 being put in
place to shore up or take over from the old pre-existing retaining panels 17.2. In this case, an
old anchor 32.2 is already in place and tied to adjacent land. An extension 32.1 is linked to the
old anchor 32.2 to extend the tie 32 to the capping beam 28 for the new panel 17. The
extension 32.1 can be precast into the beam 28, or the capping beam 28 for the new panel 17 is
post tensioned to the existing capping beam 28.2.
[0289] Figures 19.1 to 19.4 depict the movement of the bed dirt, mud, or other matter which is
displaced by the drilling assembly 3. As discussed before, as the drilling assembly 3 drills into
the friable ground, the weight of the caisson/casing 1 enables the caisson 1 to sink down to the
drilled level. As mentioned above, the caisson 1 is also able to sink because the cuttings tend to
be displaced upwards. Together the actions and weight of the drilling assembly 3 and caisson 1
progressively cause portions of the friable ground to become plasticised, which allows the
action of gravity to sink the caisson to a desired depth.
[0290] The assembly 3 and caisson 1 displace the disturbed or drilled matter 33, which tends to
accumulate upwards as shown in the arrows included in Figures 19.2 and 19.3. The arrows of
Figure 19.3 depict the process whereby, as the caisson and drilling assembly advance deeper
into the hole, more disturbed or drilled matter 33 is accumulated upwardly. The previously
displaced cuttings or matter is pushed upwards by newly displaced matter. Once the drill
assembly is retracted, and a structural element such as a panel 17 is inserted into the caisson
1, the caisson can be removed. Upon the removal of the caisson 1, the previously piled
displaced matter 33 (if toe grouting is not done) now flows downwardly, in the direction indicated
by the arrows in Figure 19.4, to fill the space vacated by the caisson 1. Due to the friable nature
of the environment, the drillings and cuttings are plasticized. Therefore, there is no requirement
to actively pump the bed matter out of the drilled hole to prevent blockage.
[0291] Referring to Figures 20.1 to 20.8, in some circumstances, the depth of the hole to be
drilled will be greater than the length or height of a caisson 1 that can be used with the drilling
equipment. In this situation, additional caissons 1' can be added to follow the initial or leading
caisson 1 which has been inserted or partially inserted into the hole, in an end-to-end fashion.
Here, the attachment of the caissons 1, 1' is done whilst the trailing edge of the first inserted
caisson 1 is still accessible. Preferably, the neighbouring caissons 1, 1' will be attached
together. This way, the plurality of caissons 1, 1' is able to be removed in a single operation.
The skilled person will appreciate that more caissons can be added for insertion into holes of
greater depths as needed.
P4943AU04

                                                  27
[0292] Figure 21 is a schematic view of one manner of attachment between neighbouring
caissons. As shown, the lower or leading caisson 1 has a rim, flange, bead, or generally a
projection 34 around its trailing edge. The adjacent, subsequently inserted caisson 1' which
trails the other caisson 1 includes a cooperating projection 35 at its leading edge. The
cooperating projection 35 includes a groove 36 which is adapted to receive the trailing
projection 34 of the previous caisson 1. The upper or subsequent caisson 1' is further
constructed from two halves 1-1, 1'-2, respectively having the grooves 36-1, 36-2. The two
halves V-1, 1'-2 are two vertical halves of the subsequent caisson 1'. The halves 1-1, 1-2 have
a vertical parting plane S and are initially spaced apart from each other. The vertical halves 1-1,
1-2 are moved toward the trailing edge of the first or previously inserted caisson 1, then closed
toward each other and onto the previously inserted caisson 1, so that the grooves 36-1, 36-2
together are fitted onto the projection 34, attaching the caissons 1, 1' together. The two vertical
haves 1'-1, 1'-2 of the subsequent caissons 1' can further be secured together by e.g. bolts. The
skilled person will appreciate that although the subsequent caissons or casings 1' are described
as having two half sections, they can each be constructed of three or more vertical sections,
and then assembled in the manner described above.
[0293] When the caissons 1, 1' need to be removed, the upper most caisson 1' is hooked or
otherwise attached to a lifting device, and then both caissons 1, 1' will be lifted together
because of the attachment between the caissons 1, 1'.
[0294] The caissons 1, 1' can have identical features - that is each caisson 1 has a leading
projection 35 and a trailing projection 34 as described above, and is constructed from two
vertical halves. This construction allows the subsequent caisson 1' to be added unhindered by
the support or cables for the drilling assembly. Alternatively, the skilled person will appreciate
that the first inserted caisson does not need to have a leading edge projection 35 or be
constructed from multiple sections.
[0295] While the preceding passages describe prior art systems, these systems are particularly
useful together with the following inventive aspects and embodiments, as described below with
respect to Figures 23 to 50.
[0296] In broad terms, the embodiments illustrated in Fig 24, Figure 28, Figures 32 to 34 and
Figure 51 to 62, all provide a caisson or casing 107 for installing a sheet 102 into a ground or
underwater location, the caisson 107having a shaped wall 107.1 which is open for a
predetermined length, which is adapted to receive and connect to an excavation means 3 within
the confines of the caisson or casing 107.
[0297] The shape of the shaped wall 107.1 will be dependent upon the sheet pile or other
retaining wall element that needs to be positioned in ground or under water location. The
shaped wall can be made from any number of wall segments needed to match the shape of the
P4943AU04

                                                28
sheet pile being installed. So, for the shaped wall 107.1 of Figure 24, there are segments 107.2
to 107.10, while shaped wall 107.1 of Figures 32 to 34 have segments 107.2 to 107.8, and the
shaped wall 17.1 in Figure 38, is made from three segments 107.2 to 107.4. In the case of the
Figures 24 and 32 to 34 shaped walls, these almost entirely match the shape of the sheet pile
102 being installed.
[0298] The shaped wall 107.1 has its free sides A and B each having a clutch, and a
connecting section 125 or 111, in the case of the systems of Figures 24, 30,38,50A and 69 is
provided which closes the caisson 107and or the shaped wall 107.1.
[0299] The connection section 125 or 111 (as seen in Figure 30) can have a first wall portion
125.1 with a mating clutch 125.2 and 125.4 to join with the clutches at the free sides A and B of
the shaped wall 107.1.
[0300] The connection section 125 of Figures 24 and 38 also include a second wall portion
125.10 which is at an angle to the first portion and which terminates in a third clutch 125.11
which is adapted to engage the free clutch at a side of a sheet 101 previously inserted in the
ground or underwater location.
[0301] The connection section 125, as in the case of Figure 38, is a sheet pile, which is
adapted, in use, to be separable from the shaped wall 107.1.
[0302] The connection section 125, in the case of Figure 38 has a first clutch 125.2 and a
second clutch 125.4, the first clutch 125.2 located at a side of the connection section 125 and
the second clutch 125.4 located intermediate the free sides 125.10 and 125.1 of the connection
section 125, so that the first and second clutches 125.2 and 125.4 are adapted to connect to the
two clutches at the free sides A and B of the shaped wall 107.1.
[0303] The connection section 125 has the third clutch 125.11 located at the other side of the
connection section 125 from the first clutch 125.2, with the third clutch 125.11 being adapted to
engage a free clutch being at a side of a sheet 101 previously inserted in the ground or
underwater location.
[0304] The third mating clutch 125.11 on the connection section 125, by being adapted to
engage a free clutch on a sheet 101 previously inserted in the ground or underwater location, is
adapted to act as a guide to guide the caisson or casing 107, and an excavation means 3
combined therewith, as excavation or drilling occurs.
[0305] The third clutch 125.11 is adapted to be located outside an excavation footprint 108 of
an excavation means which is at the end of the caisson or casing 107, but remains within the
excavation footprint 105 of the ground disturbed when placing sheet 101.

[0306] The caisson or casing 107, as best illustrated in Figures 24A, 30A and 39 have a
releasable locking mechanism 300 which allows releasable interconnection between the
connection section 125 and the shaped wall 107.1.
[0307] The locking mechanism 300 can include any lock mechanism, such as a pin means like
shear pin 126, which sits in aligned apertures passing through mating clutches on the shaped
wall 107.1 and the connection section 125, in which case it will be a clutch locking mechanism,
which can be removed when needed. The apertures can be of any appropriate shape, and the
pin can simply match that shape. However this is not preferred due to the importance of the
clutch allowing relative sliding motion. Alternatively, and more preferred, as illustrated in Figures
24A, 30A and 39 one of the connection section 125 or the shaped wall 107.1 can be provided
with a flange portion 125.13 provided to receive the removable pin 126. The locking mechanism
300 is preferably at the top and or bottom of both ends of the shaped wall 107.1 so that when it
is upended, a lock between the clutch on the shaped wall 107.1 and the sheet 102/103 can be
effected.
[0308] The caisson or casing 107 when combined with an excavation means 3 can be adapted
to allow the excavation means 3 to provide an excavation footprint 108 which can overlap an
excavation footprint 105 related to the sheet 101 previously inserted in the ground or
underwater location.
[0309] After the caisson or casing 107 has been positioned in the ground or underwater
location, the connection section 125 is separable from the shaped wall 107.1, by the
mechanisms described above.
[0310] The shaped wall 107.1 is adapted so that a sheet 102 can be made to engage the clutch
of a previous sheet 101, and pushed or hammered or vibrated into position.
[0311] The shaped wall 107.1 is removeable from the ground or the underwater location, after
the sheet 102 is positioned.
[0312] The drilling assembly as described in relation to Figures 1 to 22 can be combined with
the caisson or casing 107 of Figures 23 to 50.
[0313] The excavation means 3 substantially closes off an opening formed by an inner
periphery of the caisson or casing 107, even though in the embodiment of Figures 32 to 34,
there is an open side to the caisson or casing 107.
[0314] As best illustrated in Figures 24 and 38 there are multiple excavation means 109 used
for the caisson or casing opening.
[0315] The excavation means 109 excavates hard ground or drills hard ground, allowing the
caisson or casing 107 to be positioned to a predetermined or required depth.
P4943AU04

                                                 30
[0316] As the connection section 125 has to be separated from the shaped wall 107.1, there
needs to be provided means, such as releasable lock means 10 described above, which can
disconnect them. The connection section 125 preferably does not connect to the excavation
means 3 or releasably connected to the excavation means 3 or.
[0317] It may be preferred that the excavation means 109 to be associated with the caisson or
casing 107, be connected to or supported only by the shaped wall 107.1.
[0318] When installing the "first" sheet pile 101.1, as best illustrated in Figure 30, then either the
a first caisson 107shaped and sized specifically to accept the first sheet 101.1 can be utilised. In
a first example the sheet 101.1 will be a standard width sheet pile, and the caisson 107 of
Figure 30 having increased dimensions when compared to that of Figure 24 which is being used
to install a subsequent sheet pile. Alternatively the same caisson 107from Figure 24 can be
used, but a first sheet 101.1 can provided which has a reduced width, so that the sheet pile
101.1 fits within the caisson 107and connection piece 111.
[0319] As is described above in respect of Figures 1 to 22, the embodiments of Figures 23 to
50 are constructed so as to attach an excavation tool 3 within the lower end of the caisson 107.
The tool 3 is shaped to fit inside the caisson 107 being used. The tool 3 consists of two or more
drill bits (which may not be expandable) or two or more expandable drill bits 109 arranged so as
in their expanded state they excavate beyond the boundary of the caisson or casing 107.
[0320] The drill bits 109 are provided with a means of flushing the hole with a fluid. The fluid
may be, water, polymer, mud or any other suitable fluid. When rotated in the expanded state the
drill bits will allow the caisson107 to advance to the required depth, through hard ground,
without noise or vibration.
[0321] When the required depth is reached the expandable drill bits are returned to their
retracted state. In this state they are contained entirely within the caisson 107. The tool 3 can
then be detached and removed from the caisson 107.
[0322] When the tool 3 has been removed, in the manners described above with respect to
Figure 1 to 22, the first sheet 101 or101.1 can be placed to the correct depth inside the caisson
107.
[0323] When the first sheet 101 being full sized positioned by the caisson 107 or first sheet
101.1 being of reduced size positioned by the first caisson 107, is in place, then caisson 107, or
the first caisson 107, can be removed and a second caisson assembly 107 will now be required,
due to the change in shape of the sheet pile 102. The second caisson 107 is shaped so as to
accept the second sheet 102. The second caisson 107 is also shaped to fit the tool 3. The
second caisson 107 can be in two parts, a connecting section 125 and a main body or shaped
P4943AU04

                                                    31
wall 107.1. The connecting section 125 can be attached to the first sheet 101 or 101.1 by the
clutch and to the body by two clutches 125.2 and 125.4 or by other convenient means.
[0324] In the systems of Figures 23 to 37, the connecting section 125 of the caisson 107
attached to the first sheet 101 is removed leaving the body or shaped wall 107.1 of the caisson
107 in place.
[0325] With the connecting section 125 and the tool 3 removed, then a second sheet 102 can
be attached to the first sheet 101 and placed to the correct depth. With the second sheet 102 in
place the shaped wall 107.1 of the caisson 107 can be removed.
[0326] If in the installation of the piles a smaller first pile 101.1 is used then the first caisson can
now be re-used to install a third pile. Or if a First caisson and second caisson have already
been used, then a third caisson assembly 107 will now be required. It will be similar to the
second caisson 107 but a mirror image. This caisson 107 is shaped to fit the third sheet 103.
[0327] The third caisson, as described above is advanced, without noise or vibration, and the
tool 3 removed.
[0328] The third sheet 103 can be attached to the second sheet 102 and placed to depth. The
third caisson 107 can then be removed.
[0329] By repetition of the steps described above a sheet pile wall can be constructed in hard
ground without noise or vibration.
[0330] Those skilled in the art will understand that utilising several caissons 107 and possibly
multiple drilling tools 3 will slow down the installation process. Whereas it can be speeded up if
the process used a single tool and a single caisson assembly. The connecting section 125 of
the second caisson could be replaced by a blank part so that the assembly took the shape of
the first caisson, or something similar.
[0331] Alternatively, the shaped wall 107.1 can be constructed so that the second caisson
assembly 107 could be turned upside down, thereby allowing it to take the shape needed for the
of the third caisson assembly. Likewise if the tool 3 is constructed symmetrically about its minor
axis it will fit both a right hand and a left hand caisson.
[0332] Those skilled in the art will understand that sheets can be fabricated with the clutch
misaligned. This will allow the next sheet to be placed at an angle to the XX axis. By this
method sheet pile walls, other than straight can be constructed.
[0333] After the sheet piles 101,102 103 etc. have been placed in position, the base of the
sheets 101,102 103 etc. can be grouted into the hole that has been drilled. A polymer or
bentonite drill fluid will greatly assist this process. This grouting should take place some
P4943AU04

                                                  32
distance behind the advancing pile wall under construction and should not be allowed to
impinge on the drilling of the caisson for the next sheet.
[0334] While the following description is in respect of one section of sheet pile it will be readily
understood that the present invention can be applied to other sections.
[0335] While the following description is in respect of placing one sheet at a time it will be
readily understood that the present invention can be applied to install multiple sheets at one
time.
[0336] Figure 23 shows three sheets 101, 102 and 103 connected by clutches 104. The sheet
pile 101, 102 and 103 in this instance is Larsson type 755 sheet pile. For the purpose of this
description the sheets 101, 102 and 103 are to be installed in numerical order. The longitudinal
axis XX is shown for reference
[0337] Figure 24 shows the first sheet 101 in place. The boundary of the ground disturbed or
drilled during the installation of the first sheet 101 is shown by the intermittent line 105. The
connecting section 125 of the caisson 107 attaches to the first sheet 101 by clutch 125.11 which
connects to the clutch 104 on the first sheet 101. The other end of connection piece 125
connects to the body or shaped wall 107.1 of the caisson 107 by two clutches 125.2 and 125.4
to the clutches at the ends A and B.
[0338] In Figure 24, a drilling tool 3 is shown attached inside the caisson 107. The attachment
of the tool 3 to the caisson 107 is not shown, but is as described above in relation to Figures 1
to 22. Four drills 109 with expandable drill bits are located within the tool 3. The boundary 108 is
the limit of the ground disturbed by the drill bits 109 in their expanded state. It should be noted
that the connection section 125 has its clutch 125.11 beyond the boundary of the disturbed
ground 108 but it is inside the boundary of the previously disturbed ground 105.It should also be
noted that the boundary 108, that is, the limit of the expanded bits, passes close to, but does
not interfere with the first sheet 101. The tool 3 is symmetrical about the minor axis YY. The
inner void of the caisson 107 is shaped to match the symmetry about the axis YY, but is not
actually symmetrical. This relationship and arrangement allows the caisson 107 and the tool 3
to be used when the caisson 107 is in a mirror reverse configuration. This will be necessary to
place sheet 103.
[0339] For the purpose of the following description the caisson 107 will be viewed along the YY
axis from the point it coincides with the XX axis. Figure 24 is thus described as a caisson 107
with a right hand interconnection. A caisson 107 with a left hand connection will be required to
place sheet 103.The caisson 107 with the tool 3 attached and the expanding bits 109 in their
expanded state, extending to the boundary 108, can now be drilled to the required depth.

                                                  33
[0340] Figure 25 shows the caisson 107 after it has been drilled to the required depth and the
interconnecting section 125 removed. The tool 3 has been collapsed so that it is now contained
within the caisson 107. In this state the tool 3 can be detached and removed from the caisson
107.
[0341] Figure 26 shows the caisson 107 with both the interconnecting section 125 and the tool
3 removed. The caisson 107 can now accept sheet 102.
[0342] Figure 27 shows the second sheet 102 connected to the first sheet 101 inside the empty
caisson 101. The sheet 102 can then be pushed to the correct depth. The caisson 107 can then
be removed.
[0343] Figure 28 shows the second sheet 102 connected to the first sheet 101 and the caisson
107 removed.
[0344] Figure 29 is similar to Figure 24 but the assembly is now a caisson 107 with a left hand
interconnection shaped to accept sheet 103. The change in handedness can be provided either
by turning both the caisson 107 and the connection piece 125 upside down or it could be a
purpose built caisson. Note that because the void in the caisson 107 is symmetrical about the
YY axis, the tool being also symmetrical about the YY axis will fit inside the caisson 107 as
before, once it has been rotated through 180 degrees.
[0345] The process of drilling the caisson 107 to the correct depth, removing the connection
piece 125, detaching and removing the tool 3, placing the next sheet 103 and removing the
caisson 107 can now be repeated.
[0346] Figure 30 shows the caisson 107 with a blank connection piece 111 in place drilled to
depth and the tool 3 removed. This caisson 107 can be manufactured in one piece but in this
configuration it could be used to place the first sheet 101. The purpose of the blank connection
piece 111 is so the caisson 107, in conjunction with the tool 3, can be used to place sheets 101
and subsequently with connection piece 125 of earlier Figures, used to place the second sheet
102 and third sheet 103. The fabricated first sheet 101 is shown inside the caisson 107. The
caisson 107 and the connection 111 can be withdrawn leaving the sheet 101 in place to the
correct depth.
[0347] Figure 31 shows the closure of a sheet pile wall. A fabricated sheet pile piece 114 is
used to connect sheet 112 to the last full sheet 113 both positioned in the ground. The
fabricated connecting piece 114 is able to be placed because the disturbed ground shown by
the intermittent lines 115 and 116 overlap. To arrive at this position sheet 113 may have to be
fabricated with a reduced width as sheet 101 or 101.1 in Figure 30.
[0348] Figure 32 is similar to Figure 27 except it shows a caisson 107 shaped to accept a
different sheet pile section, in this instance Larsson type ZK 675 sheet pile. The caisson 107 is
P4943AU04

                                                     34
shown with the connecting piece 125 removed. The sheet 102 is shown connected to the
previously placed sheet 101.
[0349] Figure 33 shows a caisson 107 shaped to accept Larsson type ZK 675 sheet pile. This
caisson 101 is open sided, with no connecting piece being used. In certain types of ground this
may be possible.
[0350] Figure 34 shows a caisson 107 shaped to accept Larsson ZK 755 sheet pile. This
caisson 107 is open sided, in that between the ends A and B it is open, but are shaped to be
directed inwardly to the sheet pilel 01, to more closely fit to the previously placed sheet 101. If
desired, the sheet pile 101 can have welded or attached locating blocks or locating flanges
101.2 and 101.3, so as to provide a guide for the inward ends A and B to travel between. In
certain types of ground this may be possible, and is expected to work effectively, when the
sheet pile is installed shortly after the drilling has been completed.
[0351]          As can be seen from the above description, in broad terms there is described a
method of inserting a sheet or sheet pile 102, 103, the method including: providing a caisson or
casing 107 as described above; providing an excavation means 3 which is expandable to
excavate and retractable to within the confines of the caisson or casing 107; utilizing an earlier
installed sheet pile 101, 101.1 a drilling guide or if the caisson or casing is open, overlapping the
excavation area of the new sheet pile 102 with that of the earlier installed sheet pile 101;
installing a sheet pile 102 or 103 by means of the caisson or casing.
[0352]          The method described above includes the use of a connection section 125 or
111 to close the caisson or casing or shaped wall 107.1.
[0353]          The connection section 125 enables the caisson or casing 107 to be guided by
the earlier installed sheet pile 101. As illustrated in Figure 50A it can be seen that the
connection section 125 could also be constructed from a V-shaped type of construction where
the free legs include the clutches 125.2 and 125.4, and the vertex of the V has the clutch 125.11
extending from it.
[0354]          The connection section 125 as in the case of the embodiment of Figure 38 also
acts as a sheet pile 102 and remains in the ground or underwater location.
[0355] Figure 35 shows previously placed sheet 101 which has penetrated a hard layer of
ground 117. The caisson 107 attached to sheet 101 has drilled through the hard ground 117
and with the tool 3 (not shown) removed, and can now accept the next sheet 102 (not shown on
the drawing). Once placed through the hard ground inside the caisson 107, the sheet 102 can
be placed to depth by conventional means- that is, this apparatus is such that it does not require
the caisson 107 to move down further. Ground level 118 is shown.
P4943AU04

                                                  35
[0356] Figure 36 shows a caisson 107 which has drilled through a layer of soft ground 121 and
then into a hard sea bed 119. Water level 120 is shown
[0357] Figure 37 shows the sheet pile 102 which has been place through the caisson 107.After
the caisson 107 has been removed grout 122 can be pumped to the bottom of the drilled hole in
the seabed 119. The sheet 102 is now grouted into the drilled hole in the seabed 119. The pile
102 is now able to support the ground 121. Up to ground level 11 8.Water level 120 is shown.
[0358] Illustrated in Figure 38 is another sheet pile installation system and method.
[0359] The caisson 107 is effectively constructed in two halves. The first half being a shaped
wall 107.1 to accept the drilling tool 3. The second half being a connection section 125, which
will also be the sheet 102 to be installed. A clutch 125.4, or other means of attachment, must be
adhered or riveted in the case of some sheet pile material, or welded if steel or aluminium, or by
sheet bolts in the case of GFRP, to one side of the connection piece 125 or sheet to be
installed. The first half 107.1 of the caisson 107 will attach to the second half 125 by this clutch
and the existing clutch on the other side. The two halves now forming one caisson can be
attached to the clutch 104 of the previously placed adjacent sheet 101, by means of the clutch
125.11 located on the end of the sheet pile 125/102. As before the drilling tool 3 is shaped to fit
inside this caisson 107.
[0360] Figure 38 shows a section of clutch 125.4 welded to one side of the sheet to be placed
102. This clutch 125.4 can be continuous or it can be intermittently present and engaging
depending upon the application. The sheet to be placed 102 is attached to the previously placed
adjacent sheet 101. The shaped wall 107.1 or caisson half is attached to the sheet 102 to be
placed by both the welded clutch section 125.4 and the existing clutch on the other side. The
two halves now form one caisson. Inside this caisson107 is the drilling tool 3 with four
expandable drills 109, with the drilling tool 3 being attached to the lower end of the caisson 107.
When the drilling tool 3 is in the expanded state the boundary of the ground disturbed 108 is
beyond the caisson 107. The caisson 107 can now be drilled to depth. When the caisson 107
has been drilled to the correct depth the expandable drill bits 109 can be collapsed. When the
bits 109 have been collapsed both the drilling tool 3 and the caisson half or shaped wall 107.1
can be withdrawn separately or in unison. The result being that the sheet 102 has been
positioned in the required place.
[0361] The caisson half or shaped wall 107.1 is then upended and combined or attached to the
next sheet 103 not shown on the drawing. As the drilling tool 3 is symmetrical about the YY
axis, after it is rotated through 180 degrees, it can again be attached to the lower end of the
caisson and the drilling process repeated.
[0362] As described earlier, the excavation means 3 is detachably attached to the caisson 107
or the shaped wall 107.1, and is preferably a drilling tool 3 comprised of two or more drill bits
P4943AU04

                                                   36
109, such as expandable drill bits. In the expanded state the drilling tool 3 excavates beyond all,
or substantially all, of the boundary of the lower end of the caisson 107. In the collapsed state
the drilling tool 3 is contained wholly within the foot print of the hole or aperture through the
lower end of the caisson 107. The excavation means 3 is positioned so as to close off all, or
substantially all, of the lower end of the caisson 107. The excavation means 3 being detachably
connected to the caisson 107 ensures that when attached to the caisson 107, the caisson 107
will advance as the tool 3 drills. When the drilling tool 3 is detached it can be removed from the
caisson 107. The excavation means 3 will generally be provided with or connected to a source
of flushing air, water, polymer, mud or a combination of any 2 or more of these.
[0363] Illustrated in Figures 41 to 50 is an excavation means 3 for use with a caisson or casing
1 so as to drill in front of the leading edge of the caisson or casing 1, particularly in hard ground.
The excavation means has a body to mount at least two excavation tools 133 so that the two
excavation tools 133 are distanced or spaced from each other so that the outside diameter 134
of excavation of the tools 133 are spaced from each other so that when the body 3 is rotated
through 180 degrees, a series of overlapping excavations will result. The excavation means
includes a detachable connection, as described above, to a caisson or casing with which it will
be used. The advantage of the excavation means 3 is the ability to drill a shaped hole with less
drill bits.
[0364] The excavation means 3 is a drilling tool or drilling tool assembly, and can include
expandable drilling bits, and there can be an even or an odd number of bits or excavation tools
133, as is illustrated in Figures 91 and 92, or a single excavation tool 133 as illustrated in
Figures 95 and 96. It will be noted in the case of the excavation or drilling assemblies 3 of
Figures 41, 42, 91, 92, 95 and 96, that there is located one excavation tool 133 close to a side
wall of the drilling assembly so as to be close to the side wall of the caisson or casing 1, but
there is a larger spacing to the opposite side wall, from the only or last excavation tool 133.
[0365] In summary, Figures 43 to 50 show a method of drilling a caisson or casing 1, the
method including the steps of: providing a caisson or casing 1; attaching to the caisson or
casing an excavation means 3; advancing the excavation means 3 to excavate ground beneath
the excavation means 3; withdrawing the excavation means 3 from the caisson or casing;
rotating the excavation means through 180 degrees; reattaching the excavation means 3 to the
caisson or casing 1; advancing the excavation means 3 to excavate ground beneath the
excavation means 3 to produce a series of overlapped excavations into which the caisson or
casing 1 can positioned.
[0366]           The following will describe Figures 41 to 50 in more detail.
[0367]           Figure 41 illustrates a plan view of an alternative caisson 1 with a main body of a
drilling assembly 3 located inside. The assembly 3 has two expanding drills 133, in their

                                                  37
collapsed state, attached. The attachment of the drills 133 is asymmetrical. It will be noted that
the caisson 1, is similar to that of Figures 1 and 2 above, except that in Figures 1 and 2 above
show three drills 4, whereas the caisson 1 of Figures 41 to 50 has only two expandable drills
133 which are spaced apart, so that when rotated by 180 degrees, a series of four bores 134
and 135, as depicted in Figure 42, will be drilled.
[0368]            Figure 42 shows the same plan view as that of Figure 41, when the expanding
drills 133 are expanded to their outer diameter 134 in their expanded state. The broken circles
135 illustrate the holes to be drilled next, once the drill tool 3 has been removed from the
caisson, then rotated through 180 degrees, and drilling begins again.
[0369]           Illustrated in Figures 43 to 50 is a schematic representation of the drilling
process. Figures 43 and 44 is a schematic side elevation and a plan view respectively of a
caisson 1 containing a drill assembly 3 with the expanding drills 133 in their collapsed state,
which have not yet been locked to the caisson 1, and have not yet arrived into the position for
the drill 3 and caisson to be detachably secured together. In the position of Figure 43, the
assembly 3 is ready to advance to the drilling location.
[0370]           Figures 45 and 46 are similar to Figures 43 and 44, and show the drill assembly
3 after it has advanced, and with the drills in the expanded state. Once Drilling occurs, two
holes will be drilled which coincide with the drilling diameter circles of Figure 46, and the holes
will be spaced apart, whereby only part of the periphery of the caisson 1 will have a drilled holed
underneath its leading edge.
[0371]          Once the two holes have been drilled, the caisson and drill assembly of Figures
45 and 46will then have the drill bits collapsed and the drill tool 3 removed from the caisson 1.
The drill tool 3 once out of the caisson is then rotated through 180 deg. When viewed in plan
view and placed back into the caisson 1, ready to be advanced.
[0372]           Figures 47 and 48 shows the caisson and drill assembly 1 and 3 after the drill
tool 3 has been advanced the second time. The drills 3 are then returned to their collapsed state
and the caisson 1 advanced.
[0373]           Figures 49 and 50 shows the caisson 1 advanced and the drill tool or assembly 3
collapsed ready to repeat the steps of Figures 43 to 50, but starting on the right side of the
caisson.
[0374]           Illustrated in Figures 51 to 57 is a sheet pile placement method and apparatus,
similar to that described above. In this method the first sheet pile 101 is in position to a required
depth in hard ground 119 having also passed through soft bed 121. It is called "first" only for the
sake of ease of description, as it will be seen in Figure 51 that the first sheet pile 101 connects
to an even earlier unnumbered sheet pile. It will also be noted in Figure 51, that the hard ground
P4943AU04

                                                     38
to the right of the base of the sheet pile 101 has been excavated by the earlier used excavation
tool.
[0375]            The second sheet pile 102 is connected to sheet pile 101 by their respective
clutches, and the sheet pile 102 is pushed down through the soft layer 121 until its base
reaches the start of the hard ground layer 119, as in Figures 51 and 52.
[0376]            In Figure 53 a shaped wall 107.1 and drill assembly 3, are assembled together
with a trailing leg 3.1 which is preferably connected to the drilling assembly 3, but may be
extending from the shaped wall 107.1. The shaped wall 107.1 has clutches 125.2 and 125.4 to
engage clutches provided on the sheet pile 102 (such as described above in relation to Figure
38), with the drilling bits 109, which are schematically represented by a single bit, being
operated without expanding, and "drilling" through the soft bed 121, until it reaches the hard
ground 119.
[0377]            As seen in Figured 54, once the hard ground 119 is engaged, the expanding bits
continue to drill, until they pass sufficiently the lower end of the sheet 102, and then they are
reversed and they slowly expand outwardly as they drill and undercut the leading edge of the
sheet 102. The point at which the expanding bits 109 can be reversed and expanded is when
an engagement end 3.2 on the trailing leg 3.1, engages the top edge 102.9 because the
distance between the end 3.2 and the drill bit 109 has been set for the height of the sheet 102.
[0378]            The end 3.2 also has the advantage that as the drill assembly 3 moves down the
sheet pile 102, all the while being guided by the sheet 101, the sheet 102 follows the drill
assembly 3 downward until, drilling is finished as in Figure 55. Whereupon the drill assembly
and shaped wall 107.1 and leg 3.1 and end 3.2 are withdrawn as in Figure 56, and the sheet
pile 202 grouted in place (once a further sheet along the wall has been installed), and then
eventually as in Figure 57 the ground level side 118, can be back filled to complete the wall
construction.
[0379]            This arrangement of Figures 51 to 57 has the advantage that the shaped wall
107.1 does not need to be locked to the sheet 102 by means of the clutches that are engaged,
making the process quicker. Additionally the caisson or casing 107 formed by the shaped wall
107.1 and sheet 102, at the base of the sheet 102, assists to ensure that soft bed 121 does not
rush to fill in the excavation foot print. It will be noted that the Shaped wall 107.1 is of a height
greater than the depth of soft bed 121 and the depth of drilling into hard ground, thus keeping
out soft bed material while drilling is occurring
[0380]            Illustrated in Figures 58 to 62 is a sheet pile placement method and apparatus,
similar to that described above. In this method the first sheet pile 101 is in position to a required
depth in hard ground 119 having also passed through soft bed 121. It is called "first" only for the
sake of ease of description, as it will be seen in Figure 58 that the first sheet pile 101 connects
P4943AU04

                                                    39
to an even earlier unnumbered sheet pile. It will also be noted in Figure 58, that the hard ground
to the right of the base of the sheet pile 101 has been excavated by an earlier used excavation
tool.
[0381]           In the method of Figure 58 to 62, as in Figures 58 and 59, a drilling assembly 3
and shaped wall 107.1 are operatively connected to a sheet pile 102, so that the drilling bits 109
when expanded are below the leading edge of the caisson 107 formed at the lower section of
the sheet 102 by the joining of the shaped wall 107.1 to the sheet pile 102, by one of the means
described above The height of the shaped wall is provided so that it is higher than the depth to
be drilled in hard ground 119 plus the depth of the soft bed 121.
[0382]           In Figures 58 to 62, the drill bits 109 are schematically represented by a single
drill bit 109. At the top 102.9 of the sheet 102 is a conventional sheet pile installation tool or
piling equipment 139, which will drive the sheet pile 102 and drill assembly and shaped wall
107.1 through the soft bed 121, until hard ground 119 is encountered. The shaped wall 107.1
and drill assembly are joined together, and the assembly of them is connected to the sheet 102
by a releasable latch mechanism 10 (such as that described above), which is shown I the
locked condition in Figure 59.
[0383]           Thus as the piling equipment 139 pushes the sheet 102 into the soft bed 121, so
too does the shaped wall and drilling assembly follow. If needed depending upon the "viscosity"
of the soft bed 121, the unexpanded bits in the drill assembly can be rotated in an unexpanded
condition to help clear the path for the shaped wall 107.1 and the drilling assembly 3.
[0384]           Once hard rock is reached the bits 109 are rotated so as to expand under the
leading edge of the shaped wall 107.1 and the sheet pile 102, and continues to drill until the
required depth is reached, as illustrated in Figure 60. At this point, as illustrated in Figure 61,
the sheet 102 is at its required depth, and the piling equipment 139, by means of lifting
assembly 12, and the disengagement of latch 10, lifts the drilling assembly 3 with the drill bits
unexpanded and shaped wall 107.1, up along the sheet 102 and out ready for the next sheet.
Then as in Figure 62, grout 122 can be installed in both the soft bed 121 and hard ground layers
119, and the ground level 118 back filled to the wall so produced, but usually a few sheet back if
back filling is progressing at the same time as pile placement is occurring.
[0385]           Illustrated in Figures 63 to 74, is a sheet pile installation method and apparatus
similar to that of Figures 24 and 29, except that the caisson or casing 107 and its shaped wall
107.1 has a modified shape, and the connection section125 too is modified in shape.
Additionally the drilling assembly 3 has some 5 drills to insert a sheet pile 102.
[0386]           Illustrated in Figure 63, the caisson 107 of Figure 69 is combined by a latch 10 to
the drilling assembly 3, preferably before insertion into the water 120. The caisson 107 and drill
assembly 3 are then sunk to the hard ground layer 119 through soft bed 121. This can be done
P4943AU04

                                                  40
by pushing through the soft bed 121 or simply rotating the non-expanding drill bits 109 until hard
bed 119 is reached, as illustrated in Figure 64.
[0387]          As illustrated in Figure 65, the latch 10 is released allowing the drilling assembly
to continue drilling through the caisson 107, until the desired depth of placement has been
reached. It will be noted from Figures64 and 65 that the height of the caisson 107 is greater
than the depth below water level 120 of the hard rock layer 119. By this means water and softer
bed 121 do not go back into the caisson protected area.
[0388]          Once drilling to the required depth is completed, the drilling assembly 3 and latch
10 can be removed from the caisson 107, as is illustrated in Figure 66, and then as in Figure 67,
the next sheet pile 102 joined to the earlier pile 101, and slid into position inside the caisson
107. The caisson 107 can then be withdrawn. Then as in Figure 68, after the installation of
sheets has progressed, the base hole can be grouted and the ground level back filled at
appropriate time in the installation process.
[0389]          As best illustrated in Figure 69 the caisson 107 used in Figures 63 to 68 has a
shape to receive 5 drills 109 which are non-expanding drill bit, and will have an excavation p
footprint that will allow a sheet pile 102 to be installed before the caisson is removed, and after
the drill assembly is disconnected and removed from the shaped wall 107.1. It will be noted that
the connection section 125 has a curved wall shape at the ends of which are clutches 125.2 and
125.4, and at an intermediate location is attached clutch 125.11. It will be noted that he left hand
most drill 109, has its left most excavation footprint overlapping the earlier drill footprint 105
associated with installed first sheet pile 101.
[0390]          The connection section 125 is removed immediately before the sheet pile 102 is
to be inserted as in Figure 67, in which case the arrangement of Figure 70 is adopted where the
drilling assembly 3 has been removed and overleaping footprints 105 and 108 are present,
leaving a generally open space for insertion of the second sheet pile 102 to be inserted in the
caisson 107 by joining respective clutches to sheet 101, as illustrated in Figure 71.
[0391]          Then, as in Figure 72, the caisson 107 is removed, being a step between Figure
67 and 68, the sheet piles 101 and 102 are sitting in their respective excavation foot prints. This
will allow the sheet pile 101 to be grouted into position, while the caisson 107 (or the shaped
wall 107.1 and the connection section 125) on the surface has been up-ended (that is rotated
around a horizontal axis) and the drill assembly 3 has been rotated through 180 degrees around
a vertical axis and re-assembled to begin to repeat the steps of Figures 63 to 68, this time
appropriately oriented for the placement of sheet pile 103, as is illustrated in Figure 73. The
repeating of steps 63 to 68 will produce a wall segment as illustrated in Figure 74, whereby the
excavation foot print will have been grouted with grout 122 to secure the respective piles
101,102 and 103 into their holes.

[0392]           Illustrated in Figures 75 and 76 is a method and apparatus for installing slidingly
interlocking concrete panels 17, which have a male key 17.3 and female key or recess 17.4 at
opposite ends. The method and apparatus is similar to that described previously in relation to
sheet piles, and employs a generally rectangular open shaped wall 107.1, which can be closed
off by a connection section 125 as illustrated in Figure 76.. The connection section 125 has a
male key portion 125.13, which will engage recess 17.4 on an earlier positioned panel 17 to
guide the drilling process. The drill assembly 3, will include expanding drill bits to drill ahead of
the leading edge of the caisson 107, forming excavation footprint 108 which will overlap with the
previously drilled footprint 105. Then like the method of Figures 63 to 68, the connection section
125 is removed, and the next panel 17can lowered into positon to join up with the earlier
installed panel 17.
[0393]           Illustrated in Figure 77 is another method and apparatus for installing a concrete
panel 17, similar to that of Figure 75, except that no connection section 125 is used. Instead the
shaped wall 107.1 simply has an open end in which the right hand side of panel 17 can be
located to assist with the guidance of the drilling process. As the shaped wall 107.1 is longer
than in Figure 75, the footprint 108 will readily overlap with foot print 105, allowing another panel
17 to be installed.
[0394]           Illustrated in Figure 78 is a method and apparatus similar to that of Figure 77,
except that the concrete panel 17 includes a vertical channel or recess 140 on each side of the
panel 17 near to the end of the panel 17 which has the recess 17.4. The recess 140 is a guide
recess to receive the turned in ends of the shaped wall 107.1, and in this way to act to assist in
the guiding of the drilling process.
[0395]           Illustrated in Figures 79 to 82 is method and apparatus for installing concrete
panels 17, which are similar to that of Figure 78, in that at one end they have vertical guide
recesses 140 near one end, but are not interlocking. Additionally, the drilling assembly 3, does
not utilise expandable bits, that is drilling occurs only within the confines of the shaped wall
107.1. the drill bits 109 are located at different heights as shown in Figure 80, and as in Figure
81, once the drilling assembly 3 has been removed, allowing a seme shaped panel 17 to be
dropped into place in the shaped wall 107.1, abutting the previously inserted concrete panel 17.
While no joining of adjacent panel 17 may be done under water, a capping beam 28 as
described above, and other joining can be done above water level once the shaped wall 107.1
has also been removed as in the case of Figure 82, where the panels 17 are ready to be
capped.
[0396]           In the case of each of the methods and apparatus of Figures 75 to 82, it is
preferred to disconnect the drilling assembly 3 from the shaped wall 107.1, and to take out the
drilling assembly 3 before dropping in the next panel 17. This allows the shaped wall 107.1 to
P4943AU04

                                                   42
keep out soft bed 121 from lowing into the drilled hole. However, if the apparatus of Figures 75
to 78 were used to drill into hard ground 119 only, that is there was not present a soft bed 121,
the shaped wall 107.1 and the drill assembly 3 can be removed together, thereby saving time by
saving process steps.
[0397]           In broad terms, as illustrated in Figures 83 to 88 is an excavation means 3 and a
caisson or casing 1 for insertion into soft bed or friable ground, with the excavation means 3
being able to excavate inside the opening or opening footprint of said caisson or casing 1. The
excavation means 3 having a body to mount at least two excavation tools 4.2 or 4.2' so that a
series of overlapping excavations 108 will result. The excavation means 3 includes a
detachable connection to said caisson or casing 1.
[0398]           There are one or a multiple number of excavation tools 4.2 or 4.2' illustrated in
Figures 83 to 88, in this case two, which are distanced from each other so that the outside
diameter of excavation of the tools are spaced from each other so that when the body of the
drilling assembly 3 is rotated through 180 degrees, the excavation that occurs producing an
overlapped excavation footprint 108. However, as illustrated in Figures 89 and 90, there can be
an odd number of tools 4.2 or 4.2', or as is shown in Figures 93 and 94, a single excavation
tool. It will be noted in the case of the excavation or drilling assemblies 3 of Figures 83 to 88,
90, 91, 93 and 94, that there is located one excavation tool 4.2, 4.2' close to a side wall of the
drilling assembly 3 so as to be close to the side wall of the caisson or casing 1, but there is a
larger spacing to the opposite side wall, from the only or last excavation tool 4.2,4.2'.
[0399]           The excavation means can be a drilling tool or drilling tool assembly 3.
[0400]           The excavation means 3 can includes: only expandable drilling bits 4.2; or only
non-expanding drill bits 4.2'; or a combination of expanding 4.2 and non-expanding 4.2' where
the expanding drill bits 4.2 when expanded have the same outside diameter of the non
expanding drill bits 4.2'.
[0401]           There is also described a method of drilling a caisson or casing 1 in a soft bed or
friable ground, whereby the method includes the steps of: providing a caisson or casing 1 and
an excavation means or assembly 3 as described in the preceding four paragraphs. The
method then allows for activating the excavation means 3 to excavate ground beneath said
excavation means 3 so as to produce a series of overlapped excavations 108 within the
opening or opening footprint of the caisson or casing 1, whereby the soft bed or friable ground
allows the caisson or casing and the excavation means or drill assembly to move through it.
[0402]           Describing now in more detail, illustrated in Figures 83 to 85 is another caisson
or casing 1 and drilling assembly 3, which is similar to that of figures 1 and 2 described above,
except that there are four drill bits 4.2 which are expandable, but when expanded, are fully
within the internal periphery of opening footprint of the caisson or casing 1. The bits 4.2 are
P4943AU04

                                                     43
arranged or spaced so that when expanded as in Figure 84, they overlap, and occupy different
height positions as depicted in Figure 85. It will be noted from Figure 84 that the overlapping of
the drilling bits 4.2 occupies a substantial surface area of the footprint of the opening of the
caisson or casing 1. Whereas when the drill bits 4.2 are contracted or retracted, they occupy the
smaller diameter circles in Figure 83, and this is reflected illustrated in the side view of Figure
85. This caisson 1 and drilling assembly 3, is meant to perform its drilling operation wholly within
the confines of the caisson's opening or opening footprint, and is particularly suitable where soft
bed material is encountered or needs to have a for example a pre-case concrete panel 17, as
depicted in Figure 88.
[0403]           Illustrated in Figure 86 and 87 is a caisson or casing 1 and drilling assembly 3,
which is similar to that of Figures 83 to 85, except that the drill bits 4.2' are not expandable. In
that respect it is also similar to the caisson and drilling assembly of Figure 79, except that the
caisson 1 of Figure 86 has a fully bounded rectangular caisson or casing and thus does not
directly act or be guided by the previous panel 17 whereas caisson or casing 107 of Figure 79
has a shaped wall with an open section to interact with the previous panel 17. The drill bits 4.2'
overlap each so that they are fully within the internal periphery of opening footprint of the
caisson or casing 1. The bits 4.2' are arranged or spaced so they overlap, and occupy different
height positions as depicted in Figure 85. It will be noted from Figure 86 that the overlapping of
the drilling bits 4.2' occupies a substantial surface area of the footprint of the opening of the
caisson or casing 1.
[0404]           While not illustrated, if desired, the caisson 1 can have on its outer wall a shaped
formation to engage the keyway formed at the end of the previously installed panel 17, so that
the previous panel can guide the caisson or assist in locating it. Even without such a shaped
guide formation, the abutting of the outside of eth caisson 1 with eth end of the previously
installed panel 17, helps to space and or locate the caisson 1 while drilling occurs.
[0405]           While the embodiments of Figures 83 and 86 show expandable bits 4.2 and non
expandable bits 4.2', it will be understood that a combination of expandable and non
expandable can be utilised, providing the outer diameter of the expandable bit is equal to or
approximately equal to that of the non-expandable bit's diameter.
[0406]           The caisson or casings 1 and drilling assemblies 3 of Figures 83 and 86 will both
produce an excavation foot print 108 as illustrated in Figure 88, which is sized so as to receive a
pre-cast concrete panel 17 therein, which is spaced from the earlier panel 17 on the left of
Figure 88. Once the caisson 1 is removed the space between adjacent panels 17 can be
grouted or interlocking join piece inserted into the gap between the panels 17 to complete the
shoring wall, as described above with respect to Figure 13 to Figure 16.
P4943AU04

                                                   44
[0407]            In respect of the embodiments of Figure 83 and 86, a typical outer diameter of
the drill bits 4.2 when expanded or the bits 4.2' is 290mm, with the first centre of rotation being
spaced about 15)mm from the inside end wall of the caisson or side wall of its opening.
Whereas the spacing between centres of rotation of the drill bits are about 208mm apart, with
the caisson 1 having an opening, or opening footprint, of about 940mm by 315mm, so as to
provide an excavation footprint 108 which will receive a panel 17 of 175mm x 850mm.
[0408]            It will be noted that the improvement described above with respect to Figure 41
and 42 can be applied to the embodiments of figures 83 and 86, in that a drilling assembly have
two appropriately spaced drill bits 4.2 or 4.2', for locating at the first and third positions from the
left of Figures 83 and 86 can be provided, and so that once drilling of two holes has occurred
the drilling assembly can be removed and rotated around a vertical axis through 180 degrees,
and then the holes at the second and fourth positions from the left drilled.
