                     SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR RESERVE PARACHUTE DEPLOYMENT
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
              [01]         This application is a Non-Provisional Patent Application that claims the benefit to
U.S. Provisional Patent Application Number 61/868,096 filed on August 21, 2013, and incorporated
by reference herein in its entirety.
FIELD
              [02]         Disclosed embodiments relate to parachutes, and more particularly to a deployment
system and method for a parachute deployment. The disclosed embodiments more particularly
relate to a system and method for parachute deployment that minimizes the time and altitude loss
required to deploy the reserve parachute.
BACKGROUND
              [03]         Reserve parachutes have been used as a back-up parachute to an original main
parachute. When reserve parachutes were initially used, however, they would routinely become
entangled with a malfunctioned main parachute. A method was then developed so that the jumper
could release (i.e. cut-away) the malfunctioned main parachute prior to deploying the reserve
parachute. However, this introduced a new drawback of loss of time and altitude after cut-away of
the main parachute for the reserve parachute to then fully deploy. To decrease the reserve
deployment time/altitude requirements after cut-away of the main parachute, a Reserve Static Line
(RSL) was introduced, with one end connected to the main parachute riser(s) and the other end
attached to a reserve ripcord pin that deploys the reserve parachute. Upon cut-away of the main
parachute, as the jumper falls away, the RSL is pulled taut and removes the reserve ripcord pin,
causing the reserve pilot chute to be released and deploy the reserve parachute.
              [04]         Although the RSL reduced the time and altitude to pull the reserve ripcord pin, it did
not reduce the actual deployment time/attitude of the reserve parachute, once the reserve parachute
container is opened.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION
              [05]         One embodiment may include a trap system for deployment of a reserve parachute
from a container. The reserve parachute may be secured within a free bag connected by a reserve
bridle to a reserve pilot chute. The trap system may include a trap line with a first end coupled to a
main parachute and a trap attached to a surface of the container. The trap may include an outer
perimeter to removably hold a second end of the trap line and an interior within the outer perimeter
to removably hold the reserve bridle.
              [06]         Another embodiment may include a system for deployment of a reserve parachute
secured within a free bag. The system may include a means for coupling the main parachute to the
free bag to deploy the reserve parachute. The main parachute and the free bag may be initially
decoupled prior to the deployment of the reserve parachute.
              [07]         Another embodiment may include a kit for converting a parachute container into an
improved parachute container configured to deploy a reserve parachute. The parachute container
may include a reserve parachute secured within a free bag connected by a reserve bridle to a reserve
pilot chute. The parachute container may further include an RSL lanyard with a first end attached to
a reserve ripcord and a second end attached to main risers of the main parachute. The kit may
include an attachment configured to be secured to a surface of the parachute container. The kit may
include a trap line with a first end configured to be coupled to the first end of the RSL lanyard. The
attachment may also include a trap configured to be attached to the surface of the parachute
container. The trap may also include an outer perimeter to removably hold a second end of the trap
line and an interior within the outer perimeter configured to removably hold the reserve bridle.
Another embodiment may include a method for installing a trap to deploy a reserve parachute from
a container. The reserve parachute may be secured within a free bag connected by a reserve bridle
to a reserve pilot chute. The method may start by attaching a trap to a surface of the container and
coupling a first end of a trap line to a main parachute.         The method may further include removably
holding a second end of the trap line with an outer perimeter of the trap and removably holding at
least a portion of the free bag, the reserve bridle or the reserve pilot chute with the trap.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
              [034]        The inventors recognized that it would be advantageous to reduce the time and
altitude required for reserve parachute deployment after cut-away from a malfunctioned main
parachute. The inventors also recognized that while the reserve pilot chute is an effective anchor to
deploy the reserve parachute, in many cases the malfunctioned main parachute is a much more
effective anchor to deploy the reserve parachute, thereby reducing the time and altitude required for
reserve parachute deployment. The inventors also recognized that although other systems have been
developed to utilize the malfunctioned main parachute as a deployment anchor for the reserve
parachute, these systems have several drawbacks. First, these systems initially connect the main
parachute to the reserve parachute system, and thus presume that the main parachute will operate as
the deployment anchor for the reserve parachute. Thus, if the main parachute should not operate as
the deployment anchor, such as after a failed deployment of the main parachute or a low drag
                                                               4
10135186 1 (GHMatters) P102686.AU

                                                                                                12349-002
malfunction (i.e. a bag lock malfunction), these systems require intricate structural components
which must disconnect the main parachute from the reserve parachute system, and thus introduce
inherent failure risk. The inventors of the present invention recognized that, if the main parachute is
instead initially decoupled from the reserve parachute system and is only subsequently coupled to
the reserve parachute system once the main parachute will be used as the deployment anchor, the
resulting system is structurally simpler and thus inherently more reliable than the current systems.
              [035] FIGS. lA-lB illustrate a trap system 10 that may include a trap 30 attached to a
surface of a parachute container 14. In a non-limiting example, the trap 30 may be attached to a mid
portion 52 of a kicker flap 50 of the parachute container 14. The trap 30 may include an outer
perimeter 34 and an interior 36 within the outer perimeter 34. The trap 30 is discussed in greater
detail below. In addition to the trap 30 of FIGS. 1A-1B, the system 10 may include a trap line 24
having a first end 26 illustrated in FIG. 2A with a loop. As further illustrated in FIG. 2B, the first
end 26 of the trap line 24 may be connected to a metal ring 43 that is offset from a first end 44 of an
RSL lanyard 42, by passing the trap line 24 through the loop in the first end 26 and through the
metal ring 43 of the RSL lanyard 42. In a non-limiting example, the metal ring 43 is offset from the
first end 44 by a distance in a range from 1-6", for example. In a non-limiting example, although
FIG. 2B depicts the metal ring 43 connected to the trap line 24 on one side of the first end 44 and
metal ring 41, the metal ring 43 may be connected to the trap line 24 on an opposite side of the first
end 44 and metal ring 41, and may be offset from the opposite side of the first end 44 and metal 41
be a distance in a range of 1-6", for example. As further illustrated in FIG. 2C, the first end 26 of
the trap line 24 is connected to and passes through the metal ring 43 offset from the first end 44 of
the RSL lanyard 42, and the reserve ripcord 46 is connected to and passes through a metal ring 41
that is connected to the first end 44 of the RSL lanyard 42. Although FIGS. 2B-2C depict the RSL
lanyard with two metal rings 41, 43 attached near the first end 44, the RSL lanyard may include the
metal ring 41 (without the metal ring 43) attached to the end 44, where the reserve ripcord 46 is
connected to and passes through the metal ring 41 and the first end 26 of the trap line 24 is
connected to and passes through the metal ring 41. Additionally, as illustrated in FIG. 2D, a second
end 45 of the RSL lanyard 42 may be connected to main risers 48 of the main parachute. As
appreciated by one skilled in the art, upon cut-away of a main parachute, the RSL lanyard 42 is
configured to pull the reserve ripcord 46 and deploy the reserve parachute. Thus, since the first end
26 of the trap line 24 is connected to the first end 44 of the RSL lanyard 42, the trap line 24 is also
                                                       5

                                                                                                       12349-002
coupled to the risers 48 of the main parachute upon cut-away of the main parachute. The above
discussed embodiment discloses that the trap 30 may be attached to the mid portion 52 of the kicker
flap 50, so that the mid portion 52 of the kicker flap 50 is adjacent to a portion of a cover flap where
the first end 44 of the RSL lanyard 42 is looped over the reserve ripcord 46, consequently the length
of the trap line 24 can be below a length threshold. However, the trap 30 need not be attached to
any specific location on the kicker flap 50 or on the container 14, and may be attached to any
location on the container 14, provided that the trap 30 has the characteristics disclosed in the
embodiments.
              [036]        As illustrated in FIGS. 3A-3B, the trap 30 may include the outer perimeter 34 to
removably hold a second end 28 of the trap line 24. The outer perimeter 34 may be detached from
the mid portion 52 of the kicker flap 50 to form an edge sized to removably hold the second end 28
of the trap line 24, or any part of the trap line 24. The trap 30 also includes an inner perimeter 58
attached to the mid portion 52 of the kicker flap 50. As illustrated in FIG. 3A, the outer perimeter
34 of the trap 30 may have an arcuate form, such as a circular form, including a flat side 72 and
angled sides 71, 76 on either side of the flat side 72. In a non-limiting example, the flat side 72 may
be cut inward at a ratio of approximately 1/8 of the diameter of the circular outer perimeter 34. In a
non-limiting example, the angled sides 71, 76 may be cut at an angle of approximately 45 degrees to
the flat side 72. In a non-limiting example, the outer diameter of the outer perimeter 34 may be
approximately 4 inches, the inner diameter of the inner perimeter 58 is approximately 2 inches, the
flat side 72 is cut inward approximately 1/8" and the angled sides are cut at approximately 45
degrees. Additionally, as illustrated in FIGS. 3A-3B, a cinch point or an anchor point 69 may be
included that is attached to the mid portion 52 of the kicker flap 50 and is positioned at the
circumference of the trap 30. A tack thread 68 may be passed through a loop hole of the second end
28 of the trap line 24 and is tacked to the anchor point 69, so that the loop of the second end 28 is
anchored. This ensures that the loop of the second end 28 of the trap line 24 remains at the cinch
point 69 in place for cinching in the vicinity of the flat side 72 of the outer perimeter 34. In a non
limiting example, the trap 30 and outer perimeter 34 may be made from a mesh material. However,
the trap and the outer perimeter are not limited to any specific material, provided that the material
chosen to be used is capable of accomplishing the above-discussed function of the trap.
                                                              6

                                                                                                   12349-002
              [037] As further illustrated in FIG. 3B, the second end 28 of the trap line 24 may have a
loop through which the trap line 24 is passed so that the trap line 24 can be removably held under
the edge of the outer perimeter 34.
              [038] FIG. 3C illustrates an alternate trap 30' that includes an outer perimeter 34' with
ridges or folds along the circumference of the outer perimeter 34', where the ridges or folds increase
the rigidity of the outer perimeter 34' and the edge of the outer perimeter 34'. In a non-limiting
example, the increased rigidity of the outer perimeter 34' may removably hold the second end 28 of
the trap line 24 behind the edge. However, the outer perimeter 34' need not include the ridges/folds,
and may be made from a material which has an inherent rigidity/strength capable of removably
holding the second end 28 behind the edge, without the ridges/folds. As further illustrated in FIG.
3C, a marking 70' may be placed on the trap line 24 that is passed through the loop of the second
end 28 and is located outside the outer perimeter 34', where the marking 70' is used as a visual
indicator that the tack thread 68 remains intact and the trap line 24 has not been pulled above the
anchor point 69. Although FIG. 3C illustrates the marking 70' along the trap line 24, the trap does
not need to include a marking along the trap line in order for the trap to function effectively and thus
the trap may exclude the trap line marking.
              [039] FIG. 3D illustrates an alternate trap 30" with an outer perimeter 34" that may be
attached to the surface of the kicker flap 50 and the inner perimeter 58" is detached from the surface
of the kicker flap 50 so that the edge is formed by the inner perimeter 58", to removably hold the
second end 28 of the trap line 24. As illustrated in FIG. 3D, the trap 30" may be triangular shaped
and the inner perimeter 58" includes material at each corner of the triangular-shaped trap 30", to
form an edge at each corner to hold down the second end 28 of the trap line 24.
              [040] FIGS. 3A-3D illustrate that the traps 30, 30', 30" may form an arcuate shape such as
a circular shape, or a polygon shape. In a non-limiting example, the trap may take a triangular
shape. However, the disclosed embodiments are not limited to any specific arcuate or polygon
shape and the outer perimeter and inner perimeter may take any shape such as any polygon shape,
including a square or a rectangle, or any arcuate shape. In a non-limiting example, the outer
perimeter and inner perimeter arcuate shape may be an oval shape. In a non-limiting example, the
material used to make the outer perimeter 34 may be elastic material, binding tape, Tyvek*,
Parapak*, mesh, metal, rubber, plastic, webbing, etc. In a non-limiting example, the material used
to make the interior 36 may be elastic material, binding tape, Tyvek*, Parapak*, mesh, metal,

rubber, plastic, webbing, etc. In a non-limiting example, the material used to make the trap line 24
may be 725-1000 spectra parachute line material. In a non-limiting example, the diameter of the
inner perimeter 58 may be within a range of 1-3" and the diameter of the outer perimeter 34 may be
within a range of 3-5". In a non-limiting example, the dimensions of the interior 36 may be within a
range of 0.75-1.25". In a non-limiting example, the dimensions of the trap line 24 may have a
length within a range of 12-18", with loops in the range of 0.5-1.0" at both ends 26, 28. In an
embodiment, the dimensions of the outer perimeter, interior and trap line are determined, based on a
size of the container on which the trap is installed. The materials and dimensions listed above are
merely non-limiting examples and the disclosed embodiments are not limited to any specific
dimension range or types of materials to be used to make the trap and the trap line, provided that the
dimension and material used to form the trap and the trap line are effective to achieve the structural
characteristics of the embodiments of the trap system disclosed herein. In a non-limiting example,
the material used to form the trap should be chosen such that the material is sturdy and pliable
enough to hold the trap line and permit the trap and trap line to operate in the manner discussed
herein. Additionally, in a non-limiting example, the material used to form the trap line should be
chosen such that the material provides similar grip and/or similar release resistance as a spectra
parachute line material.
              [041] FIG. 4A illustrates a free bag 18 within which the reserve parachute is contained, and
the free bag 18 may be connected by a reserve bridle 20 to a reserve pilot chute 22. The reserve
bridle 20 may include an intermediate location 74 positioned at a location between a midpoint 77 of
the reserve bridle 20 and the pilot chute 22. The distance between the intermediate location 74 and
the reserve pilot chute 22 is less than a length of the distance between the intermediate location 74
and the free bag 18. Although the distance between the intermediate location 74 and the pilot chute
22 is greater than a length of the trap line 24, it is primarily the speed differential between the main
parachute and the pilot chute 22 which causes the main parachute to pull the trap line 24 taut and
thus the main parachute to serve as the deployment anchor of the reserve parachute, if the main
parachute is not entangled and breaks away. Additionally, the above distance relationship results in
the main risers 48 having a shorter distance to travel to pull the trap line 24 taut than the deployment
distance of the reserve pilot chute 22, which further contributes to the main parachute serving as the
deployment anchor of the reserve parachute, if the main parachute is not entangled and breaks away.
In a non-limiting example, the length between the intermediate location 74 and the midpoint 77 may

be approximately 12". The intermediate location 74 separates the reserve bridle 20 into a first
portion 73 of the bridle 20 between the intermediate location 74 and the free bag 18 and a second
portion 75 of the bridle 20 between the intermediate location 74 and the reserve pilot chute 22. As
further illustrated in FIG. 4A, the intermediate location 74 may include a portion of webbing 78
attached to the reserve bridle 20. In a non-limiting example , the webbing 78 may be sewn down to
the reserve bridle 20 at the intermediate location 74, or any location along the reserve bridle 20 that
is inserted within the loop 67. As illustrated in FIG. 4C, the reserve bridle 20 is folded at the
intermediate location 74 along a length dimension 80 and along a width dimension 82 of the reserve
bridle 20. In a non-limiting example, the reserve bridle 20 may have a width of approximately 2"
and the reserve bridle 20 may be folded along the width dimension 82 such that the width of the
reserve bridle 20 at the intermediate location 74 is approximately 1". However, the folding of the
reserve bridle 20 is not limited by these above width ranges and the reserve bridle 20 may be sized
and folded by any dimension, provided that the intermediate location 74 and reserve bridle 20 are
effective to perform the functions disclosed in the embodiments. As further illustrated in FIG. 4B
and 4D, the webbing 78 may be attached to the reserve bridle 20, where the width 79 of the webbing
78 is approximately one-third the width 81 of the reserve bridle 20, such that the reserve bridle 20
on either side of the webbing 78 can be folded in the width dimension 82 over the webbing 78. The
reserve bridle 20 may then be folded in the length dimension 80 at the intermediate location 74
(FIG. 4D) which can then be placed in the trap, as discussed below. In a non-limiting example, the
webbing 78 may have a width of approximately 0.75" and a length of approximately 1.25". In a
non-limiting example, the reserve bridle 20 may have a width of approximately 2" (unfolded) and in
a range of approximately 0.5-1.0" (folded).
              [042]        FIG. 5 illustrates that the interior 36 of the trap 30 that is attached to the kicker flap
50. The trap 30 defines a loop 67 over a portion of the interior 36 that is not attached to the kicker
flap 50. In an embodiment, the interior 36 may be made from an elastic material, such that the loop
67 provides an opening where the elastic material of the interior 36 compresses to hold an item
inserted within the loop 67. As illustrated in FIG. 5, after folding the intermediate location 74 of the
reserve bridle 20 (FIG. 4B), the intermediate location 74 of the reserve bridle 20 may be inserted
within the loop 67 and removably held within the loop 67 of the interior 36. In a non-limiting
example, any portion of the reserve bridle 20 may be inserted within the loop 67 and removably
held within the loop 67 and thus the intermediate location 74 of the reserve bridle 20 need not be
                                                                 9

inserted within the loop 67. The webbing 78 of the bridle 20 and the folding of the intermediate
location 74 may provide additional bulk and/or friction when the intermediate location 74 is inserted
within the loop 67 of the interior 36. However, the webbing 78 and folding of the intermediate
location 74 is not required and the intermediate location 74 may be simply inserted within the loop
67, without the need for the webbing and folding discussed above.
              [043] As illustrated in FIG. 3B, the trap 30 may define an anchor point 69 along the surface
of the kicker flap 50, and the first end 26 of the trap line 24 is passed through the loop of the second
end 28. The tack thread 68 is attached to the anchor point 69. The loop at the second end 28 is
tacked to the anchor point 69 by passing the tack thread 68 through the loop of the second end 28, so
as not to breach the integrity of the line or thread. Upon tension in the trap line 24, the trap line 24 is
released from behind the edge and tightens around the reserve bridle 20. As illustrated in FIG. 3B,
the anchor point 69 is positioned at an approximate 12 o'clock position, based on the frame of
reference of FIG. 1A. As illustrated in FIG. 5, the intermediate location 74 of the reserve bridle 20
may be inserted within the loop 67 from a direction of the anchor point 69, to further position the
loop of the second end 28 of the trap line 24 to tighten with the reserve bridle 20, upon tension in
the trap line 24 and release of the trap line 24 from behind the edge of the outer perimeter 34. In a
non-limiting example, the intermediate location 74 may be inserted within the loop 67 from any
direction, relative to the anchor point 69. The tack thread 68 and anchor point 69 are configured to
anchor the loop of the second end 28 and fix the loop as the cinch point near the anchor point 69.
Although FIG. 5 depicts that the intermediate location 74 of the reserve bridle 20 is inserted within
the loop 67, any portion of the reserve system including at least a portion of the free bag 18, or at
least a portion of the reserve bridle 20 or at least a portion of the reserve pilot chute 22 may be
inserted within the loop 67. Additionally, any line or extension connected to any portion of the
reserve system may be inserted within the loop 67. Although FIG. 3B illustrates the tack thread 68,
the trap does not need to include a tack thread in order for the trap to function effectively and thus
the trap may exclude the tack thread. In a non-limiting example, the trap line 24 may be anchored
at the anchor point 69 with a tack thread at any location around the outer perimeter 34 of the trap 30
and the reserve bridle 20 may be inserted within the loop 67 from any direction around the outer
perimeter 34.
              [044] As illustrated in FIG. 6, after the first portion 73 (FIG. 4A) of the reserve bridle 20 is
packed normally under the kicker flap 50, afterwards the intermediate location 74 of the reserve

bridle 20 may then be folded over onto the kicker flap 50 and placed into the trap 30 and the
remaining bridle 20 is folded normally. After folding the second portion 75 of the reserve bridle 20
on the kicker flap 50, the reserve pilot chute 22 may be positioned over the folded bridle 20, and the
rest of the parachute container is packed, as appreciated by one skilled in the art and as per the
manufacturer instructions.
              [045] The system 10 may be utilized for deployment of the reserve parachute, based on
various types of malfunctions of the main parachute. In one embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 7A,
the main parachute 16 deploys from the container 14, does not entangle with the jumper and yet still
experiences a malfunction. In a non-limiting example, the malfunction may consist of one or more
openings, tears, twists, broken lines in the main parachute 16. During such a malfunction, the
jumper cuts-away the main parachute, and thus the main risers 48 begin to separate from the
container 14. As previously discussed, the second end 45 of the RSL lanyard 42 may be connected
to the main risers 48 and the first end 44 of the RSL lanyard 42 is connected to both the reserve
ripcord 46 and the first end 26 of the trap line 24. Thus, after sufficient separation of the main risers
48 from the container 14, the RSL lanyard 42 pulls the reserve ripcord 46, which activates the
reserve parachute deployment. Additionally, the RSL lanyard 42 may pull the trap line 24 taut,
which causes the second end 28 of the trap line 24 to release from behind the edge of the trap 30 and
tighten around the intermediate location 74 of the reserve bridle 20 (FIGS. 7B-7E). Since the trap
line 24 is in tension between the intermediate location 74 of the bridle 20 and the main risers 48, the
main parachute 16 will serve as the anchor to deploy the reserve parachute from the free bag 18.
Additionally, since the second portion 75 of the bridle 20 between the reserve pilot chute 22 and the
intermediate location 74 is not in tension when the trap line 24 is in tension, the reserve pilot chute
22 does not serve as the anchor to deploy the reserve parachute from the free bag 18. Thus, when
the main parachute 16 undergoes a malfunction, the trap 30 may be configured to cinch the trap line
24 around the reserve bridle 20 so that the main parachute 16 deploys the reserve parachute from the
free bag 18.
              [046] In another embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 8A, the main parachute 16 may
undergo a low drag malfunction, during which the main pilot chute 13 and the main bag 15 deploy
but the main parachute does not deploy from the main bag 15. The deployed main pilot chute 13
and the main bag 15 may move a sufficient distance to cause the RSL lanyard 42 to pull the reserve
ripcord 46 and pull the trap line 24 taut, thereby releasing the trap line 24 from behind the edge of
                                                      11

                                                                                                          12349-002
the outer perimeter 34. Thus, the trap line 24 may be initially secured to the intermediate location
74 of the reserve bridle 20 (FIG. 8B). However, since the main parachute 16 has not deployed from
the main bag 15, the main parachute 16 does not continue to move away from the jumper and thus
the trap line 24 does not remain taut. Additionally, since the RSL lanyard 42 pulled the reserve
ripcord 46, the reserve pilot chute 22 may deploy, creating tension in the second portion 75 of the
bridle 20, thereby releasing the bridle 20 from the trap line 24 and permitting the reserve pilot chute
22 to deploy the reserve parachute from the free bag 18 (FIGS. 8C-8D).
              [047]        In another embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 9, the main parachute 16 may fail to
deploy from the parachute container, in which case the main parachute 16 is not used as an anchor
to deploy the reserve parachute. Since the main parachute 16 may fail to deploy, the main risers 48
do not separate from the jumper and thus the trap line 24 does not become taut or release from
behind the edge of the outer perimeter 34 of the trap 30. Thus, the trap 30 of the system 10 may be
configured such that the trap line 24 remains held by the edge of the outer perimeter 34 if the main
parachute fails to deploy. Thus, in the event of a failed deployment of the main parachute, the
jumper may manually activate the reserve ripcord 46 to deploy the reserve parachute, which results
in deployment of the reserve pilot chute 22 and tension of the reserve bridle 20 so that the
intermediate location 74 is released from the loop 67 of the interior 36 of the trap 30, as illustrated
in FIG. 9. After the reserve bridle 20 is released from the loop 67 of the interior 36, the trap 30
would resemble FIG. 3B, where the trap line 24 remains tacked to the anchor point 69 with the tack
thread 68 and the trap line 24 remains held by the edge of the outer perimeter 34. Thus, the manual
activation of the reserve parachute is not affected by the trap 30 of the system 10 and may result in
the use of the reserve pilot chute 22 as an anchor to deploy the reserve parachute from the free bag
 18.
              [048]        Indeed, the trap 30 and the trap line 24 of the system 10, as described in the above
disclosed embodiments may be effective as a means for coupling the main parachute 16 to the free
bag 18 upon a malfunction of the main parachute 16. After a malfunction of the main parachute, a
jumper will cutaway from the main parachute, then the trap 30 and trap line 24 may be used to
connect the free bag 18 to the main parachute 16, by connecting the reserve bridle 20 (which is
connected with the free bag 18) to the trap line 24 (which is connected with the RSL lanyard 42,
which in-turn is connected to the main risers 48 and main parachute 16). Prior to the malfunction of
the main parachute 16, the main parachute 16 and the free bag 18 may be initially decoupled, due to
                                                               12

the reserve bridle 20 and the trap line 24 being decoupled and not connected. The above
embodiments disclose the trap 30 and the trap line 24 as one non-limiting example of the means for
coupling the main parachute 16 to the free bag 18 upon release of the malfunctioned main parachute
16, in which the main parachute 16 is decoupled from the free bag 18 prior to the malfunctioned
deployment. However, the disclosed embodiments are not limited to the trap 30 and trap line 24
arrangement and include any structure or configuration which couples the main parachute 16 to the
free bag 18 upon release of the malfunctioned main parachute 16 in which the main parachute is
initially decoupled from the free bag 18 prior to the malfunction.
              [049] As illustrated in FIG. 10A, the system 10 may include a flap 102 that is secured to
the mid portion 52 of the kicker flap 50 and covers the trap 30. The flap 102 is rotatably secured to
the mid portion 52 of the kicker flap 50 along a hinge 103 and thus can rotate about the hinge 103.
A grommet 104 may also be included, with an opening 105 through the flap 102 for the grommet
104, such that, upon packing the container 14, the closing loop is passed through the flaps of the
container 14 including the kicker flap 50 and passed through the opening 105 of the grommet 104,
after which the closing loop passes through the reserve pilot chute 22 and is secured with the reserve
ripcord. However, the flap 102 need not include grommet 104.
              [050] Although the above disclosed embodiments discuss the system 10 including the trap
30 and the trap line 24 installed on a parachute container 14, the disclosed embodiments need not
include a parachute container 14 and may merely include a kit to convert a parachute container into
an improved parachute container to deploy a reserve parachute upon a malfunction of a main
parachute. FIG. 1OB illustrates a kit 100 that is used to convert a parachute container into the
parachute container 14 depicted in FIG. 1A, by providing a trap 30"', a flap 102A and an attachment
102B that has a size approximately equal to the flap 102A. The trap 30"' is positioned between the
flap 102A and the attachment 102B, and the trap 30"' is pre-secured to the attachment 102B. The
kit 100 includes a means, including instructions (and materials) for securing the attachment 102B to
the kicker flap 50 or any portion of the parachute container. For example, the kit 100 includes
materials or instructions to stitch a perimeter 101 and a hinge 103 of the attachment 102B to the
kicker flap 50, thereby securing the attachment 102B to the kicker flap 50. The kit 100 may merely
provide instructions for securing the attachment 102B to the kicker flap 50 and need not include the
materials for securing the attachment 102B to the kicker flap 50. Any stitching or sewing materials
known to one skilled in the art may be utilized within the kit 100. As illustrated in FIG. 1OB, the
                                                       13

attachment 102B may be sized such that the grommet 104 is positioned outside the attachment
102B. However, the attachment 102B may be sized with an opening to encompass the grommet
104. In a non-limiting example, the attachment 102B may be secured to an area of the kicker flap
50. The kit 100 may include a list of installation instructions for securing the attachment 102B to
the kicker flap (or other location) of the parachute container. The flap 102A can rotate about the
hinge 103 segment of the attachment 102B. As illustrated in FIG. 1OB, the flap 102A may be
partially opened to reveal the trap 30"' attached to the surface of the attachment 102B. The trap
30"' of FIG. 1OB operates in a similar manner as the trap 30 discussed above in the other
embodiments, with the exception of the features discussed herein. As illustrated in FIG. 1OB, the
trap 30"' includes a pair of cinch points or anchor points 66"', 69"". The trap line 24"' (FIG. 1OC)
includes the first end 26 and the second end 28 of the trap line 24 discussed above, but further
includes a loop 70"' at a location between the first and second ends 26, 28. In a non-limiting
example, the trap line 24"' has a length in a range of 12-18" and the loop 70"' is positioned at a
distance in a range of 3-5" from the first end 26. In a non-limiting example, the loop 70"' is
positioned between a midpoint of the trap line 24"' and the first end 26 of the trap line 24. As
illustrated in FIG. lOB, a first tack thread 68 is passed through the loop 70"" of the trap line 24"', to
tack the loop 70"' to the first cinch point or anchor point 66"' of the trap 30"'. As further illustrated
in FIG. lOB, a second tack thread 68 is passed through the loop of the second end 28, to tack the
loop of the second end 28 to the second cinch point or anchor point 69"' of the trap 30"'. In a non
limiting example, the loop 70"' provides a marking or indicator that the trap line 24"' has not yet
been pulled beyond the second cinch point 69"', since the first tack thread 68 between the loop 70"'
and the first cinch point 66"' will break before the second thread 68 between the loop of the second
end 28 and the second cinch point 69"' breaks. In a non-limiting example, the first cinch point 66"'
is positioned at a counterclockwise position relative to the second cinch point 69"'. In a non
limiting example, the first cinch point 66"' is positioned between an 11 o'clock position and a 12
o'clock position, and the second cinch point 69"' is positioned at an approximate 12 o'clock
position along the outer perimeter 34. Although the trap 30"' including the first and second cinch
points 66"', 69"' is discussed above in the embodiment of the kit 100 to convert a parachute
container into an improved parachute container, the trap 30"' is not limited to this embodiment and
may be utilized within any of the embodiments of the trap discussed above in FIGS. 1-9.
Additionally, the embodiment of the kit 100 discussed above is not limited to the embodiment of the

trap 30"' illustrated in FIG. 1OB and may include any of the embodiments of the trap discussed
above in FIGS. 1-9.
              [051] Although the above-discussed kit involves the attachment 102B that can be secured
to the kicker flap 50 of the container, to convert the container to an improved container, the kit is not
limited to including the attachment 102B and may merely include the trap 30"' and the trap line
24"', along with installation instructions for attaching the trap 30"' to any surface of the parachute
container other than the kicker flap 50, instructions for connecting the trap line 24"' to the RSL
lanyard and/or instructions for connecting the trap line 24"' to the trap 30"'. In a non-limiting
example, the kit may include such instructions as the preferred location along the area of the kicker
flap 50 to attach the trap 30"', instructions and materials to attach the inner perimeter 58 to the area
of the kicker flap 50, and instructions and materials to attach the interior 36 with the loop 67 within
the outer perimeter 34 along the area of the kicker flap 50. Additionally, the kit may be sold in
various sizes, based on the size of the parachute container that is sought to be converted into an
improved parachute container. In a non-limiting example, the diameter of the outer perimeter 34 of
the trap 30"' may be larger, based on parachute containers of larger sizes.
              [052]        FIG. 11 is a flowchart depicting a method 200 for installing the trap 30 to deploy a
reserve parachute from the parachute container 14 upon a malfunction of the main parachute 16.
The reserve parachute may be secured within the free bag 18 connected by the reserve bridle 20 to
the reserve pilot chute 22. The method 200 may start at 201 by attaching 204 the trap 30 to the
surface of the container 14. The method 200 then includes the step of coupling 202 the first end 26
of the trap line 24 to the main parachute 16 via risers 48 (through the RSL lanyard 42) . The method
200 may further include removably holding 206 the second end 28 of the trap line 24 with the outer
perimeter 34 of the trap 30. The method 200 may further include removably holding 208 a portion
of the reserve system including at least a portion of the free bag 18, at least a portion of the reserve
