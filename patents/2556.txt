ABSTRACT
A machine tooth for heavy equipment can be monitored by coupling an RFID tag to
the heavy machine tooth and positioning an RFID reader to read the RFID tag. The
RFID reader provides an indication that the heavy machine tooth is separated from
the heavy machine.                The heavy machine tooth is configured, for example, to be
mounted on a bucket of a heavy machine.

[0001]               This application is a divisional application of australian application number
2015230856, which in turn is a divisional application of australian application number
2012302078.                  The entire   disclosures of 2015230856        and   2012302078 are

BACKGROUND
[0002]               The invention relates to detection and locating of heavy machine teeth,
specifically the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to determine when a
metal tooth is no longer on a bucket of a heavy machine.
[0003]               Heavy machines (e.g., mining equipment such as draglines and shovels)
utilize steel teeth in their bucket designs. The teeth are used for several reasons:
They provide a smaller point of surface area when digging into the earth, helping to
break up the earth, and requiring less force than the larger surface area of a bucket
itself. In addition, the teeth provide easily replaceable wear points that save the
bucket itself from wearing down. However, as a tooth wears down, there is currently
no method to measure wear without physically removing the tooth.
[0004]               When the teeth wear down, they typically fall off. The current method of
detecting when a tooth falls off is an expensive machine vision system that looks at
the bucket and detects when a tooth has gone missing. This system is extremely
costly to implement, and only lets the operator know that the tooth has gone missing,
not where it is. Once a crew notices a tooth is missing, they haul away an average
ten truckloads of material in hopes of locating and separating out the fallen tooth. If
they are unable to locate the tooth, the tooth can end up in a crusher. In addition the
tooth can become stuck in the crusher and be ejected from the crusher, potentially
harming other equipment.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0022]               Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to
be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of
construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following
description or illustrated in the following drawings. The invention is capable of other
embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways.
[0023]               Heavy machines are used to move large amounts of earth in industries
such as mining and construction. Some heavy machines (e.g., an electric shovel)
include buckets for scooping up the earth. The buckets often include a plurality of
teeth to help break up the earth, and make it easier to scoop the earth into the
bucket.
[0024]               Fig. 1 shows an exemplary electric shovel 100 used for surface mining
applications. The electric shovel 100 includes a mobile base 105 supported on drive
tracks 110. The mobile base 105 supports a turntable 115, and a machinery deck
120. The turntable 115 permits full 3600 rotation of the machinery deck 120 relative
to the base 105.
[0025]               A boom 125 is pivotally connected at 130 to the machinery deck 120.
The boom 125 is held in an upwardly and outwardly extending relation to the deck by
a brace or gantry in the form of tension cables 135 which are anchored to a back
stay 140 of a stay structure 145 rigidly mounted on the machinery deck 120.
[0026]               A dipper or bucket 150 includes a plurality of teeth 152, and is suspended
by a flexible hoist rope or cable 155 from a pulley or sheave 160, the hoist rope is
anchored to a winch drum 165 mounted on the machinery deck 120. As the winch
drum rotates, the hoist rope 155 is either paid out or pulled in, lowering or raising the
9753000 1 (GHMatters) P96374.AU.2

                                                 6
dipper 150. The boom pulley 160 directs the tension in the hoist rope 155 to pull
straight upward on the shovel dipper 150.thereby producing efficient dig force with
which to excavate the bank of material. The dipper 150 an arm or handle 170 rigidly
attached thereto, with the dipper arm 170 slideably supported in a saddle block 175,
which is pivotally mounted on the boom 125 at 180. The dipper arm 170 has a rack
tooth formation thereon (not shown) which engages a drive pinion or shipper shaft
(not shown) mounted in the saddle block 175. The drive pinion is driven by an
electric motor and transmission unit 185 to effect extension or retraction of the dipper
arm 170 relative to the saddle block 175.
[0027]               The shovel boom 125 is a major structural component in size, shape, and
weight. Its main purpose is to hold the boom pulley 160 in an advantageous position
for efficient hoist dipper pull through the bank. Another major purpose of the boom
125 is to mount the shipper shaft at a sufficient height and outward radius from the
centerline of rotation of the shovel 100. The shipper shaft powers the shovel handle
to extend and retract the dipper 150. These two features of an electric shovel
digging attachment make the shovel uniquely qualified to reach and dig high bank
formations safely away from the shovel. The shovel in this regard is also able to
reach a great volume of material in one sitting without propelling closer to the bank.
[0028]               The bucket teeth 152 are removably attached to the bucket 150. This
enables broken or worn teeth 152 to be easily replaced. However, this leads to teeth
152 occasionally breaking or falling off of the bucket 150. In some circumstances, a
tooth 152 will break/fall off the bucket 150 and end up in the earth being mined (i.e.,
in the bucket 150). When the earth in the bucket 150 is deposited in a truck, the
tooth 152 goes into the truck as well. Often the earth in the truck is taken to a
crusher to be crushed. When the truck empties its contents into the crusher, the
tooth 152 goes into the crusher as well, potentially damaging the crusher, being
expelled from the crusher and damaging other equipment, or being damaged in the
crusher.

                                                   7
[0029]               Figs. 2A and 2B represent a typical mining operation. The shovel 100
digs up earth 200 with its bucket 150, and dumps the earth 200 into a truck 205.
Once the truck 205 is full, the truck 205 takes the earth 200 to another location (e.g.,
at the mining site or remote from the mining site). In some operations, the truck 205
takes the earth 200 to a crusher 210. The truck 205 deposits the earth 200 onto a
conveyor 215 which feeds the earth 200 into the crusher 210 which crushes the
earth 200 into smaller components 220.
[0030]               Embodiments of the invention use an active RFID tag embedded in or
attached to the metal tooth 152 of the heavy machine bucket to enable detection of a
tooth 152 missing from the bucket 150.
[0031]               Embodiments of the invention use an RFID reader 225 located on a
structure (e.g., an exit gate) through which the truck 205 passes after being filled.
The RFID reader 225 checks if an RFID tag passed near the structure. If an RFID
tag is detected, an alarm can be triggered enabling the truck 205 to be searched to
determine if the detected RFID tag and corresponding tooth 152 was in the bed of
the truck 205. If a tooth 152 containing an RFID tag had broken/fallen off the bucket
150 and was in the truck 205, it could be found before leaving the site or being
deposited in the crusher 210. Preferably, the RFID reader 225 is positioned a far
enough distance away from the bucket 150 that the reader 225 does not detect RFID
tags in the teeth 152 that are still in place on the bucket 150.
[0032]               In addition, an RFID reader 230 can be positioned before the entrance to
the crusher 210 to detect the RFID tag on a tooth 152 prior to the tooth 152 entering
the crusher 210 (e.g., the reader 230 could be positioned over the conveyor 215
feeding the crusher 210). Again, if the reader 230 detects an RFID tag, an alarm is
triggered and the conveyor 215 and/or crusher 210 is/are stopped, enabling the tooth
152 to be located prior to entering the crusher 210.
[0033]               An RFID tag in a tooth 152 can include information identifying the tooth
152. For example, the RFID tag can be written with data such as, but not limited to,
a serial number, an origin, a date of manufacture, etc. This stored information can
9753000 1 (GHMatters) P96374.AU.2

                                                  8
enable a user to quickly determine where the tooth 152 came from promoting faster
repair of the bucket 150 or returning of the tooth 152.
[0034]               In some embodiments, an RFID reader 235 is included in the heavy
machine 100 itself (see Fig. 1). The reader 235 reads all of the RFID tags located on
the machine 100, including the tags on the teeth 152. A controller or computer
receives information from the reader 235 about the tags detected. The controller
then provides diagnostic information to a user. This information can include when
the tooth 152 was installed, how many hours the tooth 152 has been in operation,
etc. In addition, should a tooth 152 break/fall off, the controller alerts the user of this
condition enabling the lost tooth 152 to be found quickly and replaced.
[0035]               In some embodiments, additional circuitry is included with the RFID tag to
determine the amount of wear of a tooth, enabling preventative maintenance to be
performed before a tooth fails.
[0036]               In some embodiments, the RFID tag 300 is detuned when the tooth 152
is mounted to the bucket 150. When the tooth 152 breaks/falls off the bucket 150,
the signal strength of the RFID tag 300 increases. The reader 235 detects the
increase in signal strength and determines that the tooth 152 has broken/fallen off
the bucket 150.
[0037]               Figs. 3-5 show a view of a heavy machine bucket tooth 152. The tooth
152 includes an active RFID tag 300 encased in a ceramic enclosure 305, the
ceramic enclosure 305 is then encased in steel 310. A separate control circuitry can
also be included in the ceramic enclosure 305 to activate the RFID tag 300 when the
tooth 152 is shipped or installed, saving battery power and extending the life of the
RFID tag 300. The ceramic enclosure 305 with the RFID tag 300, and any other
circuitry, is placed in a mold into which liquid steel is poured to form the tooth 152.
The ceramic enclosure 305 protects the RFID tag 300 from the heat of the liquid
steel. The RFID tag 300 is detuned such that the steel of the tooth 152 tunes the
RFID tag 300 to the correct frequency, using the tooth 152 as an antenna. In some
9753000 1 (GHMatters) P96374.AU.2

                                                  9
embodiments, a tuning circuit in the RFID tag 300 tunes the tag 300 once the tag
300 is activated in the tooth 152.
[0038]               Fig. 6 shows another construction of a heavy machine bucket tooth 152
incorporating an RFID tag 300. The tag 300 is mounted to an end 600 of the tooth
152. The end 600 is inserted into a mounting bracket 605 and the tooth 152 is
secured to the mounting bracket 605. In this construction, the RFID tag 300 takes
advantage of the metal of the tooth 152 and the bracket 605, using backscattering to
increase an intensity of the RFID signal.
[0039]               Fig. 7 shows a construction of a heavy machine bucket tooth 152
arranged to receive an RFID tag. The tooth 152 includes a hole 700 drilled into the
base of the tooth 152. A cylindrical RFID tag is inserted into the hole 700. In some
constructions, a ceramic disk is placed over the RFID tag, and the hole 700 is
welded shut.
[0040]               Fig. 8 shows a construction of a ceramic plug 800 for insertion in the
tooth 152 of Fig. 7. The ceramic plug 800 encapsulates an RFID tag and a tooth
wear detection circuit. Four probes 805, 810, 815, 820 extend out of the ceramic
plug 800. When the ceramic plug 800 is inserted into the hole 700 of the tooth 152,
the probes 805-820 each contact the tooth 152 and are thereby electrically coupled
to the tooth 152. The wear detection circuit uses the probes 805, 810, 815, 820 to
electrically test the tooth 152 and determine the wear of the tooth 152. The wear
detection circuit provides data to the RFID tag 300 regarding the wear of the tooth
152 (e.g., amount of loss, useful life remaining, etc.).            The RFID tag 300 then
communicates (e.g., via a wired or wireless connection) the wear information to an
RFID reader (e.g., in a cab of a shovel, to a portable RFID reader, etc.).
[0041]               Fig. 9 shows a wear detection circuit 900 used to determine wear of the
tooth 152. The circuit 900 uses a four-point resistance method to determine wear. A
current source 905 produces a current that is applied to two of the probes 805 and
820. The current flowing through the probes 805 and 820 is detected by a current
transducer 910. A voltage transducer 915 of the circuit 900 detects a voltage across
9753000 1 (GHMatters) P96374.AU.2

                                                  10
the other two probes 810 and 815.                Using the detected current and voltage, a
microcontroller 920 of the circuit 900 determines a resistance of the tooth 152. The
resistance varies based on the material composition of the tooth 152, the permittivity
of the tooth 152, and the dimensions of the tooth 152. As the tooth 152 wears, the
resistance of the tooth 152 changes. The change in resistance can thus be used to
determine the wear and tear on the tooth 152.              In some embodiments, the initial
resistance (i.e., when the tooth 152 is new) is recorded in the RFID tag 300. Also, in
some embodiments, other resistance measurements (e.g., the resistance previously
determined) are recorded in the RFID tag 300.
