A BEVERAGE CONTAINER HOLDER
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]      The present invention relates to a beverage container holder.
BACKGROUND
[0002]      The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be
taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of
the common general knowledge.
[0003]      Stubby holders are a type of beverage container holder for holding stubbies
(small bottles) and cans of drink, and beer in particular.
[0004]      A known type of beverage container holder includes a base, and a neoprene
sleeve glued to the base and for receiving a beverage container. In practice, the base
stops the container from slipping through the sleeve. The sleeve often becomes grotty
through handling and beverage spillage.
[0005]      The preferred embodiment provides a beverage container holder which can
maintain a fresher appearance.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]      According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
beverage container holder including:
       a base including a light; and
       a sleeve for removably fastening to the base and for receiving a beverage
       container.
[0007]      Advantageously, the sleeve may be removed from the base and washed to
remove any grot before being reattached, and thereby maintains a fresher appearance.

                                             2
[0008]      The base may include catches for catching the sleeve. The sleeve may
include apertures for receiving respective hooks. The base may include a actuator for
actuating the light. The sleeve may include an aperture for receiving the actuator which
is exposed. The actuator may be a push button. The actuator may be actuated to cycle
through functions of the light.
[0009]      The light may include one or more LEDs. The light may include many LEDs
extending across the sleeve. The holder may include a controller for controlling the
LEDs. The controller may control the colour of the LEDs when illuminated. The
controller may include the state of the LEDs (e.g. flashing, constantly on, constantly off
et cetera). The holder may further include a removable inset for inserting in the sleeve.
[00010]     The base may include a compartment for storing one or more batteries. The
base may include a lid which is rotationally released to access the batteries.
[00011]     The holder may function as a torch when the sleeve does not receive a
beverage container, and the sleeve effectively acts as a waveguide directing light waves
from the light. The holder may function as a lamp when the sleeve receives a
translucent or transparent beverage container. The sleeve may be resilient.
[00012]     The base may further include one or more shelves for locating the sleeve.
The base may further define gaps between adjacent shelves and that are in register
with catches to facilitate attachment and detachment of the sleeve with the base 200.
[00013]     According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
beverage container holder including:
       a base including a light; and
       a sleeve for fastening to the base and for receiving a beverage container.
[00014]     Any of the features described herein can be combined in any combination
with any one or more of the other features described herein within the scope of the
invention.

[00015]      Preferred features, embodiments and variations of the invention may be
discerned from the following Detailed Description which provides sufficient information
for those skilled in the art to perform the invention. The Detailed Description is not to be
regarded as limiting the scope of the preceding Summary of the Invention in any way.
The Detailed Description will make reference to a number of drawings as follows:
[00016]      Figure 1 shows a disassembled perspective view of a beverage container
holder in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention; and
[00017]      Figure 2 shows a disassembled bottom view of a base of the beverage
container holder of Figure 1.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[00018]      According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a
beverage container holder 100 as shown in figure 1. The beverage container holder 100
includes a base 102 including an upward facing light 104. A resilient sleeve 106 is
provided for removably fastening to the base 102 and for receiving a beverage
container (e.g. can or bottle). Advantageously, the cylindrical sleeve 106 can be
removed from the base 102 and washed to remove any grot before being reattached,
and thereby maintains a fresher appearance.
[00019]      The base 102 includes catches 108, in the form of downward facing hooks,
for catching the sleeve 106. The sleeve 106 includes corresponding base apertures 110
for receiving respective catches 108. The base 102 also includes a push-button actuator
112 for actuating the light 104. In turn, the sleeve 106 includes a round aperture 114 for
receiving the actuator 112 which is exposed. The actuator 112 is actuated to cycle
through functions of the light 102 (e.g. off, on white, background blue light, emergency
red light flashing, off, on, ... ).
[00020]      The light 102 includes many encased and sealed light emitting diodes (LEDs)
extending across the base of the sleeve 106. The holder also 100 includes a controller
for controlling the LEDs. The controller controls the colour and the the state of the LEDs
(e.g. flashing, constantly on, constantly off et cetera) by pushing the push button
actuator 112 as described above. The holder further includes a removable and resilient

                                               4
tubular inset 114 for inserting in the sleeve 106 to tighten the fit for slender beverage
containers.
[00021]     Turning to Figure 2, the base 102 includes an internal compartment 200 for
storing three AAA batteries 202 and the controller 204. The base 102 includes a
threaded lid 206 which is rotationally released to access the batteries 202 for
replacement.
[00022]     The base 102 also includes lower shelves 208 against which the sleeve 106
can be abutted during assembly. The base 102 further defines gaps 210 between
adjacent shelves 208 and that are in register with catches 108 to facilitate attachment
and detachment of the sleeve 106 with the base 102.
[00023]     The holder 100 functions as a high-powered torch (or flashlight) when the
sleeve 106 does not receive a beverage container, and the sleeve 106 effectively acts
as a waveguide directing light waves from the light 104. The holder 100 also functions
as a lamp when the sleeve 106 receives a translucent or transparent beverage
container.
[00024]     A person skilled in the art will appreciate that many embodiments and
variations can be made without departing from the ambit of the present invention.
[00025]     The sleeve 106 and insert 114 can be manufactured using different material
such as neoprene, plastics, metals and/or other suitable material for holding various
sized and shaped items including but not limited to bottles, cans, glass and plastic drink
containers.
[00026]     In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language
more or less specific to structural or methodical features. It is to be understood that the
invention is not limited to specific features shown or described since the means herein
described comprises preferred forms of putting the invention into effect.
[00027]     Reference throughout this specification to 'one embodiment' or 'an
embodiment' means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in
connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present
invention. Thus, the appearance of the phrases 'in one embodiment' or 'in an

                                           5
embodiment' in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all
referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or
characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more combinations.
