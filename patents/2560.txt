15       Referring to Figure                 2,     an embodiment            of a control
   scheme of the embodiment of the DALI compatible lighting
   controller              100    according              to   the       disclosure               is
   illustrated.              The    embodiment            of   the     control          scheme
   includes         steps      S01    to    S08.
20       As a prerequisite,                the sensing unit             2 continues to
   make detection               (i.e.,      light       detection         and/or        motion
   detection)          and generate         the result        of detection.            In step
   S01,     the processing           unit    4 determines whether a current
   result of detection                  (i.e.,       a current result of light
25 detection          and/or a current             result     of motion detection)
   conforms            with       a     predetermined                condition.                The
   predetermined condition                      includes         that     the     result        of

   light        detection           is      within          a   predetermined                range      of
   brightness                (e.g.,          smaller            than         a     predetermined
   threshold in               brightness),                 and/or that             the     result       of
   motion detection               indicates             movement of the object within
 5 a predefined             area (or within                 a predefined            distance         from
   a position             of the motion detector                        22)     in    the space of
   interest.            In   this     embodiment,               the predefined                area may
   be     defined          using       a    hardware            approach           or    a   software
   approach.           In   the hardware approach,                       the predefined              area
10 is    defined         by an opaque mask limiting                            travel        distance
   of the        infrared         emitted           by the motion detector                        22.    In
   the software approach,                        the predefined                area is         defined
   by an instruction                   that      is     transmitted             from the mobile
   device        300 to the DALI compatible                            lighting          controller
15 100,       and that         is  utilized             by the processing                  unit       4 to
   determine whether the result                              of detection           conforms with
   the predetermined condition.
         When the processing unit 4 determines                                          in step S01
   that a current result of detection conforms with the
20 predeterminedcondition,                           step      S02 isperformed,                inwhich

   to which operation                   of the prearranged                   lighting          device
   is   to be switched                (from a current               operating           state)      . It
   is   worthy to note that                  light       emitted        by the prearranged
   lighting device is brighter                             in the second state                     than
 5 in     the     first        state        in     this       embodiment               (e.g.,        the
   prearranged             lighting           device         may     be     turned         off     when
   operating in the                  first state),               but implementation of
   the lighting            of the prearranged                  lighting          device in         each
   of the states            is   not limited            thereto.         On the other            hand,
10 step     S01 is      performed once again when the determination
   made in        step       S01     is negative.
          After      transmitting              the first          switching command via
   the DALI bus 200 to                    the prearranged lighting device,
   the processing unit                     4    controls the              timer        3    to   start
15 measuring elapsed                 time as shown in              step     S03.     Thereafter,
   in   step     S04,     the processing              unit      4 makes a determination
   as to whether a current                       result        of detection               generated
   by the detecting               unit     2 conforms with the predetermined
   condition.           When a result               of the determination                       made in
20 step      S04 is      affirmative,              a flow of this               control         scheme
   proceeds to             step S05,           in which the processing unit                              4
   resets       the timer 3 (i.e.,                make the elapsed                time measured
   thereby return               to zero),           and then the processing                        unit
   4 controls the                timer 3 to           restart the measurement of
25 elapsed          time       as      shown       in      step       S03      and       makes        the
   determinationas                showninstepS04 once again. Otherwise,
   when the result                of the determination                      made in         step      S04

                                                       10
   is      negative,            step       S06      is     performed,          in    which         the
   processing             unit      4 determines whether the elapsed                            time
   measured thus far                  by the timer 3 is             greater        than a first
   duration. When it                    is determined in step S06 that                             the
 5 elapsed time measured thus                              far by the timer 3 is not
   greater          than the first              duration,          the flow goes back to
   step       S04.      On the other             hand,       when it      is   determined            in
   step       S06 that         the elapsed            time measured thus far                 by the
   timer 3 is             greater than the first                      duration,          the flow
10 of this          control         scheme proceeds               to step       S07,     in   which
   the       processing            unit       4   transmits          a   second        switching
   command that             is   associatedwith                the prearrangedlighting
   device via            the DALI bus 200 to the prearranged                            lighting
   device          so    as    to    switch        operation         of the        prearranged
15 lightingdevice                 fromthe second state                  to the first        state.
   In       this       embodiment,              the       second       switching           command
   indicates            the first         state       as a state        to which operation
   of the prearranged lighting device is to be                                          switched
    (from a          current         operating            state).       Subsequently, the
20 processing             unit      4 resets          the timer 3 in            step     S08,      and
   the       flow of the             control         scheme       returns        to   step     S01.
           Referring           to Figures 3A and 3B,                   another embodiment
   of the control                 scheme of the DALI compatible                         lighting
   controller                100       according              to    the      disclosure              is
25 illustrated.                Said another              embodiment          of the        control
   scheme includes                  steps       Sl      to S24.      Since earlier            steps
    (i.e.,        step      Sl      to S16)        in    said    another embodiment                  of

   the     control         scheme           is   similar to            steps         S01   to    S06
   respectively,                 which         are    explained             in      the    previous
   embodiment             of       the        control          scheme,           some      repeated
   descriptions            thereof           are omitted for the sake of brevity,
 5 and introduction                 to said       another embodiment thus starts
   from step          S17       hereafter.
         When it is determined by the processing unit 4 in
   step     S16 that         the elapsed            time measured thus far                      by the
   timer 3 is           greater than the first                         duration,            step S17
10 is   performed,            in    which the processing                     unit      4 transmits
   a third        switching command that                         is   associated           with the
   prearranged           lighting             device via          the DALI bus 200 to the
   prearranged            lighting            device so as to switch operation
   of the prearranged                  lighting        device from the second state
15 to a third       state.         In this       embodiment,            the third        switching
   command indicates                    the third          state       as a      state      to which
   operation         of the prearranged                      lighting          device is          to be
   switched          (from        a     current        operating             state).         In    this
   embodiment,              the        light       emitted           by     the        prearranged
20 lighting device                  is brighter             in the        second state             than
   in    the third         state,           and is    brighter           in    the third         state
   than in       the first           state.       However,          implementation of the
   lighting        of the prearranged                    lighting           device in         each of
   the states may vary in other embodiments, and is not
25 limited what              are disclosed herein.
         Next,      the processing unit 4 resets                                 the timer 3 as
   shown      in   step        18,     and controls              the timer 3 to restart

                                       12
   the measurement of elapsed time as shown in               step S19.
   Afterwards, a flow of said another embodiment of the
   control    scheme     proceeds      to  step   S20,  in which     the
   processing unit        4 makes another determination as to
 5 whether a current result          of detection generated by the
   detecting     unit     2  conforms      with   the  predetermined
   condition.
        When a result     of the another determination made in
   step S20 is     affirmative,       the processing unit 4 resets
10 the timer 3 as shown in       step S21,     and the flow goes back
   to step S12,     in   which the processing unit 4 transmits
   the first   switching command via the DALI bus 200 to the
   prearranged lighting        device so as to switch operation
   of the prearranged lighting           device from the third   state
15 to the second state.
        On the other hand, when the result of the another
   determination made in step S20              is negative, step S22
   is performed,      in which the processing unit 4 determines
   whether the elapsed time measured thus far by the timer
20 3isgreater     than asecondduration. When it is determined
   in   step S22 that the elapsed time measured thus far by
   the timer 3 is not greater than the second duration,
   the flow goes back to step S20.             Otherwise,  when it     is
   determined in       step S22 that the elapsed time measured
25 thus farby the timer3isgreater            than the secondduration,
   step S23 is     performed,     in   which the processing unit 4
   transmits the second switching command via the DALI bus

                                                     13
   200 to the prearranged                     lighting           device        so as to switch
   operation        of the prearranged                     lighting          devices 400 from
   the third        state          to    the      first       state.
          Succeedingly,               in   step       S24,       the     processing unit                  4
 5 resets       the     timer          3,     and      the       flow       of     said       another
   embodiment         of the control                  scheme        returns          to step         Sl.
          It  should be noted that                   the DALI compatible lighting
   controller         100 has a built-in                      sensing function                   (i.e.,
