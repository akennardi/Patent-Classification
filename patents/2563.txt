      PAPER SHEET STORAGE CASSETTE AND PAPER SHEET HANDLING MACHINE
                                      TECHNICAL FIELD
   [0001]
 5 The present invention relates to a paper sheet storage cassette which is portable and in
   which paper sheets such as banknotes are stacked in a layered state, and a paper sheet
   handling machine to which the paper sheet storage cassette is detachably mounted.
                                      BACKGROUND ART
10 [0002]
   To date, various types of paper sheet storage cassettes have been known as paper sheet
   storage cassettes which is portable and in which paper sheets such as banknotes are
   stacked in a layered state.   For example, Japanese Patent No. 5363531 (JP5363531 B)
   discloses a technique in which a spiral stacking wheel is provided near an inlet in a paper
15 sheet storage cassette, and paper sheets inserted through the inlet into the paper sheet
   storage cassette from the outside are each stored between blades of the stacking wheel,
   and thereafter stacked onto an ascending/descending stage from the stacking wheel, to
   stack the paper sheets on the ascending/descending stage in an aligned state.      In such a
   paper sheet storage cassette, in a case where a paper sheet is inserted along the its long
20 edge through the inlet into the paper sheet storage cassette from the outside, a region
   (so-called paper sheet passing region) through which a paper sheet stored between the
   blades of the stacking wheel passes when the paper sheet is sent onto the
   ascending/descending stage by the stacking wheel, needs to be formed near the stacking
   wheel.   More specifically, such a paper sheet passing region is formed between the
25 stacking wheel and an inner wall on a side facing the inlet, among inner walls of the paper
   sheet storage cassette.    Unless such a paper sheet passing region is formed near the
   stacking wheel in the paper sheet storage cassette, when a paper sheet is sent onto the
   ascending/descending stage by the stacking wheel, the paper sheet stored between the
   blades of the stacking wheel collides with the inner wall of the paper sheet storage
30 cassette, and the paper sheet is thus greatly curved, so that paper sheets cannot be

                                                2
   stacked on the ascending/descending stage in an aligned state.     Furthermore, also in a
   paper sheet storage cassette in which a paper sheet is inserted along its short edge
   through an inlet into the paper sheet storage cassette from the outside, a problem arises
   that, when the paper sheet storage cassette is transported, the end edge, on the short
 5 edge side, of a paper sheet stacked on an ascending/descending stage is moved so as to
   be distant from the ascending/descending stage, and the paper sheets stacked on the
   ascending/descending stage in a layered state may become misaligned.
                                 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
10 [0003]
   In a case where the paper sheet passing region is thus formed in the paper sheet storage
   cassette, a problem arises that, when the paper sheet storage cassette is transported, a
   paper sheet stacked on the ascending/descending stage is moved toward the upper
   portion of the paper sheet passing region (that is, moved so as to be distant from the
15 ascending/descending       stage),  and     the   paper    sheets    stacked     on    the
   ascending/descending stage in a layered state may become greatly misaligned.
   [0004]
   The present invention is made in view of such a problem, and an object of the present
   invention is to provide a paper sheet storage cassette which can prevent paper sheets
20 stacked on a stacking unit in a layered state from becoming greatly misaligned when
   transported, and a paper sheet handling machine to which the paper sheet storage
   cassette is detachably mounted.
   [0005]
   A paper sheet storage cassette of the present invention is portable and includes: an inlet,
25 provided in the paper sheet storage cassette, through which a paper sheet is inserted into
   the paper sheet storage cassette from the outside; a stacking unit, provided inside the
   paper sheet storage cassette, on which paper sheets inserted through the inlet into the
   paper sheet storage cassette from the outside are stacked in a layered state, the stacking
   unit configured to move along a direction in which the paper sheets are stacked; and a
30 stacking wheel configured to send paper sheets inserted through the inlet into the paper

                                                   3
   sheet storage cassette from the outside, one by one, to the stacking unit, the stacking
   wheel including a base body that rotates about a shaft, and a plurality of blades which
   extend outward from an outer circumferential surface of the base body in a direction
   opposite to a direction of rotation of the base body, the stacking wheel configured to send
 5 paper sheets stored between the blades into the stacking unit, a paper sheet passing
   space through which paper sheets to be sent into the stacking unit by the stacking wheel
   pass, the paper sheet passing space being formed near the stacking wheel inside the
   paper sheet storage cassette; and an inhibiting portion configured to inhibit a paper sheet
   stacked on the stacking unit from being moved toward the paper sheet passing space.
10 [0006]
   In the paper sheet storage cassette of the present invention, the inhibiting portion may be
   provided in a portion facing the stacking wheel, of an inner wall of the paper sheet storage
   cassette.
   [0007]
15 In the paper sheet storage cassette of the present invention, the inhibiting portion may be
   provided in a portion, of the inner wall of the paper sheet storage cassette, which faces an
   edge, on a short edge side, of a paper sheet to be sent into the stacking unit by the
   stacking wheel.
   [0008]
20 In the paper sheet storage cassette of the present invention, the inhibiting portion may be
   disposed above a lower end of a blade passing region through which each blade of the
   stacking wheel passes.
   [0009]
   In the paper sheet storage cassette of the present invention, the inhibiting portion may
25 have one or more groove portions formed in the inner wall of the paper sheet storage
   cassette, and at least a part of each of the one or more groove portions may form a
   stepped shape by which an edge of a paper sheet can be caught when the paper sheet
   stacked in the stacking unit is moved toward the paper sheet passing space.
   [0010]
30 In this case, the one or more groove portions may be provided so as to be aligned along a

                                                   4
   direction in which paper sheets are stacked in the stacking unit.
   [0011]
   Furthermore, the one or more groove portions may be each formed so as to be a straight
   line that extends almost parallel to a direction in which the shaft of the stacking wheel
 5 extends.
   [0012]
   Furthermore, the one or more groove portions may each include a tilted surface that is
   tilted relative to a direction in which paper sheets are stacked in the stacking unit.
   [0013]
10 In the paper sheet storage cassette of the present invention, the inhibiting portion may
   have a projection that is disposed on the inner wall of the paper sheet storage cassette,
   and that projects from the inner wall toward the paper sheet passing space, and at least a
   part of the projection may form a stepped shape by which an edge of a paper sheet can
   be caught when the paper sheet stacked on the stacking unit is moved toward the paper
15 sheet passing space.
   [0014]
   In this case, a plurality of the projections may be provided so as to be aligned along a
   direction in which paper sheets are stacked in the stacking unit.
   [0015]
20 In the paper sheet storage cassette of the present invention, the inhibiting portion may
   have a guide member that is movable between an advanced position at which the guide
   member advances to the paper sheet passing space and a retracted position at which the
   guide member retracts from the paper sheet passing space, and the guide member may
   inhibit a paper sheet stacked in the stacking unit from being moved toward the paper
25 sheet passing space when the guide member is positioned at the advanced position.
   [0016]
   In the paper sheet storage cassette of the present invention, the inhibiting portion may
   comprise a frictional material that causes a friction force such that, when a paper sheet
   stacked in the stacking unit is moved toward the paper sheet passing space, the friction
30 force caused between the paper sheet and the frictional material is higher than a friction

                                                  5
   force caused between the paper sheet and a material of the inner wall of the paper sheet
   storage cassette.
   [0017]
   In the paper sheet storage cassette of the present invention, the inhibiting portion may
 5 have a pressing member that presses paper sheets stacked in the stacking unit in a
   layered state toward the stacking unit.
   [0018]
   In this case, the pressing member may comprise a frictional material that causes a friction
   force such that a friction force caused between the frictional material and one or more
10 paper sheets stacked in the stacking unit and pressed by the pressing member is higher
   than a friction force caused between a material of the inner wall of the paper sheet
   storage cassette, and the one or more paper sheets pressed by the pressing member.
   [0019]
   In the paper sheet storage cassette of the present invention, paper sheets stacked in the
15 stacking unit in a layered state may be pressed by the stacking unit toward the stacking
   wheel when the paper sheet storage cassette is transported.
   [0020]
   A paper sheet handling machine of the present invention is a paper sheet handling
   machine to which the paper sheet storage cassette as described above is detachably
20 mounted, and a paper sheet is transported through the inlet of the paper sheet storage
   cassette from the paper sheet handling machine into the paper sheet storage cassette.

   [0023]
25 The money handling system according to the present embodiment is disposed in stores
   such as supermarkets and convenience stores, and performs depositing of banknotes and
   coins as sales proceeds and dispensing of banknotes and coins as changes. As shown
   in FIG. 1, the money handling system according to the present embodiment includes a
   banknote handling machine 1 and a coin handling machine 101 that are aligned in the left
30 right direction.   Furthermore, a POS register (not shown) is connected to the banknote

                                                  8
   handling machine 1 by means of a LAN or the like such that the POS register and the
   banknote handling machine 1 can communicate with each other.                  Furthermore, a
   settlement counter (table or counter) that partitions a clerk and a customer from each
   other is disposed in a settlement place in the store, and the clerk waits on one side of the
 5 settlement counter. The POS register is disposed, in many cases, on the side on which
   a clerk waits so as to allow the clerk to operate the POS register.   Meanwhile, a customer
   stands on the other side of the settlement counter, and places, on the settlement counter,
   commodities to be purchased.       The clerk registers, in the POS register, the commodity
   numbers and prices of the commodities placed on the settlement counter.          Furthermore,
10 the clerk receives money from the customer, and inserts the money into the money
   handling system.     Such a money handling system will be described below in detail.
   [0024]
   Firstly, a structure of the banknote handling machine 1 will be described in detail with
   reference to FIG. 2.    The right side surface of a housing 1a (described below) in FIG. 2
15 corresponds to the front side surface of the banknote handling machine 1 (that is, the front
   side surface of the banknote handling machine 1 as viewed from the front side thereof as
   shown in FIG. 1), and the leftward direction in FIG. 2 is a depth direction of the housing 1a.
   [0025]
   As shown in FIG. 2, the banknote handling machine 1 has the housing 1a that is almost
20 rectangular-parallelepiped-shaped.      Furthermore, the banknote handling machine 1 has
   an upper assembly 2 and a lower assembly 3. The upper assembly 2 includes: a
   banknote inlet unit 10 through which a banknote is inserted into the housing 1a from the
   outside; a transport unit 12 that transports the banknote inserted into the housing 1a
   through the banknote inlet unit 10; a recognition unit 14 that is disposed in the transport
25 unit 12 and recognizes the banknote transported by the transport unit 12; and a banknote
   outlet unit 16 through which the banknote is discharged from the inside of the housing 1a
   to the outside.
   [0026]
   The banknote inlet unit 10 includes a plurality of rollers such as feed rollers and kicker
30 rollers, and banknotes which are placed in the banknote inlet unit 10 in a layered state by

                                                 9
   an operator are kicked from the lowermost banknote, one by one, by the kicker rollers
   toward the feed rollers, and the kicked banknotes are fed one by one into the housing 1a
   by the feed rollers.   The banknotes fed into the housing 1a by the banknote inlet unit 10
   are transported one by one by the transport unit 12.        In the present embodiment, the
 5 banknotes are fed along the long edge of each banknote from the banknote inlet unit 10
   into the transport unit 12, and the banknotes are transported along the long edge of each
   banknote in the transport unit 12.        Furthermore, the recognition unit 14 performs
   recognition of a denomination, authenticity, fitness/unfitness, old/new version, face/back,
   transport state, and the like of each banknote transported by the transport unit 12.    The
10 banknotes recognized by the recognition unit 14 are transported by the transport unit 12
   into storage/feeding units 20 described below according to, for example, each
   denomination.
   [0027]
   In diverging portions of the transport unit 12, diverting members (not shown) such as
15 diverters, respectively, are provided, and a destination to which the banknote is
   transported is determined in the diverging portion by means of the diverting member.
   Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 2, banknote detection sensors 12a for detecting each
   banknote transported by the transport unit 12 are provided in various portions of the
   transport unit 12.   Each banknote detection sensor 12a includes, for example, an optical
20 sensor that has a light emitting element and a light receiving element.          When light
   emitted from the light emitting element is blocked by a banknote transported by the
   transport unit 12 and is not received by the light receiving element, the banknote is
   detected by the banknote detection sensor 12a.        Detection information of the banknote
   detected by each banknote detection sensor 12a is transmitted to a control unit 60
25 described below.     Furthermore, the control unit 60 determines whether or not a distance
   between a plurality of banknotes transported by the transport unit 12 is a predetermined
   distance, on the basis of the detection results for the banknotes detected by the banknote
   detection sensors 12a.     In a case where the control unit 60 determines that the distance
   between the plurality of banknotes transported by the transport unit 12 is greatly different
30 from the predetermined distance, occurrence of abnormality in transporting such as skew,

                                                10
   overlapping, or chaining is detected for a banknote transported by the transport unit 12.
   [0028]
   Further, in the upper assembly 2, two banknote storage units 18, 19 (capture bins) are
   connected to the transport unit 12.     Each of the banknote storage units 18, 19 stores
 5 banknotes transported by the transport unit 12.        However, banknotes stored in the
   banknote storage units 18, 19 cannot be fed from the banknote storage units 18, 19 into
   the transport unit 12.   Furthermore, the banknote storage units 18, 19 are positioned
   such that banknotes can be transported into the banknote storage units 18, 19 from the
   transport unit 12 in both banknote depositing and banknote dispensing.      Furthermore, in
10 the present embodiment, in one of the two banknote storage units 18, 19 (for example, the
   banknote storage unit 19 closer to the banknote outlet unit 16), at least one of a
   counterfeit note and a suspect note is stored.   Furthermore, in the other of the banknote
   storage units (for example, the banknote storage unit 18 that is farther from the banknote
   outlet unit 16), banknotes (specifically, for example, banknotes that are abnormally
15 transported) that are fed from the storage/feeding units 20 described below into the
   transport unit 12 but cannot be discharged to the outside of the housing la by the
   banknote outlet unit 16 when banknote dispensing is performed, are stored.
   [0029]
   Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 2, the transport unit 12 is provided so as to extend over
20 both the upper assembly 2 and the lower assembly 3, and a plurality (four in the example
   shown in FIG. 2) of the storage/feeding units 20 are connected to the transport unit 12 in
   the lower assembly 3.     The storage/feeding units 20 are aligned in parallel with each
   other along the height direction of the banknote handling machine 1. Furthermore, each
   storage/feeding unit 20 stores banknotes transported from the transport unit 12, and can
25 feed the stored banknotes one by one into the transport unit 12.      More specifically, the
   uppermost storage/feeding unit 20 and the lowermost storage/feeding unit 20, among the
   four storage/feeding units 20, have banknote storing mechanisms 22, respectively, each
   having one drum 22a, and the banknotes transported by the transport unit 12 are each
   sandwiched between paired tapes one by one and the tapes are wound onto the drum
30 22a together with the sandwiched banknote.      Furthermore, when the drum 22a rotates in

                                               11
   a direction opposite to the tape winding direction, the tapes are unwound from the drum
   22a and the banknotes each sandwiched between the paired tapes are fed one by one
   into the transport unit 12.  Furthermore, each of the second storage/feeding unit 20 and
   the third storage/feeding unit 20, among the four storage/feeding units 20, which are
 5 counted from the uppermost one, includes two banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26
   having different maximum banknote storage capacities, respectively, and the banknote
   storing mechanisms 24 and 26 have drums 24a and 26a, respectively. Specifically, in
   the banknote storing mechanism 24, 26, the banknotes transported from the transport unit
   12 are each sandwiched between paired tapes one by one, and the tapes are wound onto
10 the drum 24a, 26a together with the sandwiched banknote.      Furthermore, when the drum
   24a, 26a rotates in a direction opposite to the tape winding direction, the tapes are
   unwound from the drum 24a, 26a, and the banknotes each sandwiched between the
   paired tapes are fed one by one into the transport unit 12.   The length of the tape that is
   wound onto the drum 26a is greater than the length of the tape that is wound onto the
15 drum 24a.    Thus, the maximum storage number of banknotes in the drum 26a is greater
   than the maximum storage number of banknotes in the drum 24a.              Specifically, the
   maximum storage number of banknotes in the banknote storing mechanism 24 is, for
   example, 100, whereas the maximum storage number of banknotes in the banknote
   storing mechanism 26 is 200.
20 [0030]
   Furthermore, in the lower assembly 3, a collection unit 40 is provided in the transport unit
   12, and the collection unit 40 is used when banknotes stored in the storage/feeding units
   20 are collected.     More specifically, a banknote collection cassette 42 that stores
   banknotes in a layered state is detachably mounted to the collection unit 40, and
25 banknotes transported from the storage/feeding units 20 through the transport unit 12 into
   the collection unit 40 are stored in the banknote collection cassette 42.      Furthermore,
   banknotes of denominations that are not assigned to the storage/feeding units 20, and
   overflow banknotes that cannot be stored in the storage/feeding unit 20 for the
   corresponding denomination since the storage/feeding unit 20 therefor is full, are also
30 stored in the banknote collection cassette 42 mounted to the collection unit 40.        The

                                                 12
   banknotes are collected together with the banknote collection cassette 42 from the
   banknote handling machine 1 by the banknote collection cassette 42 being taken out from
   the collection unit 40.    The structure of the banknote collection cassette 42 will be
   described below in detail.
 5 [0031]
   Furthermore, in the banknote handling machine 1 according to the present embodiment,
   the lower assembly 3 is structured as a safe housing the inside of which is accessible only
   by an operator who has a predetermined access right.         More specifically, a security
   transport company is authorized to manage the banknotes stored in the storage/feeding
10 units 20 and the collection unit 40 inside the lower assembly 3, and only a guard of the
   security transport company is allowed to open a door (not shown) of the lower assembly 3
   and access the inside of the lower assembly 3. Specifically, a locking mechanism (not
   shown) for locking the door of the lower assembly 3 in a closed state is provided, and a
   key and a PIN number for unlocking the door locked by the locking mechanism are
15 provided only to an operator (for example, a guard of a security transport company) who is
   allowed to access the inside of the lower assembly 3. Thus, the banknote collection
   cassette 42 mounted to the collection unit 40 can be collected from the inside of the lower
   assembly 3, only by the guard of the security transport company.      That is, the clerks of
   the store and the like are not allowed to access the inside of the lower assembly 3 and
20 take out banknotes stored in the storage/feeding units 20 and the collection unit 40.
   Thus, the security for preventing banknotes stored in the storage/feeding units 20 and the
   collection unit 40 from being stolen, can be enhanced.
   [0032]
   As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the banknote outlet unit 16 has a shutter mechanism 17
25 that opens and closes the outlet for banknotes in the banknote outlet unit 16.    As shown
   in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, in a case where the outlet for banknotes in the banknote outlet unit
   16 is closed by the shutter mechanism 17, an operator is not allowed to take out
   banknotes that are transported from the transport unit 12 into the banknote outlet unit 16,
   from the banknote outlet unit 16, to the outside of the housing la, when banknote
30 dispensing is performed.    Meanwhile, in a case where the outlet for the banknotes in the

                                                13
   banknote outlet unit 16 is opened by the shutter mechanism 17, an operator is allowed to
   take out banknotes transported from the transport unit 12 into the banknote outlet unit 16,
   from the banknote outlet unit 16, to the outside of the housing la. When the banknote
   handling machine 1 is in a stand-by state, the outlet for banknotes in the banknote outlet
 5 unit 16 is closed by the shutter mechanism 17.
   [0033]
   Next, a structure of the coin handling machine 101 will be briefly described in detail. The
   coin handling machine 101        includes: a housing 101a that is almost rectangular
   parallelepiped-shaped; a coin inlet unit 110 through which coins are inserted into the
10 housing 101a from the outside; and a coin outlet unit 172 through which coins are
   discharged from the inside of the housing 101a to the outside.      Furthermore, inside the
   housing 101a, a recognition unit (not shown) that recognizes coins inserted into the
   housing 101a by the coin inlet unit 110, and a plurality of storage/feeding units (not
   shown) in which coins recognized by the recognition unit are stored for each denomination,
15 are disposed. Coins fed from the storage/feeding units are discharged from the inside of
   the housing 101a to the outside by the coin outlet unit 172.        Furthermore, inside the
   housing 101a, a collection box (not shown) used as an overflow coin storage unit is
   disposed. The collection box can be horizontally extracted toward the front side from a
   collection box storage unit (not shown) provided in the lower portion of the housing 101a.
20 In such a collection box, overflow coins that cannot be stored in the storage/feeding units,
   and coins that are fed from the storage/feeding units and are to be collected, are stored.
   After the coins are stored in the collection box, when a guard of a security transport
   company or the like extracts the collection box toward the front side from the collection
   box storage unit, the guard or the like is allowed to collect the coins together with the
25 collection box.
   [0034]
   Next, a structure of a control system of the banknote handling machine 1 according to the
   present embodiment will be briefly described.    As shown in FIG. 2, inside the housing 1a
   of the banknote handling machine 1, the control unit 60 is provided, and the control unit 60
30 controls the components of the banknote handling machine 1. More specifically, to the

                                                  14
   control unit 60, the banknote inlet unit 10, the transport unit 12, the banknote detection
   sensors 12a, the recognition unit 14, the shutter mechanism 17, the storage/feeding units
   20, and the like are connected.     Signals based on results of banknote recognition by the
   recognition unit 14, and signals based on results of banknote detection by the banknote
 5 detection sensors 12a are transmitted to the control unit 60.        Furthermore, the control
   unit 60 transmits instruction signals to the components such as the banknote inlet unit 10,
   the transport unit 12, the shutter mechanism 17, and the storage/feeding units 20 to
   control the components.      Furthermore, an operation/display unit (not shown) such as a
   touch panel is provided on the front surface or the upper surface of the housing 1a of the
10 banknote handling machine 1, and the operation/display unit is also connected to the
   control unit 60.  On such an operation/display unit, for example, information representing:
   handling state of banknotes and coins in the banknote handling machine 1 and the coin
   handling machine 101; inventory amounts, for each denomination, of banknotes and coins
   stored in each storage/feeding unit 20 of the banknote handling machine 1 and each
15 storage/feeding unit of the coin handling machine 101; or the like, is displayed.
   Furthermore, an operator is allowed to input various instructions to the control unit 60
   through the operation/display unit.
   [0035]
   Next, a structure of the banknote collection cassette 42 that is detachably mounted to the
20 collection unit 40 will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 3 to FIG. 5.  As shown
   in FIG. 3 and the like, the banknote collection cassette 42 according to the present
   embodiment includes: a casing 42a that is almost rectangular-parallelepiped-shaped; and
   an inlet 43 through which banknotes are inserted into the casing 42a from the outside.
   The inlet 43 is formed in the upper portion of the side surface of the casing 42a.      When
25 the banknote collection cassette 42 is mounted to the collection unit 40, banknotes
   transported from the transport unit 12 into the collection unit 40 are inserted through the
   inlet 43 into the casing 42a of the banknote collection cassette 42.           In the present
   embodiment, banknotes are transported along their long edges in the transport unit 12,
   and the banknotes are transported into the casing 42a along their long edges through the
30 inlet 43 of the banknote collection cassette 42.      Furthermore, inside the casing 42a, an

                                                  15
   ascending/descending stage 46 (stacking unit), on which banknotes inserted through the
   inlet 43 into the casing 42a from the outside are stacked in a layered state, is provided,
   and the ascending/descending stage 46 moves along the banknote stacking direction
   (that is, the up-down direction in FIG. 3).      More specifically, each time a banknote is
 5 stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46, the ascending/descending stage 46
   descends over a short distance.         Thus, a space in which banknotes are stacked is
   formed between a stacking wheel 44 described below, and the ascending/descending
   stage 46.
   [0036]
10 Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 3, in an upper region inside the casing 42a, the stacking
   wheel 44 for sending banknotes that are inserted through the inlet 43 into the casing 42a
   from the outside, one by one, onto the ascending/descending stage 46 is provided.        More
   specifically, the stacking wheel 44 rotates about a shaft 44a that is orthogonal to the sheet
   surface of FIG. 3, in the clockwise direction shown in FIG. 3.      Furthermore, as shown in
15 FIG. 4, the stacking wheel 44 includes: a base body 44b that rotates about the shaft 44a;
   and a plurality of blades 44c that extend outward from the outer circumferential surface of
   the base body 44b in a direction (that is, in the counterclockwise direction in FIG. 3)
   opposite to a direction of rotation of the base body 44b. The blades 44c are equally
   spaced from each other on the outer circumferential surface of the base body 44b.       While
20 the banknote handling machine 1 operates, the stacking wheel 44 is rotated about the
   shaft 44a in the clockwise direction shown in FIG. 3, by a driving force transmitted from
   the main body of the banknote handling machine 1 to the banknote collection cassette 42.
   Banknotes are transported one by one to the stacking wheel 44 from the inlet 43.          The
   stacking wheel 44 receives, between the two blades 44c, a banknote transported from the
25 inlet 43, and sends, to the ascending/descending stage 46, the banknote received
   between the blades 44c.      At this time, the end portion of the banknote received between
   the blades 44c of the stacking wheel 44 passes through a banknote passing space 48
   (described below) formed lateral to the stacking wheel 44.              More specifically, as
   described above, since a banknote is transported along its long edge through the inlet 43
30 of the banknote collection cassette 42 into the casing 42a, the edge, on one of the short

                                                 16
   edge sides, of the banknote received between the blades 44c of the stacking wheel 44
   deeply enters between the blades 44c, and a portion, of the same banknote, near the
   edge on the other of the short edge sides passes through the banknote passing space 48.
   The stacking wheel 44 thus allows banknotes to be stacked on the ascending/descending
 5 stage 46 in an aligned state.
   [0037]
   As shown in FIG. 3, the banknote passing space 48 through which a banknote sent onto
   the ascending/descending stage 46 by the stacking wheel 44 passes is formed between
   the stacking wheel 44 and an inner wall 49 that is among inner walls positioned lateral to
10 the internal space of the casing 42a and that faces an inner wall in which the inlet 43 is
   formed.   This is because, unless the banknote passing space 48 is formed near the
   stacking wheel 44 inside the banknote collection cassette 42, when the banknote is sent
   onto the ascending/descending stage 46 by the stacking wheel 44, the banknote stored
   between the blades 44c of the stacking wheel 44 collides with the inner wall 49, so that
15 the   banknote is greatly curved,         and banknotes       cannot be stacked       on   the
   ascending/descending stage 46 in an aligned state.              Furthermore, in the present
   embodiment,      an  inhibiting portion 50 that inhibits      a banknote stacked       on the
   ascending/descending stage 46 from being moved toward the upper portion of the
   banknote passing space 48 when the banknote collection cassette 42 is taken out from
20 the banknote handling machine 1 and the banknote collection cassette 42 is transported,
   is provided near the banknote passing space 48.
   [0038]
   The inhibiting portion 50 is provided in a portion, facing the stacking wheel 44, of the inner
   wall 49 which is among the inner walls of the casing 42a and which faces the inner wall in
25 which the inlet 43 is provided.    More specifically, the inhibiting portion 50 has a plurality
   (specifically, for example, two) of groove portions 50a that are aligned along a direction
   (specifically, the up-down direction in FIG. 3) in which the banknotes are stacked on the
   ascending/descending stage 46.       Furthermore, at least a part of each groove portion 50a
   forms a stepped shape by which the edge of a banknote can be caught when the
30 banknote stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 is moved toward the banknote

                                                   17
   passing space 48.      More specifically, each groove portion 50a has: a straight line portion
   50b that extends along a direction in which banknotes are stacked on the
   ascending/descending stage 46; a catching portion 50c that laterally extends from the
   upper end of the straight line portion 50b; and a tilted surface 50d that extends diagonally
 5 downward from the lower end of the straight line portion 50b.        Furthermore, each groove
   portion 50a is formed so as to be a straight line that extends almost parallel to a direction
   (that is, direction orthogonal to the sheet surface of FIG. 3) in which the shaft 44a of the
   stacking wheel 44 extends.      Specifically, each groove portion 50a extends over the entire
   length, of an internal region of the casing 42a, in a direction in which the shaft 44a of the
10 stacking wheel 44 extends.       Each of the groove portions 50a is structured such that,
   since the tilted surface 50d is tilted relative to a direction in which banknotes are stacked
   on the ascending/descending stage 46, when the banknote transported from the inlet 43 is
   received between the two blades 44c and the banknote received between the blades 44c
   is sent onto the ascending/descending stage 46, even if the edge, on the short edge side,
15 of the banknote received between the two blades 44c hits against the inner wall 49 of the
   casing 42a, the edge portion of the banknote is sent along the tilted surface 50d onto the
   ascending/descending stage 46, so that the banknote can be prevented from being
   caught by each groove portion 50a.
   [0039]
20 The inhibiting portion 50 having the plurality (specifically, for example, two) of groove
   portions 50a is provided in a portion, of the inner wall 49 of the casing 42a, which faces
   the edge, on the short edge side, of a banknote sent onto the ascending/descending
   stage 46 by the stacking wheel 44.        Furthermore, the inhibiting portion 50 is disposed
   above the lower end of a blade passing region (represented by a reference character R in
25 FIG. 3) through which each blade 44c of the stacking wheel 44 passes.
   [0040]
   The inhibiting portion 50 is thus provided in the inner wall 49 of the casing 42a.
   Therefore, when the banknote collection cassette 42 is taken out from the banknote
   handling machine 1 and the banknote collection cassette 42 is transported, a banknote
30 stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 is inhibited from being moved toward the

                                                  18
   upper portion of the banknote passing space 48. This will be described with reference to
   FIG. 4 and FIG. 5.
   [0041]
   In a case where the banknote collection cassette 42 is taken out from the banknote
 5 handling machine 1 and the banknote collection cassette 42 is transported, the
   ascending/descending stage 46 is moved upward to press the banknotes stacked on the
   ascending/descending stage 46 in a layered state toward the stacking wheel 44 (see FIG.
   4).   Thus, when the banknote collection cassette 42 is transported, a plurality of
   banknotes in the layered state are sandwiched and pressed between the stacking wheel
10 44 and the ascending/descending stage 46, whereby the banknotes stacked on the
   ascending/descending stage 46 can be inhibited from becoming misaligned and being
   stacked in the misaligned state.       However, even if the plurality of banknotes in the
   layered state are thus sandwiched and pressed between the stacking wheel 44 and the
   ascending/descending stage 46, the banknotes (in particular, one or more of the
15 banknotes on the stacking wheel 44 side) stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46
   are misaligned and stacked in the misaligned state in some cases. Meanwhile, in the
   present embodiment, since the inhibiting portion 50 is provided in the inner wall 49 of the
   casing 42a, even if banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 are
   misaligned and one or more of the banknotes on the stacking wheel 44 side are moved
20 toward the banknote passing space 48, the edge of the banknote can be caught by the
   groove portions 50a (more specifically, the catching portion 50c of each groove portion
   50a) of the inhibiting portion 50 as shown in FIG. 5, whereby the banknote can be
   inhibited from being moved to the upper portion of the banknote passing space 48.
   [0042]
25 For comparison, a banknote collection cassette 42p, of conventional art, in which the
   inhibiting portion 50 is not provided in the inner wall 49 will be described with reference to
   FIG. 6.    The banknote collection cassette 42p as shown in FIG. 6 is such that, in a case
   where the banknote collection cassette 42p is taken out from the banknote handling
   machine 1 and the banknote collection cassette 42p is transported, if the banknotes
30 stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 are misaligned and one or more of the

                                                 19
   banknotes on the stacking wheel 44 side are moved toward the banknote passing space
   48, the banknotes are moved to the upper portion of the banknote passing space 48,
   whereby the banknotes in the casing 42a are greatly misaligned.            Meanwhile, in the
   banknote collection cassette 42 according to the present embodiment, the edge of the
 5 banknote can be caught by the groove portion 50a of the inhibiting portion 50, whereby
   the banknote can be inhibited from being moved to the upper portion of the banknote
   passing space 48, and the banknotes inside the casing 42a can be thus prevented from
   being greatly misaligned.
   [0043]
10 The inhibiting portion that inhibits a banknote stacked on the ascending/descending stage
   46 from being moved toward the banknote passing space 48 is not limited to one having
   the structure shown in FIG. 3 to FIG. 5.    As an inhibiting portion that inhibits a banknote
   stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 from being moved toward the banknote
   passing space 48, groove portions having structures shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 may be
15 used.    In an inhibiting portion 52 shown in FIG. 7, groove portions 52a do not have tilted
   surfaces that extend diagonally downward from the lower ends of the straight line portions
   extending along a direction in which banknotes are stacked on the ascending/descending
   stage 46, and each of the groove portions 52a has other straight line portions 52c, 52d
   that laterally extend from the upper end and the lower end, respectively, of a straight line
20 portion 52b extending in the up-down direction.          Furthermore, each of the groove
   portions 52a is formed so as to be a straight line that extends almost parallel to a direction
   in which the shaft 44a of the stacking wheel 44 extends.     Specifically, each of the groove
   portions 52a extends over the entire length, of an internal region of the casing 42a, in a
   direction in which the shaft 44a of the stacking wheel 44 extends.      Also in a case where
25 the inhibiting portion 52 that has the groove portions 52a is thus provided in the inner wall
   49 of the casing 42a, when the banknote collection cassette 42 is taken out from the
   banknote handling machine 1 and the banknote collection cassette 42 is transported,
   even if banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 are misaligned and one
   or more of the banknotes on the stacking wheel 44 side are moved toward the banknote
30 passing space 48, the edge of the banknote can be caught by the groove portion 52a of

                                                  20
   the inhibiting portion 52, whereby the banknote can be inhibited from being moved to the
   upper portion of the banknote passing space 48.
   [0044]
   Furthermore, an inhibiting portion 54 shown in FIG. 8 is structured such that groove
 5 portions 54a do not have straight line portions that extend in a direction in which
   banknotes are stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46, and each of the groove
   portions 54a includes: a catching portion 54b that laterally extends; and a tilted surface
   54c that extends diagonally downward from the end portion, on the depth side, of the
   catching portion 54b.    Furthermore, each of the groove portions 54a is formed so as to
10 be a straight line that extends almost parallel to a direction in which the shaft 44a of the
   stacking wheel 44 extends.      Specifically, each of the groove portions 54a extends over
   the entire length, of an internal region of the casing 42a, in a direction in which the shaft
   44a of the stacking wheel 44 extends. Also in a case where the inhibiting portion 54 that
   has the groove portions 54a is thus provided in the inner wall 49 of the casing 42a, when
15 the banknote collection cassette 42 is taken out from the banknote handling machine 1
   and the banknote collection cassette 42 is transported, even if banknotes stacked on the
   ascending/descending stage 46 are misaligned and one or more of the banknotes on the
   stacking wheel 44 side are moved toward the banknote passing space 48, the edge of the
   banknote can be caught by the groove portion 54a (specifically, catching portion 54b) of
20 the inhibiting portion 54, whereby the banknote can be inhibited from being moved to the
   upper portion of the banknote passing space 48.
   [0045]
   Furthermore,    as an inhibiting portion that inhibits a banknote stacked on the
   ascending/descending stage 46 from being moved toward the banknote passing space 48,
25 a projection that projects from the inner wall 49 toward the banknote passing space 48
   may be used instead of the groove portion provided in the inner wall 49 of the casing 42a.
   A structure of the inhibiting portion having such a projection will be described with
   reference to FIG. 9.
   [0046]
30 A banknote collection cassette 42m according to modification shown in FIG. 9 is

                                                  21
   structured such that an inhibiting portion 56 that includes a plurality (specifically, two) of
   projections 56a projecting from the inner wall 49 toward the banknote passing space 48 is
   provided in the inner wall 49, among inner walls of the banknote collection cassette 42m,
   which faces the stacking wheel 44. The projections 56a are disposed so as to be aligned
 5 in a direction in which banknotes are stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46.
   Furthermore, each projection 56a forms a stepped shape by which the edge of a banknote
   can be caught when the banknote stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 is
   moved toward the banknote passing space 48.                Specifically, each projection 56a
   includes: a tilted surface 56b that is tilted relative to a direction in which banknotes are
10 stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46; and a catching portion 56c that laterally
   extends.    Since the tilted surface 56b is thus provided in each projection 56a, when the
   banknote sent from the inlet 43 is received between the two blades 44c and the banknote
   received between the blades 44c is sent onto the ascending/descending stage 46, the
   edge, on the short edge side, of the banknote received between the two blades 44c can
15 be prevented from being caught by each projection 56a of the inhibiting portion 56.
   Furthermore, in the banknote collection cassette 42m according to modification shown in
   FIG. 9, in a case where the banknote collection cassette 42m is taken out from the
   banknote handling machine 1 and the banknote collection cassette 42m is transported,
   even if banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 are misaligned and one
20 or more of the banknotes on the stacking wheel 44 side are moved toward the banknote
   passing space 48, the edge of the banknote can be caught by the projection 56a
   (specifically, catching portion 56c) of the inhibiting portion 56, whereby the banknote can
   be inhibited from being moved to the upper portion of the banknote passing space 48.
   Each projection 56a of the inhibiting portion 56 may be formed so as to be a straight line
25 that extends almost parallel to a direction in which the shaft 44a of the stacking wheel 44
   extends.    Alternatively, the width of each projection 56a in the direction in which the shaft
   44a of the stacking wheel 44 extends, may be sufficiently small relative to the entire length
   of the internal region of the casing 42a.
   [0047]
30 Furthermore, as still another example of an inhibiting portion that inhibits a banknote

                                                 22
   stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 from being moved toward the banknote
   passing space 48, an inhibiting portion having a guide member that is movable between
   an advanced position at which the guide member advances to the banknote passing
   space 48 and a retracted position at which the guide member retracts from the banknote
 5 passing space 48, may be used.      A structure of the inhibiting portion having such a guide
   member will be described with reference to FIG. 10.
   [0048]
   In a banknote collection cassette 42n according to another modification shown in FIG. 10,
   an inhibiting portion 58 has a guide member 58a that is movable between an advanced
10 position (represented by a solid line in FIG. 10) at which the guide member 58a advances
   to the banknote passing space 48 and a retracted position (represented by an alternate
   long and short dash line in FIG. 10) at which the guide member 58a retracts from the
   banknote passing space 48. When the banknote collection cassette 42n is mounted to
   the collection unit 40, the guide member 58a is positioned at the retracted position.   Thus,
15 when a banknote transported from the inlet 43 is received between the two blades 44c
   and the banknote received between the blades 44c is sent onto the ascending/descending
   stage 46, the edge, on the short edge side, of the banknote received between the two
   blades 44c is not caught by the guide member 58a.           Meanwhile, when the banknote
   collection cassette 42n is taken out from the collection unit 40, the guide member 58a is
20 moved to the advanced position represented by the solid line in FIG. 10.      When the guide
   member 58a is thus positioned at the advanced position, a banknote stacked on the
   ascending/descending stage 46 is inhibited from being moved toward the banknote
   passing space 48.         In the banknote collection cassette 42n according to another
   modification as shown in FIG. 10, when the banknote collection cassette 42n is taken out
25 from the banknote handling machine 1 and the banknote collection cassette 42n is
   transported, a banknote stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 is inhibited, by
   the guide member 58a, from being moved toward the banknote passing space 48,
   whereby a state where the banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 are
   misaligned and one or more of the banknotes on the stacking wheel 44 side are moved
30 toward the upper portion of the banknote passing space 48, can be inhibited.

                                                   23
   [0049]
   Furthermore, in the banknote collection cassettes 42, 42m, 42n described above, each of
   the inhibiting portions 50, 52, 54, 56, 58 may include a frictional material, such as rubber,
   which causes, when a banknote stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 is moved
 5 toward the banknote passing space 48, a high friction force between the frictional material
   and the banknote.      More specifically, a friction force caused between the banknote and
   the frictional material of the inhibiting portion 50, 52, 54, 56, 58 is higher than a friction
   force caused between the banknote and a material of the inner wall of the banknote
   collection cassette 42.     Thus, when the banknote collection cassette 42, 42m, 42n is
10 taken out from the banknote handling machine 1 and the banknote collection cassette 42,
   42m, 42n is transported, even if the banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending
   stage 46 are misaligned and one or more of the banknotes on the stacking wheel 44 side
   are moved toward the banknote passing space 48, the banknote can be inhibited, due to
   the friction force caused between the banknote and the inhibiting portion 50, 52, 54, 56,
15 58, from being moved to the upper portion of the banknote passing space 48, with
   enhanced effectiveness.
   [0050]
   Furthermore, as still another example of the inhibiting portion that inhibits a banknote
   stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 from being moved toward the banknote
20 passing space 48, an inhibiting portion that has a pressing member that presses
   banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 in a layered state toward the
   ascending/descending stage 46, may be used.              A structure of the inhibiting portion
   having such a pressing member will be described with reference to FIG. 11.
   [0051]
25 In a banknote collection cassette 42s according to another modification shown in FIG. 11,
   an inhibiting portion 59 has a pressing member 59a that presses banknotes stacked on
   the ascending/descending stage 46 in a layered state toward the ascending/descending
   stage 46.    When the banknote collection cassette 42s is mounted to the collection unit 40,
   the    pressing    member     59a     retracts   from    the  banknotes    stacked    on   the
30 ascending/descending stage 46 in a layered state.            Meanwhile, when the banknote

                                                   24
   collection cassette 42s is detached from the collection unit 40, the pressing member 59a
   presses the banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 in a layered state
   toward the ascending/descending stage 46.            In the banknote collection cassette 42s
   according to another modification shown in FIG. 11, when the banknote collection
 5 cassette 42s is taken out from the banknote handling machine 1 and the banknote
   collection    cassette     42s    is   transported,     the   banknotes    stacked   on  the
   ascending/descending        stage   46   in a     layered   state are   pressed   toward the
   ascending/descending stage 46 by the pressing member 59a, whereby a state where the
   banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 are misaligned and one or
10 more of the banknotes on the stacking wheel 44 side are moved toward the banknote
   passing space 48, can be inhibited.
   [0052]
   Furthermore, in the banknote collection cassette 42s as described above, the pressing
   member 59a may include a frictional material, such as rubber, which causes, when a
15 banknote stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 is moved toward the banknote
   passing space 48, a high friction force between the frictional material and the banknote.
   More specifically, a friction force caused between the banknote and the frictional material
   of the pressing member 59a is higher than a friction force caused between the banknote
   and a material of the inner wall of the banknote collection cassette 42. Thus, when the
20 banknote collection cassette 42s is taken out from the banknote handling machine 1 and
   the banknote collection cassette 42s is transported, a state where the banknotes stacked
   on the ascending/descending stage 46 are misaligned and one or more of the banknotes
   on the stacking wheel 44 side are moved toward the banknote passing space 48, can be
   inhibited with enhanced effectiveness.
25 [0053]
   Next, an operation performed by the money handling system according to the present
   embodiment will be described.          Specifically, operations, performed by the banknote
   handling machine 1, for banknote depositing, dispensing, and collection will be described
   below.    The operation of the banknote handling machine 1 as described below is
30 performed by the control unit 60 controlling the components of the banknote handling

                                                  25
   machine 1.
   [0054]
   Firstly, an operation, for banknote depositing, performed by the banknote handling
   machine 1 will be described.        When an operator inputs an instruction for starting
 5 banknote depositing through the operation/display unit (not shown) and inserts banknotes
   into the banknote inlet unit 10, the banknotes inserted into the banknote inlet unit 10 are
   fed one by one into the housing 1a by the plurality of rollers such as the feed rollers and
   the kicker rollers provided in the banknote inlet unit 10, and the fed banknotes are
   transported by the transport unit 12.        Furthermore, the recognition unit 14 performs
10 recognition of denominations, authenticity, fitness/unfitness, old/new version, face/back,
   transport state, and the like for the banknotes transported by the transport unit 12.
   Banknotes that are determined as normal banknotes on the basis of the result of the
   recognition by the recognition unit 14 are delivered from the upper assembly 2 to the
   lower assembly 3 by the transport unit 12, and stored, for each denomination, in the
15 storage/feeding units 20 provided inside the lower assembly 3.         Meanwhile, a banknote
   recognized as a counterfeit note or a suspect note by the recognition unit 14 is
   transported into the banknote storage unit 19 by the transport unit 12, and stored in the
   banknote storage unit 19.    Thus, both banknotes recognized as counterfeit notes by the
   recognition unit 14 and banknotes recognized as suspect notes by the recognition unit 14
20 are stored in the banknote storage unit 19.         Furthermore, banknotes of denominations
   which are not assigned to the storage/feeding units 20, and overflow banknotes which
   cannot be stored in the storage/feeding unit 20 for the corresponding denomination since
   the storage/feeding unit 20 therefor is full, are transported into the collection unit 40 by the
   transport unit 12, and stored inside the banknote collection cassette 42 mounted to the
25 collection unit 40. When all the banknotes are fed from the banknote inlet unit 10 into the
   housing 1a, and are transported into the storage/feeding units 20, the banknote storage
   unit 19, or the collection unit 40, the banknote depositing by the banknote handling
   machine 1 is completed.
   [0055]
30 Next, an operation, for banknote dispensing, performed by the banknote handling

                                                 26
   machine 1 will be described.    When an operator inputs the number of banknotes to be
   dispensed for each denomination, the total monetary amount of the banknotes to be
   dispensed, or the like and inputs an instruction for starting banknote dispensing through
   the operation/display unit (not shown), banknotes to be dispensed are fed one by one
 5 from the storage/feeding units 20 into the transport unit 12, and delivered from the lower
   assembly 3 to the upper assembly 2 by the transport unit 12.           Banknotes that are
   determined as being not abnormally transported, on the basis of the results of detection
   by the banknote detection sensors 12a, are transported into the banknote outlet unit 16
   and stacked in the banknote outlet unit 16.      Furthermore, banknotes (that is, rejected
10 notes in dispensing) that are determined as being abnormally transported, on the basis of
   the results of detection by the banknote detection sensors 12a, are transported into the
   banknote storage unit 18 and stored in the banknote storage unit 18.          When all the
   banknotes to be dispensed are transported into the banknote outlet unit 16, and are
   stacked in the banknote outlet unit 16, the shutter mechanism 17 opens the outlet, for the
15 banknotes, of the banknote outlet unit 16, and the operator is thus allowed to take out the
   banknotes from the banknote outlet unit 16 to the outside of the housing 1a.     Thereafter,
   when the banknotes are taken out from the banknote outlet unit 16 to the outside of the
   housing la, the shutter mechanism 17 closes again the outlet, for banknotes, of the
   banknote outlet unit 16.     Thus, the banknote dispensing by the banknote handling
20 machine 1 is completed.
   [0056]
   Next, an operation, for banknote collection, performed by the banknote handling machine
   1 will be described.    When a guard of a security transport company, or the like inputs an
   instruction for stating banknote collection through the operation/display unit (not shown),
25 all the banknotes stored in the storage/feeding units 20 are fed one by one from the
   storage/feeding units 20 into the transport unit 12, and are transported into the collection
   unit 40 by the transport unit 12.       Specifically, the banknote collection cassette 42
   described above, is detachably mounted to the collection unit 40, and the banknotes
   transported from the storage/feeding units 20 through the transport unit 12 into the
30 collection unit 40 are stored inside the banknote collection cassette 42.     When all the

                                                 27
   banknotes are transported from the storage/feeding units 20 into the collection unit 40,
   and stored in the banknote collection cassette 42 mounted to the collection unit 40, the
   guard of the security transport company, or the like opens the door of the lower assembly
   3 and takes out the banknote collection cassette 42 from the collection unit 40, whereby
 5 the banknotes are collected together with the banknote collection cassette 42 from the
   banknote handling machine 1. Thus, when the banknote collection cassette 42 in which
   the banknotes are stored is taken out from the banknote handling machine 1, the
   banknote collection by the banknote handling machine 1 is completed.
   [0057]
10 In the banknote collection cassette 42, 42m, 42n, 42s (paper sheet storage cassette),
   according to the present embodiment, having the above-described structure, the banknote
   passing space 48 through which banknotes sent onto the ascending/descending stage 46
   (stacking unit) by the stacking wheel 44 pass, is formed near the stacking wheel 44 in the
   banknote collection cassette 42, 42m, 42n, 42s.       Furthermore, the inhibiting portion 50,
15 52, 54, 56, 58, 59 that inhibits a banknote stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46
   from being moved toward the banknote passing space 48 (more strictly, upper portion of
   the banknote passing space 48), is provided.            Thus, a banknote stacked on the
   ascending/descending stage 46 is inhibited from being moved toward the banknote
   passing space 48 near the stacking wheel 44, whereby the banknotes stacked on the
20 ascending/descending stage 46 in a layered state, can be prevented from being greatly
   misaligned.
   [0058]
   Furthermore, in the banknote collection cassette 42, 42m, 42n, 42s of the present
   embodiment, the inhibiting portion 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 59 is disposed in a portion, of the
25 inner wall 49 of the banknote collection cassette 42, 42m, 42n, 42s, which faces the
   stacking wheel 44.     Furthermore, the inhibiting portion 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 59 is disposed
   in a portion, of the inner wall 49 of the banknote collection cassette 42, 42m, 42n, 42s,
   which faces the edge, on the short edge side, of the banknote to be sent onto the
   ascending/descending stage 46 by the stacking wheel 44.           Furthermore, the inhibiting
30 portion 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 59 is disposed above the lower end of the blade passing region

                                                 28
   through which the blades 44c of the stacking wheel 44 pass.
   [0059]
   Furthermore, in the examples shown in FIG. 3 to FIG. 8, the inhibiting portions 50, 52, 54
   have the groove portions 50a, 52a, 54a provided in the inner wall 49 of the banknote
 5 collection cassette 42, and at least a part of each of the groove portions 50a, 52a, 54a
   forms a stepped shape by which the edge of a banknote can be caught when the
   banknote stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 is moved toward the banknote
   passing space 48.     In this case, when the banknote collection cassette 42 is taken out
   from the banknote handling machine 1 and the banknote collection cassette 42 is
10 transported, even if the banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 are
   misaligned and one or more of the banknotes on the stacking wheel 44 side are moved
   toward the banknote passing space 48, the banknote can be inhibited from being moved
   to the upper portion of the banknote passing space 48 by the edge of the banknote being
   caught by the groove portion 50a, 52a, 54a of the inhibiting portion 50, 52, 54.
15 Furthermore, a plurality of the groove portions 50a, a plurality of the groove portions 52a,
   or a plurality of the groove portions 54a are disposed so as to be aligned along the
   direction in which banknotes are stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46. The
   number of the groove portions 50a of the inhibiting portion 50, the number of the groove
   portions 52a of the inhibiting portion 52, and the number of the groove portions 54a of the
20 inhibiting portion 54 may not be plural.    The inhibiting portion 50 may have one groove
   portion 50a, the inhibiting portion 52 may have one groove portion 52a, and the inhibiting
   portion 54 may have one groove portion 54a.       Furthermore, the groove portions 50a, 52a,
   54a may be each formed so as to be a straight line that extends almost parallel to the
   direction in which the shaft 44a of the stacking wheel 44 extends.         Furthermore, the
25 groove portions 50a, 54a include the tilted surfaces 50d, 54c that are tilted relative to the
   direction in which banknotes are stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46.
   [0060]
   Furthermore, in the example shown in FIG. 9, the inhibiting portion 56 has the projection
   56a that is provided in the inner wall 49 of the banknote collection cassette 42m, and that
30 projects from the inner wall 49 toward the banknote passing space 48, and at least a part

                                                 29
   of the projection 56a forms a stepped shape by which the edge of a banknote can be
   caught when the banknote stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 is moved
   toward the banknote passing space 48.          In this case, when the banknote collection
   cassette 42m is taken out from the banknote handling machine 1 and the banknote
 5 collection cassette 42m is transported, even if the banknotes stacked on the
   ascending/descending stage 46 are misaligned and one or more of the banknotes on the
   stacking wheel 44 side are moved toward the banknote passing space 48, the edge of the
   banknote can be caught by the projection 56a of the inhibiting portion 56, whereby the
   banknote can be inhibited from being moved to the upper portion of the banknote passing
10 space 48.    Furthermore, a plurality of the projections 56a are disposed so as to be
   aligned   along   the   direction   in  which    the    banknotes  are   stacked   on   the
   ascending/descending stage 46.       The number of the projections 56a of the inhibiting
   portion 56 may not be plural, and the inhibiting portion 56 may have one projection 56a.
   [0061]
15 Furthermore, in the example shown in FIG. 10, the inhibiting portion 58 has the guide
   member 58a that is movable between the advanced position at which the guide member
   58a advances to the banknote passing space 48 and the retracted position at which the
   guide member 58a retracts from the banknote passing space 48.             When the guide
   member 58a is positioned at the advanced position, the banknote stacked on the
20 ascending/descending stage 46 is inhibited from being moved toward the banknote
   passing space 48.    In this case, when the banknote collection cassette 42m is taken out
   from the banknote handling machine 1 and the banknote collection cassette 42m is
   transported, the guide member 58a positioned at the advanced position inhibits a state
   where the banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 are misaligned and
25 one or more of the banknotes on the stacking wheel 44 side are moved toward the
   banknote passing space 48.
   [0062]
   Furthermore, in the example shown in FIG. 11, the inhibiting portion 59 has the pressing
   member 59a that presses the banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46
30 toward the ascending/descending stage 46.        In this case, when the banknote collection

                                                     30
   cassette 42s is taken out from the banknote handling machine 1 and the banknote
   collection cassette 42s is transported, banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending
   stage 46 in a layered state are pressed toward the ascending/descending stage 46 by the
   pressing member 59a, whereby a state where the banknotes stacked on the
 5 ascending/descending stage 46 are misaligned and one or more of the banknotes on the
   stacking wheel 44 side are moved toward the banknote passing space 48, can be
   inhibited.
   [0063]
   Furthermore, in the present embodiment, when the banknote collection cassette 42, 42m,
10 42n, 42s is transported, the banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 in
   a layered state, are pressed toward the stacking wheel 44 by the ascending/descending
   stage    46.      In this     case,   a   state    where    the  banknotes  stacked    on  the
   ascending/descending stage 46 are misaligned and one or more of the banknotes on the
   stacking wheel 44 side are moved toward the banknote passing space 48, can be
15 inhibited with enhanced effectiveness.
   [0064]
   The banknote collection cassette according to the present embodiment is not limited to
   one having the above-described structure, and various modifications thereto can be made.
   [0065]
20 For    example,    the   inhibiting  portion    that  inhibits  a banknote  stacked    on  the
   ascending/descending stage 46 from being moved toward the banknote passing space 48
   is not limited to the inhibiting portion structured so as to have the above-described groove
   portion, projection, or the like.   The inhibiting portion may have a structure other than the
   structures described above when the structure inhibits a banknote stacked on the
25 ascending/descending stage 46 from being moved toward the banknote passing space 48.
   [0066]
   Furthermore, the principle of the present invention may be applied to a banknote
   collection cassette into which banknotes are inserted from the outside along their short
   edges, instead of the banknote collection cassette into which banknotes are inserted from
30 the outside along their long edges.        The structure of the banknote collection cassette

                                                  31
   according to the modification will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 12.
   [0067]
   As shown in FIG. 12, a banknote collection cassette 72 according to the modification
   includes: a casing 72a that is almost rectangular-parallelepiped-shaped; and an inlet 73
 5 through which banknotes are inserted into the casing 72a from the outside.          The inlet 73
   is formed in the upper portion of the side surface of the casing 72a.          In the banknote
   collection cassette 72 according to the modification, the inlet 73 extends in the left-right
   direction in FIG. 12.     When the banknote collection cassette 72 is mounted to the
   collection unit, banknotes transported from the transport unit of the body portion of the
10 banknote handling machine to the collection unit are inserted through the inlet 73 into the
   casing 72a of the banknote collection cassette 72.        In the example shown in FIG. 12, in
   the transport unit of the body portion of the banknote handling machine, the banknotes are
   transported along their short edges, and the banknotes are transported along their short
   edges through the inlet 73 of the banknote collection cassette 72 into the casing 72a.
15 That is, the long edges of the banknotes inserted through the inlet 73 into the banknote
   collection cassette 72 in FIG. 12 extend in the left-right direction in FIG. 12.   Furthermore,
   an ascending/descending stage 76 (stacking unit) on which banknotes inserted into the
   casing 72a through the inlet 73 from the outside are stacked in a layered state is provided
   in the casing 72a. The ascending/descending stage 76 is moved along the direction (that
20 is, in the up-down direction in FIG. 12) in which the banknotes are stacked.               More
   specifically, each time a banknote is stacked on the ascending/descending stage 76, the
   ascending/descending stage 76 descends over a short distance. Thus, a space in which
   banknotes are stacked is formed between the ascending/descending stage 76 and
   stacking wheels 74 described below.
25 [0068]
   Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 12, paired left and right stacking wheels 74 for sending
   banknotes inserted through the inlet 73 into the casing 72a from the outside, one by one,
   onto the ascending/descending stage 76 are provided in an upper region of the inside of
   the casing 72a.     More specifically, the paired left and right stacking wheels 74 rotate
30 about an axis that extends in the left-right direction in FIG. 12 in synchronization with each

                                                  32
   other.   Furthermore, each stacking wheel 74 includes: a base body that rotates about a
   shaft; and a plurality of blades that extend outward from the outer circumferential surface
   of the base body in a direction opposite to a direction of rotation of the base body.     The
   blades are equally spaced from each other on the outer circumferential surface of the
 5 base body.      In the stacking wheels 74, a banknote transported from the inlet 73 is
   received between two blades, and the banknote received between the blades is sent onto
   the ascending/descending stage 76. The stacking wheels 74 thus allow banknotes to be
   stacked on the ascending/descending stage 76 in an aligned state.
   [0069]
10 As shown in FIG. 12, banknote passing spaces 78 through which a banknote to be sent
   onto the ascending/descending stage 76 by the stacking wheels 74 passes, are formed
   between the stacking wheels 74 and paired left and right inner walls 79 which are among
   the inner walls positioned lateral to an internal space of the casing 72a and which face the
   stacking wheels 74, respectively.     Furthermore, in the example shown in FIG. 12, paired
15 left and right inhibiting portions 80 are provided which inhibit a banknote stacked on the
   ascending/descending stage 76 from being moved toward the upper portion of the
   banknote passing space 78 when the banknote collection cassette 72 is taken out from
   the banknote handling machine 1 and the banknote collection cassette 72 is transported.
   [0070]
20 The inhibiting portions 80 are disposed in portions, facing the stacking wheels 74, of the
   inner walls 79 which are among the inner walls of the casing 72a and which face the
   stacking wheels 74, respectively.       More specifically, each inhibiting portion 80 has a
   plurality (specifically, for example, two) of groove portions 80a that are aligned along a
   direction (specifically, the up-down direction in FIG. 12) in which banknotes are stacked
25 on the ascending/descending stage 76. At least a part of each groove portion 80a forms
   a stepped shape by which the edge of a banknote can be caught when the banknote
   stacked on the ascending/descending stage 76 is moved toward the banknote passing
   space 78.    Furthermore, each groove portion 80a is formed so as to be a straight line that
   extends in the direction orthogonal to the sheet surface of FIG. 12.       Specifically, each
30 groove portion 80a extends over the entire length of an internal region of the casing 72a in

                                                  33
   the direction orthogonal to the sheet surface of FIG. 12.
   [0071]
   In a case where the inhibiting portions 80 are thus provided in the inner walls 79 of the
   casing 72a, when the banknote collection cassette 72 is taken out from the banknote
 5 handling machine and the banknote collection cassette 72 is transported, a banknote
   stacked on the ascending/descending stage 76 can be inhibited from being moved toward
   the banknote passing space 78. This will be described below.
   [0072]
   When the banknote collection cassette 72 is taken out from the banknote handling
10 machine      and    the   banknote     collection    cassette    72   is   transported,  the
   ascending/descending stage 76 is moved upward, and banknotes stacked on the
   ascending/descending stage 76 in a layered state is thus pressed toward the stacking
   wheels 74.     Thus, when the banknote collection cassette 72 is transported, a plurality of
   banknotes in the layered state are sandwiched and pressed between the stacking wheels
15 74 and the ascending/descending stage 76. Therefore, the banknotes stacked on the
   ascending/descending stage 76 can be inhibited from being misaligned and stacked in the
   misaligned state.    However, even when a plurality of banknotes in the layered state are
   thus    sandwiched     and   pressed    between     the   stacking   wheels    74   and  the
   ascending/descending stage 76, banknotes (in particular, one or more of the banknotes
20 on the stacking wheel 74 side) stacked on the ascending/descending stage 76 are
   misaligned in the left-right direction in FIG. 12, and stacked in the misaligned state in
   some cases.     Meanwhile, in the example shown in FIG. 12, the inhibiting portions 80 are
   provided in the inner walls 79, respectively, of the casing 72a.    Therefore, even when the
   banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending stage 76 are misaligned in the left-right
25 direction in FIG. 12 and one or more of the banknotes on the stacking wheel 74 side are
   moved toward the banknote passing space 78, the edge of such a banknote can be
   caught by the groove portions 80a of the inhibiting portions 80, whereby the banknote can
   be inhibited from being moved to the upper portion of the banknote passing space 78.
   [0073]
30 Furthermore, in the banknote handling machine 1 shown in FIG. 1 to FIG. 5 and the like,

                                                 34
   in a case where banknotes are collected, when plural kinds of banknotes having different
   lengths (specifically, banknotes of different denominations or banknotes issued in different
   countries and the like) are fed from the storage/feeding units 20 and transported into the
   collection unit 40, an operation of transporting, into the banknote collection cassette 42, a
 5 predetermined number of banknotes (for example, several tens of banknotes) each having
   a certain banknote length, and thereafter transporting, into the banknote collection
   cassette 42, a predetermined number of banknotes (for example, several tens of
   banknotes) each having another banknote length, may be repeated.             In this case, as
   shown in FIG. 13, a predetermined number of banknotes P1 each having a long banknote
10 length and a predetermined number of banknotes P2 each having a short banknote length
   are alternately stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46.             In a case where
   banknotes are thus stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46, when the banknote
   collection cassette 42 is taken out from the banknote handling machine 1 and the
   banknote collection cassette 42 is transported, banknotes, each having the short
15 banknote length, which are stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 can be
   inhibited from being laterally displaced and greatly misaligned.     More specifically, in a
   case where a lot of banknotes each having a short banknote length are stacked on the
   ascending/descending stage 46, since a large space is formed between the edges of the
   banknotes and the inner wall 49 of the casing 42a, if the banknotes, each having the short
20 banknote length, which are stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 are laterally
   displaced, the banknotes enter the space and are thus raised, and the banknotes are
   greatly misaligned.    Meanwhile, as shown in FIG. 13, in a case where the predetermined
   number of banknotes P1 each having a long banknote length and the predetermined
   number of banknotes P2 each having a short banknote length are alternately stacked on
25 the ascending/descending stage 46, a large space is not formed between the edges of the
   banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 and the inner wall 49 of the
   casing 42a. Therefore, even if the banknotes, each having the short banknote length,
   which are stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 are laterally displaced, the
   banknotes can be inhibited from being raised.       Thus, in a case where a predetermined
30 number of banknotes P1 each having a long banknote length and a predetermined

                                                 35
   number of banknotes P2 each having a short banknote length are alternately stacked on
   the ascending/descending stage 46, when the banknote collection cassette 42 is
   transported, the banknotes stacked on the ascending/descending stage 46 in a layered
   state can be prevented from being misaligned.
 5 [0074]
   Furthermore, a case where the inhibiting portion inhibits banknotes stacked on a stacking
   unit such as the ascending/descending stage from being moved toward the banknote
   passing space in the banknote collection cassette used for collecting banknotes, is
   described above.      However, an inhibiting portion having the same structure as the
10 inhibiting portion described above may be provided in a cassette (for example, banknote
   storage cassette) other than a banknote collection cassette when the cassette is portable
   and allows banknotes to be stacked on a stacking unit in a layered state.
   [0075]
   Furthermore, the present invention is not limited to a cassette (for example, banknote
15 collection cassette) that is portable and allows banknotes to be stacked on a stacking unit
   in a layered state.    In the present invention, the principle of the banknote collection
   cassette 42, 42m, 42n, 42s described above may be applied to paper sheet storage
   cassettes that is portable and allow paper sheets (for example, checks or gift coupons)
   other than banknotes to be stored in a layered state. That is, in a paper sheet storage
20 cassette that is portable, an inhibiting portion that inhibits a paper sheet stacked on a
   stacking unit from being moved toward a paper sheet passing space may be provided in
   the paper sheet passing space through which paper sheets, which are to be sent into the
   stacking unit such as an ascending/descending stage by a stacking wheel, pass.       In this
   case, the inhibiting portion inhibits a paper sheet stacked on the stacking unit from being
25 moved toward the upper portion of the paper sheet passing space near the stacking wheel,
   whereby the paper sheets stacked on the stacking unit in a layered state can be
   prevented from being greatly misaligned during carrying operation.
