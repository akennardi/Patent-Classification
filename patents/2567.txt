                             BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
[0003]      The Protein Kinase B/Akt enzymes are a group of serine/threonine kinases that
are overexpressed in certain human tumors.         International Patent Application Publication
Number WO 2008/006040 and U.S. Pat. No. 8,063,050 discuss a number of inhibitors of
AKT, including the compound (S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-((5R,7R)-7-hydroxy-5-methyl
6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[d]pyrimidin-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)-3-(isopropylamino)propan-1
one (GDC-0068), which is being investigated in clincal trials for the treatment of various
cancers. The free base and dihydrochloride salt form of GDC-0068 isolated in Example 14 of U.S.
Pat. No. 8,063,050 are hygroscopic and difficult to develop into a solid dosage form. What is
needed are forms and formulations of GDC-0068 and its salts that have improved pharmaceutical
properties.

                                 DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES
[00131      Figures 1A-B show physical characterization of amorphous form of compound of
formula I. Figure 1A shows an X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD) pattern of a diffused
halo, typical of amorphous material. Figure 1B shows a polarized microscopy image. No
birefringence was observed.
[00141      Figure 2 shows a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) profile of amorphous
compound of formula I showing weight loss (due to presence of solvent: water and ethanol)
up to 150*C.
[0015]      Figure 3 shows a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profile of amorphous
compound of formula I where glass transition is evident in the second heating cycle after
solvent removal in the first heating cycle. Glass transition onset temperature for the sample
is 114 'C.
[0016]      Figure 4 shows a FT-Raman spectra of amorphous compound of formula I.
[0017]      Figure 5 shows an XRPD pattern of the product of Example 1, which shows both
diffracted peaks and amorphous halo demonstrating by XRPD.

 10018]     Figure 6 shows a polarized light microscopy image of the product of Example 1,
where birefringence is observed.
 [0019]     Figure 7 shows a water sorption analysis of the product of Example 1,with
continuous water sorption profile at 25*C from 0-90% RH (deliquescence point at
 ~75%RH).
 [0020]     Figure 8 shows a FT-Raman spectra of the product of Example 1, overlaid with
amorphous form of compound of formula I.
 [0021]     Figure 9 shows a DSC profile of the product of Example 1.. The first endotherm
signifies solvent loss (water and ethanol). The second, sharp endotherm overlaps with a "step
change" (change in baseline) event. To resolve these two events, a temperature modulation
(±0.5*C over 80 sec) was used, and the endotherm (with an associated enthalpy change of 7
 11 J/g) was found to overlap with a glass transition temperature (onset ~130*C).
 [00221     Figure 10 shows a modulated DSC profile of the second endotherm of Figure 9.
10023]      Figure 11 shows various XRPD patterns as a function of temperature. Heating the
the product of Example leads to loss in structure (diffracted peaks start to disappear in the
 100-160*C range) and the solid-state form becomes amorphous..
[0024]       Figure 12 shows various XRPD patters as a function of exposure to water vapor
(relative humidity or RH) of the product of Example 1. Upon exposure to water vapor at
room temperature (different RH/relative humidity conditions generated by using different
salt solutions) for 5-7 days, the starting marterial loses crystallinity as suggested by loss of
diffracted peak intensity as a function of increasing RH. Upon drying the sample exposed to
60% RH for 4 hours under reduced pressure (top most XRPD pattern), the crystallinity does
not reappear.
[0025]      Figure 13 shows representative XRPD patterns of the product of Example 1,
(bottom) compared to granules of amorphous form of compound of formula I (prepared
according to processes described herein) stored under ICH guidelines for 12 weeks.
Diffracted peaks from crystalline regions are not present in the XRPD patterns of the
granules of the amorphous form of formula I in the formulations described herein.

the solid composition include channel or layered solvates. In one example, the solid
composition comprises compound of formula I, fully substituted with solvent, such as 1:1
molar ratio solvate. In another example, the solid composition comprises compound of
formula I, partially substituted with solvent, such as in a w/w% (solvent:compound of
formula I) in the range of about 0.1% to about about 20%, alternatively about 1%to about

100831      Another aspect includes a liquid-fill capsule formulation of compound of formula
I, comprising a compound of formula I and a liquid fill solvent. Liquid fill solvents for use in
the liquid fill formulations include solvents that comprise a lipidic (for example, C3 -20 alkyl)
group and hydroxyl group. In one example, liquid fill solvents are mono-esters,di-esters and
tri-esters of fatty acids (C 3 -20 alkyl or C8 -18 alkyl) and glycerol, ethylene glycol, propylene
glycol or polyethylene glycol. Examples include lipids, such as glyceryl stearates, for
example esters of natural fatty, stearic and palmitic acids with glycerin, and alkylglycol
caprylates, and the like. Other examples include propylene glycol monocaprylate type II
(Capryol     90TM),    PEG-32       glyceryl    laurate-(Gelucire@    44/14),   Propylene    glycol
monocaprylate type I (Imwitor 792), PEG-6 glyceryl oleate, (Labrafil@ M 1944CS), PEG-6

esters of caprylic or capric fatty acids with glycerin or propylene glycol (for example,
Miglyol 81 ON or Miglyol 812N).
[00841      In another example, liquid fill solvents are those solvents with critical micelle
concentration (cmc) values greater than about 0.9 g/g with the compound of formula I. In
certain embodiments, the liquid fill solvent is propylene glycol caprylate (in one example,
the product sold commercially as Capryol 90TM, Gattefosse). The liquid fill solvent can be
present in a range of about 36.5% w/w to about 60% w/w depending on the dosage strength,
i.e., the amount of compound of formula I. In another example, the liquid fill solvent is a
solvent in which the compound of formula I can be dissolved in concentrations between
about 0.7 and 1 g/g, including propylene glycol monocaprylates (e.g., types I and II), PEG-8

described herein that are further compatible with hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and hard
gelatin capsules such as propylene glycol monocaprylate type II (Capryol 9OTM) and
LauroglycolTM 90.
[0086]       In certain embodiments,     the liquid-fill formulation further comprises an
antioxidant. Antioxidants include ascorbic acid, methionine, butylated hydroxyanisole
(BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). In one example, the antioxidant comprises
BHA. In one example, the antioxidant comprises BHT. In certain embodiments, the liquid
fill formulation comprises about 0.1% w/w antioxidant.
[0087]       In certain embodiments, the liquid-fill formulation further comprises anti
crystallization additives. In one example, the additive is PVP polymer.
[0088]       The liquid-fill formulation allows for unexpectedly high concentrations of
compound of formula I, which allows for the production of a single, high dosage unit with
strengths between 100-mg and 400-mg. Such high doses are generally unachievable with
active pharmaceutical ingredients in the lipid like liquid fill solvent systems. For example, it
was unexpectedly discovered that compound of formula I is surface active in the presence of
propylene glycol caprylate which provides the ability to reach high concentration liquid fill
formulations. The critical micelle concentration for GDC-0068 in propylene glycol caprylate
(e.g., Capryol 9OTM) was determined to be 0.945 g/g.
100891       Additionally, several compounds with known high aqueous solubility as well as
poor aqueous solubility were tested for the maximum amounts that could be dissolved in
Capryol 9OTM.      Highly water-soluble compounds tested were ascorbic acid, metformin,
acetyl salicylic acid and acetaminophenol. Poorly water-soluble compounds tested were
griseofulvin, indomethacin and naproxen. None of the model compounds could be dissolved
at greater than 10% w/w concentration in Capryol 9OTM.

formula I, comprising about 100mg to about 400mg of compound of formula I (measured as
free base), about 36.5% w/w to about 60% w/w propylene glycol caprylate and about 0.1%
w/w antioxidant. In one example, the antioxidant is BHA. In one example, a liquid-fill
formulation comprises 100mg compound of formula I. In one example, a liquid-fill

formulation comprises 400mg compound of formula I. In one example, the formulation
further comprises a capsule.
 [0091]      Another aspect includes a tablet formulation, comprising amorphous compound
of formula I and filler. In one example, the formulation comprises amorphous compound of
formula I and silica. In another example, the formulation further comprises inhibitors of
crystallization, such as PVP or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and optionally
further comprises antioxidant. such as BHT or BHA.
 [00921      In certain embodiments, the tablet comprises about 33% w/w amorphous
compound of formula I, about 15% w/w silica (in one example, the product sold
commercially as Cab-o-sil, Cabot, Corp.), about 43% w/w microcrystalline cellulose, about
5% w/w croscarmellose sodium, about 2.5% w/w PVP, about 0.1% w/w BHA, and about 1%

I, comprising contacting a compound of formula I with a solvent, and removing the solvent
to form the amorphous compound of formula I.
[00941       Alternatively, the process of producing amorphous compound of formula I
comprises removing solvent from a solvate of a compound of formula I, such as by drying or
contacting the solvate with moist nitrogen or other inert gas.
[00951       Alternatively, the process of producing amorphous compound of formula I
comprises spray drying a solution of compound of formula I to form amorphous material. In
one example of spray drying, the material (for example crystalline or mesomorphous
material) is dissovled in a solvent and spray dried to produce the amorphous compound of
formula I. Example solvents for use in the spray drying process include water and ethanol.
The starting material can be any form of the compound of formula I, for example, a solvate
of a compound of formula I, such as the ethyl acetate solvate, or material prepared according
to Example 1. In one example, the spray dried amorphous product comprises about 0.01 to
about 2.5 % residual solvent. In one example, the spray dried amorphous product comprises
about 0.01 to about 1.0 % residual solvent. In one example, the ethyl acetate solvate is
contacted with water and spray dried to give amorphous compound of formula I comprising
less than about 1.0 %w/w water and about 0.25 %w/w or less ethyl acetate. In another
example, the ethyl acetate solvate is contacted with ethanol and spray dried to give
amorphous compound of formula I comprising less than about 1.0 %w/w water, about 2.5 %

 w/w or less ethanol and about 0.25 %w/w or less ethyl acetate. In certain embodiments, the
 process further comprises drying the spray-dried amorphous material to further reduce the
 amount of water and solvent. In one example, the further dried amorphous spray-dried
 compound of formula I comprises less than about 0.5% solvent.
 [0096]       In certain embodiments, the contacting of a compound of formula I with a solvent
 further comprises dissolving the compound of formula I in the solvent. In certain
 embodiments, the solvent comprises ethanol. In one example, the solvent comprises water.
 In certain embodiments the solvent comprises ethanol:water, for example in 1:1 mixture. In
 certain embodiments, the solvent further comprises additives, for example, inhibitors of
 crystallization, such as polymers, for example polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and other
 additives, such as antioxidants or preservatives, for example, BHA or BHT.
 [0097]       Another aspect includes a pharmaceutical formulation comprising an amorphous
 compound of formula I.
 [00981       Another aspect includes a process of producing a tablet formulation comprising
amorphous compound of formula I, comprising contacting a compound of formula I with a
 solvent comprising ethanol to form a mixture; contacting the mixture with filler comprising
crystalline cellulose; and removing the solvent to form the pharmaceutical formulation
comprising amorphous compound of formula I. In certain embodiments, the solvent further
comprises water. In certain embodiments, the solvent further comprises stabilizer, for
example, PVP polymer, and antioxidant, for example BHA or BHT.
 [00991       Another aspect includes a process of producing a tablet formulation comprising
contacting a mesomorphous form of a compound of formula I, cellulose and silica (for
example amorphous or colloidal silica). The process includes contacting the mesomorphous
form, cellulose and silica with a solvent mixture of ethanol and water and removing the
solvent mixture by drying the mixture to form the amorphous form of the compound of
formula I, which is entrapped in the mixture. It was unexpectedly found that such a direct
wet granulation process would result in an amorphous form of the drug substance of formula
I. The hygroscopicity of the final formulation obtained by such a direct wet granulation is
surprisingly similar to that of the formulation prepared from a solution mediated
precipitation of the compound of formula I alone.
[00100]      In certain embodiments, the tablet manufacturing process includes (a) dissolving
antioxidant and stabilizer in a 50:50 mixture of solvent comprising ethanol, and optionally

further comprising water to form a mixture; (b) dissolving compound of formula I into the
mixture to form a solution; (c) granulating the solution with filler to form granules; (d)
drying the granules; and (e) compressing the granules to produce the tablet. In one example,
the process further comprises before (e): mixing additional ingredients to form a blend.
[00101]      In certain embodiments, the granulating process further comprises high-shear
granulating the solution with filler comprising crystalline cellulose. In certain embodiments,
the filler comprises microcrystalline cellulose. In certain embodiments, the filler further
comprises fumed amorphous silica, and optionally further comprises croscarmellose sodium.
In one example, the filler comprises highly porous microcrystalline cellulose and fumed
silica.
[001021      In certain embodiments, drying the granules further comprises drying at an
elevated temperature. In certain embodiments, the temperature for drying granules is in the
range of about 50 'C and 60 'C.
[001031      Predicting and controlling the amount of crystallinity in a drug dosage form is
important for several reasons including obtaining predictable bioavailability and quality
control in manufacturing. It is also important to have stable drug forms of hygroscopic drug
substances to prevent the drug forms from changing crystalline nature. Mesomorphous forms
of a compound of formula I, for example, a condis-crystal form of the compound of formula
I, can have analytically variable levels of crystallinity and is hygroscopic. The tablet
production process described herein can transform a sample of compound of formula I from
a mesomorphous form, and in one embodiment a condis-crystal form, to a drug product
comprising amorphous compound of formula I, and mitigates hygroscopicity problems (i.e.,
deliquescence) by adsorbing the compound of formula I into a highly porous structure of
filler (for example, fumed silica) and thereby protecting the compound of formula I from the
moisture gain.

amorphous compound of formula I in an amount of 100mg to 400mg calculated as the

compound of formula I in an amount of 100mg. In certain embodiments, the solid unit oral
pharmaceutical dosage form comprises amorphous compound of formula I in an amount of
400mg. In certain embodiments, the oral dosage form is a tablet.

 monohydrochloride (compound of formula I) was screened through a #30 screen to de-lump
 the large particles. BHA and PVP were dissolved into the ethanol-water solution (50:50 mix
 to make a total of 15 mL). The compound of formula I was slowly added to the solution
 with vigorous stirring conditions. Small amounts were added in incremental portions so as
 to allow complete dissolution. In a 0.5L Diosna granulator bowl, the batch amounts of
 microcrystalline cellulose, Syloid 244 and croscarmellose sodium were mixed for 2 minutes
 in the high shear granulator using the impeller under a dry state so as to get a uniform
 mixture. This was followed by drop-wise addition of the solution containing the compound
 of formula I under constant agitation of the powder bed in the high shear granulator. After
 adding all the solution, the beaker was rinsed with about 2 mL of water and added dropwise
into the granulation under agitation to so as to ensure the entire batch amount of solution is
incorporated into the granulation. This was followed by a final rinse step of about 1 mL
ethanol also added with agitation. After completion of the rinse addition, the impeller speed
was increased and the chopper blade was turned on so as to perform the kneading or wet
massing and facilitate particle growth. After about 2 minutes of kneading, a clear visual
increase in particle size was observable and the granulation end-point could be confirmed by
granule squeeze test. The granules were dried in a tray oven for about 4.5 hours to remove
the ethanol and water. The final loss on drying from the granules was measured to be less
than 3% w/w suggesting a dry granulation. Using the dried granules and re-calculating the
exact amount of croscarmellose sodium and stearic acid required for the batch, pre-screened
stearic acid was added stepwise to the batch and mixed on a turbula mixer. The final
lubricated granulation was compressed on a Carver hydraulic press using capsule shaped
tooling in order to compress 300-mg potency tablets at a press weight of 1000-mg.

using the impeller under a dry state so as to get a uniform mixture. A persistaltic pump was
set up to dispense the compound of formula I and granulating fluid at a controlled rate. A
speed of 12 gram/minute provided a steady stream for the granulating solution containing
compound of formula I being added into the bed while the impeller speed of the granulator
was maintained at 150-rpm. After addition of the granulating fluid and the rinse solution
making up a total of about 35% w/w ethanol-water with respect to the batch size, a clear
growth in particle size was observed and also tracked by an increase in power consumption
by the machine. This indicated an end-point of the granulation process. Finally, a wet
massing step was carried out at the impeller speed of 250 rpm and a chopper speed of 500
rpm in order to produce a uniform granulation. The granules were dried in fluid-bed drying
equipment at 50 'C inlet air and 35 cubic feet per minute air swaps. The granules dried to
moisture content of less than 3% w/w when the product temperature equilibrated at 42 'C.
The dried granules were then sized through a miller (Quadro-Comill) to obtain the desired
particle size using a #16 mesh screen, a #18 screen and a #20 screen to identify the optimal
screen size.     These milled granules were mixed with the extra-granular portion of
croscarmellose sodium and then lubricated with steric acid. Tablets having 100-mg and 300
mg strengths of compound of formula I were compressed on a Piccola tablet press using a
10-mm diameter round tooling for the 100-mg strength. The dissolution profiles in the
figure below suggested that the milling screen size did not affect the dissolution behavior
and either screen could be utilized.

making up a total of about 41% w/w ethanol-water with respect to the batch size, a clear
growth in particle size was observed and also tracked by an increase in power consumption

massing step was carried out at the impeller speed of 140 rpm and a chopper speed of 500
rpm in order to produce a uniform granulation. The granules were dried in fluid-bed drying

for 2 minutes in the high shear granulator using the impeller under a dry state so as to get a
uniform mixture. This was followed by drop-wise addition of the solution containing the
BHA and PVP dissolved in ethanol and water, under constant agitation of the powder bed in
the high shear granulator. After adding all the solution, the beaker was rinsed with about 30
grams of ethanol/water and added drop wise into the granulation under agitation to so as to
ensure the entire batch amount of solution is incorporated into the granulation. This was
followed by a final rinse step of about 20 grams ethanol/water also added with agitation.
After completion of the rinse addition, the impeller speed was increased and the chopper
blade was turned on so as to perform the kneading or wet massing and facilitate particle
growth.     After about 2 minutes of kneading, a clear visual increase in particle size was
observable and the granulation end-point could be confirmed by granule squeeze test. The
granules were dried in a tray oven for about 4.5 hours to remove the ethanol and water. The
final loss on drying from the granules was measured to be less than 3% w/w suggesting a dry
granulation. Using the dried granules and re-calculating the exact amount of croscarmellose
sodium and stearic acid required for the batch, pre-screened stearic acid was added stepwise
to the batch and mixed on a turbula mixer. The final lubricated granulation was compressed
on a Carver hydraulic press using capsule shaped tooling in order to compress 300-mg
potency tablets at a press weight of 1000-mg.     The powder X-ray diffractograms for the

[001331      Variable temperature XRD showed that both solvates are stable up to 80 'C. At
temperatures > 80 'C, there is substantial loss of crystallinity. In both samples, they appear
to be X-ray amorphous at 90 'C and above (due to melting of the lattice solvent and
dissolution of the solid phase in it as confirmed by hot stage microscopy). Taken together,
the analysis of the solvates shows them to be highly crystalline, stable, non-hygroscopic,
have about 18-22% solvent uptake in the crystal lattice and at ambient temperature, exhibit
almost 2 fold lower solubility in respective solvents than the material of Example 1.

[001341     The material of Example 1 was dissolved in 10 volumes of ethanol. A stir bar
was added to the rotovap flask and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure on a
rotary evaporator to give foam. The foam is scraped to knock down the foam and drying is
continued until a free flowing solid is obtained. A sample of the product (4.70 mg), is placed
in a pre-weighed aluminum pan and placed in the oven on a TA Instruments Q5000SA vapor
sorption analyzer. The sample was heated to 50 'C under a stream of dry nitrogen and
equilibrated. The relative humidity was increased to 50% at 50 'C and held there for 2 hours.
The humidity was then lowered to 0% RH while the temperature was maintained at 50 'C
and held there for 2 hours. The sample was then analyzed by XRPD (Figure 27) and
modulated DSC (Figure 28). The DVS program is graphically shown in Figure 26. The DSC
method was done by using modulated DSC at a rate of 2 'C/minute with modulation of ± 1
