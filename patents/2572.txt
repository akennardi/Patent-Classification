                          FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]      The invention relates to a screw pile. In particular, the invention
relates, but is not limited, to a screw pile for a ground anchoring system in
building foundations.
                    BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]      Reference to background art herein is not to be construed as an
admission that such art constitutes common general knowledge in Australia or
elsewhere.
[0003]      A common process in a number of industries involves winding piles
(e.g. poles) into the ground in order to form a foundation. Screw piles are
typically cost effective foundations and, for example, offer a reduced
environmental impact in comparison to other foundations. Other advantages
of screw pile foundations also include ease of installation and a reduced risk
to personnel as, for instance, the foundations are typically screwed in with a
machine.
[0004]      Screw pile design is based on structural and geotechnical
principles. Increasing the mechanical properties of a screw pile typically
assists screw pile design as less screw piles may need to be used and/or they
have decreased likelihood of failing during use. Recent screw pile technology
has been directed towards, for example, composite technology. Whilst
composites offer some benefits with regard to mechanical properties, this
technology is also relatively expensive in today's market. On the other hand,
traditional screw pile technology is relatively cheap but typically provides,
amongst other things, a lower mechanical strength.

              DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[00115]     Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a screw pile 1Ca, according to an
embodiment of the invention. The screw pile 10a includes an elongate
member 100a and an anchoring member 200a. A longitudinal axis 12a
extends along the screw pile 1Ca.
[00116]     The elongate member 100a is in the form of a hollow round shaft.
The elongate member 100a is formed from a metal. The metal in this
embodiment includes steel. However, it will be appreciate that in further
embodiments that the elongate member 100a may be made from different
materials including, for example, a composite and/or Aluminium.
[00117]     The elongate member 100a includes a surface in the form of outer
surface 11 Ca. The outer surface 11 Ca defines the outer portion of the
elongate member 100a. The outer surface 11 Ca includes a groove 11 2a. The
groove 112a extends substantially along the elongate member 100a. The
groove 11 2a forms a spiral along the elongate member 100a. In this regard,
the groove 11 2a includes, for example, helixes 11 4a-1, 11 4a-2. The helixes
11 4a-1, 11 4a-2 are separated by a pitch that may be varied according to the
present invention. The shape of the groove 112a may also be varied
depending on the design application required.
[00118]     The groove 11 2a extends from the outer surface 11 Ca of the
elongate member 100a towards the longitudinal axis 12a. Accordingly, the
groove 11 2a extends towards the hollow of the elongate member 11 Ca. The

                                      -16
groove 11 2a leaves the outer surface 11 Ca of the elongate member 100a
substantially cylindrical such that the elongate member 100a looks similar to,
for example, a helical spring with no spacers between coils. The inner wall of
the elongate member 11 Ca, adjacent the hollow, is also substantially
cylindrical. In this embodiment, portions of the groove 11 2a do not extend into
the hollow of the elongate member such that there are no apertures in the
inner wall from the groove 11 2a. As further outlined below, the groove 11 2a
provides mechanical benefits to the screw pile 1Ca.
[00119]      The elongate member 11 Ca includes an end portion 120a. The end
portion 120a includes a coupling that is configured to connect to parts
thereabove. In this embodiment, the coupling includes apertures 122a. The
apertures 122a are axially aligned and located on opposite sides of the
elongate member 11 Ca. The apertures 122a are configured to receive a pin
therethrough that may be connected to, for example, a rotary power head.
The end portion 120a is connected to another end portion 140a via a middle
portion 130a. The groove 11 2a extends from the end portion 11 Ca, along the
middle portion 130a, to the other end portion 140a. However, it will be
appreciated that in further embodiments that the groove 11 2a may extend
only along segments of the elongate member 11 Ca.
[00120]      A leading bit 150a is located at the end of the end portion 140a.
The leading bit 150a includes a point 152a that is substantially located along
the longitudinal axis 12a. The point 152a forms a cutting edge for earthen
material. The anchor member 200a is located above the leading bit 150a (i.e.
inboard along the elongate member 100a).
[00121]      The anchor member 200a is connected to the outer surface 11 Ca
of the elongate member 100a. That is, in this embodiment, the anchor
member 200a is welded to the outer surface 11 Ca of the elongate member
100a. The anchor member 200a extends away from the elongate member
100a. In this regard, the anchor member 200a extends in substantially an
opposite direction to the groove 11 2a (i.e. the anchor member 200a extends

                                      -17
away from the longitudinal axis 12a, from the outer surface 11 Ca, whilst the
groove 112a extends towards the longitudinal axis 12a, from the outer surface
11 a).
[00122]    The anchor member 200a includes a plate 21 Ca. The plate 21 Ca is
angled in a manner such that it forms a helical portion around the elongate
member 200a when it is connected thereto. The plate 21 Ca completes a
revolution around the elongate member 100a in this embodiment. However, it
would be appreciated that in further embodiments that the anchor member
200a may be formed from a plurality of plates around the elongate member
100a. In addition, further anchor members 200a may be placed along the
elongate member 100a to provide additional foundation support.
[00123]     Figures 3 to 4 illustrate a screw pile 10b, according to a further
embodiment of the invention. The screw pile 10b is substantially similar to the
screw pile 1Ca but differences therebetween are noted below. It is also noted
that the use of a reference numeral followed by a lower case letter typically
indicates alternative embodiments of a general element identified by the
reference numeral in this specification. Thus for example the screw pile 1Ca is
similar to but not identical to the screw pile 10b. Further, references to an
element identified only by the numeral refer to all embodiments of that
element. Thus for example a reference to screw pile 10 is intended to include
both the screw pile 1Ca and the screw pile 10b.
[00124]     Like the screw pile 10a, the screw pile 1Ob includes an elongate
member 100b and an anchoring member 200b. A longitudinal axis 12 extends
along the middle of the screw pile 10b. The elongate member 100b is
substantially cylindrical and hollow. The outer surface 11 Ob of the elongate
member 100b includes groove 112b, which helically extends along the
elongate member 100b. In comparison to the groove 11 2a, the pitch between
helixes of the grooves 112b have a smaller pitch. That is, the distance
between helixes 11 4b-1, 11 4b-2, for example, is smaller than the distance

                                      -18
between 11 4a-1, 11 4a-2. As outlined further below, both of these different
pitches assist in providing mechanical benefits in the present invention.
[00125]      The groove 112b extends from the end portion 120b, along the
middle portion 130b, to the other end portion 140b in this embodiment. The
end portion 120b, like the end portion 120a, includes a coupling having
apertures 122b. Furthermore, a leading bit 150b is located at the end of the
end portion 140b. In comparison to the leading bit 150a, the leading bit 150b
is offset to one side of the longitudinal axis 12b. That is, the leading bit 150b
tapers to a point 152b that is outboard of the longitudinal axis 12b. It would be
appreciated that in further embodiments that the leading bits 150 may be
changed for a particular application.
[00126]      In the same manner as the anchor member 200a, the anchor
member 200b includes a plate 220b that is fixed to the outer surface 11 Ob of
the elongate member 100b. The plate 220b is connected in a manner such
that it spirals along the elongate member 100b. The plate 220b is located
above the leading bit 150b.
[00127]      In this embodiment, the grooves 11 2a, 11 2b of the screw piles 1Ca,
1Ob extend helically along the elongate members 100a, 100b in a direction
which is opposite to direction in which the screw piles are rotated when
installing them into the ground. For example, if the screw piles 1Ca, 1Ob are
rotated in a clockwise direction when installing them in the ground, the
grooves 11 2a, 11 2b extend helically along the elongate members 100a, 100b
in an anti-clockwise direction. Such a groove configuration significantly
increases the torsional strength of the screw piles. However, in further
embodiments, the grooves 112a, 112b of the screw piles 10a, 10b may
extend helically along the elongate members 100a, 100b in a direction which
is the same direction in which the screw piles are rotated when installing them
into the ground.

                                          -19
[00128]       In order to produce the screw piles 10, a cylindrical hollow tube is
feed through a machine that rolls the grooves 11 2a, 11 2b into their respective
elongate members 100a, 100b. In this regard, the grooves 112 are cold
worked into the cylindrical tube in this embodiment. The pitch of the helixes
114 are predetermined with a user input. The cylindrical hollow tube may
initally include the apertures 11 2a, 11 2b and/or the leading bits 150a, 150b.
Alternatively, these features may be formed after the grooves 112 are in
place.
[00129]       Following the above, the steel plates 21 Ca, 21 Ob are connected to
their respective elongate members 100a, 100b. Typically, the steel plates 210
are welded to the elongate members 100. However, it would be appreciated
that in further embodiments that, for example, the steel plates 210 may be
releasably fastened to the elongate members 100.
[00130]       Figures 5 to 8 illustrate tests results carried out on elongate
members. The test results from figures 6 to 8 illustrate elongate members
according to the present invention. Figure 5 illustrates test results from a plain
pipe, which is typically used in current screw piles. A summary of these test
results is provided in the table below.
Test No.          Pipe Characteristics        Yield Point,          Maximum

              4.2mm       wall    thickness.
               Pitch of spiral = 11mm.

             57mm outer diameter and
             3.1mm       wall   thickness.
             Pitch of spiral = 20mm.
     4       Spiral    grooved     pipe    -        1680               3165
             57mm outer diameter and
             3.1mm       wall   thickness.
             Pitch of spiral = 38mm.
[00131]      From the above test results, it is evident that the elongate
members, according to the present invention, include mechanical properties
that are a significant improvement over the elongate members used in current
screw piles. By way of example, including the spiral grooves in the pipe of test
1 (i.e. the pipe in test 2), the yield point of the elongate member is increased
from 1740Nm to 3920Nm (a 225% increase) and the maximum torque is also
increased from 2730Nm to 4659Nm (a 170% increase). In this regard, the
yield point of the pipe is brought closer to its ultimate strength. Decreasing the
pitch of the grooves (cf. test 3 and 4) also increased the maximum torque
results.
[00132]      Figures 9-11 illustrate tests results carried out on elongate
members. Figure 9 illustrates test results from a plain pipe, which is typically
used in current screw piles. The test results from Figure 10 illustrate an
elongate member according to the present invention. Figure 11 illustrates a
graph comparing the test results from a plain pile and from an elongate
member according to the present invention.
[00133]      From the graph shown in Figure 11, it is further evident that the
elongate members, according to the present invention, include mechanical
properties that are a significant improvement over the elongate members
used in current screw piles. By way of example, by including the spiral

                                       - 21
grooves in the pipe, the bending strength of the elongate member is increased
from 553 MPa to 625 MPa (a 13% increase). The graph of Figure 11 also
indicates that the pipe with the spiral grooves is more flexible than a plain pipe
for a given stress.
[00134]      The manufacturing time of the screw piles 10 is also similar to the
manufacturing time of previous screw piles. For instance, a 6m length of the
elongate members 100 may be processed, to include the grooves 112, within
approximately 1 minute. Furthermore, the manufacturing time of the screw
piles 10 is also relative short and inexpensive compared to, for example,
previous composite screw piles.
[00135]     In addition, the spiral nature of the grooves 112 also assist in
guiding the screw piles 10 through the ground. Moreover, the inner portions of
the grooves 112 create a neutral line of flexibility between the helixes 114.
That is, the inner portions of the grooves 112 provide some flexibility between
the helixes 114 of the elongate members 100 whilst the outer regions have
been cold worked to increase the overall mechanical properties of the
elongate members 100. The flexibility provided by this arrangement also
assists in driving the screw piles 10 in the ground to form a foundation.
[00136]     Figure 12 illustrates a screwpile 10c, according to an alternative
embodiment of the invention. The screw pile 10c includes an elongate
member 100c, an anchoring member 200c and a fin assembly 300c. A
longitudinal axis 12c extends along the screw pile 1Cc.
[00137]     The elongate member 100c includes a surface in the form of outer
surface 11 Cc. The outer surface 110c defines the outer portion of the elongate
member 100c. The outer surface 11 Ca includes a groove 11 2c. The groove
112c extends substantially along the elongate member 100c. The groove
112c forms a spiral along the elongate member 100c. In this regard, the
groove 11 2c includes, for example, helixes 114c-1, 114c-2. The helixes 114c
1, 114c-2 are separated by a pitch that may be varied according to the

                                      - 22
present invention. The shape of the groove 112c may also be varied
depending on the design application required.
[00138]     The groove 11 2c extends from the outer surface 110c of the
elongate member 100c towards the longitudinal axis 12c. Accordingly, the
groove 11 2c extends towards the hollow of the elongate member 110c. The
groove 11 2c leaves the outer surface 11Cc of the elongate member 100c
substantially cylindrical such that the elongate member 100c looks similar to,
for example, a helical spring with no spacers between coils. The inner wall of
the elongate member 11 Cc, adjacent the hollow, is also substantially
cylindrical. In this embodiment, portions of the groove 11 2c do not extend into
the hollow of the elongate member such that there are no apertures in the
inner wall from the groove 11 2c.
[00139]     The elongate member 11Cc includes an end portion 120c. The end
portion 120c includes a coupling that is configured to connect to parts
thereabove. In this embodiment, the coupling is formed from apertures 122c.
The apertures 122c are axially aligned and located on opposite sides of the
elongate member 11Cc. The apertures 122c are configured to receive a pin
therethrough that may be connected to, for example, a rotary power head.
The end portion 120c is connected to another end portion 140c via a middle
portion 130c. The groove 11 2c extends from the end portion 11Cc, along the
middle portion 130c, to the other end portion 140c. However, it will be
appreciated that in further embodiments that the groove 11 2a may extend
only along segments of the elongate member 11 Ca.
[00140]     A leading bit 150c is located at the end of the end portion 140c.
The leading bit 150c includes a point 152c that is substantially located along
the longitudinal axis 12c. The point 152c forms a cutting edge for earthen
material. The anchor member 200c is located above the leading bit 150c (i.e.
inboard along the elongate member 100c). However, it will be appreciated that
in further embodiments that the leading bit 150c is offset to one side of the
longitudinal axis 12c such that the leading bit 150c tapers to a point 152c that

                                       - 23
is outboard of the longitudinal axis 12c. It would be appreciated that in further
embodiments that the leading bits 150c may be changed for a particular
application.
[00141]     The anchor member 200c is connected to the outer surface 110c of
the elongate member 100c. That is, in this embodiment, the anchor member
200c is welded to the outer surface 11Cc of the elongate member 100c. The
anchor member 200c extends away from the elongate member 100c. In this
regard, the anchor member 200c extends in substantially an opposite
direction to the groove 11 2c (i.e. the anchor member 200c extends away from
the longitudinal axis 12c, from the outer surface 11 Cc, whilst the groove 11 2c
extends towards the longitudinal axis 12c, from the outer surface 11 Cc).
[00142]     The anchor member 200c includes a plate 21Cc. The plate 21Cc is
angled in a manner such that it forms a helical portion around the elongate
member 200c when it is connected thereto. The plate 21Cc completes a
revolution around the elongate member 100c in this embodiment. However, it
would be appreciated that in further embodiments that the anchor member
200c may be formed from a plurality of plates or blades around the elongate
member 100c. In addition, further anchor members 200c may be placed along
the elongate member 100c to provide additional foundation support.
[00143]     The fin assembly 300c includes four fins 31Cc that extend radially
from three, vertically spaced, collars 351 c, 352c, 353c rotatably mounted on
the elongate member 100c. A locating ring (not shown) may be provided
adjacent one or more of the collars 351 c, 352c, 353c to limit movement of the
fin assembly 300c along the elongate member 100c. However, it will be
appreciated that in further embodiments that the fin assembly 300c may
comprise fins 31 Cc which are welded to the outer surface 11 Cc of the elongate
member 100c.
[00144]     The fins 31Cc and the collars 351 c, 352c, 353c are formed from a
metal. The metal in this embodiment includes steel. However, it will be

                                       - 24
appreciated that in further embodiments that the fins 310c and the collars
351c, 352c, 353c may be made from different materials including, for
example, a composite and/or Aluminium.
[00145]     Each fin 31 Cc has a lower, cutting edge, 311 c which is inclined
downwardly in a radially outward direction and terminates in a ground
engaging point 312c distal from the collar 353c.
[00146]     A respective fastening portion 360c is located at the top end of
each of the fins 31 Cc such that the top surface of the fastening portion is flush
with the top edge 313c of the fins 310c. The fastening portion 360d is located
in a corresponding cut-out or gap formed at a top end of each fin 31 Cd which
is shaped to receive the fastening portion. The fastening portion 360c may be
configured to receive a mounting bolt or a stud to secure a mounting plate
(not shown) of a column. However, it will be appreciated that in further
embodiments that the fastening portion may comprise a mounting bolt or stud
extending vertically from the top edge 313c of the fins 31 Cc.
[00147]     It will be appreciated that in further embodiments that two or more
fin assemblies 300c are provided at spaced intervals along the elongate
member 100c of the screw pile 1Cc. Moreover, it will be appreciated that in
further embodiments that the fin assembly may include any number of fins
and/or the fins may be oriented at an angle with respect to the longitudinal
axis of the elongate member.
[00148]     By providing the fin assembly 300c, the fins 31Cc tend to compress
the ground in the area generally surrounding the fins. Tests have shown that
the compression of the ground may increases the resistance of the upper end
of the elongate member 11Cc (and thereby the screwpile 1Cc) against lateral
movement by a factor of five to ten times, more generally six times. Further,
by use of the fin assembly 300c, it is possible to use thinner gauge material in
the manufacture of the elongate member 11 Cc without loss of vertical load
capacity or reduction in lateral bending resistance below prescribed limits.

                                       - 25
[00149]     Figure 13 illustrates a screw pile 10d, according to a further
embodiment of the invention. The screw pile 10d is substantially similar to the
screw pile 10c but differences therebetween are noted below.
[00150]     Like the screw pile 1Cc, the screw pile 10d includes an elongate
member 100d, an anchoring member 200d and a fin assembly 300d. The fin
assembly 300d includes four fins 310d that extend radially from three,
vertically spaced, collars 351 d, 352d, 353d rotatably mounted on the elongate
member 100d. A locating ring (not shown) may be provided adjacent one or
more of the collars 351d, 352d, 353d to limit movement of the fin assembly
300d along the elongate member 100d. Each fin 310d has a lower, cutting
edge, 311 d which is inclined downwardly in a radially outward direction and
terminates in a ground engaging point 312d distal from the collar 353d.
[00151]     A respective fastening portion 360d is located at the top end of
each of the fins 31 Cd such that the top surface of the fastening portion is flush
with the top edge 313d of the fins 31 Cd. The fastening portion 360d is located
in a corresponding cut-out or gap formed at a top end of each fin 31 Cd which
is shaped to receive the fastening portion. The fastening portion 360d may be
configured to receive a mounting bolt or a stud to secure a mounting plate
(not shown) of a column. However, it will be appreciated that in further
embodiments that the fastening portion may comprise a mounting bolt or stud
extending vertically from the top edge 313d of the fins 31 Cd.
[00152]     Each fin 310d comprises three indents 320d, 330d, 340d. A first
indent 320d and a second indent 340d are formed on a first surface 317d of
the fin while a third indent 330d is formed on a second surface 316d of the fin
which is parallel to and spaced apart from the first surface 317d of the fin. The
indents 320d, 330d, 340d extend across the width of the fin, outwardly from
the collars 351 d, 352d, 353d to the outer vertical edge 314d of the fin 31 Cd. It
will be appreciated that in further embodiments that the indents 320d, 330d,
340d are all formed on a single surface of the fin.

[00153]       Figure 14 illustrates a front view of one of the fins 31 0d of the fin
assembly 300d. Figure 15 illustrates a cross-sectional view of one of the fins
31 0d of the fin assembly 300d. The indents 320d, 330d, 340d extend from an
inner vertical edge 315d to the outer vertical edge 314d of the fin 310d. The
first indent 320d is located at a top end of the fin 31 0d and is in the form of a
substantially straight line extending across the first surface 31 7d of the fin and
substantially parallel to the top edge 313d of the fin. The first indent extends
on both sides of the cut-out or gap formed on the fin 310d for receiving the
fastening portion 360d.
[00154]      The second indent 340d is located at a lower end of the fin 31 Cd
and is in the form of a substantially straight line extending across the first
surface 317d of the fin and substantially parallel to the lower edge 311 d of the
fin. Thus, the second indent 340d is in the form of a substantially straight line
which is inclined downwardly in a radially outward direction.
[00155]      The third indent 330d is located substantially in the centre of the fin
310d between the first indent 320d and the second indent 340d and
substantially equally spaced from the first indent 320d and the second indent
340d. The third indent 330d is in the form of a substantially straight line
extending across the second surface 316d of the fin and substantially parallel
to the top edge 313d of the fin and to the first indent 320d.
[00156]      The indents 320d, 330d, 340d have a V-shaped cross-section and
each of the indents comprise a first surface portion 321d, 331d, 341d and a
second surface portion 322d, 332d, 342d. The first surface portion 321 d and
second surface portion 322d of the first indent 320d are inclined with respect
to the first surface 31 7d of the fin 31 Cd such that the first and second surface
portions of the first indent intersect along a common edge 323d. The first
surface portions 341 d and second surface portion 342d of the second indent
340d are inclined with respect to the first surface 317d of the fin 31 Cd such
that the first and second surface portions of the second indent intersect along
a common edge 343d. The first surface portion 331d and second surface

                                       - 27
portion 332d of the third indent 330d are inclined with respect to the second
surface 31 6d of the fin 31 0d such that the first and second surface portions of
the third indent intersect along a common edge 333d. The first surface
portions 321 d, 331 d, 341 d and the second surface portions 322d, 332d, 342d
of the indents 320d, 330d, 340d are substantially planar.
[00157]     The first surface portions 321d, 341d and the second surface
portions 322d, 342d of the first and second indents 320d, 340d are inclined
with respect to the first surface 31 7d of the fin. The first surface portion 331 d
and the second surface portion 332d of the third indent 330d are inclined with
respect to the second surface 31 6d of the fin. The first surface portion 331 d of
the third indent 330d is inclined in a direction opposite to the direction of
inclination of the first surface portions 321d, 341d of the first and second
indents 320d, 340d. Similarly, the second surface portion 332d of the third
indent 330d is inclined in a direction opposite to the direction of inclination of
the second surface portions 322d, 342d of the first and second indents 320d,
340d.
[00158]     Although the first and second surface portions of the indents 320d,
330d, 340d shown in Figures 13-15 are substantially planar, thereby resulting
in a V-shaped cross-section, in further embodiments the cross-sectional
shape of the indents may be varied depending on the design requirements.
For example, in further embodiments, the cross-sectional shape of the indents
may comprise at least one curved portion.
[00159]     As shown in Figures 13-15, the indents 320d, 330d, 340d are in the
form of a substantially straight line extending across the first surface 31 7d or
the second surface 316d of the fin 31 0d. However, in further embodiments the
indents 330d may be in the form of a curved line, in a wave-shaped line or
formed as a series of distinct spaced indents. Moreover, in further
embodiments, the indents may extend only along a small portion of the fin
31 0d and/or may be formed at an angle with respect to the outer vertical edge
314d or the inner vertical edge 315d of the fin 310d.

                                      - 28
[00160]      Each fin 310d of the fin assembly 300d includes mechanical
properties that are a significant improvement over the fin assemblies used in
current screw piles. The indents 320d, 330d, 340d of the fin 310d enhance
the strength and stiffness of the fin. When installed in the ground, the fins of
the fin assembly tend to compress the ground, which increases the resistance
of the upper end of the elongate member against lateral movement. The
degree of resistance depends on factors such as number of fins provided, the
depth and width of the fins and the composition of the surrounding soil. Where
the ground has a low mechanical strength, a larger number of fins would be
required for the fin assembly to provide greater lateral resistance. The fins of
the fin assembly 300d comprising indents 320d, 330d, 340d, being stronger
and stiffer, would be able to provide the same lateral resistance with a fewer
number of fins, and possibly smaller fins, in each fin assembly. Moreover, the
indents would make each fin 310d more resistant to deformation. Upon
application of force, each fin 31 0d may undergo elastic deformation along one
or more of the indents 320d, 330d, 340d, thereby preventing buckling or any
permanent damage to the fin.
[00161]      Figure 16 illustrates a screw pile 10e, according to a further
embodiment of the invention. The screw pile 1Ce is substantially similar to the
screw pile 1Cd but differences therebetween are noted below.
[00162]      Like the screw pile 10d, the screw pile 10d includes an elongate
member 100e, an anchoring member 200e and a fin assembly 300e. The
elongate member 100e includes a surface in the form of outer surface 11e.
However, the outer surface 110 e of the elongate member 100e does not have
any grooves extending along the outer surface.
[00163]      Figures 17a, 17b and 17c illustrate a portion of an elongate
member 100f of a screw pile 1Of, according to a further embodiment of the
invention. The screw pile 1Cf may be substantially similar to any one of screw
piles 1Ca, 1Ob, 1Cc or 1Cd but differences therebetween are noted below.

                                       - 29
[00164]     Like the screw piles 1Ca, 1Ob, 10c, 1Cd, the outer surface 11 Cf of
the elongate member 100f of the screw pile 1Cf includes a groove 11 2f which
extends along the elongate member 100f. However, the outer surface 11 Cf of
the elongate member 100f further includes a second groove 11 5f which also
extends along the elongate member 100f.
[00165]     Like the first groove 11 2f, the second groove 11 5f forms a spiral
along the elongate member 100f. The second groove 11 5f extends from the
outer surface 11 Cf of the elongate member 100f towards the longitudinal axis
12f. Accordingly, the second groove 11 5f extends towards the hollow of the
elongate member 11 Cf. The second groove 11 5f leaves the outer surface 11 Cf
of the elongate member 100f substantially cylindrical. The inner wall of the
elongate member 11 Cf, adjacent the hollow, is also substantially cylindrical. In
this embodiment, portions of the second groove 11 5f do not extend into the
hollow of the elongate member such that there are no apertures in the inner
wall from the second groove 11 5f.
[00166]     Like the first groove 11 2f, the second groove 11 5f forms a spiral
along the elongate member 100f. The second groove 115f includes, for
example, helixes 116f-1, 116f-2. The helixes 116f-1, 116f-2 are separated by
a pitch that may be varied according to the present invention. The shape of
the second groove 115f may also be varied depending on the design
application required.
[00167]     In this embodiment, the first groove 11 2f and the second groove
115 extend along the outer surface 11 Cf of the elongate member 100f at
opposed angles with respect to the longitudinal axis 12f, i.e the helixes 11 4f-1,
11 4f-2 of the first groove 11 2f and the helixes 11 6f-1, 11 6f-2 of the second
groove 11 5f intersect at multiple points on the outer surface 11 Cf of the
elongate member 100f. However, in further embodiments, the first groove
11 2f and the second groove 11 5f may extend along the outer surface 100f at
substantially similar angles with respect to the longitudinal axis 12f and may
not intersect at all. Moreover, in further embodiments, three or more grooves

                                      - 30
may extend along the outer surface 100f of the elongate member 100f at
substantially similar or different angles with respect to the longitudinal axis
12f.
[00168]     Figures 18a, 18b and 18c illustrate a partial view of an elongate
member 100g of a screw pile 1Og, according to a further embodiment of the
invention. The screw pile 1Og may be substantially similar to any one of screw
piles 1Ca, 1Ob, 1Cc, 1Cd or 1Ce but differences therebetween are noted
below.
[00169]     Like the screw piles 1Ca, 1Cb, 1Cc, 1Cd, 1Ce, the elongate member
1C0g of the screw pile 1Cg includes an end portion 120g. However, the end
portion 120g is configured to mate with a coupling member 400g. In this
embodiment, the end portion 120g of the screw pile 1Og does not include any
apertures. However, in further embodiments, the end portion 120g of the
screw pile 1Og may include apertures, like the screw piles 1Ca, 1Ob, 1Cc, 1Cd.
[00170]    The coupling member 400g is cylindrical in shape and includes an
upper disc portion 41 Og and a lower threaded portion 420g. The upper disc
portion 41 Og has substantially flat upper and lower surfaces and includes a
threaded bore 411 g that is configured to connect to parts thereabove. The
threaded bore 411 g lies along the longitudinal axis 12g of the elongate
member 1O0g and may be used to connect the pile 1Og to for example, a
rotary power head. However, in further embodiments, parts may be connected
to the coupling 400g through alternative means.
[00171]    The lower threaded portion 420g of the coupling member 400g is
received in the hollow end portion 120g of the elongate member 100g. The
inner wall of the end portion 120g is correspondingly threaded so that the
lower threaded portion 420g of the coupling member 400g and the end portion
120g of the elongate member 100g can be releasably attached together.
When the lower threaded portion 420g of coupling member 400g is
completely screwed into the end portion 120g of the elongate member 100g,

                                       - 31
the lower surface of the upper disc portion 410g is in contact with the end
portion 120g. However, in further embodiments, there may be a gap between
the lower surface of the upper disc portion 41 Og and the end portion 120g to
accommodate, for example, a washer.
[00172]      Figures 19a and 19b illustrate a partial view of an elongate member
100h of a screw pile 10h and a partial view of an extension member 500h,
according to a further embodiment of the invention. The screw pile 1Oh may
be substantially similar to any one of screw piles 1Ca, 1Ob, 10c or 1Cd but
differences therebetween are noted below.
[00173]      Like the screw piles 1Ca, 1Ob, 1Cc, 1Cd, the elongate member 100h
of the screw pile 1Oh has an end portion 120h. However, in this embodiment,
the end portion 120h of the screw pile 1Oh is configured to be connected to an
extension member 500h via a joining member 600h. In further embodiments,
the joining member 600h may be used to join the elongate members of two
distinct screw piles. The joining member 600h includes a first end portion
620h and a second end portion 630h.
[00174]     The extension member 500h and the joining member 600h are in
the form of a hollow round shaft. The extension member 500h and the joining
member 600h are formed from a metal. The metal in this embodiment
includes steel. However, in further embodiments, the extension member 500h
and/or the joining member 600h may be made from different materials
including, for example, a composite and/or Aluminium.
[00175]     The extension member 500h includes a surface in the form of outer
surface 51 Oh. The outer surface 51 Oh of the extension member 500h includes
a groove 512h. The groove 512h extends substantially along the extension
member 500h. The groove 512h forms a spiral along the extension member
500h. In this embodiment, the pitch of the groove 512h is substantially similar
to the pitch of the groove 11 2h of the elongate member 100h of the screw pile

                                     - 32
1Oh. However, in further embodiments, the pitch of the groove 512h may be
different from the pitch of the groove 11 2h of the elongate member 100h.
[00176]      The extension member 500h includes an end portion 540h which
mates with the joining member 600h. In this embodiment, the end portion
540h of the extension member 500h is received in the first end portion 620h
of the joining member 600h. However, in further embodiments, the first end
portion 620h of the joining member 600h may be received in the end portion
540h of the extension member 500h or the extension member 500h and the
joining member 600h may be connected through alternative means.
[00177]      Like the extension member 500h, the joining member 600h
includes a surface in the form of outer surface 61 Oh which includes a groove
612h. The groove 612h extends substantially along the joining member 600h.
The groove 612h forms a spiral along the joining member 600h. The pitch of
the groove 612h is substantially similar to the pitch of the groove 11 2h of the
elongate member 100h of the screw pile 1Oh and the pitch of the groove 512h
of the extension 500h, which allows the extension member 500h and the
elongate member 100h to be screwed into the joining member 600h.
[00178]      In this embodiment, the end portion 120h of the elongate member
100h of the screw pile 1Oh is received in the second end portion 630h of the
joining member 600h. However, in further embodiments, the second end
portion 630h of the joining member 600h may be received in the end portion
120h of the elongate member 100h or the elongate member 100h and the
joining member 600h may be connected through alternative means.
Moreover, in this embodiment, the end portion 120h of the elongate member
100h does not include a coupling in the form of apertures. However, in further
embodiments, the end portion 120h of the elongate member 100h may
include apertures like the screw pile 1Oa, 1Ob, 1Oc or 1Od and/or a coupling
member like the screw pile 10g.

                                       - 33
[00179]     By using the joining member 600h, the total length of a screw pile
can be increased, thereby increasing the depth at which the screw pile is
installed in the ground. Installing the screw pile at a greater depth results in
enhanced support for the structure that the screw pile is connected to.
[00180]     Figures 20a and 20b illustrate a fin assembly 300f, according to a
further embodiment of the invention. The fin assembly 300f may be used with
any one of the screw piles 1Ca, 1Ob, 1Cc, 1Cd, 1Ce, 1Cf, 1Cg or 1Ch. The fin
assembly 300f is substantially similar to the fin assembly 300c but differences
therebetween are noted below.
[00181]     Like the fin assembly 300c, the fin assembly 300f includes four fins
31 Cf. However, in this embodiment, the four fins 31 Cf extend radially from a
single collar 350f rotatably mounted on the elongate member 100a, 100b,
100c, 100d, 100e, 100f, 100g, or 100h of any one of the screw piles 1Ca, 1Ob,
1Cc, 10d, 10e, 1Of, 1Og or 10h.
[00182]     Like the fin assembly 300c, each fin 31 Cf has an outer vertical edge
314f which is distal from the collar 350f. However, in this embodiment, each
outer vertical edge 314f has a linear member 370f attached thereto. The
linear members 370f are non-planar with respect to the fins 31 Cf and extend
at an angle to the first and second surfaces 31 6f, 31 7f of the fins 31 Cf. In this
embodiment, each linear member 370f is substantially perpendicular to the
first and second surfaces 316f, 317f of the respective fin 31 Cf. However, in
further embodiments, the linear members 370f may extend at angles other
than 90 degrees from the first and second surfaces 316f, 317f of the fins 31 Cf
and/or one or more linear members 370f may extend at an angle from first
and second surfaces 31 6f, 31 7f of their respective fin that is different from the
angle at which another linear member 370f extends at from first and second
surfaces 31 6f, 31 7f of its respective fin.
[00183]     In this embodiment, each linear member 370f extends substantially
along the entire outer vertical edge 314f. However, in further embodiments,

                                        - 34
the linear members 370f may extend along only a portion of the outer vertical
edges 314f. Moreover, in this embodiment, the linear members 370f and the
fins 31 Of are integrally formed. However, in further embodiments, the linear
members 370f may be attached to the fins 31 Of via welding or an adhesive.
[00184]      The linear members 370f enhance the strength and stiffness of the
fins. Due to the presence of the linear members 370f, the fins 31 Of are able to
provide a greater lateral resistance, thereby requiring fewer and/or smaller
fins. Moreover, the linear members 370f make the fins 310f resistant to
deformation or permanent damage by preventing buckling of the fins 310f
when force is applied to them.
[00185]      Figure 21 illustrates a pile assembly 20, according to a further
embodiment of the invention. The pile assembly 20 includes a plate 700
through which four piles 10i pass.
[00186]      The plate 700 has a substantially square shape. However, in
further embodiments, the plate may be circular or have a polygonal or
irregular shape. Moreover, in further embodiments, the plate 700 may have a
downwardly and/or upwardly extending flange at one or more of its edges.
The plate 700 is formed from a metal. The metal in this embodiment includes
steel. However, in further embodiments, the plate 700 may be made from
different materials including, for example, a composite and/or Aluminium.
[00187]      The plate 700 includes two sets of apertures. The first set of
apertures includes four substantially elliptical apertures 710, with each
elliptical aperture 710 located adjacent to a corner of the plate 700. Each
elliptical aperture 710 receives a pile 10i at an angle other than 90 degrees
such that portions of the pile 10i extend on both sides of the plate 700.
[00188]      A wall 711 extends from a surface of the plate 700 around each of
the elliptical apertures 710 of the first set of apertures. Each wall 711 extends
at an angle other than 90 degrees to the surface of the plate 700 such that a

                                        - 35
central axis of the bore formed by the wall 711 forms an angle other than 90
degrees with the plate 700.
[00189]      The second set of apertures of the plate 700 includes a
substantially circular central aperture located in the centre of the plate and
eight linear slots radially arranged around the central aperture. The second
set of apertures is used to attach a column, post, pole or any such structural
member to the plate 700. However, in further embodiments, the plate may
include other means, including slots and/or apertures of different shapes and
sizes, to attach other structural members to the plate 700.
[00190]      Each pile 10i includes an elongate member 100i which is
substantially similar to the elongate member 100a of pile 1Ca but differences
therebetween are noted below. However, in further embodiments, the
elongate member 100i of one or more piles 1Ci may be similar to the elongate
members 100a, 100b, 100c, 100d, 100e, 100f, 100g, or 100h of any one of
the screw piles 10a, 1ob, 1Cc, 10d, 1e, 1Of, 1Og or 10h.
[00191]      Like the elongate member 100a of pile 1Ca, the elongate member
100i has a groove 112i on its outer surface 110i. However, the elongate
member 100i does not have a coupling, anchor member or leading bit at its
end portions.
[00192]      The piles 1Ci are inserted through the elliptical apertures 710 of the
plate 700 via a rotary powerhead or a jackhammer. However, in further
embodiments, the internal surface of the wall 711 of the plate 700 may be
threaded and the piles 1Ci may be screwed into the walls 711 and through the
elliptical apertures 710 of the plate 700.
[00193]      The piles 1Ci, when inserted through the elliptical apertures 710 of
the plate 700, are located at an angle other than 90 degrees to the plate 700,
i.e the longitudinal axis 12i of the elongate member 100i of each pile 1Ci forms
an angle other than 90 degrees with the plate 700. In this embodiment, each
pile 1Ci is located at an angle and inclined in a direction that is different from

                                          - 36
the direction and the angle of inclination of the remaining piles 10i. However,
in further embodiments, two ore more piles 10i may be located at the same
angle and/or inclined in the same direction. Moreover, in further embodiments,
the pile assembly 20 may include two, three or more than four piles 10i.
[00194]      Each pile 10i has a proximal end portion 120i, that is located
adjacent the walls 711 of the plate 700 when the pile 1Ci has been inserted
through the elliptical apertures 710 of the plate 700, and a distal end portion
140i, that is located distal from the plate 700. When the pile assembly 20 is
installed in the ground, the plate 700 is located immediately above the ground
level and the distal end portions 140i of the elongate members 100i of the pile
1Ci are located in the soil, below the ground level.
[00195]      In order to install the pile assembly 20, the plate 700 is first placed
in position on the ground. The piles 1Ci are then inserted through the elliptical
apertures 710 of the plate 700 until the proximal end portions 120i of the
elongate members 100i of the piles 1Ci are adjacent the walls 711 of the plate
700 and the distal end portions 140i are secured in the ground, distal from the
plate 700.
[00196]      The pile assembly 20 serves as a stable and strong foundation
onto which a structural column or post can be attached. An advantage of the
pile assembly 20 over similar assemblies known in the art is that, due to the
increased strength of the grooved elongate members 100i of the piles 1Ci, the
total length of the piles 10i required is less than in conventional pile
assemblies, thereby resulting in reduced manufacturing and installation costs.
The use of the piles 1Ci in the pile assembly 20 is particularly advantageous
as the groove on the elongate members 100i of the piles 10i provides the
piles 1Ci with increased bending strength which is necessary to withstand the
forces experienced by the piles when they are installed in the ground at an
angle other than 90 degrees to the plate 700.
