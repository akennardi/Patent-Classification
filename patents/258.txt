element comprises an enclosure; a first piston configured to move relative to the
enclosure to generate the seismic waves; a first actuator, located inside the enclosure,
and configured to move the first piston back and forth relative to the enclosure; a
second piston located inside the enclosure; and a second actuator, located inside the

        Method and System for Pneumatic Control for Vibrator Source Element
                                          BACKGROUND
   TECHNICAL FIELD
 5 [0001]         Embodiments of the subject matter disclosed herein generally relate to
   methods and systems and, more particularly, to mechanisms and techniques for
   controlling internal pressure of a marine vibratory source element for maintaining
   hydrostatic balance with the ambient pressure.
 0 DISCUSSION OF THE BACKGROUND
   [0002]         Reflection seismology is a method of geophysical exploration to
   determine the properties of a portion of a subsurface layer in the earth, information
   that is especially helpful in the oil and gas industry. Marine reflection seismology is
   based on the use of a controlled source that sends energy waves into the earth. By
 5 measuring the time it takes for the reflections to come back to plural receivers, it is
   possible to estimate the depth and/or composition of the features causing such
   reflections. These features may be associated with subterranean hydrocarbon
   deposits.
   [0003]         For marine applications, a seismic survey system 100, as illustrated in
20 Figure 1, includes a vessel 102 that tows plural streamers 110 (only one is visible in
   the figure) and a seismic source 130. Streamer 110 is attached through a lead-in
   cable (or other cables) 112 to vessel 102, while source 130 is attached through an
   umbilical 132 to the vessel. A head float 114, which floats at the water surface 104,
   is connected through a cable 116 to a head end 11 0A of streamer 110, while a tail

                                                 2
   buoy 118 is connected, through a similar cable 116, to a tail end 11 OB of streamer
   110. Head float 114 and tail buoy 118 maintain the streamer's depth and are also
   provided with GPS (Global Positioning System) or other communication equipment
   120 for determining the streamer's position.
 5 [0004]         In this regard, knowing the exact position of each sensor 122 (only a
   few are illustrated in Figure 1 for simplicity) is important when processing the seismic
   data these sensors record. Thus, vessel 102 is also provided with GPS 124 and a
   controller 126 that collects the position data associated with streamer head and tail
   ends and also the position of the vessel and calculates, based on the streamer's
 0 known geometry, the absolute position of each sensor.
   [0005]         The same happens for source 130. A GPS system 134 is located on
   float 137 for determining the position of the source elements 136. Source elements
   136 are connected to float 137 to travel at desired depths below the water surface
   104. During operation, vessel 102 follows a predetermined path T while source
 5 elements (usually air guns) 136 emit seismic waves 140. These waves bounce off
   the ocean bottom 142 and other layer interfaces below the ocean bottom 142 and
   propagate as reflected/refracted waves 144 that are recorded by sensors 122. The
   positions of both the source element 136 and recording sensor 122 are estimated
   based on GPS systems 120 and 134 and recorded together with the seismic data in
20 a storage device 127 onboard the vessel.
   [0006]         A source element may be impulsive (e.g., an air gun) or vibratory. A
   vibratory source element is described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No.
   13/415,216 (herein the '216 application), filed on March 8, 2012, and entitled,
   "Source for Marine Seismic Acquisition and Method," assigned to the same assignee

                                               3
as the present application, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by
 reference.
 [0007]        A vibratory source element experiences increased ambient pressure as its
depth increases. The increase in ambient pressure is approximately 1 bar for every 10
 m of added depth. For vibratory source elements with a large radiating surface
 (pistons), the resultant force acting on this surface due to the hydrostatic force can
 become so great that, in fact, the resultant force exceeds the force capability of the
actuator used to drive the piston. If this happens, the seismic source element becomes
 unable to generate seismic waves. Transient effects, for example sea swells, can also
 produce localized fluctuations in ambient pressure near the source that can also result
 in significant forces that act on the piston face. Figure 6 illustrates an estimate of the
variation in ambient pressure for a source located at 25 m depth that might be
experienced during a seismic survey.
 [0008]        To make best use of the force that can be developed by the source
element's actuator, one approach is to counteract (i.e., balance) the static forces acting
on the pistons so the actuator only provides a dynamic force for generating the seismic
waves.
 [0009]        Thus, it is desirable to provide systems and methods that balance the
 hydrostatic force/pressure acting on the source element while being towed underwater.

ambient pressure of the enclosure while seismic waves are generated.

waves in water. The source sub-array includes a float configured to float in water and
plural source elements suspended from the float. A source element includes an
enclosure having an opening covered by a piston, wherein the piston is configured to
move relative to the enclosure to generate the seismic waves, a local supply
accumulator fluidly communicating with an interior of the enclosure, wherein the local
supply accumulator stores a fluid that is also present inside the enclosure, a pressure of

                                                  7
                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0030]           The following description of the exemplary embodiments refers to the
   accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings identify
 5 the same or similar elements. The following detailed description does not limit the
   invention. Instead, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims. The
   following embodiments are discussed, for simplicity, with regard to the terminology and
   structure of a vibratory source element configured to generate acoustic energy in a
   marine environment. However, the embodiments to be discussed next are not limited
 0 to a marine environment; they may be applied to any type of source of seismic waves
   that uses moving pistons, for example, in sources that are raised and lowered and
   used in fluid filled boreholes for RVSP (reverse vertical seismic profiling) surveys or
   cross-hole tomography work.
   [0031]           Reference throughout the specification to "one embodiment" or "an
 5 embodiment" means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in
   connection with an embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the subject
   matter disclosed. Thus, the appearance of the phrases "in one embodiment" or "in an
   embodiment" in various places throughout the specification is not necessarily referring
   to the same embodiment. Further, the particular features, structures or characteristics
20 may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.
   [0032]           According to an embodiment, a pneumatic control system for
   maintaining a balance between a source element's interior pressure and the ambient
   pressure is configured to have a control loop that adjusts the interior pressure as the
   source element's piston moves back and forth. Thus, for some of the time the

                                                  8
   pressure inside the source element needs to be increased, while for other times it
   has to be decreased. An advantage of maintaining hydrostatic balance around the
   source element pistons is that this helps to maintain the actuator's position near the
   center of its stroke limits. Particularly for source elements' operation that generates
 5 low frequencies, where large piston displacements are required to radiate useful far
   field acoustic signal levels, it is desirable to achieve correct centering of the actuator.
   Improper actuator centering may generate great forces inside the source element's
   structure, which in time may result in mechanical failure.
   [0033]          Prior to discussing various pneumatic control systems, a vibratory
 0 source element is introduced, which, for simplicity, is referred to herein as a source
   element. A source element may have an electro-magnetic linear actuator system
   configured to drive a piston (or a pair of pistons). Note that a piston defines not only
   a rigid material but may include a soft material, for example, a diagram. Thus, a
   piston is a material that separates an inside of the source element from the ambient.
 5 However, it is possible to have a hydraulic, pneumatic, magnetostrictive or
   piezoelectric actuator or other appropriate mechanisms instead of the electro
   magnetic actuator. A source element may be driven by an appropriate pilot signal.
   Plural source elements may be located together to form a source sub-array. One or
   more source sub-arrays form a source array. A vessel is configured to tow a source
20 array. A pilot signal is designed as a source array target signal such that the total
   array far-field output follows a desired target power spectrum. A drive signal derived
   from the pilot signal is applied to each source element. A pilot signal may have any
   shape, e.g., pseudo-random, cosine or sine, increasing or decreasing frequency, etc.

                                                 9
   [0034]          According to the embodiment illustrated in Figure 2A, a source element
   200 has a housing 220 that, together with pistons 230 and 232, enclose an actuator
   system 240 and separate it from the ambient 250, which might be water. Although
   Figure 2A shows two movable pistons 230 and 232, note that a source element may
 5 have any number of pistons, e.g., one piston or more than two.
   [0035]          Housing 220 may be configured as a single enclosure as illustrated in
   Figure 2A and have first and second openings 222 and 224 configured to be closed
   by pistons 230 and 232. However, in another embodiment 201 illustrated in Figure
   2B, housing 220 may include two enclosures 220A and 220B rigidly connected to
 0 each other by a member 202. A single actuator system 240 may be configured to
   simultaneously drive pistons 230 and 232 in opposite directions to generate seismic
   waves, as illustrated in Figure 2A. Two actuator systems 240A and 240B may be
   used in the embodiment of Figure 2B. In one application, pistons 230 and 232 are
   rigid, i.e., made of a rigid material, and reinforced, as will be discussed later, with
 5 rigid ribs 234. Actuator system 240 may include one or more individual electro
   magnetic actuators 242 and 244. Other types of actuators may be used.
   Irrespective of how many individual actuators are used in source element 200 or
   201, the actuators are provided in pairs configured to act simultaneously in opposite
   directions on corresponding pistons in order to prevent source element "rocking"
20 motion. Note that it is undesirable to "rock" the source element when generating
   waves because the source element's position should follow a predetermined path
   when towed in water.
   [0036]          The size and configuration of the housing, pistons and actuator system
   depend on the source element's acoustic output. For example, a high-frequency

                                              10
   source element (as illustrated in Figure 2A) has smaller sizes than a low-frequency
   source element (as illustrated in Figure 2B). In one embodiment, the high-frequency
   source element's housing length is about 1.5 m and its diameter is about 450 mm.
   Total housing length of the low-frequency source element is about 3 m and its
 5 diameter is about 900 mm. Thus, in one application, the low-frequency source
   element is substantially double the size of the high-frequency source element.
   [0037]          Actuator system 240 may be attached to housing 220 by an attachment
   248 (e.g., a wall or a bracket). Various other components described elsewhere are
   illustrated in Figures 2A and 2B. Such components may include a sealing
 0 mechanism 260 provided between the pistons and the housing, a pressure
   regulation mechanism 285 or 285A and 285B configured to balance the external
   pressure of the ambient 250 with a pressure of a fluid 273 enclosed by housing 220
   (enclosed fluid 273 may be air or other gases or mixtures of gases), one or more
   shafts (280 and 282) per piston to transmit the actuation motion from the actuation
 5 system 240 to pistons 230 and 232, a guiding system 290 for the shafts, a cooling
   system 294 to transfer heat from the actuator system 270 to ambient 250, one or
   more local control devices 270, 270A, 270B to coordinate the movement of these
   elements, etc.
   [0038]          A pneumatic system for maintaining hydrostatic balance in one or more
20 source elements is now discussed with regard to Figure 3A, which illustrates a single
   sub-array 302 of a source array 300. Sub-array 302 includes a float 304 that floats
   at water surface 306. In one application, float 304 may be configured to float below
   the water surface. From float 304, plural source elements 31 Oa-d are suspended
   through corresponding cables 312a-d, e.g. cables, ropes, chains and/or stretchable

                                               11
   linkage. The number of source elements may vary depending on survey
   characteristics. Figure 3A shows four source elements, but this number is
   exemplary and should not be construed to limit the invention.
   [0039]         Pneumatic system 320 includes a pressure supply mechanism 322 and
 5 a pressure relief mechanism 324. Pressure supply mechanism 322 is tasked with
   moving a fluid from the vessel (in this embodiment, however, it is possible, as
   discussed later, to have the fluid supplied from a local accumulator, thus,
   autonomous from the vessel) to each individual source element, while the pressure
   relief mechanism is tasked with removing the fluid from each source element. The
 0 supply and relief of the fluid may happen in an alternative sequence, as controlled by
   a control device to be discussed later. Both mechanisms act to maintain the
   hydrostatic balance between the source elements' external and internal pressures.
   Each mechanism is now discussed in detail.
   [0040]         Pressure supply mechanism 322 includes a fluid supply line 326 (e.g.,
 5 a hose, conduit, etc.) that takes compressed fluid from the vessel and delivers it to
   the sub-array. The fluid may be air, dry air, or another gas, for example, nitrogen.
   The fluid may be transferred from the vessel at a high pressure. The fluid is
   compressed onboard the vessel by a main compressor (not shown) or another
   similar device. Supply line length L can be in the range of 500 to 1,000 m, in order to
20 position the sources closer to the streamer whose receivers are positioned well back
   of the vessel to avoid noise associated with vessel motion/propulsion.
   [0041]         Because of supply line length, pressure drop and transient response
   become significant issues. Another significant issue for such a configuration is the
   large number of source elements. For example, a modern source array may include

                                                12
   dozens of source elements, each requiring pressurized fluid. Further complicating
   the picture are the localized ambient pressure perturbations due to wave action, and
   sea swells, and the need for each source element to have the pressurized fluid as
   quickly as possible to balance the outside pressure. Other hydrodynamic forces due
 5 to towing may also act upon the piston face and need to be counter balanced.
   Therefore, the volume of fluid necessary during source array operation is significant.
   Supplying pressurized fluid from the vessel directly to each source element is slow,
   which results in unsatisfactory pressure balance. Because traditional pneumatic
   systems cannot quickly supply the fluid at high pressure over such long distances
 0 and to so many source elements, this application's inventors have proposed the
   following novel features.
   [0042]         To resolve the high-pressure requirement, a sub-array global
   accumulator 328 is located on each sub-array. This global accumulator (note that
   the term "global" applies to a given sub-array and not to the entire source array)
 5 stores the fluid under pressure and distributes it to each source element in the sub
   array as needed. This configuration greatly reduces the distance between the
   supply and the source element, e.g., to less than 30 m. Using some exemplary
   numbers, in one application, if the fluid's pressure is 100 bar when leaving the
   vessel's compressor, the fluid's pressure in the accumulator 328 should also be
20 around 100 bar. A pressure-reducing/pressure regulator valve 330 (e.g., passive
   types like spring/diaphragm activated or electrically driven solenoid, proportional,
   poppet, etc.) ensures that the pressurized fluid is delivered at a lower pressure to the
   seismic source elements. Each source element 310a has its own local supply
   accumulator 332a connected to pressure-reducing valve 330. The fluid's pressure in

                                               13
   the local supply accumulator may be between 6 and 10 bars. Thus, the pressure
   reducing valve/pressure regulator valve 330 may be configured to reduce the
   pressure by a factor of ten. Other values are possible.
   [0043]          Considering that each source element 31 Oa is a twin driver as
 5 illustrated in Figures 2A-B, the pressurized fluid is distributed from the local supply
   accumulator 332a via corresponding local valves (e.g., pneumatic valves) 334a-1
   and 334a-2 to the twin drivers. This high pressure is injected in the source element's
   interior 336a, on one side of each piston 338a, to counterbalance the outside
   pressure 340 that acts on the other side of the piston. Note that Figure 3A is a
 0 schematic figure, not at scale and not intended to show the exact shape, position
   and size of the pressure mechanism or seismic source array. Should there be an
   increase in ambient pressure which might cause the pistons to move inward,
   pressurized fluid is delivered inside the source element at a pressure higher than the
   ambient pressure, thus helping the pistons move outwardly relative to the source
 5 element housing to keep the piston and actuator centered within its range of travel
   and to counteract the increase in ambient pressure. Likewise, should there be a
   decrease in ambient pressure which might cause the pistons to move outward, fluid
   is vented from inside the source element at a pressure lower than the ambient
   pressure, thus helping the pistons move inwardly relative to the source element
20 housing to counteract the decrease in ambient pressure. Details about the control
   mechanism for determining when and how much pressurized fluid to allow inside the
   source element are discussed later.
   [0044]          When the pistons need to move inwardly, the volume of the source
   element decreases, thus generating increased pressure inside it. The pressure relief

                                                 14
   mechanism 324 is responsible for preventing/reducing the pressure increase, as is
   now discussed. Pressure relief mechanism 324 may use local valves 334a-1 and
   334a-2 or different pairs (if a twin driver is considered) of valves for removing fluid
   from inside the source element. In one application, local valves 334a-1 and 334a-2
 5 are three-way valves as illustrated in Figures 4A-C, that can be a proportional spool
   valve type, a solenoid valve or comprised of poppet valves. However, local valves
   334a-1 and 334a-2 may be plural single valves, for example, each valve 334a-1
   and/or 334a-2 may include a set of single valves connected in parallel and driven by
   a same signal. This setup may be advantageous for increasing the flowarate.
 0 Figure 4A shows the local supply accumulator 332a being in fluid communication
   with an input 342a of the source element when local valve 334a-1 is in state A. At
   the same time, a local vent accumulator 344a (e.g., one for each source element or
   one for the entire sub-array) and an output 346a of the source element are shut, i.e.,
   not in fluid communication with each other. Figure 4B illustrates the same setup with
 5 the difference that local valve 334a-1 is now in state B, i.e., blocking local supply
   accumulator 332a and input 342a and fluidly communicating local vent accumulator
   344a with output 346a. Figure 4C illustrates the same setup with the difference that
   local valve 334a-1 is now in state C, i.e., blocking local supply accumulator 332a
   from communication with input 3422a and blocking local vent accumulator 344a from
20 communication with output 346a. State C coincides to the case where the ambient
   and internal housing pressures have been adequately equalized and no action is
   required. Other types of valves and/or other arrangements may be used as will be
   appreciated by those skilled in the art as long as the same control of the fluid is

                                                   15
   achieved. Pressure of the local vent accumulator is desired to be around 1 bar, but
   other values may also be used.
   [0045]         The local vent accumulators may be connected to a common line 348
   as illustrated in Figure 3A, and the common line is connected to a vent line 350 that
 5 directly communicates with the atmosphere above the water surface 306. Vent line
   350 may be attached to float 304 or it may have its own float (not shown) for
   maintaining one of its ends in fluid communication with the atmosphere. The
   pressure relief mechanism is thus able to remove the fluid from inside the source
   elements (acting similar to a vacuum pump) and to expel that fluid in the
 0 atmosphere.      In one application, if it is preferred to exhaust the housing fluid at
   depth, rather than running a vent line to the atmosphere to avoid line entanglements,
   the inlet of a pneumatic pump equipped with a pressure regulator mechanism could
   be attached to common line 348 to help maintain low pressure in the local vent
   accumulators. The exhaust port of the pneumatic pump could be connected to a
 5 short exhaust hose equipped with a check valve to vent the exhausted air at or
   above ambient pressure.
   [0046]          Figure 3A also shows that each cable 312a-d is attached to
   corresponding plates 352a-d that offer mechanical support for the source elements,
   local supply accumulators, local vent accumulators, common lines, etc. Figure 3A
20 schematically illustrates the plates and their relations to the other elements.
   [0047]          Pressure mechanism 320 may also include pressure sensors
   distributed at various locations, for example, a pressure sensor 360a inside the
   source element, a pressure sensor 362 outside the source element to measure the
   ambient pressure, a pressure sensor 364a inside local supply accumulator 332a, a

                                                16
   pressure sensor 366a inside local vent accumulator 344a, and/or a pressure sensor
   368 inside global supply accumulator 328. A position sensor 370a may be located
   inside each source element for measuring and/or estimating a position of the piston
   relative to the source element housing. Either the pressure or position
 5 measurements (or another appropriate quantity) may be used in a feedback loop
   control for balancing the hydrostatic pressure.
   [0048]         According to a variant embodiment illustrated in Figure 3B, a vacuum
   pump 380 may be connected to common line 348 for removing the low pressure air
   from the source elements. Vacuum pump 380 may have a vent line 382 that
 0 discharges the air directly to the ambient. Thus, vent line 350 shown in Figure 3A is
   not necessary. Vacuum pump 380 may be actuated by a pneumatic motor 384.
   Pneumatic motor 384 may be connected to accumulator 328 and is driven by the
   high pressure air from this accumulator. The vacuum pump may be, for example, a
   dry scroll pump. The exhaust of the pneumatic motor may be connected through
 5 conduit 386 to local supply accumulators 332a-d to fill them with air to maintain the
   hydrostatic balance. In one application, the pneumatic motor may work in parallel
   with pressure-reducing valve 330, and a pressure relief valve 388 may be used to
   keep the supply pressure from getting too high. Thus, according to this embodiment,
   there is no need for a vent hose to the surface and instead air could be exhausted at
20 the same depth as the source.
   [0049]         In one embodiment, as illustrated in Figure 5, a source sub-array
   includes, besides the elements illustrated in Figures 3A or 3B (and reproduced in
   Figure 5), a controller 502. Controller 502 may be located on the sub-array to act as
   a local controller, or on the vessel to act as a global controller, or it may be

                                                   17
   distributed between the sub-array and the vessel. Controller 502 is electrically
   connected to pressure-reducing valve 330, local valve 334a-1 (also local valve 334a
   2, but for simplicity, this case is not illustrated because it behaves similarly to valve
   334a-1), inside pressure sensor 336a and outside pressure sensor 362. Controller
 5 502 is configured to receive, with a given frequency (preferably less than 2 Hz for not
   interfering with the pistons' movement), pressure measurements from the inside and
   outside pressure sensors. In one application, if a difference between the two
   pressures is greater than a pre-established threshold, e.g., inside pressure is less
   than outside pressure, controller 502 controls local valve 334a-1 to release more
 0 pressurized fluid from local supply accumulator 332a into the inside of source
   element 31 0a. If the opposite situation is true, i.e., outside pressure is less than
   inside pressure, controller 502 changes the state of valve 334a-2 to shut local supply
   accumulator 332a and to fluidly connect the inside of the source element with the
   local vent accumulator 344a to reduce inside pressure. Because inside pressure
 5 changes continuously during piston operation, and because outside pressure also
   may change in time (due to swells, changing source element depth, temperature
   change, etc.) as illustrated in Figure 6, controller 502 needs to continuously monitor
   pressure changes and quickly adjust inside pressure. Continuous monitoring implies
   that a comparison between internal and external pressures is performed with certain
20 regularity, e.g., every 0.5 s or more frequently. Quick adjustment of internal pressure
   is achieved by having the fluid reservoirs close to each source element (i.e., the local
   supply accumulator and local vent accumulator). Note that in one application the
   same may be achieved without the presence of global accumulator 328. Controller
   502 may also coordinate the opening and closing of valve 330 for supplying

                                                18
   pressurized fluid from global accumulator to local accumulators. If valve 330 is a
   proportional valve, controller 502 may control the metering area of valve 330 so as to
   smoothly vary the fluid flow rate. In one application, each source element has its
   own controller 502. However, in another application, controller 502 controls all of a
 5 given sub-array's source elements. In still another application, controller 502
   controls all the source elements of the source array.
   [0050]          Comparing the external and internal pressures is one possible
   approach (loop) for controlling the source elements' hydrostatic balance. Another
   possibility is to measure the piston's position relative to the source element housing
 0 and then subtract off the displacement contribution due to the sweep (or some
   fraction of the displacement contribution due to the sweep, for example, about 90%),
   and to use this result as a feedback signal to controller 502. Note that the
   displacement contribution due to piston sweep may be calculated, based on a
   theoretical model, or measured during a dry test prior to deploying the seismic
 5 source element in water. The controller driving the local valves can use an averaged
   or low-pass filtered piston displacement signal as a feedback signal to keep the
   actuator centered during operation. Other closed loop control schemes are possible,
   such as schemes that have a closed loop bandwidth that falls below the sweep
   frequency bandwidth of interest so the pneumatic control loop ignores rapid piston
20 motion due to sweeping.
   [0051]          Various modifications may be envisioned to the embodiments
   illustrated in Figures 3A-B that still achieve source element pressure balance. For
   example, instead of having vent line 350 communicating with the atmosphere, it is
   possible to extend this line back to the vessel and form a closed pneumatic circuit so

                                               19
   the fluid is returned to the vessel compressor to be recirculated. To help move the
   fluid back to the ship, one or more pumps (not illustrated) may be added to the sub
   array or to each source element. In another application, the source element housing
   includes a chamber 510, as illustrated in Figure 5, that houses the electronics, and it
 5 is isolated from the interior 512 of the source element. Chamber 510's pressure may
   be at atmospheric pressure. In this embodiment, the fluid from interior 512 (which
   has a greater pressure than that inside chamber 510) may be quickly released
   through an internal valve 514 to chamber 510. In still another embodiment, chamber
   510 is made to communicate with valve 334a-1 for venting the fluid outside.
 0 [0052]          In another embodiment illustrated in Figure 7A, a source sub-array 700
   has plural source elements 702, one of which is illustrated for simplicity. In this
   embodiment, the hydrostatic balance between source element 702's inside and
   outside is achieved by a movable internal piston that adjusts its position to control
   the inside pressure. More specifically, Figure 7A shows a housing 704 having one
 5 end 706 closed by an external piston 708. Movement of piston 708 generates the
   desired seismic waves. Figure 7A schematically shows a shaft 710 attached
   between piston 708 and actuator 712. As noted previously, actuator 712 may be
   attached by a bracket 714 or any equivalent structure to housing 704. However,
   different from the embodiments illustrated in Figures 2A-B, an internal piston 716 is
20 completely provided inside housing 704 so it divides housing 704's inside into first
   chamber 718A and second chamber 718B. A different, secondary actuator system
   720 is attached to housing 704 and configured to actuate internal piston 716 through
   one or more shafts 722. For maintaining the pressure inside first chamber 718A, a
   sealing mechanism 724 is distributed between internal piston 716 and housing 704.

                                                20
   [00531          A controller 726, which can be located inside or outside the source
   element, on the vessel, or in any other combination thereof, is configured to
   coordinate main actuator 712 and secondary actuator 720 so that when a pressure
   inside first chamber 718A increases more than a predetermined threshold over
 5 outside pressure, internal piston 716 moves to increase a volume of first chamber
   718A to decrease the pressure in this chamber. Controller 726 is also configured to
   move the internal piston in the opposite direction if the pressure inside first chamber
   718A decreases. Controller 726 may be connected to pressure sensors similar to
   controller 502 in Figure 5 for controlling a movement of the two pistons.
 0 Alternatively, controller 726 may achieve pressure balance by monitoring a position
   of piston 708, as is also discussed above with regard to Figure 5.
   [0054]          Similar to the embodiment illustrated in Figure 3A, a local supply
   accumulator 730 may be located on or next to source element 702 to supply
   pressurized fluid inside first chamber 718A. A valve 732 controls the pressurized
 5 fluid's inflow inside first chamber 718A. A local vent accumulator 734 may also be
   located on or next to the source element for removing the fluid from inside first
   chamber 718A. A corresponding valve 736 controls the fluid's outflow from first
   chamber 718A. Alternatively, instead of having local vent accumulator 734, a vent
   line may be fluidly connected to the atmosphere for venting out the fluid from first
20 chamber 718A. If a vent line is used, a fan or a pump (not shown) may also be used
   to control the fluid's outflow. Note that controller 726 is connected to both valves 732
   and 736 and also to the pump, if one is present, to control the pressure balance
   inside and outside first chamber 718A.

                                                21
   [0055]          In one application, local supply accumulator 730 is not connected to
   the vessel or any other fluid supply. In other words, the local supply accumulator is
   an autonomous unit, similar to a scuba diving unit, which contains the necessary
   fluid under pressure. However, in another application, it is possible to connect the
 5 local supply accumulator 730 to fluid supply on the vessel. If the local supply
   accumulator 730 is autonomous, the local vent accumulator or vent line may also be
   autonomous, i.e., they are not connected to the vessel. In this case, source element
   702 is configured to function without pneumatic assistance from the vessel. Note
   that in one application, internal piston 716 is configured to adjust the pressure inside
 0 first chamber 718A to account only for swells.
   [0056]         A similar source element is illustrated in Figure 7B. However, this
   source element does not use an internal piston 716 and associated actuator system
   720 for balancing the inside pressure with the ambient pressure, but rather uses a
   pump 752 connected to a reservoir 754 for achieving the same function. Pump 752
 5 is configured to act either as an air compressor or as a vacuum pump. Controller
   726 controls pump 752 so that air is removed from source element 750 when the
   hydrostatic pressure decreases. When the hydrostatic pressure increases, pump
   752 reverses its function and adds air to the source element. This could be a closed
   system with no hoses to the surface or to the vessel. Pump 752 may be a vane,
20 scroll or diaphragm pump or a piston pump. In one application, instead of reversing
   the function of the pump, a four-way valve may be used to reverse the inlet and
   outlet lines of the pump. Note that local supply accumulator 730 and local supply
   valve 732 are optional for this embodiment.

                                               22
   [0057]         Figure 8 illustrates another embodiment similar to that discussed with
   reference to Figure 7A, but having a bladder system instead of an internal piston.
   More specifically, Figure 8 shows a rigid enclosure 840 attached to the housing 804
   and forming a second chamber 818B. A bladder system 842 is located inside rigid
 5 enclosure 840 and sized to release or absorb enough fluid into first chamber 818A to
   compensate for pressure variation produced by swells. Bladder system 842 fluidly
   communicates with first chamber 818A through a passage 844. Passage 844 may
   be sized or contain an orifice, for example, to balance pressure variation due to
   swells (below 4 Hz) with the minimum pressure loss and to ensure the function of
 0 actuator 812 for operational frequencies (e.g., between 5 Hz and 25 Hz for a low
   frequency source element). Rigid enclosure 840 may have another passage 846
   that communicates with the ambient (i.e., seawater) such that the ambient pressure
   acts directly on the bladder exterior to help equalize the ambient pressure and
   interior housing pressure. Passage 846 may be sized so as to respond to low
 5 frequency changes in ambient pressure and not so large as to create a significant
   acoustic leakage pathway for sound produced by the sweep.
   [0058]         The embodiment illustrated in Figure 8 may have an autonomous local
   supply accumulator 830, i.e., not connected to the vessel's fluid supply. However, in
   one application, similar to the embodiment illustrated in Figure 7A, the local supply
20 accumulator 830 may in fact be connected to the vessel's fluid supply. In one
   application, bladder 842 may be designed to have a volume twice the volume
   required to balance the pressure inside first chamber 818A. A local vent
   accumulator or vent line 834 may be connected to first chamber 818A for venting out
   the excess pressure inside the first chamber. Controller 826's functionality may be

                                               23
   limited to controlling only actuator 812 and/or local valves 832 and 836. In one
   embodiment, vent line 834 is connected to a pump 835 that is configured to vent out
   the fluid from the housing. In this application, vent line 834 does not need to extend
   to the water surface. In another application, if the pump 835 is present, no vent line
 5 834 may be needed. Pump 835 may be attached to an outside of enclosure 804.
   The pump with the above-noted configurations may also be implemented in the other
   embodiments, e.g., the embodiment of Figure 5.
   [0059]         The following configuration of the controller may apply to any of the
   above-noted embodiments. The controller may be configured to control the local
 0 supply valve such that the pressure inside the enclosure does not fall significantly
   below the ambient pressure while seismic waves are generated. The controller may
   also be configured to control the local vent valve so that the pressure inside the
   enclosure does not significantly exceed the ambient pressure while seismic waves
   are generated. The controller may be programmed to read from storage device
 5 (e.g., a memory) first and second thresholds such that the pressure inside the
   enclosure does not fall more than the first threshold relative to the ambient pressure,
   and the pressure inside the enclosure does not exceed the ambient pressure by
   more than the second threshold. In one application, the first and second thresholds
   are equal.
20 [0060]         A method for maintaining pressure balance outside and inside a
   seismic source is now discussed with regard to Figure 9. In step 900, inside and
   outside pressures are received at a controller. Alternatively, a piston position is
   received at the controller. In step 902 the two pressures are compared or the piston
   position is compared to a given chart that illustrates the piston position in time. If the

                                               24
   external pressure is higher than the internal pressure by a given value, the controller
   activates in step 904 a valve to supply fluid from a local supply accumulator to an
   inside of the source element. If the opposite condition is true, the controller activates
   in step 906 the same valve or another valve to vent fluid out from inside the source
 5 element. These steps may be adapted to control the valves based on the piston
   position relative to the given chart. The supplying or venting of fluid may happen for
   a predetermined period of time. In one application, supplying or venting may happen
   until a new measurement is performed in step 908. In step 910, the contribution of
   the sweep to the housing interior pressure is removed from the output of step 908,
 0 and then the process returns to step 902. In general, for improved efficiency, a
   housing air-spring resonance is employed in the source element design. The
   trapped fluid inside the housing acts like a spring that in combination with the
   combined mass loading due to the driven structure mass and radiation mass creates
   a resonance effect, typically in the midrange of the sweep range. So it is usually
 5 desired to ignore the sweep contribution to the housing pressure variation so as to
   not defeat the housing air-spring.
   [0061]         When implemented in an actual seismic survey system, a seismic
   source array 1200 having the source elements discussed with reference to Figures
   3, 7 and 8 may have, as illustrated in Figure 10A, two high-frequency sub-arrays
20 1002 and a single low-frequency sub-array 1004. Each sub-array may have plural
   source elements as discussed above. In one application, the high-frequency sub
   arrays 1002 are towed at a depth of about 5 m, while the low-frequency sub-array
   1004 is towed at a depth of about 25 m.

                                                25
   [0062]         A side view of a marine acquisition system 1006 that includes seismic
   sources having pistons shaped and configured as discussed above is illustrated in
   Figure 10B. System 1006 includes a towing vessel 1008 that tows the seismic array
   1000. Seismic array 1000 may include, as discussed with regard to Figure 10A, one
 5 or more high-frequency sub-arrays 1002 positioned at a depth H1 and one or more
   low-frequency sub-arrays 1004 positioned at a depth H2, where H2 is deeper than
   H1. Depth controllers 1010 may be located on or next to each sub-array for
   maintaining a desired depth. Umbilicals 1012 connect each sub-array to vessel
   1008. An umbilical may include a strength member, command and data capabilities,
 0 electrical power, and pneumatic air supply.
   [0063]         A mechanical interface 1012 connects corresponding umbilical
   components to a pneumatic supply system 1014, a power supply system 1016, and
   a command and control device 1018. Command and control device 1018 may
   include a processing unit, as described later, that is capable to receive and process
 5 seismic data for imagining the surveyed subsurface. Command and control device
   1018 may also be configured to control a trajectory of the seismic source, adjust its
   trajectory and control the shooting of the source elements. Command and control
   device 1018 may interact with the vessel's navigation system.
   [0064]         Although Figure 10B shows each sub-array having a horizontal
20 distribution, note that a multi-level source may be used instead of source array 1004.
   For example, a multi-level source 1100 is illustrated in Figure 11 as having one or
   more sub-arrays. The first sub-array 1102 has a float 1106 configured to float at the
   water surface 1108 or underwater at a predetermined depth. Plural source elements
   111 Oa-d are suspended from float 1106 in a known manner. A first source element

                                                26
   11 10a may be suspended closest to head 1106a of float 1106, at a first depth z1. A
   second source element 111 Ob may be suspended next, at a second depth z2,
   different from z1. A third source element 111 Oc may be suspended next, at a third
   depth z3, different from z1 and z2, and so on. Figure 11 shows, for simplicity, only
 5 four source elements 111 Oa-d, but an actual implementation may have any desired
   number of source points. In one application, because the source elements are
   distributed at different depths, the source elements at the different depths are not
   simultaneously activated. In other words, the source array is synchronized, i.e., a
   deeper source element is activated later in time (e.g., 2 ms for 3 m depth difference
 0 when the speed of sound in water is 1,500 m/s) such that corresponding sound
   signals produced by the plural source elements coalesce, and thus, the overall
   sound signal produced by the source array appears as being a single sound signal.
   In one embodiment, the high-frequency source elements are simultaneously
   activated in a flip-flop mode with the source elements of the low-frequency source
 5 elements. In another embodiment, all the source elements are simultaneously
   activated with incoherent, coded signals so that the recorded seismic signals can be
   separated based on the source element that emitted that signal.
   [0065]         The depths z1 to z4 of the source elements of the first sub-array 1102
   may obey various relationships. In one application, the source elements' depths
20 increase from the head toward the tail of the float, i.e., z1 <z2<z3<z4. In another
   application, the source elements' depths decrease from the head to the tail of the
   float. In another application, the source elements are slanted, i.e., provided on an
   imaginary line 1114. In still another application, line 1114 is straight. In yet another
   application, line 1114 is curved, e.g., part of a parabola, circle, hyperbola, etc. In

                                               27
   one application, the depth of the first source element for sub-array 1102 is about 5 m
   and the greatest depth of the last source element is about 8 m. In a variation of this
   embodiment, the depth range is between 8.5 and 10.5 m or between 11 and 14 m.
   In another variation of this embodiment, when line 1114 is straight, the depths of the
 5 source elements increase by 0.5 m from one source element to an adjacent source
   element. Those skilled in the art would recognize that these ranges are exemplary
   and these numbers may vary from survey to survey. A common feature of all these
   embodiments is that the source elements have variable depths so a single sub-array
   exhibits multiple-level source elements.
 0 [0066]         The above embodiments were discussed without specifying the type of
   seismic receivers used to record seismic data. In this sense, it is known in the art to
   use, for a marine seismic survey, streamers towed by one or more vessels, and the
   streamers include seismic receivers. The streamers may be horizontal, slanted or
   have a curved profile as illustrated in Figure 12.
 5 [0067]         Curved streamer 1200 of Figure 12 includes a body 1202 having a
   predetermined length, plural detectors 1204 provided along the body, and plural
   birds 1206 provided along the body for maintaining the selected curved profile. The
   streamer is configured to flow underwater when towed such that the plural detectors
   are distributed along the curved profile. The curved profile may be described by a
20 parameterized curve, e.g., a curve described by (i) a depth zo of a first detector
   (measured from the water surface 1212), (ii) a slope so of a first portion T of the body
   with an axis 1214 parallel with the water surface 1212, and (iii) a predetermined
   horizontal distance hc between the first detector and an end of the curved profile.
   Note that not the entire streamer has to have the curved profile. In other words, the

                                                 28
   curved profile should not be construed to always apply to the entire length of the
   streamer. While this situation is possible, the curved profile may be applied only to a
   portion 1208 of the streamer. In other words, the streamer may have (i) only a
   portion 1208 with the curved profile or (ii) a portion 1208 curved and a portion 1210
 5 with a flat profile, with the two portions attached to each other.
   [0068]         Seismic data generated by the seismic sources discussed above and
   acquired with the streamers noted in Figure 12 may be processed in a corresponding
   processing device for generating a final image of the surveyed subsurface as
   discussed now with regard to Figure 13. For example, the seismic data generated
 0 with the source elements as discussed with regard to Figures 3, 7 and 8 may be
   received in step 1300 at the processing device. In step 1302, pre-processing
   methods are applied, e.g., demultiple, signature deconvolution, trace summing,
   motion correction, vibroseis correlation, resampling, etc. In step 1304, the main
   processing takes place, e.g., deconvolution, amplitude analysis, statics
 5 determination, common middle point gathering, velocity analysis, normal-move out
   correction, muting, trace equalization, stacking, noise rejection, amplitude
   equalization, etc. In step 1306, final or post-processing methods are applied, e.g.
   migration, wavelet processing, seismic attribute estimation, inversion, etc. and in
   step 1308 the final image of the subsurface is generated.
20 [0069]         An example of a representative processing device capable of carrying
   out operations in accordance with the embodiments discussed above is illustrated in
   Figure 14. Hardware, firmware, software or a combination thereof may be used to
   perform the various steps and operations described herein. The processing device
   1400 of Figure 14 is an exemplary computing structure that may be used in

                                              29
   connection with such a system, and it may implement any of the processes and

   actuator system and/or the pressure mechanism of each source element. Processor
   1402 carries out a variety of functions as are known in the art, as dictated by
   software and/or firmware instructions.

   including disk drives 1412, CD-ROM drives 1414, and other hardware capable of
   reading and/or storing information, such as a DVD, etc. In one embodiment,
   software for carrying out the above-discussed steps may be stored and distributed
   on a CD-ROM 1416, removable media 1418 or other form of media capable of
20 storing information. The storage media may be inserted into, and read by, devices
   such as the CD-ROM drive 1414, disk drive 1412, etc. Server 1401 may be coupled
   to a display 1420, which may be any type of known display or presentation screen,
   such as LCD, plasma displays, cathode ray tubes (CRT), etc. A user input interface
   1422 is provided, including one or more user interface mechanisms such as a

   mouse, keyboard, microphone, touch pad, touch screen, voice-recognition system,
   etc.

   equipment of a vessel, via a network. The server may be part of a larger network
 5 configuration as in a global area network (GAN) such as the Internet 1428, which
