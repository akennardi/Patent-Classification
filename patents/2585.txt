                                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0014]                      With reference to FIGS. 1-2B, a gas spring-powered fastener driver 10 is
operable to drive fasteners (e.g., nails, tacks, staples, etc.) held within a magazine 14 into a
workpiece. The fastener driver 10 includes a cylinder assembly 18 and a moveable piston
(not shown) positioned within the cylinder assembly 18. The fastener driver 10 further
includes a driver blade (not shown) that is attached to the piston and moveable therewith.
                                                             2
9673352_1 (GHMatters) P107293.AU

The driver blade translates along a driving axis 22 to drive a fastener into the workpiece.
The fastener driver 10 includes a first nosepiece 26 (i.e., a front nosepiece) and a second
nosepiece 30 (i.e., a rear nosepiece). A fastener driving channel 34 is defined between the
front nosepiece 26 and the rear nosepiece 30, and extends along the driving axis 22. With
reference to FIGS. 5A and 5B, the fastener driving channel 34 is defined with a channel
portion 34A in the front nosepiece 26 and a channel portion 34B in the rear nosepiece 30
[0015]                      With reference to FIGS. 2A and 2B, the front nosepiece 26 is secured to an
upper housing 38 of the fastener driver 10, and a quick-release latch 42 is operable to
secure the rear nosepiece 30 (and the attached magazine 14) to the front nosepiece 26.
The quick-release latch 42 includes a user-actuated lever 46, a leaf spring 50 pivotably
coupled to the lever 46, and spaced coaxial pins 54 on a lower end of the spring 50 that
engage corresponding hooks 58 on the rear nosepiece 30. In the illustrated embodiment,
the hooks 58 on the rear nosepiece 30 extend through respective apertures or windows 62
formed in the front nosepiece 26. Using the quick-release latch 42, the rear nosepiece 30
and the magazine 14 can be attached and detached from the front nosepiece 26 without the
use of tools.
[0016]                      With reference to FIGS. 2A-3, the fastener driver 10 further includes a depth
of drive adjustment assembly 64 including a workpiece contact element 66. The workpiece
contact element 66 is movable with respect to the front nosepiece 26 between an extended
position (FIG. 2A) and a retracted position (FIG. 2B). Specifically, as explained in greater
detail below, the workpiece contact element 66 moves from the extended position (FIG. 2A)
to the retracted position (FIG. 2B) when the workpiece contact element 66 contacts a
workpiece and a force directed toward the workpiece is applied to the fastener driver 10.
The front nosepiece 26 includes a groove 70 (FIGS. 3 and 5A) that slidably receives the
workpiece contact element 66. In the illustrated embodiment, the groove 70 is defined in a
front surface 74 of the front nosepiece 26. In other words, the groove 70 is formed on the
front surface 74, which is opposite the fastener driving channel 34. More specifically, the
groove 70 is formed in the front surface 74 of the front nosepiece 26, which is opposite the
channel portion 34A formed on a rear surface 76 (FIG. 5B) of the front nosepiece 26.
[0017]                      In the illustrated embodiment, the workpiece contact element 66 is positioned
between the quick-release latch 42 and the front nosepiece 26. In other words, the
workpiece contact element 66 is positioned in front of the front nosepiece 26. And, the
workpiece contact element 66 extends in the direction of the driving axis 22, or generally
                                                            3
9673352_1 (GHMatters) P107293.AU

parallel with the driving axis 22, which is also parallel with the groove 70. This positioning of
the workpiece contact element 66 ensures a clear line of sight to the workpiece, which might
otherwise be obstructed if the workpiece contact element 66 extended along the side of
either of the nosepieces 26 and 30. As such, no portion of the workpiece contact element 66
extends along the side of either of the nosepieces 26, 30, therefore offering a compact
design that does not block an operator's view of the workpiece or a view of the location on
the workpiece where the fastener will be driven.
[0018]                      With reference to FIG. 4, the workpiece contact element 66 is linear. In
particular, the workpiece contact element 66 includes an upper end 78 positioned directly
above a lower end 82 when viewed from the front of the workpiece contact element 66. The
workpiece contact element 66 includes a mounting block 86 to secure the workpiece contact
element 66 to the remaining portions of the depth of drive adjustment assembly 64. In the
illustrated embodiment, a rounded portion 90 of the workpiece contact element 66 transitions
to a planar portion 94 that is slidably received with the groove 70 on the front nosepiece 26.
[0019]                      With reference to FIG. 3, the depth of drive adjustment assembly 64 also
includes a first bracket 98, a spring 102, an adjustment knob 106, and a second bracket 110.
The upper end 78 of the workpiece contact element 66 is secured to the first bracket 98 by
fasteners 114. The first bracket 98 includes a seat 118 upon which to support the spring
102. The spring 102 is also supported on a seat 122 (FIGS. 2A and 2B) formed on a
mounting flange 126 of the upper housing 38. As such, the spring 102 biases the first
bracket 98 and the workpiece contact element 66 away from the mounting flange 126,
towards the extended position. A screw portion 130 is formed as part of the first bracket 98
and is received within a threaded bore of the adjustment knob 106. The second bracket 110
supports the adjustment knob 106 between two flanges 134. The second bracket 110 and
the adjustment knob 106 translate with the first bracket 98 and workpiece contact element
66 between the extended position (FIG. 2A) and the retracted position (FIG. 2B).
[0020]                      The depth of drive adjustment assembly 64 adjusts the depth to which a
fastener is driven into the workpiece. In particular, the depth of drive adjustment assembly
64 adjusts the effective length of the combination of the workpiece contact element 66 and
the first bracket 98, and changes the distance between the nosepieces 26, 30 and the
workpiece when the workpiece contact element 66 is in the retracted position (coinciding
with initiation of a fastener driving operation). In other words, the depth of drive adjustment
assembly 64 adjusts how far the workpiece contact element 66 extends past the nosepieces
                                                            4
9673352_1 (GHMatters) P107293.AU

26, 30 when a fastener is driven into a workpiece. As such, when the workpiece contact
element 66 is in the retracted position, the position of the workpiece contact element 66 with
respect to the front nosepiece 26 is adjustable to adjust the depth to which a fastener is
driven.
[0021]                      With continued reference to FIGS. 2A-3, the fastener driver 10 further
includes a switch 138 (e.g., a microswitch) operable to detect when the workpiece contact
element 66 is positioned against a workpiece. In other words, the switch 138 determines
when the workpiece contact element 66 is in the retracted position (FIG. 2B). Upon reaching
the retracted position (FIG. 2B), a finger 142 on the second bracket 110 engages an
actuation arm of the switch 138, thereby closing the switch 138 (if the switch 138 is normally
open) to allow activation of the fastener driver 10. Activation of the fastener driver 10 is
prevented when the workpiece contact element 66 is in the extended position (FIG. 2A).
