APPARATUS, SYSTEMS, AND METHODS FOR BREWING A BEVERAGE
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]      This application claims the benefit of, and priority to, United States Provisional
Application Serial No. 61/563,185, filed on November 23, 2011, entitled "Apparatus, Systems,
and Methods for Brewing a Beverage," which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
The present application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application Number
2012340526, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
FIELD
[0002]      The present disclosure generally relates to apparatus, systems, and methods for
brewing a beverage, such as coffee, and includes the disclosure of automated single-cup coffee
brewing systems having one or more brew groups or modules.
BACKGROUND
[0003]      Many methods and systems for brewing beverages, such as coffee, are known. In
conventional coffee brewing systems, a brewing machine typically brews a relatively large batch
of coffee. In commercial settings, a barista may pour cup-sized portions of coffee from the batch
when a customer places an order. Such beverage brewing systems are inefficient because coffee
may be wasted when not all of the coffee in the batch is ordered or consumed.      In addition, such
systems may produce coffee having an inconsistent flavour and taste because the coffee is not
necessarily brewed when a customer places an order and may not be fresh when consumed.
[0004]      Automated single-cup coffee brewing systems may be employed to address some of
the disadvantages of conventional batch-type coffee brewing systems. Users of automated
single-cup coffee brewing systems would benefit from several improvements to those systems,
including, but not limited to, reducing the time it takes to brew a single-cup portion or traveller
portion of coffee, reducing the labour and time involved in cleaning brewing equipment between

                                                 2
brew cycles, reducing steam and condensation from entering the grinder and hopper areas of the
system to improve the quality of the coffee and to reduce corrosion on grinder components,
improving the accuracy and repeatability of providing a desired dose of coffee beans to a grinder
portion of the system, improving agitation of coffee grounds during a brew cycle, and reducing
the labour and time involved in maintaining the hoppers and refilling the hoppers with coffee
beans.

[0077]       Figures 23-49 illustrate additional embodiments of a system for brewing a beverage.
The embodiments of Figures 23-49 are similar in many respects to the embodiments of Figures
1-22. However, the embodiments of Figures 23-49 may include additional, or alternative,
features not necessarily included in the embodiments of Figures 1-22. Similarly, the
embodiments of Figures 1-22 may include additional, or alternative, features not necessarily
included in the embodiments of Figures 23-49. For example, one difference illustrated in
Figures 23-49 is that the system for brewing a beverage may include substantially cylindrical
hoppers that are inclined and disposed generally on their side.
[0078]       In particular, Figures 23-28 illustrates an embodiment of a system for brewing a
beverage where three brew modules are installed in a beverage brewing machine. Figure 29-33
illustrate embodiments of a brew module configured to be used with a beverage brewing
machine. Figures 34A and 34B show an embodiment of a hopper of a brew module. Figures

35A and 35B illustrate an embodiment of a brewing chamber of a brew module. Figures 36 and
37 illustrate partial views of a brew module where a brewing chamber is disposed in a first
position and in a second position. Figures 38-40 illustrate partial views of a brew module where
certain components have been removed to help show a brewing chamber of the brew module.
Figures 41 and 42 are additional views of a brew module where certain components have been
removed to help show interior components of the brew module. Figures 43-45 illustrate
embodiments of a doser assembly and a volumetric doser. Figures 46-49 show components of a
fan assembly configured to provide airflow at or near a grinder outlet.
[0079]       As discussed in more detail below, one embodiment provides a system for
automatically brewing a single-cup portion or a traveller portion of coffee. The system has more
than one brew module, where each brew module has more than one hopper. The system allows a
user to quickly and easily brew a variety of types of single-cup portions of coffee. In one
particular embodiment, the system comprises three brew modules each comprising two hoppers.
In that particular embodiment, the system is configured to contain and brew six different types of
coffee. In other embodiments, the system may comprise more or less than three brew modules
and each brew module may be in communication with more or less than two hoppers. In some
embodiments, the brew modules may be in communication with one or more shared hoppers
such that relatively few hoppers may provide grounds to many brew groups.
[0080]       In another embodiment, a system is provided that brews a faster cup of coffee based
on a combination of the following parameters: finely ground coffee, high brewing temperature,
fan spray during brewing process, fine filter, and a relatively large piston. In another
embodiment, a system is provided that brews a faster cup of coffee based on a combination of the
following parameters: finely ground coffee, faster grinder, grinder-brewer integration, lower
steep time, high brewing temperature, hotter brew vessel, and a motor configured to provide
sufficient power and force to the piston. In one particular embodiment, the system is configured
to grind, brew, and dispense a single-cup portion of coffee in about 30 seconds or less. In some
embodiments, fan spray is provided to agitate coffee grounds to improve extraction.

                                                12
[0081]      In another embodiment, a system is provided to clean interior components of a brew
module, where the system uses one or more fan sprays to remove coffee grounds and residue to
clean the components between brewing cycles. They system may also include a plow feature that
mechanically moves a large portion of the grounds and residue. The cleaning system may be
automatic such that a user does not need to manually clean components of a brewing machine
between brewing cycles.
[0082]      In another embodiment, a baffle device is provided that is configured to prevent
steam and condensation from rising and entering a grinder and hopper of a beverage brewing
system. The baffle device may be disposed on an upper portion of a brew module between a
wiper assembly of the brew module and a grinder plate assembly that supports the grinder and
hopper. A fan may provide airflow about the baffle device to reduce condensation that
accumulates on surfaces of the baffle device and to prevent steam and moisture from rising and
contacting grinder components and coffee beans. In some embodiments, airflow is provided
from outside a beverage brewing machine. In other embodiments, airflow is provided from
inside the beverage brewing machine, such as from inside a chassis of the machine. In some
embodiments, airflow may be provided from both outside and inside the beverage brewing
machine.
[0083]      In another embodiment, an apparatus for brewing a beverage is provided. The
apparatus comprises at least one brew module configured to brew a single-cup portion of a
beverage. The at least one brew module comprises a grinder subassembly, an upper
subassembly, a fan, and a baffle device configured to provide a positive pressure inlet at or near a
coffee grounds outlet to prevent steam and condensation from rising and entering the grinder
subassembly. The baffle device is disposed on an upper portion of the at least one brew module
and generally below the grinder subassembly. The fan is configured to provide airflow about the
baffle device. The baffle device is suspended with respect to a lower face of the upper
subassembly.
[0084]      In another embodiment, a beverage brewing machine includes an apparatus to lower
the coffee bean hoppers relative to the brewing machine so that a user may easily refill and

                                                  13
maintain the hoppers. The apparatus may comprise a handle in communication with a frame of
the machine to allow translation of the hopper without disassembly to relocate the hopper to a
more serviceable location. The apparatus may reduce the labour and time involved in
maintaining the hoppers and refilling the hoppers with beans.
[0085]       In another embodiment, a beverage brewing machine includes a plurality of hoppers
that are disposed generally on their side and at least partially inclined. The hoppers may be
advantageously arranged in a side-by-side configuration in a serviceable location so that a user
may easily refill and maintain the hoppers without necessarily having to lower the hoppers or
having to use a stool or step, for example, to access the hoppers. Such an apparatus may reduce
the labour and time involved in maintaining the hoppers, refilling the hoppers with beans, and
exchanging one hopper for another hopper.
[0086]       While the drawings show embodiments of systems for brewing a beverage having
one brew module and embodiments having three brew modules, the disclosed embodiments may
also include systems having other numbers of brew modules, such as systems having two brew
modules, four brew modules, five brew modules, six brew modules, or more brew modules.
Further, each brew module may be in communication with more or less than two hoppers. In
some embodiments, the brew modules collectively may be in communication with one or more
shared hoppers. For example, the system may transport coffee beans or grounds from relatively
few hoppers to many brew groups or modules. The drawings will now be described in greater
detail below.
[0087]       Figure 1 illustrates one embodiment of a system 10 for brewing a beverage such as
coffee. The system 10 may include a beverage brewing machine 12, a coffee cup 14, and a
coffee traveller container 16. The beverage brewing machine 12 comprises an outer cover 20, a
dispensing portion 30, a grinder plate assembly 40, and three brew groups or modules 50. The
outer cover 20 has a front panel 22 that covers a front portion of the beverage brewing machine
12. The outer cover 20 may include a display screen 24 configured to display data or information
relating to the system 10 for brewing a beverage. The dispensing portion 30 provides a surface
to place a cup 14 and/or a traveller container 16 to receive and contain coffee brewed by the

                                                   14
brewing machine 12. The cup 14 may be configured to contain a single serving of coffee, while
the traveller container 16 may hold a larger quantity of coffee to serve multiple customers or
consumers.
[0088]       The grinder plate assembly 40 is configured to interact with the brew modules 50 to
contain coffee beans, grind the beans, and provide the grounds to the brew modules 50. The
brew modules 50 then brew coffee, such as a single-cup portion or a larger traveller-size portion,
and automatically clean interior components of the brew modules 50 to prepare for the next brew
cycle. The grinder plate assembly 40 may include six hoppers 42 such that two hoppers 42 are
configured to interact with each brew module 50. In one embodiment, each hopper 42 provides
beans to a grinder, which is not shown in Figure 1, of the grinder plate assembly 40. The brew
modules 50 include a waste bin 52 with a handle to easily remove used coffee grounds and other
waste, such as excess water, from the brewing machine 12. The brew modules 50 also include a
dispenser 54 to dispense coffee into a cup 14 or traveller 16.
[0089]       In some embodiments, the brew module 50 may include one or more sensors to
detect and monitor qualities of the finished beverage. Data obtained from the one or more
sensors may be stored and logged in a data storage device. The one or more sensors may include
sensors configured to detect qualities such as temperature, opacity, total dissolved solids (or
TDS), and Brix (e.g., sugar content of the beverage). The data may be used to provide
information about the beverage brewing machine 12. The one or more sensors may be
configured to conduct a final quality control check for the brewed beverage and identify potential
issues if certain data falls outside of predetermined tolerance ranges. For example, if the coffee
temperature is low at the dispenser 54, then a user may discover that a heating element of the
machine 12 has failed. In some embodiments, the one or more sensors are disposed at or near
the dispenser 54. In some embodiments, the one or more sensors may conduct initial and/or
intermediate quality control checks in addition to, or in place of, a final quality control check.
[0090]       In some embodiments, the brew module 50 may include one or more sensors to
detect and monitor qualities regarding the size and volume of a container for the brewed
beverage. The one or more sensors may detect the size of a beverage cup 14 and provide

                                                    15
information to the beverage brewing machine 12 to ensure that the appropriate quantity of
beverage is dispensed. An interlock feature can activate to dispense only an appropriate amount
of brewed beverage. For example, the one or more sensors are configured to ensure that the
system 10 does not dispense 20 ounces of beverage when an 8-ounce cup is present. In addition,
the one or more sensors could detect a beverage traveller container 16 is present and dispense an
appropriate amount of brewed beverage to the traveller 16. The one or more sensors may also
ensure that the dispenser 54 does not dispense brewed beverage when a container, such as a cup
14, is not present. In some embodiments, the one or more sensors are disposed at or near the
dispenser 54. In some embodiments, the interlock feature may comprise a motion interlock
feature and/or an ultrasonic interlock feature.
[0091]       While the embodiment of Figure 1 shows a system 10 having three brew modules 50
and six hoppers 42, other configurations may be used. For example, the system 10 may include
more or less than three brew modules 50. In addition, the brew modules 50 may be configured to
interact with more or less than two hoppers 42, and each brew module 50 does not necessarily
need to interact with the same number of hoppers 42 as other brew modules 50. In some
embodiments, the brew modules 50 communicate with one or more hoppers 42 shared among
some or all of the brew modules 50. In one embodiment, the system 10 comprises two brew
modules 50 each having two hoppers 42.
[0092]       In some embodiments, the system for brewing a beverage (such as, for example, the
systems shown in Figures 1 and/or Figures 23) may brew a faster cup of coffee than other
systems by speeding up the brewing process based on one or a combination of some or all of the
following parameters: finely ground coffee, faster grinder, grinder-brewer integration, lower
steep time, high brewing temperature, hotter brew vessel, and a motor configured to provide
sufficient power and force to the piston. The motor may comprise a torquey motor that is
configured to generate high torque at low RPMs. In some embodiments, the motor provides
sufficient force and power to the piston such that desired speed and movement of the piston is
not limited by the motor of the brewing machine. Other parameters may include fan spray during
the brewing process, a fine filter, and a relatively large piston. A system having a relatively large
piston and filter facilitates filtering a large volume of coffee grounds quickly by maintaining a

                                                 16
relatively thin puck of coffee grounds. A fine filter may be used with finer coffee grinds to
appropriately filter the coffee.
[0093]       In one particular embodiment, the system is configured to grind, brew, and dispense a
single-cup portion of coffee in approximately 30 seconds or less. For example, the system may
complete a grind and brew cycle in approximately 26 seconds and dispense the coffee in
approximately 4 seconds. Existing brew processes for single-cup portions of coffee may take
more than 60 seconds. Thus, reducing the cycle time to approximately 30 seconds results in a
significant time savings to a user and customer.
[0094]       Providing finely ground coffee typically will result in a faster brew time. However,
there are some limitations with finely ground coffee. For example, when using fine grounds, an
operator typically has less control over the brewing process and ultimately less control over the
taste of the coffee. Thus, some brewing systems use finely ground coffee to reduce the brew
time, but those systems may produce coffee having a poor taste. In addition, typically there is
less margin for error with finely ground coffee. For instance, finer grinds can require greater
process control because extraction becomes more sensitive than with coarser grinds.
[0095]       Other parameters may also improve the brewing process. For example, it may be
desirable to provide a relatively high temperature of water, such as water having a temperature of
approximately 210 degrees. In some embodiments, water having a temperature of about 200
degrees to 220 degrees is provided during a brew cycle. A relatively high temperature of water
can speed up the brewing process. During the brewing process, it may also be desirable to
provide a fan spray of hot water to the coffee grounds. The fan spray provides agitation and
wetting advantages such that it speeds up extraction of flavour from the coffee grounds. In some
prior brewing systems, a barista would manually agitate the coffee grounds. In some
embodiments of the disclosed system, providing a fan spray eliminates or reduces the need for a
barista to manually agitate the coffee grounds. A relatively fine filter may be provided so that the
dispensed coffee has an appropriate texture and is not too murky. The filter may be configured
to compensate for finer grinds and to produce a cup of coffee with appropriate clarity. A
relatively large piston also has been found to be advantageous because a large piston allows the

                                                  17
machine to provide a more aggressive and faster filtering process. The large piston also allows
the puck of coffee grounds to be relatively thin to provide more efficient filtration. In some
embodiments, the piston has a diameter approximately one inch larger than pistons in standard
brewing machines.
[0096]       In some applications, it might be advantageous to modify the flavour profile of the
brewed beverage. Varying water temperature during the brew process may modify the flavour of
a brewed beverage. Water having a higher temperature tends to speed up extraction and produce
a stronger, more aggressive flavour. Water having a lower temperature tends to slow down
extraction and produce coffee having a mellower flavour. Water temperature may be varied
during the brewing process through flow rate of the water, providing water at different
temperatures, and/or providing water at different times during the brewing process. For example,
the beverage brewing system may add water during the steeping process to change the water
temperature. In some embodiments, hot water may be added mid-steep and in other
embodiments cool water may be added mid-steep. Changing the water temperature during the
steeping process can allow the system to customize a particular flavour of the brewed beverage.
In some embodiments, the system has two or more boilers each configured so that the system
may provide water having different temperatures during the steeping process. In some
embodiments, water pressure may be varied to modify the flavour of a brewed beverage.
[0097]       In addition, grind size may be used to modify the flavour profile of a brewed
beverage. A coarser grind tends to slow down extraction from the coffee grounds and to produce
a relatively mellow coffee. A finder grind tends to increase extraction speed and produce coffee
having a stronger flavour. The system may provide coffee grounds having multiple grind sizes to
modify the flavour profile. For instance, coffee grinds having different sizes may be added at
different points during the steep process to mix the differently-sized coffee grinds. This can also
allow the system to customize a particular flavour of the brewed beverage. In some
embodiments, more than one grinder may be used to create different grind sizes. In some
embodiments, both changing water temperature mid-steep and mixing multiple grind sizes may
be employed to modify the flavour profile of brewed coffee. In other embodiments, the flavour
of the brewed beverage may be determined by adjusting and/or controlling one or more of the

                                                  18
following parameters: brew time, water temperature, grind size, and dose ratio. Any or all of the
considerations and parameters described in the paragraphs above may be applied to embodiments
of the systems 100, 1000 shown in Figures 1 and/or Figure 23, respectively.
[0098]       Figures 2-7 show an embodiment of a system 100 for brewing a beverage where one
brew module 500 is installed in a beverage brewing machine 110. The system 100 of Figures 2-7
is substantially similar to the system 10 of Figure 1 except that only one brew module 500 is
shown in Figures 2-7. Figures 2-7 illustrate the modular nature of the system 100 in that one or
more brew modules 500 may be removed from or attached to the brewing machine 110. The
system 1000 for brewing a beverage illustrated in Figure 23 may also be modular in that one or
more brew modules 1050 of the system 1000 may be removed from or attached to the beverage
brewing machine 1010 illustrated, for example, in Figures 23-28.
[0099]       With reference to Figure 2, the system 100 may include a beverage brewing machine
110, a coffee cup 120, and a traveller container 130. The beverage brewing machine 110 may
comprise an outer cover 200, a dispensing portion 300, a grinder plate assembly 400, and a brew
group or module 500. The outer cover 200 has a front panel 210 that may include a display
screen 220. The beverage brewing machine 110 defines a brew module receiving area 230
configured to receive a brew module 500. In the illustrated embodiment, a centre brew module
receiving area 230a and a right brew module receiving area 230b do not contain a brew module
500 and portions of those receiving areas 230a, 230b may be seen in Figure 2. The dispensing
portion 300 provides a surface to place a cup 120 and/or a traveller container 130 to receive and
contain coffee brewed by the brewing machine 110.
[00100]      The grinder plate assembly 400 is configured to interact with the brew module 500
similar to the interaction described above with respect to the system 10 of Figure 1. The brew
module 500 is shown on a left portion of the brewing machine 110 and interacts with two
hoppers 410 disposed on a left side of the grinder plate assembly 400. The grinder plate
assembly 400 may comprise a vent feature 401 to allow steam and air generated during and after
the brew cycle to travel out of the brewing machine 110 and to be released into the surrounding
environment.

                                                  19
[00101]      Figures 3-7 illustrate other views of the system 100. Many of the features and
components of the system 100 described above with respect to Figure 2 may be further seen in
Figures 3-7. In particular, Figures 3 and 4 show a front side and a rear side, respectively, of the
system 100. Figure 4 shows a rear panel 240 that covers a rear portion of the beverage brewing
machine 110. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate a right side and a left side, respectively, of the system
100. Figure 5 shows a right side panel 202 that covers a right side of the brewing machine 110,
and Figure 6 shows a left side panel 204 that covers a left side of the brewing machine 110.
Figure 7 shows a top view of the system 100, which illustrates how the hoppers 410 may be
oriented, in some embodiments, with respect to the grinder plate assembly 400.
[00102]      Turning to Figure 8, an embodiment of the grinder plate assembly 400 of the brewing
machine 110 is shown. The grinder plate assembly 400 comprises a base plate 430 that supports
each hopper and grinder subassembly 402. The hopper and grinder subassembly 402 comprises a
grinding mechanism 420 attached to the base plate 430. A support plate 404 supports the hopper
410 and a chute portion 412 of the hopper 410 interacts with the grinding mechanism 420 to
deliver coffee beans to the grinding mechanism 420. A fan 440 is attached to base plate 430 and
is disposed on the underside of the base plate 430. The fan 440 may interact with an upper
subassembly 800 of the brew module 500 to provide airflow to a baffle device 860. The brew
module 500 is described below in connection with Figures 9-14, and the upper subassembly 800
and baffle device 860 are described below in connection with Figures 20-22.
[00103]      Other embodiments of the system 100 may comprise different configurations of
components of the system 100, such as different configurations of the beverage brewing machine
110, the grinder plate assembly 400, the brew module 500, and the upper subassembly 800.
Other embodiments of the grinder plate assembly 400 may comprise different configurations and
components. In addition, one or more of the embodiments of the system 1000 and/or the
beverage brewing machine 1010 illustrated in Figures 23-42 may also include a grinder plate
assembly with similar structure and function as the grinder plate assembly 400 illustrated, for
example, in Figures 2 and 8.

                                                  20
[00104]      In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 8, the grinder plate assembly 400 has six
hoppers 410, six grinding mechanisms 420, and six fans 440. However, other embodiments may
include less or more hoppers 410, grinding mechanisms 420, and/or fans 440. For example,
other embodiments may comprise a grinder plate assembly with four hoppers 410, four grinding
mechanisms 420, and four fans 440. In some embodiments, the grinder plate assembly does not
have the same number of hoppers 410, grinding mechanisms 420, and/or fans 440. For example,
in one such embodiment, the grinder plate assembly 400 could include four hoppers 410, more or
less than four grinding mechanisms 420, and more or less than four fans 440. In some
embodiments, coupling between the grinding mechanisms 420 and the brew groups 500 may be
less direct and not in a one-to-one relationship. In some embodiments, a single fan may provide
sufficient airflow to, or within, the system 100.
[00105]      In some embodiments, the grinder mechanism 420 comprises a stopping mechanism.
In one embodiment, the stopping mechanism comprises a disc brake. The stopping mechanism
may control the spin-down of grinder components. The stopping mechanism is configured to
provide highly-accurate, timed whole bean dosing to the brew module 500. In other
embodiments, one or more hoppers and/or the grinding mechanism are configured to provide
volumetric dosing instead of, or in addition to, timed dosing. Controlled dosing may provide a
repeatable and consistent amount of beans and/or grounds during the brewing process.
[00106]      Figures 9-14 illustrate an embodiment of a brew module 500. With reference to
Figures 9 and 10, the brew module 500 comprises an interior subassembly 600, a wiper assembly
700, and an upper subassembly 800. The upper subassembly 800 is configured to receive coffee
grounds from a hopper 410 (shown in Figure 2) and deliver the grounds to the interior
subassembly 600 for brewing a single-cup portion of coffee. The wiper assembly 700 is
configured to interact with the interior subassembly 600 to clean components of the brew module
500. For example, the wiper assembly 700 may clean components of the interior subassembly
600 between brewing cycles. One or more of the embodiments of the system 1000 and/or the
beverage brewing machine 1010 illustrated in Figures 23-42 may also include an interior
subassembly, a wiper assembly, and an upper subassembly with similar structure and function as

                                                  21
the interior subassembly 600, the wiper assembly 700, and the upper subassembly 800 illustrated,
for example, in Figures 9-14.
[00107]      The brew module 500 may also include a waste bin 510 that collects used coffee
grounds and other waste. The waste bin 510 preferably allows a barista to remove the bin 510
from the brew module 500 to easily dispose of its contents. The waste bin 510 is illustrated near
a front portion of the brew module 500. A dispenser 520 to dispense coffee is also shown on a
front portion of the brew module 520. The brew module 500 may also include a side cover 530
to cover a right side of the brew module 500 and a front cover 540 to cover an upper front
portion of the brew module 500. In some embodiments, the brew module 500 comprises an
inner vent feature 802 that interacts with the outer vent feature 401 (see Figure 2) of the brewing
machine 110 to permit steam generated during a brew cycle to vent from the brewing machine
110 and into the surrounding environment. One or more of the embodiments of the brew module
1050 illustrated, for example, in Figures 23-33 may also include an inner vent feature and an
outer vent feature similar in structure and function to the inner vent feature 802 and the outer
vent feature 401 described above with respect to Figures 9-14. Other embodiments of the brew
module 500 may comprise different configurations and components.
[00108]      The components described above are further illustrated in Figures 11-14. For
example, Figures 11 and 12 show left side and right side views, respectively, of the brew module
500. Figures 13 and 14 show cross-sectional views of the brew module 500 taken along the lines
13-13 and 14-14, respectively, of Figure 9. Figures 13 and 14 show certain interior components
and features of the brew module 500, such as a piston 630 disposed near a lower portion of a
piston chamber 632.
[00109]      Figure 15 illustrates an embodiment of an interior subassembly 600 of a brew module
500. The interior subassembly 600 may comprise a lower portion 610 and an upper portion 620.
The lower portion 610 includes a first support surface 612 that is attached to a lower portion of
the brew module 500 to secure the interior subassembly 600 to the brew module 500. The lower
portion 610 also includes a second support surface 614 to support components of the upper
portion 620 of the interior subassembly 600. The upper portion 620 may include a piston

                                                   22
housing 622 that houses a piston 630 (shown in Figures 13 and 14). The piston housing 622
extends from the second support surface 614 to a third support surface 624. The third support
surface 624 defines an opening 626. The piston housing 622 defines a hollow piston chamber
632 (shown in Figures 13 and 14) to allow the piston 630 to translate vertically and extend above
the piston housing 622 and third support surface 624. The third support surface 624 may also
interact with a wiper assembly 700 (which is described in more detail below). Other
embodiments of the interior subassembly 500 may comprise different configurations and
components.
[00110]      Figures 16-19 illustrate an embodiment of a wiper assembly 700 of a brew module
500. The wiper assembly 700 may include one or more fan sprays attached to a moving filter
wiper to pressure wash the filter either after or during a primary wipe that disposes of used coffee
grounds. In particular, the wiper assembly 700 can mechanically clear the bulk of used coffee
grounds and a pressure washer system may spray off remaining fine grinds, oils, and other
unwanted substances. The used coffee grounds can be directed into a waste bin for easy removal
by a user. One or more of the embodiments of the system 1000 and/or the beverage brewing
machine 1010 illustrated in Figures 23-42 may also include a wiper assembly similar in structure
and function to the wiper assembly 700 illustrated, for example, in Figures 16-19.
[00111]      In some embodiments, hot water is used to remove fine grinds, oils, and/or unwanted
substances. Hot water typically is better for breaking down oils than cold water. However, hot
water may require more power to heat the water. In some embodiments, cold water may be used
to remove fine grinds, oils, and/or unwanted substances to improve efficient use of power by the
system 100.
[00112]      With reference to Figures 16 and 17, the wiper assembly 700 comprises a frame 710,
a wiper mechanism 730, a first spray feature 740, and a second spray feature 750. The frame 710
includes a first sidewall 712 having a first belt assembly 714. The belt assembly 714 extends
from a portion of the frame 710 near a distal wall 718 to a portion of the frame 710 near a
proximal wall 726 (which may be seen in Figure 17). The frame 710 also includes a base portion
720 that defines an opening 722. The opening 722 is configured to allow the piston 630 (which

                                                  23
may be seen in Figures 13 and 14) to pass therethrough. The frame 710 comprises a front
portion 716 that includes a deflector 724. The deflector 724 is configured to direct waste toward
the waste bin 510 (which may be seen in Figure 9) and may protect certain components of the
brew module 500, such as electronic components. The illustrated embodiment is shown having
two sidewalls and two belt assemblies, each disposed on opposing sides of the frame 710. In
particular, Figure 18 shows a second sidewall 713 and a second belt assembly 715 on an
opposing side of the frame 710 from the first sidewall 712 and first belt assembly 714. The belt
assemblies 714, 715 may comprise timing belts.
[00113]       Returning to Figures 16 and 17, the wiper mechanism 730 comprises an upper
portion 734 and a plow 732 attached to the upper portion 734. The wiping portion 734 is
configured to contact an upper surface of the base portion 720 to wipe and clean the base portion
720 and other components of the brew module 500. The first spray feature 740 extends from the
distal wall 718 to the wiper mechanism 730. The first spray feature 740 may extend through a
portion of the wiper mechanism 730. The first spray feature 740 also may include a nozzle 742
that is directed away from the distal wall 718 of the frame 710 (see Figure 17). The second spray
feature 750 may comprise a structure that extends between walls of a front portion 716 of the
wiper mechanism 730. In one embodiment, the second spray feature 750 includes three nozzles.
The nozzles may comprise a central nozzle 752, a right nozzle 754, and a left nozzle 756. The
nozzles 752, 754, 756 of the second spray feature 750 may be directed generally toward a distal
wall 718 of the frame 710. In the illustrated embodiment, the nozzles 752, 754, 756 of the
second spray feature 750 are configured in a direction generally opposite from the direction of
the nozzle 742 of the first spray feature 740. Figures 18 and 19 show a rear perspective view and
a right side view, respectively, of the wiper mechanism 730. Other embodiments of the wiper
assembly 700 may comprise different configurations and components.
[00114]       The operation of the wiper assembly 700 will now be described with references to
Figures 16-19. In one embodiment, as described below, the wiper mechanism 730 passes the
opening 722 four times in a complete cycle. The wiper mechanism 730 begins in a first position
near the distal wall 718 of the frame 710. The wiper mechanism 730 is not shown in this
position in the drawings. After the beverage brewing machine 110 brews a single-cup portion of

                                                   24
coffee, the piston 630 (show in Figures 13 and 14) can raise to provide used coffee grounds to
the wiper assembly 700. The coffee grounds can extend upward through the opening 722 of the
base portion 720. The wiper mechanism 730 may be actuated such that the belt assemblies 714,
715 activate to move the wiper mechanism 730 linearly toward a front portion 716 of the wiper
assembly 700. As the wiper mechanism 730 passes through the exposed coffee grounds, the
plow 732 collects coffee grounds and directs them toward the deflector 724 and waste bin 510
(see Figure 9). The wiper mechanism 730 continues to move toward the front portion 716 until it
reaches a second position near the front portion 716 of the wiper assembly 700. Figures 16-19
show the wiper mechanism 730 disposed near this second position.
[00115]       After the wiper mechanism 730 has reached the second position, it will have
mechanically moved much of the used coffee grounds and unwanted materials from the piston
and filter to the waste bin. The second spray feature 750 may activate such that one, some, or all
of the central nozzle 752, right nozzle 754, and left nozzle 756 spray a cleaning fluid, such as
water, toward the wiper mechanism 730 to clean grounds and debris from wiper mechanism 730.
At this point, the piston lowers slightly before or during retraction of the wiper mechanism 730
to avoid dirtying a rear portion of the wiper mechanism 730 with the piston 630, which has not
yet been pressure washed. In one embodiment, the piston 630 lowers so that it is not elevated
above the opening 722 of the base portion 720. The wiper mechanism 730 may then linearly
translate from the second position near the front portion 716 to the first position near the distal
wall 718. At this point, the cleaning cycle is approximately halfway complete.
[00116]       Once the wiper mechanism 730 reaches a retracted position, the piston 630 raises to
flush again for a secondary spray wash. For example, when the wiper mechanism 730 has
returned to the first position near the distal wall 718, the first spray feature 740 may activate such
that it directs a cleaning fluid, such as water, out of the nozzle 742. The nozzle 742 may direct
the cleaning fluid across the base portion 720 and piston 630 toward the front portion 716 of the
wiper assembly 700. This step is intended to remove remaining debris from the wiper assembly
700. For example, the first spray feature 740 may serve as a pressure washer to sufficiently clean
exposed surfaces of the wiper assembly 700. In some embodiments, the first spray feature 740

                                                   25
may also activate during the previous step described above where the plow 732 mechanically
clears the bulk of the used coffee grounds.
[00117]      After the first spray feature 740 activates and sprays the piston, filter, and
surrounding surfaces, the wiper mechanism 730 may once again move from the first position to
the second position. Such movement causes the plow 732 to push and direct remaining
unwanted grounds, oils, and excess water toward the waste bin. Finally, the wiper mechanism
730 moves from the second position near the front portion 716 back to its original position near
the distal wall 718. A two-step process involving mechanically removing the bulk of the grinds
in one step and then using the first spray feature 740 to clear remaining grounds in a second step
has been found to be advantageous in some applications because, among other reasons, such a
process results in less waste water than a single-step cleaning process employing only a spraying
step. Other embodiments of the wiper assembly 700 may comprise different configurations and
components. One or more of the embodiments of the system 1000 and/or the beverage brewing
machine 1010 illustrated in Figures 23-42 may include a wiper assembly having an operation
similar to the wiper assembly 700 described above with reference to Figures 16-19.
[00118]      Figures 20-22 illustrate an embodiment of an upper subassembly 800 of a brew
module 500. The upper assembly 800 includes a baffle device 860 that is configured to provide a
positive pressure inlet at or near a coffee grounds outlet to prevent steam and condensation from
rising and entering the hoppers and/or grinders. When moisture enters the hoppers and/or
grinders, it may interact with whole or partial coffee beans and negatively affect the quality of the
beans, the operation of the grinder and the brewing machine, and the quality of ground coffee.
By suspending a baffle device 860, air may flow across a lower portion of the upper subassembly
800 to, for example, reduce wicking of moisture. A fan 440 of the grinder plate assembly 400
(see Figure 8) may interact with the upper subassembly 800 to provide such airflow to the baffle
device 860. In some embodiments, the baffle device 860 is configured to minimize damage or
corrosion of the grinder motor and burrs from moisture and/or steam. In addition, the baffle
device 860 may be configured to prevent the grounds chute from becoming wet and sticky and
retaining accumulated and unwanted coffee grounds. One or more of the embodiments of the
system 1000 and/or the beverage brewing machine 1010 illustrated in Figures 23-42 may include

                                                 26
a baffle device having similar structure and function as the baffle device 860 illustrated, for
example, in Figures 20-22 and described herein.
[00119]      The fan 440 may provide airflow about the baffle device 860 to reduce condensation
that accumulates on surfaces of the baffle device 860 and to prevent steam and moisture from
rising and contacting coffee beans. In some embodiments, airflow is provided from outside the
beverage brewing machine 110. In other embodiments, airflow is provided from inside the
beverage brewing machine 110, such as from inside a chassis of the machine 110. In some
embodiments, airflow may be provided from both outside and inside the beverage brewing
machine 110. In some embodiments, it is advantageous to pull air from inside the chassis of the
machine 110 because the machine 110 may consume up to approximately 10kW of power during
the brewing process and, as a result, the machine 110 may become relatively hot. Thus, the
airflow may also cool components of the machine 110 when pulled from inside the machine 110.
In addition, providing air from outside the machine 110, such as by blowing ambient air through
the brew group 500, tends to cool the water and brew cylinder as it flows through the brew group
500. In some applications, it is preferable to maintain a higher temperature inside the brew
chamber.
[00120]      With reference to Figures 20-22, the upper assembly 800 comprises a baffle housing
820 attached to a base plate 810. The baffle housing 820 includes a base portion 822 and a cover
824. The baffle housing 820 houses a baffle device 860, which is shown in Figures 21 and 22.
In one embodiment, the baffle device 860 is attached to a support member 870 of the baffle
housing 820 such that the baffle device 860 is suspended with respect to the base plate 810. For
example, the baffle device 860 does not directly contact the base plate 810 and may be elevated a
certain distance with respect to the base plate 810. The cover 824 of the baffle housing 820 can
define a first upper opening 840 and a second upper opening 850. The first upper opening 840
and the second upper opening 850 each are configured to receive coffee grounds from a hopper
410 (shown in Figure 2).
[00121]      The upper subassembly 800 may also include a first hose 830 and a second hose 832
for providing hot liquid through a portion of the baffle device 860 and then to a portion of the

                                                   27
interior subassembly 600 (see Figure 15) for interacting with coffee grounds to brew coffee. The
upper subassembly 800 may also include one or more springs 826 that interact with the baffle
housing. The springs 826 may engage with a portion of the grinder plate assembly 400 (see
Figure 8) such that the cover 824 of the baffle housing 820 mates with a portion of the grinder
plate assembly 400.
[00122]      With reference to Figure 21, the baffle device 860 defines a first channel 842 that
extends from the first upper opening 840 near an upper portion of the baffle device 860 to a first
lower opening 844 near a lower portion of the baffle device 860. The baffle device 860 also
defines a second channel 852 that extends from the second upper opening 850 to the second
lower opening 854. The channels 840, 850 are configured to direct coffee beans through the
baffle device 860 and out of the first lower opening 844 and second lower opening 854,
respectively, to the coffee filter and piston of the brew module 500.
[00123]      The baffle device 860 defines a first outer sloped surface 846 and a second outer
sloped surface 856. The outer sloped surfaces 846, 856 are generally configured to direct airflow
downward toward a lower portion of the baffle device 860. The baffle device 860 includes a
proximal end 829 near the second outer sloped surface 856. The proximal end 829 includes a
wall that generally closes that end of the baffle device 860. In contrast, in some embodiments, as
described in more detail below, the distal end 827 of the baffle device 860 includes an opening
828 to allow air to pass therethrough.
[00124]      With reference primarily to Figures 20 and 21, the baffle housing 820 also includes a
distal end 827 that is configured to be disposed near a rear portion of the brew module 500. The
distal end 827 defines an opening 828. When a fan 440 of the grinder plate assembly 400 (see
Figure 8) interacts with the upper subassembly 800, the fan 440 may deliver a current of air
through the opening 828 toward the baffle device 860. After passing through the opening 828 in
the distal end 827, the airflow travels generally toward the first outer sloped surface 846 of the
baffle device 860. Because of the generally closed configuration of the baffle housing 820 (apart
from the opening 828), the air is directed downward and out of the upper subassembly 800
through the first lower opening 844 and the second lower opening 854. In some embodiments,

                                                  28
steam may exit the brewing machine to highlight the brewing process and the freshness of
brewed coffee to customers and users. In addition, the steam may direct desirable brew chamber
smells to customers and users. The steam may also provide a type of visual theatre to enhance
the atmosphere at, for example, a coffee shop setting by allowing users and/or customers to
watch steam exit the brewing machine during a brew cycle.
[00125]      Figures 22A and 22B show the baffle device 860 and portions of the upper
subassembly 800 in greater detail. In the illustrated embodiment, a lower portion of the baffle
device 828 is separated from and not in contact with a proximal portion 812 of the base plate
810. With reference to Figures 20-22, the upper subassembly 800 may include a support member
870 that supports the baffle device 860. The support member 870 extends from sidewalls of the
base portion 822 of the baffle housing 820. The support member 870 defines a horizontal fluid
opening 872. The first hose 830 and the second hose 832 engage the fluid opening 872 to deliver
hot water through the baffle device 860. The horizontal fluid opening 872 leads to a vertical
fluid opening 874 (see Figure 21) so that water may be dispensed out of the upper subassembly
800. In some embodiments, the vertical fluid opening 874 includes two nozzles arranged at
approximately 90 degrees with respect to each other to provide fan sprays of hot water to
adequately cover a relatively large piston of the brew module 500. Proper fan spray coverage can
result in complete, or near complete, wetting of the coffee grounds, which facilitates full
extraction from the coffee grounds.
[00126]      The support member 870 is configured to receive and support the baffle device 860.
The baffle device 860 includes a recess in a central portion such that the baffle device 860 may
rest on the support member 870. By positioning the baffle device 860 on the support member
870, the baffle device may be elevated with respect to the base plate 810 of the upper
subassembly 800. Thus, the support member 870 serves as both a support for the baffle device
860 and as a manifold to deliver hot water to internal components of the brew module 500.
Other embodiments of the upper subassembly 800 and/or the baffle device 860 may comprise
different configurations and components than the illustrated embodiments described above.

                                                  29
[00127]      Parallel dosing may refer to delivering hot water and coffee grounds simultaneously
to a piston and filter for brewing coffee. A problem with parallel dosing sometimes occurs
because providing hot water through internal components of a coffee brewing machine typically
results in significant condensation on surfaces of internal components of the machine. Such
condensation may result in wet coffee grounds near openings and orifices of the machine and
may create a dense, tar-like accumulation of wet coffee grounds. Such build-up may block
passageways and openings of the coffee brewing machine and affect the performance of the
machine by slowing down the brew cycle and impairing the quality of the brewed coffee.
[00128]      One advantage of the upper subassembly described above is that it allows a brewing
machine to conduct parallel dosing of coffee grounds and hot water to brew coffee without
negatively affecting the quality of the coffee or performance of the machine. That is, the
machine may deliver hot water and coffee grounds simultaneously to a piston and filter for
brewing. This results in a faster brew cycle and reduces the time it takes to brew a single-portion
cup of coffee. In addition, coffee grounds typically wet better when sprayed while airborne as
opposed to when they are disposed in an accumulated mass on the piston and filter.
[00129]      The upper subassembly 800 facilitates parallel dosing by providing airflow through
the opening 828 in the distal end 827 of the baffle housing 820. The airflow is then directed
toward the first outer sloped surface 846. The airflow tends to travel around outer surfaces of the
baffle device 860. The suspended nature of the baffle device 860 allows airflow to travel easily
about the baffle device 860. Such airflow about outer surfaces of the baffle device 860 reduces
built-up moisture and condensation on those surfaces, essentially drying those surfaces and
preventing steam and condensation from traveling upward toward the grinder components and
coffee beans. The airflow is directed out of a lower portion of the upper subassembly 800
through a first opening 880 and a second opening 882 in the base plate 810 (see Figure 22B).
[00130]      Some of the features of embodiments of the system 1000 and/or brewing machine
1010 illustrated in Figures 23-49, and described in more detail below, may also facilitate parallel
dosing during a brew cycle. For instance, embodiments of the chamber 1210, which is illustrated
in Figures 35A and 35B, provide a structure that facilitates parallel dosing.

                                                  30
[00131]       With reference to Figures 2 and 9, the coffee brewing machine 110 may also include
an outer vent feature 401, and the brewing module 500 may include an inner vent feature 802.
The inner vent feature 802 and the outer vent feature 401 may interact to allow steam and air
generated during and after a brewing cycle to travel out of the brewing machine 110 and to be
released into the surrounding environment. In the illustrated embodiment, the inner vent feature
802 and the outer vent feature 401 are disposed near a front portion of the brewing machine 100.
One advantage of providing such vent features near a front portion of the machine 110 is that it
provides both a pleasing visual appearance of rising steam and a desirable smell of coffee during
and after the brewing process. Such pleasing appearance and desirable smell may enhance the
atmosphere of a commercial establishment, such as a coffee shop, and may provide visual theatre
to a customer. The vent features are configured to allow steam to highlight the activity of the
brewing machine and the freshness of the brewed beverage.
[00132]       In some embodiments not illustrated in the drawings, the system 100 for brewing a
beverage may include an apparatus to lower the hoppers 410 so that the hoppers 410 may be
refilled easily by a user. For example, the system 100 may include an apparatus that allows
translation of the hopper 410 without disassembly to relocate the hopper 410 to a more
serviceable location. In some embodiments, the apparatus may comprise a handle in
communication with a structure that rotates about one or more pivot points to lower an assembly
containing the hoppers 410. In the same or other embodiments, the apparatus may comprise a
handle that includes a structure, such as a four-bar linkage, that allows movement in two stages.
In the first stage, the handle may allow translation of the frame generally laterally outward from
the brewing machine so that it clears an upper surface of the machine. At this point, gates on the
machine may activate to close ports to the grinders. In the second stage, the handle may allow
translation of the frame in a generally downward direction. In one embodiment, the handle
allows movement of the hoppers to the front of the brewing machine. In other embodiments, the
handle may be configured to allow movement of the hoppers to the side or rear of the brewing
machine.
[00133]       Advantageously, the apparatus may reduce the labour and time involved in
maintaining the hoppers 410 and refilling the hoppers 410 with coffee beans. The hoppers 410

                                                   31
normally are disposed at a relatively high elevation with respect to the ground and it may be
difficult for a barista to refill the hoppers 410. Such a handle apparatus may reduce or eliminate
the need for a barista to use a ladder or step stool to refill the hoppers 410 or to otherwise expend
significant effort to maintain the hoppers 410. Some users or operators empty and clean hoppers
on a daily basis, or even multiple times a day. Providing such an apparatus would significantly
improve access to the hoppers for maintaining the hoppers.
[00134]      Figures 23-49 illustrate additional embodiments of a system for brewing a beverage.
The embodiments of Figures 23-49 are similar to the embodiments described above with respect
to Figures 1-22. Unless indicated otherwise, some or all of the components, features, and/or
advantages described above with respect to Figures 1-22 may be incorporated in any of the
embodiments of Figures 23-49. Similarly, unless indicated otherwise, some or all of the
components, features, and/or advantages described below with respect to Figures 23-49 may be
incorporated in any of the embodiments of Figures 1-22.
[00135]      Figure 23 illustrates an embodiment of a system 1000 for brewing a beverage. In
some embodiments, the system 1000 is configured to brew coffee. The system 1000 may include
a beverage brewing machine 1010 that is configured to brew a single-cup portion of a beverage
and/or a traveller size portion of a beverage. The beverage brewing machine 1010 comprises an
outer cover 1020, a dispensing portion 1030, a doser assembly 1040, and three brew groups or
modules 1050a, 1050b, 1050c. The outer cover 1020 may comprise separate outer covers such
that each brew group or module has its own outer cover to substantially cover the beverage
brewing machine 1010. In some embodiments, the outer cover 1020 may include a display
screen configured to display data or information relating to the system 1000 for brewing a
beverage. The outer cover 1020 may comprise a tool-less release mechanism such that the outer
cover 1020 can be removed from the brewing machine 1010 without the use of additional
components or tools. For example, a front portion of the cover 1020 may have a tool-less release
mechanism to allow a user to easily and quickly remove the front portion of the cover 1020 to
access interior components of one or more brew module 1050. The dispensing portion 1030 may
include a surface 1060 to place a drinking receptacle, cup, mug, and/or a traveller container to

                                                  32
receive and contain beverage brewed by the brewing machine 1010. In some embodiments, the
beverage brewing machine 1010 is configured to interact with a plurality of hoppers 1070.
[00136]      In some embodiments, the hoppers 1070, the doser assembly 1040, and grinding
components of the beverage brewing machine 1010 are configured to interact with the brew
modules 1050 to contain coffee beans, grind the beans, and provide coffee grounds to the brew
modules 1050. The brew modules 1050 then brew coffee, such as a single-cup portion or a
larger traveller-size portion, and automatically clean interior components of the brew modules
1050 to prepare for the next brew cycle. In some embodiments, the doser assembly 1040 of each
brew module 1050 may be configured to interact with two hoppers 1070 such that beverage
brewing machine 1010 includes a total of six hoppers 1070. In one embodiment, the hoppers
1070 of each brew module 1050 are configured to provide beans to a grinder of the brew module
1050 (the grinder is not shown in Figure 23). The brew modules 1050 also include a dispenser
1032 to dispense the beverage into a drinking receptacle or container.
[00137]      The beverage brewing machine 1010 may include one or more waste bins 1080
configured to easily remove used coffee grounds and other waste, such as excess water, from the
brewing machine 1010. The waste bin 1080 may be disposed between adjacent brew modules
1050. For example, Figure 23 shows a waste bin 1080a disposed between a left brew module
1050a and a centre brew module 1050b. That figure also shows a waste bin 1080a disposed
between a right brew module 1050c and a centre brew module 1050b. The waste bins 1080a,
1080b preferably allow a barista to remove the bin from the brew module 1050 to easily dispose
of its contents. The waste bins 1080a, 1080b are illustrated such that they may be accessed and
removed from a front portion of the beverage brewing machine 1010. In other embodiments,
however, one or more waste bins 1080 may be configured to be removed from a rear portion
and/or a side portion of the beverage brewing machine 1010.
[00138]      While the embodiment of Figure 23 shows a system 1000 having three brew modules
1050 and six hoppers 1070, other configurations may be used. For example, the system 1000
may include more or less than three brew modules 1050. In addition, the brew modules 1050
may be configured to interact with more or less than two hoppers 1070, and each brew module

                                                 33
does not necessarily need to interact with the same number of hoppers 1070 as other brew
modules. In some embodiments, the brew modules communicate with one or more hoppers
1070 shared among some or all of the brew modules.
[00139]     For example, and not by way of limitation, in one embodiment, the system 1000
comprises two brew modules 1050 and one or more shared hoppers 1070. In another
embodiment, the system 1000 comprises two brew modules 1050 each having one hopper 1070.
In another embodiment, the system 1000 comprises two brew modules 1050 each having two
hoppers 1070. In another embodiment, the system 1000 comprises two brew modules 1050 each
having between one and three hoppers 1070. In another embodiment, the system 1000 comprises
three brew modules 1050 and one or more shared hoppers 1070. In another embodiment, the
system 1000 comprises three brew modules 1050 each having one hopper 1070. In another
embodiment, the system 1000 comprises three brew modules 1050 each having two hoppers
1070. In another embodiment, the system 1000 comprises three brew modules 1050 each having
between one and three hoppers 1070. In another embodiment, the system 1000 comprises four
brew modules 1050 and one or more shared hoppers 1070. In another embodiment, the system
1000 comprises four brew modules 1050 each having one hopper 1070. In another embodiment,
the system 1000 comprises four brew modules 1050 each having two hoppers 1070. In another
embodiment, the system 1000 comprises four brew modules 1050 each having three hoppers
1070. In another embodiment, the system 1000 comprises four brew modules 1050 each having
between one and four hoppers 1070.
[00140]     In one particular embodiment, the system 1000 is configured to grind, brew, and
dispense a single-cup portion of coffee in approximately 30 seconds or less. The system may
also be configured to automatically clean interior components of a brew module 1050 of the
beverage brewing machine 1010 in approximately 30 seconds. For example, the system may
complete a grind and brew cycle in approximately 26 seconds and dispense the coffee in
approximately 4 seconds. The system may then automatically clean the brew module 1050 in
approximately 30 seconds or less such that the total time for brewing and cleaning a single brew
module is approximately 60 seconds or less. Existing brew processes for single-cup portions of
coffee may take more than 60 seconds, and cleaning those machines between uses may take

                                                  34
another 30-60 seconds or more. Thus, reducing the brew cycle time to approximately 30 seconds
and the automatic cleaning time to approximately 30 seconds or less may result in a significant
time savings to a user and customer. Moreover, having a beverage brewing machine 1010
configured to brew multiple single-cup portions of a beverage simultaneously using multiple
brew groups 1050 results in additional efficiency and time savings to a user and customer.
[00141]      Figures 24-28 illustrate other views of the system 1000 for brewing a beverage.
Many of the features and components of the system 1000 described above with respect to Figure
23 may be further seen in Figures 24-28. In particular, Figures 24 and 25 show a front side and a
rear side, respectively, of the system 1000. Figures 26 and 27 illustrate a left side and a right
side, respectively, of the system 1000. Figure 28 shows a top view of the system 1000, which
illustrates how the hoppers 1070 and/or the dispensers 1032 may be oriented, in some
embodiments, with respect to the beverage brewing machine 1010.
[00142]      Figure 29 illustrates an embodiment of a brew module 1050 that may be used with
the system 1000 for brewing a beverage. The brew module 1050 may comprise an outer cover
1020, a dispensing portion 1030, and a doser assembly 1040. The outer cover 1020 includes a
first portion 1022 configured to cover a lower portion of the brew module 1050 and a second
portion 1024 configured to cover an upper portion of the brew module 1050. The outer cover
1020 may also include a third portion 1026 that is configured to cover a front portion of the brew
module 1050. In some embodiments, the outer cover 1020 may include a display screen
configured to display data or information relating to the system 1000 for brewing a beverage.
For example, the third portion 1026 of the outer cover 1020 may include a display screen
disposed so that a user can easily interpret data or information and/or interact with the display
screen.
[00143]      The dispensing portion 1030 may be configured to provide a visual signal to a user to
indicate when a brew cycle is complete and the brewing machine is ready to dispense a brewed
beverage. The signal may be easily discernible by a user, such as a barista in a coffee shop
setting. In some embodiments, the signal comprises a mechanical signal. For example, a control
member, such as a button, that is disposed on an end of the dispensing portion may be in a

                                                 35
retracted position when a beverage is being brewed and in an extended position when the brew
cycle is complete and a beverage is ready to be dispensed. Advantageously, a user may easily
and quickly recognize that the button is in an extended position without requiring the use of an
electronic signal or display.
[00144]      In some embodiments, as illustrated in Figure 29, the dispensing portion 1030 may
include a spout member 1032, a control member 1034, and a nozzle 1036. The spout member
1034 is configured to receive brewed beverage from a brewing area of the brew module 1050 and
dispense the beverage through the nozzle 1036 to a container, such as a cup or mug. The control
member 1034 may be in communication with a plunger that is configured to extend and retract
the control member 1034 with respect to a distal end 1038 of the spout member 1032. In some
embodiments, the control member 1034 comprises a button.
[00145]      When the brew module 1050 is ready to brew a beverage, the control member 1034
may be in a retracted position such that the control member 1050 is disposed at or near the distal
end 1038 of the spout member 1032. The plunger may be spring loaded and, for example,
released by a solenoid when the brew cycle is complete or near complete. When the plunger is
released, the control member 1034 extends from the spout member 1032. The control member
1034 may extend a certain distance from the spout member 1032 sufficient to enable a user to
easily detect that the control member 1034 is in an extended position. The user may then
dispense the dispense the beverage from the nozzle by, for example, pressing the control member
1034. After the user dispenses the beverage, the control member 1034 may stay in a retracted
position until the next brew cycle is complete or near complete.
[00146]      In the illustrated embodiment, the doser assembly 1040 comprises a first doser
portion 1041 and a second doser portion 1045. The first doser portion 1041 and the second doser
portion 1045 may be disposed in a generally side-by-side arrangement. The first doser portion
1041 comprises a first attachment member 1042, a first receiving portion 1043, and a first doser
chamber 1044. Similarly, the second doser portion 1045 comprises a second attachment member
1046, a second receiving portion 1047, and a second doser chamber 1048. The first attachment
member 1042 and the second attachment member 1046 may each be configured to be receive and

                                                  36
secure a hopper 1070 (shown, for example, in Figure 23) to the doser assembly 1040. The first
receiving portion 1043 may define an opening such that a material, such as coffee beans, can be
transferred from a hopper to the first doser chamber 1044. The second receiving portion 1047
may also define an opening such that a material, such as coffee beans, can be transferred from a
hopper to the second doser chamber 1048. The first doser chamber 1044 and the second doser
chamber 1048 are configured to provide a desired amount of material, such as coffee beans, from
the doser assembly 1040 to grinder components of the brew module 1050 for grinding the
material.
[00147]      In some embodiments, the doser assembly 1040 is configured to provide volumetric
dosing of a material instead of, or in addition to, timed dosing. Volumetric dosing refers to
providing a desired amount of material based on the volume of the material. For example, a
desired amount of coffee for a single-cup portion may be determined by providing a desired
volume of coffee beans. Volumetric dosing may be provided by detecting the weight of the
material and configuring the doser assembly 1040 to receive a quantity of material that is
substantially equivalent to a desired weight. In some embodiments, the doser assembly 1040 is
configured to receive a desired volume of coffee beans from one or more hoppers 1070.
Volumetric dosing may also be provided by configuring the first doser portion 1041 so that its
interior volume is limited and substantially matches a desired volume of material. The second
doser portion 1045 can also be configured to have a limited interior volume. In some
embodiments, volumetric dosing may provide more accurate and repeatable dosing than other
methods of dosing of a material, such as, for example, timed dosing. Embodiments of a
volumetric doser are discussed in more detail below with references to Figures 43-45.
[00148]      Figures 30-33 illustrate an embodiment of a brew module 1050 with its outer cover
removed so that internal components may be seen. With reference to Figures 30 and 31, the
brew module 1050 comprises an interior subassembly 1100, an upper subassembly 1200, and a
wiper assembly 1300. The upper subassembly 1200 is configured to receive coffee grounds from
a hopper 1070 (shown, for example, in Figure 23) and deliver the grounds to the interior
subassembly 1100 for brewing, for example, a single-cup portion of coffee. The wiper assembly
1300 is configured to interact with the interior subassembly 1100 and the upper subassembly

                                                  37
1200 to clean components of the brew module 1050. For example, the wiper assembly 1300 may
automatically clean components of the interior subassembly 1100 between brewing cycles. In
some embodiments, the wiper assembly 1300 is substantially similar in structure, function, and
operation to the wiper assembly 700 illustrated and described above with respect to Figures 16
19. The upper subassembly 1200 may include, among other components, a brewing chamber
1210 and one or more hoses 1220 (shown, for example, in Figure 31). In some embodiments, the
brewing chamber 1210 is slidable and removable from the beverage brewing machine 1010. The
components described above and below are further illustrated in Figures 32 and 33. For
example, Figures 32 and 33 show left side and right side views, respectively, of the brew module
1050.
[00149]     Continuing with reference to Figures 30-33, the brew module 1050 may include, for
example, a piston 1110, a piston chamber 1112, a boiler element 1120, and a waste chute 1130.
The piston 1110 and the piston chamber 1112 may be configured to interact with the upper
subassembly 1200 to brew a beverage. The boiler element 1120 is configured to heat water used
in the brew module 1050 to brew a beverage. The waste chute 1130 is configured to deliver
waste from the upper subassembly 1200 and the wiper assembly 1300 to a waste bin 1080
(shown, for example, in Figure 23). In some embodiments, the brew module 1050 comprises an
inner vent feature that interacts with the outer vent feature of the brewing machine 1010 to
permit steam generated during a brew cycle to vent from the brewing machine 1010 and into the
surrounding environment. Other embodiments of the brew module 1050 may comprise different
configurations and components.
[00150]     With reference to Figure 30, the brew module 1050 may be configured so that rinse
water from the automatic cleaning system may exit the brew module 1050 along a separate path
from the path used to move brewed beverage from a brew chamber 1210 to the dispensing
portion 1030. For example, a separate hose may be used for rinse water, which may be referred
to as purged water, for the brew module 1050. In Figure 30, the separate hose is shown near a
front portion of the brew module 1050 and extending out from a lower left side of the brew
module 1050. Some current systems use the same path for rinse water and the brewed beverage.
However, separating the paths for the rinse water and the brewed beverage, as contemplated

                                                   38
herein in some embodiments, substantially reduces the likelihood that the brewed beverage will
be exposed to rinse water when dispensed from the brew module 1050. This can help to improve
to the overall quality and taste of the brewed beverage.
[00151]       Figures 34A and 34B illustrate an embodiment of a hopper 1070 that is configured to
be used with the beverage brewing machine 1010 described herein. The hopper 1070 may
comprise a container or canister that stores material, such as coffee beans, and is configured to
interact with and/or attach to the beverage brewing machine 1010. For example, in some
applications, a user may have several hoppers 1070 on hand each of which stores a particular
type of material, such as a particular type of coffee beans. Some of the hoppers 1070 may be
attached to the beverage brewing machine 1070, while other hoppers 1070 may be stored in a
nearby location such that a user can exchange hoppers when a particular type of coffee is desired.
Such an arrangement is particularly advantageous in a coffee shop setting. For example, when a
user orders a particular type of coffee, a barista may select an appropriate pre-filled hopper from
a nearby location, such as a shelf or cabinet, and engage the hopper with the beverage brewing
machine to automatically brew a single-cup portion of coffee. If a user orders a type of coffee
that is in a hopper already engaged with the beverage brewing machine, then a brew cycle may be
initiated without the need to attach the hopper to the beverage brewing machine. The
combination of a brewing system 1000 having one or more brew groups 1050 each with one or
more hoppers 1070 and the ability to easily replace one hopper with another hopper enables the
brewing system 1000 to efficiently, quickly, and automatically brew a wide variety of single-cup
portions or traveller portions of a beverage with minimal involvement of a user.
[00152]       The hopper 1070 may comprise a base portion 1072 and a container portion 1092. In
some embodiments, the base portion 1072 includes a slide portion 1073 having an outer
perimeter 1074. The base portion 1072 also includes a slide rail 1076 that is disposed between
the slide portion 1073 and the container portion 1092 of the hopper 1070. In the illustrated
embodiment of Figure 34B, the slide portion 1073 and the slide rail 1076 define an opening
1075. The opening 1075 allows material to transfer from the hopper 1070 to the doser assembly
1040 (which is shown, for example, in Figure 29) of the beverage brewing machine 1010. The
slide portion 1073 is configured to translate with respect to the slide rail 1076 to open the

                                                  39
opening 1075 to release material from the hopper 1070 and to close the opening 1075 to contain
material in the hopper 1070. The base portion 1072 of the hopper 1070 may also include a
release mechanism 1077 that is configured to interact with the beverage brewing machine 1010
to release and/or secure the slide portion 1073. In some embodiments, the outer perimeter 1074
of the slide portion 1073 comprises a substantially oval shaped handle that enables a user to
easily open and close the hopper 1070. The slide portion 1073 may comprise other shapes and
configurations, such as, for example, substantially rectangular and substantially circular
configurations.
[00153]      The container portion 1092 may comprise an elongated tube portion 1093 having a
first end 1094 and a second end 1095. In the illustrated embodiment of Figures 34A and 34B,
the first end 1094 is disposed near a front portion of the beverage brewing machine 1010 when
the hopper 1070 is attached to the doser assembly 1040 and the second end 1095 is disposed near
a rear portion of the brewing machine 1010. In some embodiments, the tube portion 1093
comprises a substantially cylindrical configuration. In other embodiments, the container portion
1092 may comprise other shapes and configurations. The tube portion 1093 may be comprised
of a transparent material such that a user can easily see material stored in the hopper 1070.
However, in other embodiments, may include hoppers 1070 of different shapes and
configurations and/or may not be transparent.
[00154]      The first end 1094 and the second end 1095 can comprise a first cap and a second
cap, respectively. One or both of the first end 1094 and the second end 1095 may be configured
to be removable. In some embodiments, the first end 1094 includes one or more securing
features 1096 to attach the first end 1094 to the tube portion 1093 of the hopper 1070. Similarly,
the second end 1095 may include one or more securing features 1097 to attach the second end
1095 to the tube portion 1093 of the hopper 1070. In the illustrated embodiment, the one or
more securing features 1096, 1097 of the first end 1094 and the second end 1095 each comprise
a plurality of pin and slot configurations. The slot may define a substantially L-shaped slot. In
some embodiments, other securing mechanisms may be employed.

                                                      40
[00155]      The hopper 1070 may include a detection system that is configured, for example, to
detect the amount of material in the hopper 1070. The detection system may comprise a photo
detection system with one detector device on the hopper 1070 and another detector device
disposed outside of the hopper 1070. The detector device on the hopper 1070 can detect, for
example, the amount of light in the hopper and make a relative comparison to the amount of light
outside of the hopper. This could provide data regarding the amount of material remaining in the
hopper and provide a signal when the material falls below a certain threshold. Such a signal may
indicate that it is desirable for a user to refill the hopper 1070 with material and/or replace the
hopper 1070. In some embodiments, the detection system may detect whether a particular
hopper 1070 is engaged with the beverage brewing machine 1010. In such embodiments, the
detection system may include components of the doser assembly 1040 and/or the hopper 1070.
The detection system can include, for example, a Hall effect sensor.
[00156]      Figures 35A and 35B show an embodiment of the brewing chamber 1210 of the
beverage brewing machine 1010. The brewing chamber 1210 may be a component of the upper
subassembly 1200 of the beverage brewing machine 1010. In some embodiments, the chamber
1210 may be configured to resemble a cup-like configuration and/or a dome-like configuration.
The brewing chamber 1210 is configured to be disposed above a piston chamber 1112 (shown,
for example, in Figure 31) of the beverage brewing machine 1010 during a brew cycle to provide,
for example, a brewing area for the mixture of coffee grounds and water. In some embodiments,
the brewing chamber 1210 facilitates the brewing process by helping to improve agitation during
the brew cycle. The chamber 1210 may also be configured to be slidable and removable from the
beverage brewing machine 1010. The chamber 1210 can comprise a tool-less release mechanism
such that the chamber 1210 may move without the use of any additional components or tools.
The brewing chamber 1210 provides a substantially contained area where brewing occurs.
Accordingly, the brewing chamber 1210 advantageously contains waste and debris generated
during a brew cycle, such as coffee grinds, within the brewing chamber 1210. By containing
waste in the brewing chamber 1210, such waste may be easily discarded and it may be easier and
more efficient to clean the brew module 1050 between brew cycles because there will be less
waste on other components of the brew module 1050.

                                                 41
[00157]      The brewing chamber 1210 may comprise an outer surface 1232 that defines a first
opening 1234, a second opening 1238, and a third opening 1242. The first opening 1234 may be
configured to engage with a funnel of grinding components of the beverage brewing machine
1010 to receive freshly ground material, such as coffee grounds. The second opening 1238 may
be configured to engage with a nozzle of a hose to provide a fluid, such as water, to an inner
portion of the chamber 1210 during the brewing cycle. The third opening 1242 may comprise a
vent that allows air to exit the chamber 1210 during the brewing cycle. In some embodiments,
the outer surface 1232 comprises a first surface 1244 that defines the first opening 1234 and a
second surface 1236 that defines the second opening 1238. As illustrated in Figure 35A, the first
surface 1244 may be offset from the second surface 1236. The chamber 1210 can also include a
handle 1240 to facilitate sliding and removing the chamber 1210 from the beverage brewing
machine 1010. In some embodiments, the chamber 1210 may be removed from the brewing
machine 1010 after a brew cycle.
[00158]      During use of the beverage brewing machine 1010, ground material, such as coffee,
is delivered to the brewing chamber 1210 through the first opening 1234. Simultaneously, hot
water may be sprayed into the chamber 1210 through the second opening 1238. Agitation of the
coffee grounds may be improved by the directing a fan spray through the second opening 1238 at
an angle so that the spray may be directed throughout an inner portion of the chamber 1210. The
structure of the inner portion of the chamber 1210 may also improve agitation because grounds
may tend to generally spread out within the chamber 1210 to better receive the fan spray of
water. This structure of the chamber 1210 in combination with an angled fan spray helps to
improve agitation of coffee grounds during the brew cycle to avoid clumping of the grounds and
to provide brewed coffee with a more consistent and desirable flavour. The chamber 1210 is
configured to remain attached to the brew module 1050 during normal operation of the beverage
brewing machine 1010, including during an automatic cleaning cycle of the brew module 1050.
The brewing chamber 1210 may be removed, for example, at the end of the day by user to allow
a user to manually clean the chamber 1210. For example, at the end of the day (or at another
time when the brew module 1050 is not in use), a user may remove the brewing chamber 1210
and rinse and/or wash the brewing chamber 1210 with cleaning solution to further clean the

                                                42
brewing chamber 1210 and prepare the brewing chamber 1210 for use the next day (or for the
next cycle of uses). Without this removable feature of the brewing chamber 1210, it can be
difficult and cumbersome to clean components of a brew module 1050, such as interior
components in an upper subassembly of a brew module 1050, that collect waste and debris
during normal operation of the brew module 1050.
[00159]      In Figures 36-38, the brewing chamber 1210 is shown in the upper subassembly 1200
of the brew module 1050. Figures 36A and 37A illustrate the chamber 1210 in a first position
where the chamber 1210 is disposed generally above the piston chamber 1112. Figures 36B and
37B illustrate the chamber 1210 in a second position where the chamber is disposed near a rear
side of the brew module 1050 such as, for example, over an opening defined by a waste chute
1082. Figure 38 is shows the brew module 1050 with certain components removed to better
show the first opening 1234 and the second opening 1238 of the chamber 1210.
[00160]      In some embodiments, an automatic cleaning system comprises the chamber 1210, a
spray feature (such as, for example, one or more hoses 1220), and a waste nozzle (which is not
shown in the figures) disposed at or near a waste chute 1082 of the brew module 1050. The
chamber 1210 may have a plow feature configured to mechanically move coffee grounds and
debris to a waste bin 1080 (shown, for example, in Figure 23). In some embodiments, the spray
feature is configured to rinse the upper subassembly 1200 after a brew cycle. The waste nozzle
may be configured to rinse the chamber 1210, including, for example, an inner portion of the
chamber 1210. In some embodiments, the spray feature of the automatic cleaning system
comprises the same structure that provides a fan spray to the chamber 1210 during a brew cycle.
[00161]      The operation of embodiments of an automatic cleaning system will now be
described with references to Figures 36 and 37. The chamber 1210 begins in a first position near
a front portion of the brewing machine 1010. The chamber is shown in this position in Figures
36A and 37A. After the beverage brewing machine 1010 brews a single-cup portion of coffee,
the piston 1110 (show in Figure 37A) can raise to provide used coffee grounds to the upper
subassembly 1200. The coffee grounds can extend upward through an opening defined by the
piston chamber 1112. The cleaning system may be actuated such that, for example, belt

                                                   43
assemblies activate to move the chamber 1210 linearly toward a rear portion of the brewing
module 1050. As the chamber 1210 translates, the plow feature of the chamber 1210 collects
used coffee grounds and directs them toward the waste chute 1082, which leads to a waste bin
1080. The chamber 1210 continues to move toward the rear portion of the brew module 1050
until it reaches a second position. Figures 36B and 37B show the chamber 1210 disposed at or
near this second position.
[00162]      After the chamber 1210 has reached the second position, it will have mechanically
moved much of the used coffee grounds and unwanted materials from the piston and filter to the
waste bin 1080. The spray feature may activate such that a nozzle sprays a cleaning fluid, such
as water, toward surfaces of the upper subassembly 1200 to clean grounds and debris from the
upper subassembly 1200. While the chamber 1210 is disposed near or over the waste chute
1082, the waste nozzle may activate to direct a cleaning fluid, such as water, toward an inner
portion of the chamber 1210 to remove grounds and debris from the chamber 1210. The piston
1110 may also lower slightly before or during retraction of the chamber 1210 to avoid dirtying a
rear portion of the chamber 1210. In one embodiment, the piston 1110 lowers so that it is not
elevated above the opening defined by the piston chamber 1210. The chamber 1210 may then
linearly translate from the second position near the rear portion of the brew module 1050 to the
first position near the front portion of the brew module 1050. At this point, in some
embodiments, the cleaning cycle is approximately halfway complete. In some embodiments, the
spray feature is configured to activate such that a nozzle sprays a cleaning fluid, such as water,
toward a lower surface of the upper subassembly 1200 before the chamber has reached the
second position.
[00163]      Once the chamber 1210 reaches the first position again, the spray feature may
activate such that it directs a cleaning fluid, such as water, from a nozzle. This step is intended
to remove remaining debris from the upper subassembly 1200. For example, the spray feature
may serve as a pressure washer to sufficiently clean exposed surfaces of the upper subassembly
1200. In some embodiments, the spray feature may also activate during the previous step
described above where the plow mechanically clears the bulk of the used coffee grounds.

                                                   44
[00164]      After the spray feature activates, the chamber 1210 may once again move from the
first position to the second position. Such movement causes the plow feature of the chamber
1210 to push and direct remaining unwanted grounds, oils, and excess water toward the waste
bin. While in at or in the second position, the waste nozzle may again direct cleaning fluid
toward an inner portion of the chamber 1210 to further surfaces of the chamber 1210. In some
embodiments, the spray feature is also activated to further rinse and clean the piston 1110, piston
chamber 1112, and surrounding components of the upper subassembly 1200 disposed at or near a
front portion and/or central portion of the brew module 1050.
[00165]      Finally, the chamber 1210 moves from the second position near the rear portion of
the brew module 1050 back to its original position near the front portion of the brew module
1050. A two-step process involving mechanically removing the bulk of the grinds in one step
and then using the spray feature to clear remaining grounds in a second step has been found to be
advantageous in some applications because, among other reasons, such a process results in less
waste water than a single-step cleaning process employing only a spraying step. Other
embodiments of the automatic cleaning system may comprise different configurations and
components.
[00166]      With reference to Figures 37A and 37B, one problem encountered in some beverage
brewing machines relates to the waste chute. The waste chute tends to accumulate waste, such as
coffee grounds and other debris, and it can be difficult to clean the waste chute. For example, if
water is sprayed generally downward into the waste chute from above (such as, for example,
similar to a toilet bowl design), the machine may require a significant amount of water to clean
the surfaces of the waste chute and oftentimes accumulation and built-up debris remains in the
chute. It has been found that such issues can be addressed by altering the geometry of the waste
chute and by dispensing water on a surface of the waste chute shortly before grounds and waste
is dispensed into the chute.
[00167]      For example, the waste chute 1082 may be configured to have a relatively shallow
exit angle and a spray head that is substantially parallel with a surface of the waste chute 1082.
A bottom of the waste chute 1082 may be configured to exit a side of the brew module 1050

                                                   45
instead of, for example, being configured to dispense waste vertically in a waste bin below
generally below the chute. The water may be activated to spray a surface of the waste chute 1082
shortly before grounds and other waste is provided to the chute 1082. This can result in a plane
of water that substantially covers a surface of the waste chute 1082 from a shearing direction,
which can create a shear force that helps to carry waste down the chute 1082. Additionally, by
providing the chute 1082 with water shortly before waste is provided, a smooth plane of water is
provided that acts as a protective barrier and is configured to move waste down the chute 1082.
This may reduce the likelihood that waste will accumulate on surfaces of the chute 1082. Such a
configuration may also allow a relatively small amount of water to effectively clean the waste
chute 1082, thereby resulting in a more efficient cleaning system and cost savings to a user. In
some embodiments, a low-mounted spray nozzle in combination with directing waste out a side
of the brew module 1050 provides some or all of the advantages of embodiments of the waste
chute 1082 described above.
[00168]      In some embodiments, the brewing chamber 1210 may be replaced with a cleaning
head to further assist with cleaning the brew module 1050. The cleaning head may include a
brush, bristles, a scrubber, and/or other cleaning mechanisms configured to wipe, scrub, and/or
clean surfaces of the upper subassembly of the brew module. For example, the cleaning head
may be employed by a user at the end of the day to clean and disinfect components of the brew
module. The user may remove the brewing chamber and replace it with a cleaning head
configured to be attached to the wiper assembly and translate back and forth along a surface of
the upper subassembly. The cleaning head may be used in conjunction with one or more nozzles
configured to spray interior components of the module, similar to that which is described above
with respect to embodiments of the automatic cleaning system. In some embodiments, the brew
module has one or more sensors configured to determine whether the brew chamber or whether
the cleaning head is engaged with the wiper assembly. Such a cleaning head would
advantageously aid, for example, in the daily maintenance and cleaning cycle of a brew module.
[00169]      Figures 39 and 40 illustrate partial cross-sectional views of the brew module 1050
where certain components have been removed to help show features of the upper subassembly
1200 of the brew module 1050. For example, those figures show that the one or more hoses

                                                 46
1220 may have a nozzle 1222 configured to deliver a fan spray of fluid to the chamber 1210.
The nozzle 1222 is configured to engage with the second opening 1238 of the chamber 1210 to
provide, for example, hot water to coffee grounds during the brewing process. In some
embodiments, the nozzle 1222 comprises one or more openings on a face 1224 of the nozzle
1222 configured to direct water to an interior of the chamber 1210.
[00170]     As shown in Figure 40, the face 1224 of the nozzle 1222 may be inclined with
respect to a horizontal plane of the brewing machine 1010. That is, a central axis of the nozzle
1222 may be titled to provide an angled spray in the chamber 1210. For example, in some
embodiments, the face 1224 of the nozzle 1222 defines an angle between about 0' and 900 with
respect to a horizontal plane. In some embodiments, the face 1224 of the nozzle 1222 defines an
angle between about 50 and 60' with respect to a horizontal plane. In some embodiments, the
face 1224 of the nozzle 1222 defines an angle between about 10' and 30' with respect to a
horizontal plane. In some embodiments, the face 1224 of the nozzle 1222 defines an angle
between about 15' and 20' with respect to a horizontal plane. Such an angled configuration of
the face 1224 of the nozzle 1222 may allow the nozzle 1224 to deliver a desirable fan spray to
the chamber 1210 such that the fan spray cover a larger area of the interior of the chamber 1210
and improves the agitation process during a brewing cycle. The fan spray may also be directed
toward one or more inner sidewalls of the chamber 1210 to further agitate and spin the ground
material during a brewing cycle. As discussed above, improved agitation of ground material,
such as ground coffee, during the brewing process may speed up the brew cycle time and provide
a brewed beverage with a more consistent and desirable flavour.
[00171]      Figures 41 and 42 are additional views of a brew module where certain components
have been removed to show interior components of the brew module. For example, Figure 41
shows an embodiment of the brew module 1050, the doser assembly 1040, and a grinder
assembly 1090. The grinder assembly 1090 is disposed generally between the doser assembly
1040 and the brew module 1050. As described above, material may be provided to the doser
assembly 1040. The doser assembly 1040 is configured to provide a desired amount of material
to the grinder assembly 1090. The material is then ground in the grinder assembly 1090. The
ground material is then provided to the brew module 1050. The brew module 1050 is configured

                                                  47
to brew the material and dispense a desired amount of a beverage, such as a single-cup portion,
out of the dispensing portion of the brew module 1050.
[00172]      Figure 42 is a cross-sectional view that further shows interior components of an
embodiment of the brew module 1050, the doser assembly 1040, the grinder assembly 1090, and
the dispensing portion 1030. Figure 42 generally shows that, in some embodiments, the flow
path for delivering brewed beverage from the brew chamber to the dispensing portion and
ultimately to a container, such as a mug, may generally define a downward slope substantially
along the entire flow path. For example, the flow path is generally flow in a downhill direction,
even around and about difficult geometrical constraints of the brew module, so that gravity
assists in dispensing the brewed beverage. Such a downward configuration helps to create
gravity-assisted flow and results in dispensing a steady stream of brewed beverage followed by,
in some embodiments, a single drop of any final remaining brewed beverage. This can avoid a
dispensing system where a lingering trickle of beverage is dispensed followed by several drops of
beverage. As a result, a much more efficient fluid-dispensing process may be provided. In
addition, in some embodiments, the spout of the dispensing portion 1030 may include two
separate fluid flow paths disposed on either side of a shaft of the spout. As illustrated in Figure
42, the fluid flow paths in the spout may also be in a generally downward direction.
[00173]      Figures 43-45 illustrate embodiments of a doser assembly 1040 having a volumetric
doser 1300. The volumetric doser may be configured to provide a precise amount of material,
such as coffee beans, to a grinder based on a defined, open interior volume of the doser. The
interior volume of the doser is adjustable such that the interior volume may change depending
on, for example, the amount of brewed material that is desired and/or the strength of the brewed
material. For example, if a customer orders a particular size and type of coffee, the volumetric
doser is configured to adjust the interior volume of the doser to an appropriate volume. The
doser may adjust the interior volume automatically and seamlessly when, for example, a
customer orders a cup of coffee. The volumetric doser is particularly advantageous in providing
only a precise amount of material such that extra material and waste is thereby reduced. Some
existing systems lack the ability to precisely control the volume of material provided to a
beverage brewing machine. As a result, excess material is often brewed and additional,

                                                  48
unnecessary waste is created. Accordingly, the volumetric doser may provide a cost savings to a
user by avoiding waste and providing no more than a necessary amount of material to a grinder
and brew module during a brew cycle.
[00174]       Embodiments of the volumetric doser may comprise a first opening and a second
opening. The first opening is configured to receive material from a hopper of the beverage
brewing system, while the second opening is configured to dispense material to a funnel that
leads to a grinder. The first opening and the second opening may be offset from each other so
that material can be contained in the doser. In some embodiments, the volumetric doser
comprises a first piston and a second piston. The first piston and second piston define an open
interior volume that is configured to receive material, such as coffee beans. The first piston and
the second piston are configured to move with respect to a frame of the volumetric doser. The
first piston is also configured to move respect to the second piston. Additionally, the second
piston may be configured to move with respect to the first piston. The ability of the first position
and second piston to move with respect to the frame of the doser and with respect to each other
allows the first and second pistons to shuttle back and forth between the first opening and the
second opening. That is, the first and second pistons may be initially configured such that the
open interior volume of the doser is disposed generally below the first opening. In this position,
the doser is configured to receive material from the hopper and contain the material between the
first and second pistons. The first and second pistons are then configured to move the contained
material along an inner portion of the doser toward the second opening. When the material
reaches the second opening, the material may then exit the doser and travel through the funnel to
the grinder for grinding the material.
[00175]       With reference to Figures 43A and 43B, an embodiment of a doser assembly 1040 is
shown having a first doser portion 1041 and a second doser portion 1045. The first doser portion
1041 may comprise a first doser chamber 1044 containing pistons that define an adjustable, inner
volume. The first doser portion 1041 also includes a first receiving portion 1043 configured to
receive material, such as coffee beans, through an opening. Similarly, the second doser portion
1041 may include a second doser chamber 1048 and a second receiving portion 1047. The
illustrated doser assembly 1400 also includes a mounting portion 1390 defining a funnel opening

                                                   49
1392. The mounting portion 1390 is configured to attach to a grinder assembly and the funnel
opening 1392 facilitates delivering material from the first doser portion 1041 and the second
doser portion 1045 to a grinder.
[00176]       Figures 44-45 show an embodiment of a volumetric doser 1300. In some
embodiments, first doser portion 1041 and the second doser portion 1045 of Figures 43A and
43B are essentially the same as the volumetric doser 1300 illustrated in Figures 44 and 45. With
reference to Figures 44A and 44B, the volumetric doser 1300 may comprise an outer body 1310
that defines a first opening 1312 for receiving material and a second opening 1316 for delivering
material to a grinder. The volumetric doser 1300 may also include a cap 1320 at one end of the
doser 1300 and a motor 1330 near an opposite end of the doser 1300. In some embodiments, the
cap 1320 is disposed at or near a front portion of the doser 1300 and the motor 1330 is disposed
at or near a rear portion of the doser 1300. The motor 1330 is in communication with a gear
1332. The gear 1332 may be in communication with a shaft 1334 and a lead screw 1336 (the
shaft 1334 and lead screw 1336 are shown in Figures 45B and 45C). The motor 1330, gear 1332,
shaft 1334, and/or lead screw 1336 are configured to adjust at least one piston disposed on an
inner portion of the doser 1300. The doser 1300 may also include a ratchet mechanism 1314 that
is configured to adjust at least one piston of the doser 1300.
[00177]       In Figures 45A-45C, certain components of the volumetric doser 1300 have been
removed, such as an outer cover, to better show inner components of the doser 1300. The doser
1300 may include a first piston 1340 and a second piston 1342. The first piston 1340 and the
second piston 1342 are configured to define an open interior volume 1344 disposed generally
between the first piston 1340 and the second piston 1342. In some embodiments, the second
piston 1342 is in communication with the motor 1330 via the gear 1332, the shaft 1334, and the
lead screw 1336 such that the motor can cause the second piston 1342 to move. In some
embodiments, the motor 1330 is configured to cause both the first piston 1340 and the second
piston 1342 to move together. In other embodiments, the motor 1330 is configured to cause the
second position 1342 to move independent from the first piston 1340 to adjust the size of the
interior volume 1344. In some embodiments, the ratchet mechanism 1340 is configured to cause
the first piston 1340 to move relative to the second piston 1342 to adjust the size of the interior

                                                 50
volume 1344. In some embodiments, a control system is configured to automatically adjust the
size of the interior volume 1344.
[00178]      Figures 46-49 illustrate embodiments of a fan system configured to deliver airflow
near an outlet of the grinder. The fan system may deliver a constant flow of air through an exit
port of the grinder and through a grounds chute toward a brewing chamber of the brew module.
Continuous airflow from the fan creates a positive pressure in the exit port of the grinder during
operation of the brewing machine. In some embodiments, an air inlet is provided in an exit port
of the grinder near burrs of the grinder. During operation, the fan system may provide several
advantages to the beverage brewing system such as, for example, preventing steam from rising
and entering the grinder assembly, ensuring that substantially all fresh grounds are transferred
from the grinder assembly to the brew module, and reducing the likelihood that grounds of
material (such as coffee grounds) will stick to surfaces at or near an exit port of the grinder.
[00179]      In some embodiments, the brewing machine 1010 and/or one more brew modules
1050 is grounded. Grounding the brewing machine 1010, or components of the brewing
machine 1010, can help to reduce or substantially eliminate static electricity. Electrostatic
charges can cause ground material, such as coffee grinds, to collect and stick to surfaces of
components of the brewing machine 1010. Accordingly, grounding the brewing machine 1010
can further reduce or substantially eliminate electrostatic build-up of ground material on internal
components of the brewing machine 1010.
[00180]      With reference to Figure 46, a grinder 1400 is shown having an elongated portion
1402 that defines an opening 1404. The opening 1404 is configured to receive ground material
from mounting portion 1390 of the doser assembly 1040 (shown, for example, in Figures 43A
and 43B). The grinder 1400 is in communication with an exit port 1430 disposed generally
below the grinder 1400. The exit port 1430 may be connected to a grounds chute 1440, which
leads to a brewing chamber 1210 (shown, for example, in Figures 35A, 35B, and 38). The exit
port 1430 may also be attached to a base plate 1422 that supports a fan 1420. In the illustrated
embodiment, the fan 1420 is disposed adjacent the exit port 1430. The fan 1420 is configured to
deliver airflow to the exit port 1430 and the grounds chute 1440.

                                                  51
[00181]      Figures 47-49 illustrate additional views where certain components have been
removed to better show certain features. For example, Figures 47A and 47B show additional
views where the grinder 1400 has been removed. Figure 47A shows that the exit port 1430 may
define a first opening 1432 that leads to the grounds chute 1440, while Figure 47B shows that the
exit port 1430 may define a second opening 1434 that enables the fan 1420 to provide airflow to
the exit port 1430. Figures 48A and 48B show additional views where the grinder 1400 and the
fan 1420 have been removed. For instance, Figure 48A shows the first opening 1432 and the
second opening 1434 of the exit port 1430. In Figure 48B, it can be seen that the grounds chute
1440 may define a distal opening 1444 that is configured to provide ground material to a brewing
chamber 1210. Figure 49 shows an additional view where the grinder 1400 and the exit port
1430 have been removed. That figure illustrates that the fan 1420 may define an opening 1424
configured to allow air to flow from the fan 1420 to the exit port 1430. Air may then flow
through the exit port 1430 through a proximal opening 1442 defined by the grounds chute 1440.
[00182]      Although some embodiments have been discussed above in terms of apparatus,
systems, and methods for brewing a coffee beverage using coffee beans, the disclosed
embodiments may also be employed to brew other types of materials that are mixed with a fluid
to form a beverage. Furthermore, the disclosed apparatus, systems, and methods may be used or
employed in a commercial setting, such as at a coffeehouse or coffee shop, or in a residential
