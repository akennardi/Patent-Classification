                     ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
 5      A flow conveyed plugging device for use in a well, the
   device can include a body, and one or more lines extending
   outwardly from the body, each of the lines having a lateral
   dimension that is  substantially smaller than a size of the
   body. A method of plugging an opening in a well can include
10 deploying at least one flow conveyed plugging device into
   the well, the flow conveyed plugging device including a body
   and, extending outwardly from the body, at least one of the
   group consisting of:  a) one or more fibers  and b) one or
   more lines, the flow conveyed plugging device being conveyed
15 by flow in the well into sealing engagement with the
   opening. Another flow conveyed plugging device can include a
   body, and fibers extending outwardly from the body. The flow
   conveyed plugging device degrades and thereby permits flow
   through an opening in the well.

                             BACKGROUND
25      This disclosure relates generally to equipment utilized
   and operations performed in conjunction with a subterranean
   well and, in one example described below, more particularly
   provides for flow control in wells.

                                - 2
        It can be beneficial to be able to control how and
   where fluid flows in a well. For example,  it may be
   desirable in some circumstances to be able to prevent fluid
   from flowing into a particular formation  zone. As another
 5 example, it may be desirable in some circumstances to cause
   fluid to flow into a particular  formation zone, instead of
   into another formation zone. Therefore, it will be readily
   appreciated that  improvements are continually needed in the
   art of controlling fluid flow in wells.

15                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        Representatively illustrated in FIG.  1 is a system 10
   for use with a well, and an associated method, which can
   embody principles of this disclosure. However, it should be
   clearly understood that the system 10  and method are merely
20 one example of an application of the principles of this
   disclosure in practice, and a wide variety of other examples
   are possible. Therefore, the scope of this disclosure is not
   limited at all to the details of the system 10 and method
   described herein and/or depicted in the drawings.
25      In the FIG. 1 example, a tubular string 12  is conveyed
   into a wellbore 14 lined with casing 16 and cement 18.
   Although multiple casing strings would typically be used in
   actual practice, for clarity of illustration only one casing
   string 16 is depicted in the drawings.

        Although the wellbore 14 is   illustrated as being
   vertical,  sections of the wellbore could instead be
   horizontal or otherwise inclined relative to vertical.
   Although the wellbore 14 is  completely cased and cemented as
 5 depicted in FIG.  1, any sections of the wellbore in which
   operations described in more detail below are performed
   could be uncased or open hole. Thus, the scope of this
   disclosure is  not limited to any particular details of the
   system 10 and method.
10      The tubular string 12 of FIG. 1 comprises coiled tubing
   20 and a bottom hole assembly 22.   As used herein, the term
   "coiled tubing" refers to a substantially continuous    tubing
   that is stored on a spool or reel 24.   The reel 24 could be
   mounted, for example, on a skid, a trailer, a floating
15 vessel, a vehicle, etc.,  for transport to a wellsite.
   Although not shown in FIG.  1, a control room or cab would
   typically be provided with instrumentation, computers,
   controllers, recorders, etc.,  for controlling equipment such
   as an injector 26 and a blowout preventer stack 28.
20      As used herein, the term "bottom hole assembly" refers
   to an assembly connected at a distal end of a tubular string
   in a well.  It is not necessary for a bottom hole assembly to
   be positioned or used at a "bottom" of a hole or well.
        When the tubular string 12   is positioned in the
25 wellbore 14,  an annulus 30 is formed radially between them.
   Fluid, slurries, etc.,  can be flowed from surface into the
   annulus 30 via, for example, a casing valve 32.   One or more
   pumps 34 may be used for this purpose. Fluid can also be
   flowed to surface from the wellbore 14 via the annulus 30
30 and valve 32.

                               - 5
        Fluid, slurries, etc.,  can also be flowed from surface
   into the wellbore 14 via the tubing 20,  for example, using
   one or more pumps 36. Fluid can also be flowed to surface
   from the wellbore 14 via the tubing 20.
 5      In the further description below of the examples of
   FIGS. 2A-9, one or more flow conveyed devices are used to
   block or plug openings in the system 10 of FIG. 1. However,
   it should be clearly understood that these methods and the
   flow conveyed device may be used with other systems,  and the
10 flow conveyed device may be used in other methods in keeping
   with the principles of this disclosure.
        The example methods described below allow existing
   fluid passageways to be blocked permanently or temporarily
   in a variety of different applications. Certain flow
15 conveyed device examples described below are made of a
   fibrous material and comprise a central body, a "knot"   or
   other enlarged geometry. Other flow control device examples
   may not be made of a fibrous material, may not have a
   centrally positioned body, and/or may not comprise a knot.
20      The devices are conveyed into leak paths using pumped
   fluid. Fibrous material extending outwardly from a body of a
   device can "find" and follow the fluid flow, pulling the
   enlarged geometry into a restricted portion of a flow path,
   causing the enlarged geometry and additional strands  to
25 become tightly wedged into the flow path thereby sealing off
   fluid communication.
        The devices can be made of degradable or non-degradable
   materials. The degradable materials can be either self
   degrading, or can require degrading treatments,  such as, by
30 exposing the materials to certain acids, certain base
   compositions, certain chemicals,  certain types of radiation

                                  -  6
    (e.g., electromagnetic or "nuclear"),     or elevated
   temperature. The exposure can be performed at a desired time
   using a form of well intervention, such as, by spotting or
   circulating a fluid in the well so that the material is
 5 exposed to the fluid.
         In some examples,   the material can be an acid
   degradable material    (e.g., nylon, etc.),   a mix of acid
   degradable material    (for example, nylon fibers mixed with
   particulate   such as calcium carbonate),    self-degrading
10 material   (e.g., poly-lactic acid   (PLA),  poly-glycolic acid
    (PGA), etc.),  material that degrades by galvanic action
    (such as, magnesium alloys,    aluminum alloys,   etc.),  a
   combination of different self-degrading materials, or a
   combination of self-degrading and non-self-degrading
15 materials.
         Multiple materials can be pumped together or
   separately. For example, nylon and calcium carbonate could
   be pumped as a mixture, or the nylon could be pumped first
   to initiate a seal,   followed by calcium carbonate to enhance
20 the seal.
         In certain examples described below, the device can be
   made of knotted fibrous materials. Multiple knots can be
   used with any number of loose ends. The ends can be frayed
   or un-frayed. The fibrous material can be rope,       fabric,
25 cloth or another woven or braided structure.
         The device can be used to block open sleeve valves,
   perforations   or any leak paths in a well     (such as,  leaking
   connections in casing, corrosion holes, etc.).       An opening in
   a well tool, whether formed intentionally or inadvertently,
30 can be blocked using the device. Any opening through which

   fluid flows can be blocked with a suitably configured
   device.
         In one example method described below, a well with an
   existing perforated zone can be re-completed. Devices
 5  (either degradable or non-degradable) are conveyed by flow
   to plug all existing perforations.
         The well can then be re-completed using any desired
   completion technique.   If the devices are degradable, a
   degrading treatment can then be placed in the well to open
10 up the plugged perforations    (if desired).
         In another example method described below, multiple
   formation zones can be perforated and fractured      (or
   otherwise stimulated, such as, by acidizing) in a single
   trip of the bottom hole assembly 22 into the well.       In the
15 method, one zone is perforated, the    zone is  fractured or
   otherwise stimulated, and then the perforated zone is
   plugged using one or more devices.
         These steps are repeated for each additional zone,
   except that a last zone may not be plugged. All of the
20 plugged zones are eventually unplugged by waiting a certain
   period of time   (if the devices are self-degrading),     by
   applying an appropriate degrading treatment, or by
   mechanically removing the devices.
         Referring specifically now to FIGS. 2A-D, steps in an
25 example of a method in which the bottom hole assembly 22 of
   FIG. 1 can be used in re-completing a well are
   representatively illustrated. In this method      (see FIG. 2A),
   the well has existing perforations 38    that provide for fluid
   communication between an earth formation     zone 40  and an
30 interior of the casing 16.   However, it is desired to re-

                                - 8
   complete the zone 40,  in order to enhance the fluid
   communication.
         Referring additionally now to FIG. 2B, the perforations
   38  are plugged, thereby preventing flow through the
 5 perforations  into the zone 40.  Plugs 42 in the perforations
   can be flow conveyed devices, as described more fully below.
   In that case, the plugs 42 can be conveyed through the
   casing 16 and into engagement with the perforations    38 by
   fluid flow 44.
10       Referring additionally now to FIG. 2C, new perforations
   46 are formed through the casing 16 and cement 18 by use of
   an abrasive jet perforator  48.  In this example, the bottom
   hole assembly 22  includes the perforator 48  and a
   circulating valve assembly 50. Although the new perforations
15 46 are depicted as being formed above the existing
   perforations  38, the new perforations  could be formed in any
   location in keeping with the principles of this disclosure.
         Note that other means of providing perforations   46 may
   be used in other examples. Explosive perforators, drills,
20 etc.,  may be used if desired. The scope of this disclosure
   is not  limited to any particular perforating means, or to
   use with perforating at all.
         The circulating valve assembly 50  controls flow between
   the coiled tubing 20 and the perforator 48,   and controls
25 flow between the annulus 30   and an interior of the tubular
   string 12.  Instead of conveying the plugs  42 into the well
   via flow 44 through the interior of the casing 16    (see FIG.
   2B),  in other examples the plugs could be deployed into the
   tubular string 12  and conveyed by fluid flow 52  through the
30 tubular string prior to the perforating operation. In that
   case, a valve 54 of the circulating valve assembly 50    could

                                  -  9
   be opened to allow the plugs 42 to exit the tubular string
   12 and flow into the interior of the casing 16 external to
   the tubular string.
        Referring additionally now to FIG. 2D, the zone 40 has
 5 been fractured or otherwise stimulated by applying increased
   pressure to the   zone after the perforating operation.
   Enhanced fluid communication is now permitted between the
   zone 40 and the interior of the casing 16.
        Note that fracturing is     not necessary in keeping with
10 the principles of this disclosure. Although certain examples
   described herein utilize fracturing, it should be understood
   that other types of stimulation operations      (such as
   acidizing) may be performed instead of, or in addition to,
   fracturing.
15      In the FIG. 2D example, the plugs 42 prevent the
   pressure applied to fracture the zone 40 via the
   perforations  46 from leaking into the zone via the
   perforations  38.  The plugs  42 may remain in the perforations
   38 and continue to prevent flow through the perforations, or
20 the plugs may degrade, if desired, so that flow is
   eventually permitted through the perforations.
        In other examples, fractures may be formed via the
   existing perforations   38,  and no new perforations may be
   formed. In one technique, pressure may be applied in the
25 casing 16  (e.g., using the pump 34),    thereby initially
   fracturing the zone 40 via some of the perforations      38 that
   receive most of the fluid flow 44.     After the initial
   fracturing of the zone 40,    and while the fluid is flowed
   through the casing 16,   plugs 42 can be released into the
30 casing, so that the plugs seal off those perforations      38
   that are receiving most of the fluid flow.

                               -  10
        In this way, the fluid 44 will be diverted to other
   perforations  38, so that the zone 40 will also be fractured
   via those other perforations   38. The plugs 42 can be
   released into the casing 16   continuously or periodically as
 5 the fracturing operation progresses,    so that the plugs
   gradually seal off all,  or most, of the perforations   38 as
   the zone 40  is fractured via the perforations. That is,   at
   each point in the fracturing operation, the plugs 42 will
   seal off those perforations   38 through which most of the
10 fluid flow 44 passes, which are the perforations via which
   the zone 40 has been fractured.
        Referring additionally now to FIGS. 3A-D,    steps in
   another example of a method in which the bottom hole
   assembly 22 of FIG. 1 can be used in completing multiple
15 zones 40a-c of a well are representatively illustrated. The
   multiple zones 40a-c are each perforated and fractured
   during a single trip of the tubular string 12 into the well.
        In FIG. 3A, the tubular string 12 has been deployed
   into the casing 16,  and has been positioned so that the
20 perforator 48  is at the first zone 40a to be completed. The
   perforator 48  is then used to form perforations   46a through
   the casing 16 and cement 18,   and into the zone 40a.
        In FIG. 3B, the  zone 40a has been fractured by applying
   increased pressure to the  zone via the perforations   46a. The
25 fracturing pressure may be applied, for example, via the
   annulus 30 from the surface   (e.g., using the pump 34  of FIG.
   1), or via the tubular string 12    (e.g., using the pump 36 of
   FIG. 1). The scope of this disclosure is not limited to any
   particular fracturing means or technique, or to the use of
30 fracturing at all.

                               -  11
        After fracturing of the zone 40a, the perforations 46a
   are plugged by deploying plugs 42a into the well and
   conveying them by fluid flow into sealing engagement with
   the perforations. The plugs 42a may be conveyed by flow 44
 5 through the casing 16  (e.g., as in FIG. 2B),   or by flow 52
   through the tubular string 12    (e.g., as in FIG. 2C).
        The tubular string 12  is repositioned in the casing 16,
   so that the perforator 48 is   now located at the next zone
   40b to be completed. The perforator 48    is then used to form
10 perforations 46b through the casing 16 and cement 18,     and
   into the zone 40b. The tubular string 12 may be repositioned
   before or after the plugs 42a are deployed into the well.
        In FIG. 3C, the  zone 40b has been fractured by applying
   increased pressure to the  zone via the perforations    46b. The
15 fracturing pressure may be applied, for example, via the
   annulus 30 from the surface   (e.g., using the pump 34   of FIG.
   1), or via the tubular string 12    (e.g., using the pump 36 of
   FIG. 1).
        After fracturing of the zone 40b, the perforations 46b
20 are plugged by deploying plugs 42b into the well and
   conveying them by fluid flow into sealing engagement with
   the perforations. The plugs 42b may be conveyed by flow 44
   through the casing 16,  or by flow 52 through the tubular
   string 12.
25      The tubular string 12  is repositioned in the casing 16,
   so that the perforator 48 is   now located at the next zone
   40c to be completed. The perforator 48    is then used to form
   perforations 46c through the casing 16 and cement 18,     and
   into the zone 40c. The tubular string 12 may be repositioned
30 before or after the plugs 42b are deployed into the well.

                                -  12
         In FIG. 3D, the  zone 40c has been fractured by applying
   increased pressure to the   zone via the perforations    46c. The
   fracturing pressure may be applied, for example, via the
   annulus 30 from the surface    (e.g., using the pump 34   of FIG.
 5 1),  or via the tubular string 12    (e.g., using the pump 36 of
   FIG. 1).
         In some examples,  the perforations 46c could be plugged
   after the zone 40c is   fractured or otherwise stimulated. For
   example, such plugging of the perforations     46c could be
10 performed in order to verify that the plugs are effectively
   blocking flow from the casing 16    to the zones 40a-c.
         The plugs 42a,b are then degraded and no longer prevent
   flow through the perforations 46a,b. Thus,     as depicted in
   FIG. 3D, flow is permitted between the interior of the
15 casing 16 and each of the   zones 40a-c.
         The plugs 42a,b may be degraded in any manner. The
   plugs 42a,b may degrade in response to application of a
   degrading treatment, in response to passage of a certain
   period of time, or in response to exposure to elevated
20 downhole temperature. The degrading treatment could include
   exposing the plugs 42a,b to a particular type of radiation,
   such as electromagnetic radiation     (e.g., light having a
   certain wavelength or range of wavelengths,     gamma rays,
   etc.)  or "nuclear" particles   (e.g.,  gamma, beta, alpha or
25 neutron).
         The plugs 42a,b may degrade by galvanic action or by
   dissolving. The plugs   42a,b may degrade in response to
   exposure to a particular fluid, either naturally occurring
   in the well   (such as water or hydrocarbon   fluid), or
30 introduced therein   (such as a fluid having a particular pH).

                               - 13
        Note that any number of zones may be completed in any
   order in keeping with the principles of this disclosure. The
   zones 40a-c may be sections of a single earth formation, or
   they may be sections of separate formations.
 5      In other examples, the plugs 42 may not be degraded.
   The plugs 42  could instead be mechanically removed, for
   example, by milling or otherwise cutting the plugs 42  away
   from the perforations, or by grabbing and pulling the plugs
   from the perforations. In any of the method examples
10 described above, after the fracturing or other stimulating
   operation(s) are completed, the plugs 42 can be milled off
   or otherwise removed from the perforations  38, 46, 46a,b
   without dissolving, melting, dispersing or otherwise
   degrading a material of the plugs.
15      Referring additionally now to FIG. 4A, an example of a
   flow conveyed device 60 that can incorporate the principles
   of this disclosure is representatively illustrated. The
   device 60 may be used for any of the plugs 42,  42a,b in the
   method examples described above, or the device may be used
20 in other methods.
        The device 60 example of FIG. 4A includes multiple
   fibers 62 extending outwardly from an enlarged body 64.   As
   depicted in FIG.  4A, each of the fibers 62 has a lateral
   dimension  (e.g., a thickness or diameter) that is
25 substantially smaller than a size  (e.g., a thickness or
   diameter) of the body 64.
        The body 64 can be dimensioned so that it will
   effectively engage and seal off a particular opening in a
   well. For example, if it is desired for the device 60 to
30 seal off a perforation in a well, the body 64 can be formed
   so that it is  somewhat larger than a diameter of the

                                 - 14
   perforation. If it is desired for multiple devices     60 to
   seal off multiple openings having a variety of dimensions
    (such as holes caused by corrosion of the casing 16),    then
   the bodies    64 of the devices can be formed with a
 5 corresponding variety of sizes.
         In the FIG.   4A example, the fibers 62 are joined
   together   (e.g., by braiding, weaving, cabling, etc.)   to form
   lines  66 that extend outwardly from the body 64.    In this
   example, there are two such lines 66,    but any number of
10 lines   (including one) may be used in other examples.
         The lines   66 may be in the form of one or more ropes,
   in which case the fibers    62 could comprise frayed ends of
   the rope (s).   In addition, the body 64 could be formed by one
   or more knots in the rope (s).   In some examples, the body 64
15 can comprise a fabric or cloth, the body could be formed by
   one or more knots in the fabric or cloth, and the fibers     62
   could extend from the fabric or cloth.
         In the FIG.   4A example, the body 64 is formed by a
   double overhand knot in a rope, and ends of the rope are
20 frayed, so that the fibers    62 are splayed outward. In this
   manner, the fibers 62 will cause significant fluid drag when
   the device 60 is deployed into a flow stream, so that the
   device will be effectively "carried" by, and "follow,"     the
   flow.
25       However, it should be clearly understood that other
   types of bodies and other types of fibers may be used in
   other examples. The body 64 could have other shapes,     the
   body could be hollow or solid, and the body could be made up
   of one or multiple materials. The fibers    62 are not
30 necessarily joined by lines 66,    and the fibers are not
   necessarily formed by fraying ends of ropes or other lines.

                                 -  15
   Thus, the scope of this disclosure is not      limited to the
   construction, configuration or other details of the device
   60 as described herein or depicted in the drawings.
         Referring additionally now to FIG. 4B,      another example
 5 of the device 60  is representatively illustrated. In this
   example, the device   60 is formed using multiple braided
   lines  66 of the type known as "mason twine."      The multiple
   lines  66 are knotted   (such as, with a double or triple
   overhand knot or other type of knot) to form the body 64.
10 Ends of the lines 66 are not necessarily frayed in these
   examples, although the lines do comprise fibers        (such as the
   fibers  62 described above).
         Referring additionally now to FIG. 5,     another example
   of the device 60  is representatively illustrated. In this
15 example, four sets of the fibers     62 are joined by a
   corresponding number of lines     66 to the body 64.    The body 64
   is formed by one or more knots in the lines 66.
         FIG. 5 demonstrates that a variety of different
   configurations are possible for the device 60.       Accordingly,
20 the principles of this disclosure can be incorporated into
   other configurations not specifically described herein or
   depicted in the drawings. Such other configurations may
   include fibers joined to bodies without use of lines, bodies
   formed by techniques other than knotting, etc.
25       Referring additionally now to FIGS.     6A & B,   an example
   of a use of the device 60 of FIG. 4 to seal off an opening
   68 in a well is representatively illustrated. In this
   example, the opening 68 is a perforation formed through a
   sidewall 70 of a tubular string 72      (such as,  a casing,
30 liner, tubing, etc.).    However, in other examples the opening

                                - 16
   68 could be another type of opening, and may be formed in
   another type of structure.
         The device 60 is deployed into the tubular string 72
   and is conveyed through the tubular string by fluid flow 74.
 5 The fibers  62 of the device 60 enhance fluid drag on the
   device, so that the device is influenced to displace with
   the flow 74.
         Since the flow 74  (or a portion thereof) exits the
   tubular string 72 via the opening 68,   the device 60 will be
10 influenced by the fluid drag to also exit the tubular string
   via the opening 68.  As depicted in FIG.  6B, one set of the
   fibers  62 first enters the opening 68,  and the body 64
   follows.  However, the body 64 is  appropriately dimensioned,
   so that it does not pass through the opening 68,    but instead
15 is  lodged or wedged into the opening. In some examples, the
   body 64 may be received only partially in the opening 68,
   and in other examples the body may be entirely received in
   the opening.
         The body 64 may completely or only partially block the
20 flow 74  through the opening 68.  If the body 64 only
   partially blocks the flow 74,   any remaining fibers   62
   exposed to the flow in the tubular string 72 can be carried
   by that flow into any gaps between the body and the opening
   68,  so that a combination of the body and the fibers
25 completely blocks  flow through the opening.
         In another example, the device 60 may partially block
   flow through the opening 68,   and another material   (such as,
   calcium carbonate, PLA or PGA particles) may be deployed and
   conveyed by the flow 74   into any gaps between the device and
30 the opening, so that a combination of the device and the
   material completely blocks   flow through the opening.

                                -  17
        The device 60 may permanently prevent flow through the
   opening 68,  or the device may degrade to eventually permit
   flow through the opening. If the device    60 degrades,  it may
   be self-degrading, or it may be degraded in response to any
 5 of a variety of different stimuli. Any technique or means
   for degrading the device  60   (and any other material used in
   conjunction with the device to block flow through the
   opening 68)  may be used in keeping with the scope of this
   disclosure.
10      In other examples, the device    60 may be mechanically
   removed from the opening 68.    For example, if the body 64
   only partially enters the opening 68,    a mill or other
   cutting device may be used to cut the body from the opening.
        Referring additionally now to FIGS. 7-9,    additional
15 examples of the device 60 are representatively illustrated.
   In these examples, the device    60 is surrounded by,
   encapsulated in, molded in,    or otherwise retained by, a
   retainer 80.
        The retainer 80 aids in deployment of the device 60,
20 particularly in situations where multiple devices are to be
   deployed simultaneously. In such situations, the retainer 80
   for each device 60 prevents the fibers 62 and/or lines     66
   from becoming entangled with the fibers and/or lines of
   other devices.
25      The retainer 80 could in some examples completely
   enclose the device 60.  In other examples, the retainer 80
   could be in the form of a binder that holds the fibers     62
   and/or lines 66 together, so that they do not become
   entangled with those of other devices.
30      In some examples,  the retainer   80 could have a cavity
   therein, with the device  60   (or only the fibers 62 and/or

                               -  18
   lines  66) being contained in the cavity. In other examples,
   the retainer 80 could be molded about the device 60   (or only
   the fibers  62 and/or lines 66).
         At least after deployment of the device  60 into the
 5 well, the retainer 80 dissolves, melts, disperses or
   otherwise degrades, so that the device is capable of sealing
   off an opening 68 in the well, as described above. For
   example, the retainer 80 can be made of a material 82 that
   degrades in a wellbore environment.
10       The retainer material 82 may degrade after deployment
   into the well, but before arrival of the device 60 at the
   opening 68 to be plugged. In other examples, the retainer
   material 82 may degrade at or after arrival of the device 60
   at the opening 68 to be plugged. If the device 60 also
15 comprises a degradable material, then preferably the
   retainer material 82 degrades prior to the device material.
         The material 82 could, in some examples, melt at
   elevated wellbore temperatures. The material 82   could be
   chosen to have a melting point that is between a temperature
20 at the earth's surface and a temperature at the opening 68,
   so that the material melts during transport from the surface
   to the downhole location of the opening.
         The material 82 could, in some examples, dissolve when
   exposed to wellbore fluid. The material 82  could be chosen
25 so that the material begins dissolving as soon as it is
   deployed into the wellbore 14 and contacts a certain fluid
    (such as, water, brine, hydrocarbon fluid, etc.)  therein. In
   other examples, the fluid that initiates dissolving of the
   material 82 could have a certain pH range that causes the
30 material to dissolve.

                                  - 19
         Note that it is not necessary for the material 82 to
   melt or dissolve   in the well. Various other stimuli    (such
   as, passage of time, elevated pressure, flow, turbulence,
   etc.)  could cause the material 82 to disperse, degrade or
 5 otherwise cease to retain the device 60.     The material 82
   could degrade in response to any one, or a combination, of:
   passage of a predetermined period of time     in the well,
   exposure to a predetermined temperature in the well,
   exposure to a predetermined fluid in the well, exposure to
10 radiation in the well and exposure to a predetermined
   chemical composition in the well. Thus, the scope of this
   disclosure is   not limited to any particular stimulus or
   technique for dispersing or degrading the material 82,      or to
   any particular type of material.
15       In some examples,   the material 82 can remain on the
   device 60,   at least partially, when the device engages the
   opening 68.   For example, the material 82 could continue to
   cover the body 64    (at least partially) when the body engages
   and seals off the opening 68.     In such examples,  the material
20 82 could advantageously comprise a relatively soft, viscous
   and/or resilient material, so that sealing between the
   device 60 and the opening 68 is enhanced.
         Suitable relatively low melting point substances that
   may be used for the material 82 can include wax      (e.g.,
25 paraffin wax, vegetable wax),     ethylene-vinyl acetate
   copolymer   (e.g., ELVAX(TM) available   from DuPont),  atactic
   polypropylene and eutectic alloys.     Suitable relatively soft
   substances that may be used for the material 82      can include
   a soft silicone composition or a viscous liquid or gel.
30 Suitable dissolvable materials can include PLA, PGA,
   anhydrous boron compounds     (such as anhydrous boric oxide and

                                 -  20
   anhydrous sodium borate),    polyvinyl alcohol   (PVA), polyvinyl
   acetate   (PVAc), polyethylene   oxide, salts and carbonates.
         In FIG. 7, the retainer 80    is in a cylindrical form.
   The device 60 is encapsulated in,     or molded in,  the retainer
 5 material 82.   The fibers 62 and lines   66 are, thus, prevented
   from becoming entwined with the fibers and lines of any
   other devices 60.
         In FIG. 8, the retainer 80    is in a spherical form. In
   addition, the device 60 is compacted, and its compacted
10 shape is   retained by the retainer material 82.    A shape of
   the retainer 80 can be chosen as appropriate for a
   particular device 60 shape,     in compacted or un-compacted
   form. A  frangible coating 88 may be provided on the retainer
   80.
15       In FIG. 9, the retainer 80    is in a cubic form. Thus,
   any type of shape    (polyhedron, spherical, cylindrical, etc.)
   may be used for the retainer 80,     in keeping with the
   principles of this disclosure.
         In some examples,   the devices  60 can be prepared from
20 non-fibrous or nonwoven material, and the devices may or may
   not be knotted. The devices 60 can also be prepared from
   film, tube, or nonwoven fabric. The devices 60 may be
   prepared from a single sheet of material or multiple strips
   of sheet material.
25       Polyvinyl alcohol   (PVA) and polyvinyl acetate    (PVAc)
   are described above as suitable soluble retainer materials
   82,  but these materials may be used for the device 60 itself
    (with or without the retainer 80).    PVA is available with
   dissolution temperatures in water over a wide range       (e.g.,
30 ambient temperature to 175    OF).  PVA and PVAc can be used in
   the form of film, tube, and fiber or filament.

                                - 21
        Some advantages of PVA include:     1) PVA can be
   formulated to be insoluble at a typically lowered
   circulating temperature during a fracturing operation, and
   later dissolve when heated to bottom hole static
 5 temperature. No additional treatment     is required to remove
   the knot or other plugging device made with PVA. 2) PVA can
   be cross-linked with borate ion or aluminum ion to decrease
   its dissolution rate.   3) PVA properties can be modified by
   varying a degree of hydrolysis, copolymerization, or
10 addition of plasticizer.
        An example of a PVA knot device 60 can be formed as
   follows:  A length of PVA tube   (for example, a 4 inch   (~10
   cm) width flat tube made from 3 mil     (~0.08 mm) M1030 PVA
   film available from MonoSol, LLC of Portage, Indiana USA) is
15 turned halfway inside-out to form a double-walled tube. The
   tube is  folded in half lengthwise and one end is pinched in
   a vise. The other end is connected to a vacuum pump to
   remove air from the tube. The resulting flattened tube is
   twisted into a tight strand. The resulting strand is      tied in
20 a triple overhand knot. The knot can be seated against a
   0.42 inch   (~10.7 mm) diameter orifice and pressurized to
   4500 psi   (~31 MPa) with water. The knot seals the orifice,
   completely shutting off the flow of water.
        Another material suitable for use in the device 60 is
25 an acid-resistant material that    is water-soluble. Poly
   methacrylic acid is insoluble at low pH, but dissolves at
   neutral pH. Devices   60 made from poly-methacrylic acid could
   be used as a diverter in an acid treatment to block treated
   perforations   and divert the acid to other perforations.
30 After the treatment is   complete, the devices   60 would
   dissolve as the pH rises. No remedial treatment would be
   required to remove the plugs.

                               - 22
         Referring additionally now to FIG. 10,   another example
   of the flow conveyed plugging device 60 and the retainer 80
   is  representatively illustrated. In this example, the
   retainer 80  is flexible and fluid-filled, but still retains
 5 the device 60,  so that the fibers 62   (or lines 66) do not
   become entangled with those of other devices.
         The retainer material 82 in this example is   a liquid.
   The coating 88 is  a flexible membrane or bag that contains
   the retainer material 82 and the device    60 therein. The
10 coating 88 may dissolve, melt, disperse, break or otherwise
   degrade, in order to release the device    60 for plugging an
   opening in a well.
         The device body 64 and fibers  62 may comprise any of
   the materials described herein, or other materials.    It is
15 not necessary for the body 64 and the fibers    62 to be made
   of the same material. For example, the body 64 could
   comprise a material suitable for engaging and sealing off a
   particular opening in a well, and the fibers    62 could
   comprise a material suitable for producing a desired drag
20 coefficient, so that the device 60 will be conveyed by flow
   to the opening.
         The body 64 is not necessarily made of a fibrous
   material. For example, the body 64 could comprise an
   elastomer, a plastic, a relatively deformable metal alloy,
25 etc.
         Although the device 60 is depicted in FIG. 10 as having
   the fibers  62 extending outwardly from one side of the body
   64,  any of the device configurations described herein could
   be used with the retainer  80 of FIG.  10.  The device 60 of
30 FIG. 10  could also be used with any of the other retainers
   80 described herein, or would be used without a retainer.

                               -  23
   The fibers  62 could extend from any or all sides of the body
   64, and the fibers could be combined into any number of
   lines  66. Either or both of the body 64 and fibers   62 may be
   made of degradable, non-degradable, or a combination of
 5 degradable and non-degradable materials. Thus, the scope of
   this disclosure is  not limited to any particular
   configuration of the device 60,   the retainer 80, or any
   combination thereof.
         Referring additionally now to FIG. 11,  another
10 configuration of the flow conveyed plugging device 60 is
   representatively illustrated. In this example, the lines     66
   extend outwardly from the body 64 of the device 60.
         The device 60 of FIG. 11 could be used with any of the
   retainers 80 described herein, or could be used without a
15 retainer. The lines  66 may comprise fibers  62 and, if so,
   the fibers could be splayed outward or the lines could be
   frayed to increase a drag coefficient of the device 60.
         The lines 66 could extend from any or all sides of the
   body 64.  The lines 66 could comprise rope,  twine, string,
20 fabric, cloth, film, tubes,   filaments, a single sheet of
   material, multiple strips of sheet material, etc. Either or
   both of the body 64 and lines   66 may be made of degradable,
   non-degradable, or a combination of degradable and non
   degradable materials. Thus,   the scope of this disclosure is
25 not limited to any particular configuration of the device 60
   or its lines 66.
         The device body 64 and lines 66 may comprise any of the
   materials described herein, or other materials. It is    not
   necessary for the body 64 and the lines   66 to be made of the
30 same material. For example, the body 64 could comprise a
   material suitable for engaging and sealing off a particular

                                - 24
   opening in a well, and the lines 66 could comprise a
   material suitable for producing a desired drag coefficient,
   so that the device 60 will be conveyed by flow to the
   opening.
 5       The body 64 is not necessarily made of a fibrous
   material. For example, the body 64 could comprise an
   elastomer, a plastic, a relatively deformable metal alloy,
   etc.
         Referring additionally now to FIG. 12,  a cross
10 sectional view of another example of the device 60 is
   representatively illustrated. The device 60 may be used in
   any of the systems  and methods described herein, or may be
   used in other systems and methods.
         In this example, the body of the device   60 is made up
15 of filaments or fibers   62 formed in the shape of a ball or
   sphere. Of course, other shapes may be used, if desired.
         The filaments or fibers 62 may make up all,   or
   substantially all,  of the device 60.  The fibers  62 may be
   randomly oriented, or they may be arranged in various
20 orientations as desired.
         In the FIG. 12 example, the fibers  62 are retained by
   the dissolvable, degradable or dispersible material 82.     In
   addition, a frangible coating may be provided on the device
   60,  for example, in order to delay dissolving of the
25 material 82 until the device has been deployed into a well
    (as in the examples of FIGS. 8 & 10).
         The device 60 of FIG.  12 can be used in a diversion
   fracturing operation   (in which perforations receiving the
   most fluid are plugged to divert fluid flow to other
30 perforations),  in a re-completion operation   (e.g., as in the

                                 -  25
   FIGS. 2A-D example),   or in a multiple zone perforate and
   fracture operation   (e.g., as in the FIGS.    3A-D example).
         One advantage of the FIG.     12 device 60 is that  it is
   capable of sealing on irregularly shaped openings,
 5 perforations, leak paths or other passageways.       The device
   60 can also tend to "stick"     or adhere to an opening, for
   example, due to engagement between the fibers      62 and
   structure surrounding    (and in) the opening. In addition,
   there is  an ability to selectively seal openings.
10       The fibers  62 could, in some examples, comprise wool
   fibers. The device 60 may be reinforced      (e.g., using the
   material 82 or another material) or may be made entirely of
   fibrous material with a substantial portion of the fibers        62
   randomly oriented.
15       The fibers  62 could, in some examples, comprise metal
   wool, or crumpled and/or compressed wire. Wool may be
   retained with wax or other material      (such as the material
   82)  to form a ball, sphere,    cylinder or other shape.
         In the FIG.  12 example, the material 82 can comprise a
20 wax  (or eutectic metal or other material) that melts at a
   selected predetermined temperature. A wax device 60 may be
   reinforced with fibers    62, so that the fibers and the wax
    (material 82) act together to block a perforation or other
   passageway.
25       The selected melting point can be slightly below a
   static wellbore temperature. The wellbore temperature during
   fracturing is  typically depressed due to relatively low
   temperature fluids entering wellbore. After fracturing,
   wellbore temperature will typically increase, thereby
30 melting the wax and releasing the reinforcement fibers       62.

                                 -  26
         This type of device   60 in the shape of a ball or other
   shapes may be used to operate downhole tools in a similar
   fashion. In FIG.   14,  a well tool 110  is depicted with a
   passageway 112 extending longitudinally through the well
 5 tool. The well tool 110    could, for example, be connected in
   the casing 16 of FIG.    1, or it could be connected in another
   tubular string   (such as a production tubing string, the
   tubular string 12,   etc.).
         The device 60 is depicted in FIG. 14 as being sealingly
10 engaged with a seat 114    formed in a sliding sleeve 116 of
   the well tool 110.   When the device   60 is so engaged in the
   well tool 110   (for example, after the well tool is deployed
   into a well and appropriately positioned),     a pressure
   differential may be produced across the device and the
15 sliding sleeve 116,    in order to shear frangible members 118
   and displace the sleeve downward     (as viewed in FIG. 14),
   thereby allowing flow between the passageway 112     and an
   exterior of the well tool    110 via openings 120  formed
   through an outer housing 122.
20       The material 82 of the device    60 can then dissolve,
   disperse or otherwise degrade to thereby permit flow through
   the passageway 112.    Of course, other types  of well tools
    (such as, packer setting tools,    frac plugs, testing tools,
   etc.)  may be operated or actuated using the device 60 in
25 keeping with the scope of this disclosure.
         A drag coefficient of the device 60 in any of the
   examples described herein may be modified appropriately to
   produce a desired result. For example, in a diversion
   fracturing operation, it is     typically desirable to block
30 perforations  in a certain location in a wellbore. The

                                - 27
   location is usually at the perforations taking the most
   fluid.
         Natural fractures in an earth formation penetrated by
   the wellbore make it so that certain perforations receive a
 5 larger portion of fracturing fluids. For these situations
   and others, the device 60 shape,   size, density and other
   characteristics can be selected, so that the device tends     to
   be conveyed by flow to a certain corresponding section of
   the wellbore.
10       For example, devices  60 with a larger coefficient of
   drag   (Cd) may tend to seat more toward a toe of a generally
   horizontal or lateral wellbore. Devices    60 with a smaller Cd
   may tend to seat more toward a heel of the wellbore. For
   example, if the wellbore 14 depicted in FIG. 2B is
15 horizontal or highly deviated, the heel would be at an upper
   end of the illustrated wellbore, and the toe would be at the
   lower end of the illustrated wellbore    (e.g., the direction
   of the fluid flow 44 is   from the heel to the toe).
         Smaller devices  60 with long fibers  62 floating freely
20  (see the example of FIG. 13)  may have a strong tendency to
   seat at or near the heel. A diameter of the device 60 and
   the free fiber 62 length can be appropriately selected, so
   that the device is more suited to stopping and sealingly
   engaging perforations anywhere along the length of the
25 wellbore.
         Acid treating operations can benefit from use of the
   device 60 examples described herein. Pumping friction causes
   hydraulic pressure at the heel to be considerably higher
   than at the toe. This means that the fluid volume pumped
30 into a formation at the heel will be considerably higher
   than at the toe. Turbulent fluid flow increases this effect.

                                - 28
   Gelling additives might reduce an onset of turbulence and
   decrease the magnitude of the pressure drop along the length
   of the wellbore.
         Higher initial pressure at the heel allows zones to be
 5 acidized and then plugged starting at the heel,    and then
   progressively down along the wellbore. This mitigates waste
   of acid from attempting to acidize all of the    zones at the
   same time.
         The free fibers  62 of the FIGS.  4-6B & 13 examples
10 greatly increase the ability of the device 60 to engage the
   first open perforation   (or other leak path) it encounters.
   Thus, the devices 60 with low Cd and long fibers 62 can be
   used to plug from upper perforations to lower perforations,
   while turbulent acid with high frictional pressure drop is
15 used so that the acid treats the unplugged perforations
   nearest the top of the wellbore with acid first.
         In examples of the device 60 where a wax material    (such
   as the material 82)   is used, the fibers  62 (including the
   body 64,  lines 66, knots, etc.)  may be treated with a
20 treatment fluid that repels wax    (e.g., during a molding
   process).  This may be useful for releasing the wax from the
   fibrous material after fracturing or otherwise compromising
   the retainer 80 and/or a frangible coating thereon.
         Suitable release agents are water-wetting surfactants
25  (e.g., alkyl ether sulfates, high hydrophilic-lipophilic
   balance  (HLB) nonionic surfactants, betaines,
   alkyarylsulfonates, alkyldiphenyl ether sulfonates, alkyl
   sulfates).  The release fluid may also comprise a binder to
   maintain the knot or body 64 in a shape suitable for
30 molding. One example of a binder is a polyvinyl acetate
   emulsion.

                               - 29
        Broken-up or fractured devices   60 can have lower Cd.
   Broken-up or fractured devices   60 can have smaller cross
   sections and can pass through the annulus 30 between tubing
   20 and casing 16 more readily.
 5      The restriction 98  (see FIG. 10)  may be connected in
   any line or pipe that the devices 60 are pumped through, in
   order to cause the devices to fracture as they pass through
   the restriction. This may be used to break up and separate
   devices 60 into wax and non-wax parts. The restriction 98
10 may also be used for rupturing a frangible coating covering
   a soluble wax material 82 to allow water or other well
   fluids to dissolve the wax.
        Fibers 62 may extend outwardly from the device 60,
   whether or not the body 64 or other main structure of the
15 device also comprises fibers. For example, a ball     (or other
   shape) made of any material could have fibers    62 attached to
   and extending outwardly therefrom. Such a device 60 will be
   better able to find and cling to openings, holes,
   perforations or other leak paths near the heel of the
20 wellbore, as compared to the ball   (or other shape) without
   the fibers 62.
        For any of the device 60 examples described herein, the
   fibers 62 may not dissolve, disperse or otherwise degrade in
   the well. In such situations, the devices 60    (or at least
25 the fibers 62) may be removed from the well by swabbing,
   scraping, circulating, milling or other mechanical methods.
        In situations where it is desired for the fibers 62 to
   dissolve, disperse or otherwise degrade in the well, nylon
   is a suitable acid soluble material for the fibers. Nylon 6
30 and nylon 66 are acid soluble and suitable for use in the
   device 60. At relatively low well temperatures, nylon 6 may

                                 - 30
   be preferred over nylon 66,    because nylon 6 dissolves faster
   or more readily.
         Self-degrading fiber devices 60 can be prepared from
   poly-lactic acid   (PLA),  poly-glycolic acid  (PGA),  or a
 5 combination of PLA and PGA fibers 62.     Such fibers  62 may be
   used in any of the device 60 examples described herein.
         Fibers 62 can be continuous monofilament or
   multifilament, or chopped fiber. Chopped fibers      62 can be
   carded and twisted into yarn that can be used to prepare
10 fibrous  flow conveyed devices   60.
         The PLA and/or PGA fibers    62 may be coated with a
   protective material, such as calcium stearate, to slow its
   reaction with water and thereby delay degradation of the
   device 60.  Different combinations of PLA and PGA materials
15 may be used to achieve corresponding different degradation
   times or other characteristics.
         PLA resin can be spun into fiber of 1-15 denier, for
   example. Smaller diameter fibers     62 will degrade faster.
   Fiber denier of less than 5 may be most desirable. PLA resin
20 is  commercially available with a range of melting points
    (e.g., 140 to 365  OF).  Fibers 62 spun from lower melting
   point PLA resin can degrade faster.
         PLA bi-component   fiber has a core of high-melting point
   PLA resin and a sheath of low-melting point PLA resin       (e.g.,
25 140  OF melting point sheath on a 265 OF melting point core).
   The low-melting point resin can hydrolyze more rapidly and
   generate acid that will accelerate degradation of the high
   melting point core. This may enable the preparation of a
   fibrous device  60 that will have higher strength in a
30 wellbore environment, yet still degrade in a reasonable

                               - 31
   time.  In various examples, a melting point of the resin can
   decrease in a radially outward direction in the fiber.
         It may now be fully appreciated that the above
   disclosure provides significant advancements to the art of
 5 controlling flow in subterranean wells. In some examples
   described above, the device 60 may be used to block flow
   through openings in a well, with the device being uniquely
   configured so that its conveyance with the flow is enhanced.
         The above disclosure provides to the art a flow
10 conveyed plugging device  60 for use in a subterranean well.
   In one example, the device 60 comprises a body 64,   and one
   or more lines 66 extending outwardly from the body 64,   each
   of the lines 66 having a lateral dimension that is
   substantially smaller than a size of the body 64.
15       The body 64 may comprise at least one knot. A material
   of the one or more lines  66 may be selected from the group
   consisting of film, tube, filament, fabric and sheet
   material.
         The body 64 the and one or more lines 66 may be
20 enclosed within a retainer 80.   The retainer 80 may comprise
   a liquid retainer material 82 within an outer coating 88.
         The outer coating 88 may comprise a flexible material.
   The outer coating 88 may be degradable in the well.
         The body 64 and/or the line(s)  66 may comprise a
25 material selected from the group consisting of poly-vinyl
   alcohol, poly-vinyl acetate and poly-methacrylic acid. The
   body 64 and/or the line(s) may be degradable in the well.
         A method of plugging an opening 68 in a subterranean
   well is  also provided to the art by the above disclosure. In
30 one example, the method may comprise: deploying at least one

                                - 32
   flow conveyed plugging device   60 into the well, the flow
   conveyed plugging device   60 including a body 64 and,
   extending outwardly from the body, at least one of the group
   consisting of:   a) one or more fibers  62 and b)  one or more
 5 lines  66, the flow conveyed plugging device 60 being
   conveyed by flow in the well into sealing engagement with
   the opening 68.
         The method may include mechanically removing the
   plugging device 60 from the opening 68 in the well.
10       The method may include the plugging device 60 degrading
   in the well. The plugging device 60 may degrade in response
   to at least one of the group consisting of:    a) contact with
   a fluid in the well, b)   passage of time in the well and c)
   exposure to heat in the well.
15       The method may include a knot of the body 64 blocking
   flow through the opening 68.
         A material of the lines 66 and/or fibers    62 can be
   selected from the group consisting of film, tube, filament,
   fabric and sheet material.
20       The method may include enclosing the body 64 within a
   retainer 80.  The retainer  80 may comprise a liquid retainer
   material 82.
         Another flow conveyed plugging device 60 for use in a
   subterranean well is described above. In this example, the
25 device 60 comprises a body 64,    and fibers 62 extending
   outwardly from the body. The flow conveyed plugging device
   60 degrades and thereby permits flow through an opening 68
   in the well.
         The fibers  62 may be joined into at least one line   66
30 having a lateral dimension that    is substantially smaller

                               - 33
   than a size of the body 64.  The fibers 62 may be included in
   a material selected from the group consisting of film, tube,
   filament, fabric and sheet material.
        The body 64 and the fibers 62 may be enclosed within a
 5 retainer 80. The retainer 80 may comprise a liquid retainer
   material 82 within an outer coating 88.
        At least one of the body 64 and the fibers 62 can
   comprise a material selected from the group consisting of
   poly-vinyl alcohol, poly-vinyl acetate and poly-methacrylic
10 acid. At least one of the body 64 and the fibers 62 may be
   degradable in the well.
