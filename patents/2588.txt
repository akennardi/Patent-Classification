[0001]     This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No.
2016-243899, filed on December 16, 2016, and Japanese Patent Application No.
2017-171833, filed on September 7, 2017, the disclosures of which are hereby

                                 BACKGROUND
[0002]    The present disclosure relates to a method for manufacturing a light
emitting element.
[0003]    A light emitting element can be obtained, for example, by dividing a
semiconductor wafer which includes a substrate and a semiconductor part
having, in order from the upper face side of the substrate, an n-side nitride
semiconductor layer and a p-side nitride semiconductor layer. As for methods for
dividing such semiconductor wafers, a method is known in which modified
regions are formed by irradiating a laser beam on the substrate before dividing
the wafer.     In some cases, when using this method, the n-side nitride
semiconductor layer is exposed in a top view by removing the semiconductor part
located in the areas that overlap the intended dividing lines of the semiconductor
wafer from the top by etching, and a protective layer is formed on the removed
surface.    This can inhibit or prevent the dust generated by dividing the
semiconductor wafer from adhering to the surface exposed by etching, thereby
reducing the chance of current leaking via the dust.        This is disclosed, for
example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2005
166728.
                                    SUMMARY
[0004]      The light emitting element disclosed in the aforementioned patent
document has room for further reduction in the occurrence of current leakage.
[0005]        In one embodiment of the present disclosure,           a method for
                                         1

manufacturing light emitting elements comprises: providing a semiconductor
wafer comprising: a substrate, an n-side nitride semiconductor layer containing
an n-type impurity and located on the substrate, and a p-side nitride
semiconductor layer containing a p-type impurity and located on the n-side
nitride semiconductor layer; forming a protective layer on an upper face of the p
side nitride semiconductor layer in regions that include borders of areas to
become the plurality of light emitting elements; and reducing a resistance of the
p-side nitride semiconductor in areas where no protective layer has been formed
by annealing the semiconductor wafer; irradiating a laser beam on the substrate
so as to form modified regions in the substrate; and obtaining a plurality of light
emitting elements by dividing the semiconductor wafer in which the modified
regions have been formed in the substrate.
[0006] According to such a manufacturing method, a light emitting element in
which current leakage occurs less can be manufactured.         Moreover, a light
emitting element wherein current leakage occurs less can be provided.

                            DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0008]     Certain embodiments and examples of the present invention will be
explained   below   with   reference   to   the accompanying    drawings.   The
embodiments and examples described below, however, exemplify the structures
for the purpose of embodying the technical concepts of the invention, and do not
limit the invention.      Moreover, in the following explanations, the same
designations and reference numerals indicate components or elements that are
identical or of the same nature, for which the repetitive explanations will be
                                          3

 omitted when appropriate.
                                    Embodiment 1
 [0009]      In the method for manufacturing the light emitting element 100
 according to this embodiment, as          shown in FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B, a
 semiconductor wafer 1 is first provided which has a substrate 11, an n-side
 nitride semiconductor layer 12n containing an n-type impurity and located on
the substrate, and a p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p containing a p-type
impurity and located on the n-side nitride semiconductor layer (hereinafter, the
portion containing the "n-side nitride semiconductor layer 12n" and the "p-side
nitride semiconductor layer 12p" formed on the substrate 11 is referred to as
"semiconductor part 12").      Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B, a
first protective layer 14 is formed on the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p
in regions that include borders of areas to become the light emitting elements
 100 (hereinafter, the borders of the areas to become the light emitting elements
 100 are also referred to as the "intended dividing lines 13"). The protective layer
denoted    by   reference    numeral   14    for maintaining    the  p-side  nitride
semiconductor layer 12p at high resistance is occasionally referred to as the "first
protective layer 14," and the protective layer discussed later that is denoted by
reference numeral 18 for protecting the upper face of each light emitting element
 100 is occasionally referred to as the "second protective layer 18." In FIG. 3A, to
make explanations simple, the drawing shows the area of the semiconductor
wafer 1 which will later become four light emitting elements 100.         The same
applies to the schematic plan views FIGS. 2A, 4A, 5A, and 7A. Then, as shown
in FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B, annealing (i.e., heat treating) the semiconductor wafer 1
can reduce a resistance of the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p in areas
where no first protective layer 14 is formed.       It is presumed that annealing
allows the hydrogen that inactivates the p-type impurity to escape from the p
type impurity in areas of the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p where no
first protective layer     14 is formed, while disallowing the hydrogen that
inactivates the p-type impurity to readily escape from the p-type impurity in
areas of the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p where the first protective
layer 14 is formed. It is further presumed that this is why the resistance of the p
                                           4

side nitride semiconductor 12p can be reduced in areas where no first protective
layer 14 is formed, while allowing the p-type nitride semiconductor layer 12 in
areas where the first protective layer 14 is formed to retain its high resistance.
Then, as shown in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B, laser beam L is irradiated on the
substrate 11 so as to form modified regions in the substrate 11. A number of
light emitting elements 100 each being the same as or similar to that shown in
FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B can be obtained by dividing the semiconductor wafer 1 in
which modified regions have been formed in the substrate 11.
[0010]    This would provide high-resistance portions 12x which is part of the p
side nitride semiconductor 12p at lateral faces of the obtained light emitting
element 100 , as shown in FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B.            Therefore, even if dust
generated when dividing the semiconductor wafer 1 adheres to the lateral faces
of the light emitting element 100, it can inhibit or prevent electric current from
flowing in a localized manner through the dust. Thus, electric current can flow
uniformly to some       degree across the entire      area of the p-side    nitride
semiconductor layer 12p whose resistance has been reduced, and the n-side
nitride semiconductor layer 12n located directly thereunder, which should
normally occur. In the explanations below, the situation where electric current
which should normally flow uniformly to some degree in a certain area of the
semiconductor part 12 flows through a particular area in a localized manner,
such as a damaged area, is referred to as the "occurrence of current leakage,"
"leakage of electric current," or the like.
[0011]    The energy of the laser beam L is greater near the optical axis of the
laser beam L, hence the regions that overlap the intended dividing lines 13 in a
top view are typically more susceptible to damage from the laser beam L.
However, in the present embodiment, because the high-resistance portions 12x
are provided in the regions overlapping the intended dividing lines 13 in a top
view, even if those regions were damaged, there is less probability of current
leakage caused by such damage...
[0012]   As a result of diligent research, moreover, the present inventors learned
that removing by etching the regions of the semiconductor part 12 which overlap
the intended dividing lines 13 in a top view as in the case of a conventional
                                            5

method shown in FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B allows the laser beam L to concentrate
and readily damage the corners defined by the lateral faces of a recessed portion
20 and the upper face of the semiconductor part 12 as well as their vicinities
(hereinafter collectively referred to as the "corners 21"). Although the details of
the reasons for the energy concentration of the laser beam L at the corners 21
are unclear, it is presumed that when recessed portions 20 are formed in the
semiconductor part 12, the laser beam L readily concentrates at the corners 21
by being reflected and refracted.    In other words, if the recessed portions 20 are
formed in the semiconductor part 12 as in the case of a conventional method,
unless the regions of the semiconductor part 12 to be removed are adequately
large, the corners 21 of the semiconductor part 12 would be damaged, likely
causing current leakage. In the present embodiment, however, recessed portions
20 are not formed in the semiconductor part 12. In other words, in the present
embodiment, the upper face of the semiconductor part 12 is essentially flat and
has no corners 21, thereby eliminating the risk of damaging such corners 21 or
causing current leakage attributable to such damage.
[0013]    Even in the case of a conventional method, if the removed areas of the
semiconductor part 12 are adequately large, damage would be less likely to
result in the corners 21.     However, this would reduce the emission area per
semiconductor wafer. In the absence of the corners 21, the present embodiment
can provide a larger emission area per semiconductor wafer 1. Accordingly, in
the present embodiment, if the size of each light emitting element is matched to
that of the conventional method, the emission area per light emitting element
100 can be larger, thereby increasing the emission output as well as reducing
forward voltage (hereinafter also referred to as "Vf'). Furthermore, in the case of
matching the size of the emission area per light emitting element to that of the
conventional method, because the present embodiment can reduce the area that
does not contribute to emission, the number of light emitting elements 100
produced from a single piece of semiconductor wafer 1 can be increased.
[00141 Each step will be explained below in order.
Semiconductor Wafer Preparation Step
[0015]    First, as shown in FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B, a semiconductor wafer 1 is
                                          6

prepared which includes a substrate 11, an n-side nitride semiconductor layer
 12n containing an n-type impurity and located on the substrate, and a p-side
nitride semiconductor layer 12p containing a p-type impurity and located on the
n-side nitride semiconductor layer. Here, the explanation will be given for the
case where an active layer 12a is provided between the n-side nitride
semiconductor layer 12n and the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p.
Hereinafter, the n-side nitride semiconductor layer 12n, the active layer 12a, and
the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p are collectively referred to as the
semiconductor part 12 on occasion.       For each of the layers constructing the
semiconductor part 12, a nitride semiconductor, for example, InxAlyGai-x-yN
(OX, 05Y, X+Ys1) or the like, can be used. For the n-type impurity, Si, for
example, can be used. For the p-type impurity, Mg, for example, can be used.
For the substrate 11, an insulating substrate such as sapphire, or a conductive
substrate, such as GaN, SiC, ZnS, ZnO, GaAs, Si, or the like, can be used. On
the upper face of the substrate 11, a low temperature growth buffer layer or the
like may be formed as an underlayer.
[0016]        Using the active layer 12a or interface of the p-side nitride
semiconductor layer 12p and the n-side nitride semiconductor layer 12n as a
reference, the side of the semiconductor part 12 where a p electrode is formed is
referred to as the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p, and the side of the
semiconductor part 12 where an n electrode is formed is referred to as the n-side
nitride semiconductor layer 12n herein.
[0017]     In the present embodiment, as shown in FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B, by
etching part of the semiconductor part 12 from the p-side nitride semiconductor
layer 12p side starting with the state shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, the n-side
semiconductor layer 12n is exposed to form areas on which n-pad electrode 16 is
to be formed in a later step.     At this point, the regions of the p-side nitride
semiconductor layer 12p overlapping the intended dividing lines 13 of the
semiconductor wafer 1 in a top view are not etched off.
        Exposing the n-side nitride semiconductor layer 12n by etching part of
the semiconductor part 12 from the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p
creates a difference in potential on the upper face of each light emitting element
                                         7

 100. For this reason, if the current diffusion layer 15 described later is formed
 after etching the semiconductor part 12, the potential difference might cause
 migration depending on the material used for the current diffusion layer 15 (e.g.,
Ag or the like). Accordingly, in the case of using such a material for the current
 diffusion layer 15, it is preferable to etch the semiconductor part 12 after forming
the current diffusion layer 15. In this manner, the semiconductor part 12 can be
 etched after covering the current diffusion layer 15 with a cover layer, for
example, thereby inhibiting or preventing the migration of the current diffusion
layer 15 attributable to a potential difference.
Protective Layer Formation Step
 [0018]   Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B, a first protective layer
 14 is formed on the upper face of the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p in
the regions that overlap the intended dividing lines 13 of the semiconductor
wafer 1 in a top view. The intended dividing lines 13 of the semiconductor wafer
 1 can extend such that a light emitting element 100 has a given shape when the
semiconductor wafer 1 is divided in a later step. The intended dividing lines 13
can typically be formed into a lattice pattern when viewed from the top as that
shown in FIG. 3A or the like. By employing a lattice pattern for the intended
dividing lines 13 of the semiconductor wafer 1, a light emitting element 100 can
have a quadrangular shape when viewed from the top. Alternatively, the upper
view shape of the light emitting element 100 can have a hexagonal shape or the
like. The first protective layer 14 may have any shape as long as it is formed in
the regions that overlap the intended dividing lines 13 in a top view. In the case
where the intended dividing lines 13 have a lattice pattern, the first protective
layer 14 can also have a lattice pattern so as to overlap the lattice patterned
intended dividing lines 13. This can more effectively inhibit or prevent the flow
of current leakage at all lateral faces of the rectangular light emitting element
100.
[0019]      For the first protective layer 14, SiO 2 , SiN, SiON, A12 0 3 , ZnO, ZrO2,
TiO 2, Nb 20 5 , Ta205, or the like can be used, but typically, Si0 2 can be used. The
first protective layer 14 can be formed by depositing a layer of the material
which become the first protective layer 14 on the semiconductor wafer 1 by using
                                            8

 a CVD or sputtering apparatus.
 [0020]  The thickness of the first protective layer 14 is preferably at least 0.01
 [im, more preferably at least 0.2 pim.   This can securely inhibit or prevent the
 resistance of the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p from declining in the
 regions where the first protective layer 14 is formed. The thickness of the first
protective layer 14 is preferably 1 pm at most, more preferably 0.5 pm at most.
 This can inhibit or prevent cracks from generating in the first protective layer
 14.
 [0021]     In a top view, the width of the first protective layer 14 in a short
 direction (i.e., direction perpendicular to the intended dividing lines 13) is
preferably at least 1 im, more preferably at least 5 [tm. This securely allows the
semiconductor wafer 1 to be divided into multiple light emitting elements 100
directly under the first protective layer 14. In a top view, the width of the first
protective layer 14 in a short direction (i.e., direction perpendicular to the
intended dividing lines 13) is preferably 50 ptm at most, more preferably 20 im at
most, even more preferably 15 [tm at most. This can expand the low-resistance
areas of the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p.
 [0022]   After forming the first protective layer 14, a current diffusion layer 15
can be formed on the upper face of the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p in
regions where the first protective layer 14 is not formed, including the vicinity of
the regions where the first protective layer 14 has been formed.        Here, after
forming the first protective layer 14, the current diffusion layer 15 is formed
across substantially the entire area of the upper face of the p-side nitride
semiconductor layer 12p where the first protective layer 14 is not formed. Here,
the vicinity of the regions where the first protective layer 14 has been formed
refers to the areas within 20 pm of the first protective layer 14. This can make
the current density distribution of the light emitting element 100 more uniform
throughout the plane, thereby improving the emission efficiency of the light
emitting element 100.       The current diffusion layer 15 may be formed, for
example, before forming the first protective layer 14, or after reducing the
resistance of the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p discussed later.
[0023]    By disposing the current diffusion layer 15 after reducing the resistance
                                          9

of the p-side semiconductor layer 12p, even if the specific material used is one
that inhibits or prevents        reduction    of resistance  of the    p-side nitride
semiconductor layer 12p, the material can be used as the current diffusion layer
 15.
 [0024]    For the current diffusion layer 15, conductive metal oxides, such as ITO,
ZnO, In203, or the like can be used. In the case where the current diffusion layer
 15 is concurrently used as a reflective layer, Ag or the like can be used. The
current diffusion layer 15 can be formed by depositing the material which
become the current diffusion layer 15 on the upper face of the p-side nitride
semiconductor layer 12p by using, for example, a sputtering apparatus.
[0025]     In a top view, the distance between the current diffusion layer 15 and
the first protective layer 14 is preferably at least 0 [tm, more preferably at least 2
ptm.    Providing at least a certain distance between the two can reduce light
absorption by the current diffusion layer 15 along the perimeter of the light
emitting element 100 where the light emission is weak, thereby enabling
increase of the light extraction efficiency. In a top view, the distance between
the current diffusion layer 15 and the first protective layer 14 is preferably 20
gm at most, more preferably 10 ptm at most. This can expand the area of the
current diffusion layer 15 in the light emitting element 100, thereby enabling
reduction of Vf.
P-side Nitride Semiconductor Layer Resistance Reduction Step
[0026]    Subsequently, by annealing the semiconductor wafer 1, the resistance of
the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p is reduced in the areas where first
protective layer 14 is not formed. This allows the p-side nitride semiconductor
layer 12p in the areas where the first protective layer 14 has been formed to
maintain      high   resistance,    constituting   high-resistance    portions    12x.
Accordingly, when the semiconductor wafer 1 is divided along the intended
dividing lines 13, even if airborne dust from the end faces of the divided
semiconductor wafer 1 adheres to the lateral faces of a light emitting element
100, current would less likely flow between the p-side nitride semiconductor
layer 12p and the n-side nitride semiconductor layer 12n via the dust. In FIG.
4A and FIG. 4B, for ease of understanding, the areas corresponding to the high
                                           10

 resistance portions     12x of the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p are
 represented by crosshatching. This also applies to FIGS. 5A to 6B.
 [0027]     Annealing is preferably performed in a substantially hydrogen-free
 environment.     Typically, annealing is preferably performed in              a nitrogen
 environment.      The semiconductor         wafer    1   is   preferably  annealed   at a
 temperature of 350*C to 600*C.            The semiconductor wafer 1 is preferably
 annealed for a duration of 10 minutes to 60 minutes. This can efficiently reduce
the resistance of the p-side nitride semiconductor layer.
 [0028]   Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B, an n-pad electrode 16
 and a p-pad electrode 17 are formed on the semiconductor part 12.                 Here, a
second protective layer 18 covers substantially the entire upper face of the
semiconductor wafer 1 excluding a part of each of the upper faces of the n-pad
electrodes 16 and the p-pad electrodes 17. The second protective layer 18 can be
formed to cover the first protective layer 14, or formed after removing the first
protective layer 14. For the second protective layer 18, Si0 2 , SiN, SiON, A12 0 3 ,
ZnO, ZrO2, TiO 2 , Nb 2 0 5 , Ta205, or the like can be used, but typically, Si0   2 can be
used.    The second protective layer 18 can be formed by depositing a layer of
material which become the second protective layer 18 on the semiconductor
wafer 1 by using a CVD or sputtering apparatus.
Laser Beam Irradiation Step
 [0029]    Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B, a laser beam L is
irradiated on the regions of the substrate 11 corresponding to the intended
dividing lines 13. At this time, the laser beam L is condensed so as to be focused
on the inner side of the substrate 11. This can create the modified regions in the
substrate   11 which       will   serve   as   a   starting    point  when   dividing   the
semiconductor    wafer      1,  thereby    facilitating    the   process  of dividing   the
semiconductor wafer 1 in a later step. It is preferable to irradiate the laser beam
L from the substrate 11 side of the semiconductor wafer 1, i.e., the bottom face of
the semiconductor wafer 1, in order to minimize damage to the semiconductor
part 12.
[0030]    Any laser beam machining device can be used as long as it can form the
modified regions. Specifically, a fiber laser, CO 2 laser, YAG laser, or the like can
                                              11

be used. The laser beam L can be set to a wavelength of 200 nm to 5000 nm,
preferably 360 nm to 2000 nm. The pulse width of the laser beam L can be set to
 10 fsec to 10 plsec, preferably 100 fsec to 1 nsec. The output of the laser beam L
is preferably set to 0.01 W to 10 W.
 [0031]    In the present embodiment, there are no corners 21 as in the case of a
conventional method because no recessed portions 20 are formed in the areas of
the semiconductor part 12 that overlap the intended dividing lines 13 in a top
view. For this reason, in the case where the width of a recessed portion 20 in the
direction perpendicular to a intended dividing line 13 when the recessed portion
20 is formed in the semiconductor part 12 as in the case of a conventional
method has the same width as a first protective layer 14 in the direction
perpendicular to a intended dividing line 13 when the first protective layer 14 is
formed on the semiconductor part 12 without forming a recessed portion 20 as in
the case of the present embodiment, if the regions on which the laser beam L is
irradiated are identically or similarly brought closer to the semiconductor part
12 in the former (i.e., the conventional method) and latter (i.e., the present
embodiment), the latter (i.e., the present embodiment) is less susceptible to
damage than the former (i.e., the conventional method). Accordingly, in the case
of the present embodiment, the laser beam L irradiation locations can be brought
closer to the semiconductor part 12.
[0032]     Moreover, when dividing the semiconductor wafer 1, depending on the
crystal orientation or the like of the substrate 11, instead of being divided
perpendicular to the upper face and the lower face of the semiconductor wafer 1
which are parallel to one another, the semiconductor wafer 1 can occasionally be
divided diagonally defining a certain angle with the modified regions formed by
the laser beam L. In this case, depending on the extent of the deviation from an
intended dividing line 13, the light emitting element 100 produced might turn
out be a defective product.
[0033]    As discussed earlier, however, according to the present embodiment, the
regions of the substrate 11 which would be irradiated by the laser beam L, i.e.,
where modified regions are to be formed, can be brought closer to the
semiconductor part 12 as compared to conventional methods. The location of the
                                           12

 modified regions, for example, can be in the upper half region in the thickness
 direction of the substrate 11.     Thus, the amount of the deviations from the
intended dividing lines 13 can be reduced, and an improved production yield can
be expected.
 [0034]    The position where the modified regions are formed in the substrate 11
(i.e., the position in the thickness direction of the substrate 11) does not need to
be one, but can be multiple positions. In this manner, the semiconductor wafer 1
can be divided relatively easily even if the substrate 11 is thick. In the case of
forming modified regions at multiple positions of the substrate 11, the amount of
the deviations from the intended dividing lines 13 can be reduced if, for example,
the position closest to the semiconductor part 12 is in an upper half region in the
thickness direction of the substrate 11.
          Furthermore, setting the locations where the modified regions are to be
formed close to the semiconductor part 12 allows the light emitted towards the
substrate 11 from the semiconductor part 12 to reach the modified regions
relatively quickly when the light emitting element 100 is activated. This can
increase the amount of light extracted from the light emitting element 100
because more light can be reflected by the modified regions which have rough
surfaces from being subjected to the laser beam L.
         In the case of forming modified regions at multiple positions in the
thickness direction of the substrate 11, first modified regions and second
modified regions are formed such that the second modified regions are positioned
above the first modified regions.     For example, the first modified regions are
formed by irradiating a laser beam L with a first pulse energy and a first pitch
(the term "pitch" refers to a distance between two modified regions), on the
substrate 11. The second modified regions are formed by irradiating a laser beam
L with a second pulse energy that is smaller than the first pulse energy, and a
second pitch that is wider than the first pitch, on the substrate 11. Forming the
modified regions closer to the semiconductor part 12 in this manner can reduce
damage to the semiconductor part 12 caused by the laser beam L while
increasing the amount of light extracted. In other words, in order to form the
modified regions large enough for dividing the semiconductor wafer 1, a laser
                                          13

beam L with a relatively large pulse energy and a relatively narrow pitch needs
to be irradiated on the substrate 11.       Using such a laser beam L to form the
modified regions in a position relatively close to the semiconductor part 12 can
damage the semiconductor part 12.          By irradiating a laser beam L with the
second pulse energy that is smaller than the first pulse energy, and the second
pitch that is wider than the first pitch, on the substrate 11, the damage caused to
the semiconductor part 12 by the laser beam L when forming the second
modified regions can be reduced, as compared to the case of forming the second
modified regions using a laser beam L with the same pulse energy and pitch as
that of the first pulse energy and first pitch used in forming the first modified
regions.
         In the case of forming first modified regions and second modified regions,
the first modified regions can be formed in the lower half region in the thickness
direction of the substrate 11, and forming the second modified regions in the
upper half region in the thickness direction of the substrate 11.      Forming the
modified regions in this manner can further reduce the likelihood for the laser
beam L to damage the semiconductor part 12, while further increasing the light
extraction amount by forming the modified regions close to the semiconductor
part 12.
[0035]    In the absence of corners 21, the present embodiment allows for the use
of a laser beam L having a more larger pulse energy than in the case of a
conventional method.       This facilitates the step of dividing the semiconductor
wafer 1 even when a relatively thick substrate 11 is used.
[0036]     Specifically, the substrate 11 can have a thickness of 50 [tm to 500 Im.
The laser beam L is preferably irradiated at a position that is 10 [Im to 150 ptm,
more preferably 20 pm to 100 lim, from the upper face of the substrate 11. In
other words, modified regions are preferably formed at a position that is 10 pm to
150 pm, more preferably 20 pm to 100 pm, from the upper face of the substrate
11. In this manner, the semiconductor wafer 1 can be precisely divided while
reducing the damage of the semiconductor part 12.
Step of Dividing Semiconductor Wafer
[0037]     By subsequently dividing the semiconductor wafer 1 along the intended
                                           14

 dividing lines 13, a plurality of semiconductor light emitting elements 100 each
 being the same as or similar to that shown in FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B can be
 produced. Methods for dividing the semiconductor wafer 1 include, for example,
 pressing a roller, blade, or the like against the lower face of the substrate 11 and
 applying force thereto.
                                     Embodiment 2
 [0038]   The light emitting element 100 according to this embodiment, as shown
in FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B, includes a semiconductor structure having a substrate
 11, an n-side nitride semiconductor layer 12n containing an n-type impurity and
located on the substrate, and a p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p containing
a p-type impurity and located on the n-side nitride semiconductor layer. In this
semiconductor structure, a p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p is a light
extraction face side, and a n-side nitride semiconductor layer 12n is a mounting
face side. In other words, the light emitting element 100 is a face-up mounted
type light emitting element. In a top view, a resistance of a peripheral portion of
the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p is higher than a resistance of an area
inside of the peripheral portion.
        Accordingly, the high-resistance portions 12x, which are part of the p
side nitride semiconductor layer 12p, are positioned at the lateral faces of the
light emitting element 100. This can reduce the occurrence of current leakage,
even if dust or the like, which may cause current leakage, adheres to the lateral
faces of the light emitting element 100. Also, even if the high-resistance portions
 12x have been damaged, the likelihood of current leakage attributable to such
damage can be reduced.
        In the light emitting element 100, a first protective layer 14 can be
located on an upper face of the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p in a region
that corresponds to the peripheral portion. When the semiconductor wafer 1 is
annealed, the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p located under the first
protective layer 14 retains its high resistance, constituting the high-resistance
portions 12x under the first protective layer 14.      The first protective layer 14
may be removed after annealing the semiconductor wafer 1.
        A second protective layer 18 may be formed above the semiconductor
                                           15

 structure in an area that includes the upper face of the first protective layer 14.
This can protect the upper face of the light emitting element 100.
         A current diffusion layer 15 can be located on an upper face of the p-side
nitride semiconductor layer 12p in the area inside of the peripheral portion,
including in a vicinity of the peripheral portion. Here, the current diffusion layer
 15 is located substantially across the entire upper face of the p-side nitride
semiconductor layer 12p inside of the peripheral portion. "The vicinity of the
peripheral portion" here refers to the area within 20 ptm from the peripheral
portion towards the inside. This can make the distribution of current density of
the light emitting element 100 more uniform across the plane, thereby improving
the emission efficiency of the light emitting element 100. This can also make the
area of current flow of the light emitting element 100 relatively large across the
plane, thereby increasing the amount of light extracted from the light emitting
element 100.
        Modified regions are formed at lateral faces of the substrate 11. This can
make it easier to divide the semiconductor wafer 1, therefore, the production of
light emitting elements 100 can be facilitated. Modified regions can be formed in
an upper half region in a thickness direction of the substrate 11. This can reduce
the   deviations from the      intended dividing lines     13 when dividing the
semiconductor wafer 1 to obtain light emitting elements 100.          Furthermore,
setting the locations where the modified regions are to be formed closer to the
semiconductor part 12 can result in more light being reflected by the modified
regions, thereby increasing the amount of light extracted from the light emitting
element 100.
        In the case where the modified regions are formed at multiple positions
in the thickness direction of the substrate 11, the modified regions can have first
modified regions formed by using a first pitch and a second modified regions
formed by using a second pitch that is wider than the first pitch. Moreover, the
second modified regions can be formed at a higher location than the first
modified regions. This enables the formation of the modified regions close to the
semiconductor part 12, hence, the amount of light extracted from the light
emitting element 100 can be increased. Furthermore, since the second modified
                                          16

 regions are formed using a pitch wider than the pitch used for the first modified
 regions, damage to the semiconductor part 12 from the laser beam L can be
 reduced.
         In the case where the first and second modified regions are formed, the
 first modified regions can be formed in a lower half region in the thickness
 direction of the substrate 11, and forming the second modified regions in an
 upper half region in the thickness direction of the substrate 11. This allows for
the formation of modified regions in close proximity to the semiconductor part
 12, thereby further reducing damage to the semiconductor part 12 from the laser
beam L, while increasing the amount of light extracted.
                                    Example 1
         Example 1 will be explained based on FIG. 1A to FIG. 6B.
 [0039]    First, as shown in FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B, a semiconductor wafer 1 was
obtained by stacking an n-side nitride semiconductor layer 12n containing Si as
an n-type impurity, an active layer 12a, and a p-side nitride semiconductor layer
 12p containing Mg as a p-type impurity, on a substrate 11. For the substrate 11,
a sapphire substrate having a thickness of 800 [tm was used.       For the n-side
nitride semiconductor layer 12n, the active layer 12a, and the p-side nitride
semiconductor layer 12p, any of GaN, AlGaN, and InGaN or the like were
formed. Then, as shown in FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B, an area on which an n-pad
electrode 16 is to be formed in a later step, was formed by exposing the n-side
nitride semiconductor layer 12n by etching part of the semiconductor part from
the p-side nitride semiconductor layer 12p side. During the etching of the p-side
nitride semiconductor layer 12p at this point, the regions overlapping the
intended dividing lines 13 of the semiconductor wafer 1 in a top view were not
etched off.
[0040]     Then, as shown in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B, a first protective layer 14
composed of SiO 2 was formed on the upper face             of the p-side nitride
semiconductor layer 12p in the regions that overlap the intended dividing lines
13 of the semiconductor wafer 1 in a top view.         The thickness of the first
protective layer 14 formed was about 0.3 [im. The intended dividing lines 13 of
the semiconductor wafer 1, in a top view, were lattice patterned, and the
                                        17

 distance between the adjacent intended dividing lines 13 was 650 [rm. The width
 of the first protective layer 14 in a short direction was 20 ptm. Then, an ITO as a
 current diffusion layer 15 was formed to a thickness of about 0.1 [Im in a region
 across substantially the entire surface of the upper face of the p-side nitride
 semiconductor layer 12p where no first protective layer 14 was formed.         The
 distance between the current diffusion layer 15 and the first protective layer 14
was 6 pm.
 [0041]    Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B, the resistance of the p
side nitride semiconductor layer 12p where no first protective layer 14 was
formed was reduced by annealing the semiconductor wafer 1 in a nitrogen
environment at about 500*C for 40 minutes.
 [0042]     Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B, a p-pad electrode 17
was formed on the current diffusion layer 15 formed on the upper face of the p
side nitride semiconductor 12p, and an n-pad electrode 16 was formed on an
exposed area of the n-side nitride semiconductor layer 12n.           For the p-pad
electrode, Cr, Rh, Pt, and Au were sequentially stacked. For the n-pad electrode,
Ti, Al, Ti, Ru, Ti, Cr, Rh, Pt, and Au were sequentially stacked.          A second
protective layer composed of SiO 2 was formed across the entire upper face of the
semiconductor wafer 1 excluding the p-pad electrode 17 and the n-pad electrode
 16 to a thickness of about 0.2 [im. Then, the substrate 11 was ground from the
lower face side to have a thickness of 150 pim.
 [0043]     Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B, a laser beam L was
irradiated on the regions corresponding to the intended dividing lines 13 of the
substrate 11 from the lower face side of the substrate 11. The laser beam L was
applied to the position 100 ptm from the upper face of the substrate 11. For the
laser beam L, a fiber laser having a wavelength of 1064 nm, pulse width of about
 1 psec, and output of about 0.3W was used.
 [0044]    Then, by dividing the semiconductor wafer 1 along the intended dividing
lines 13, a plurality of light emitting elements 100 were obtained.             The
semiconductor wafer 1 was divided by force of a roller pressing against the lower
face of the substrate 11 along the intended dividing lines.
 [0045]    As a result, 5529 pieces of the light emitting elements 100 each having a
                                            18

square shape as shown in FIG. 6A and 6B, each side being 650 tm long, were
obtained. These light emitting elements 100 were tested to measure the flow of
current when a reverse voltage of 5V was applied (hereinafter also referred to as
"Ir"). As shown in FIG. 8, with respect to Example 1, among the 5529 pieces of
the light emitting elements 100 obtained, the number of the light emitting
elements 100 with which 0.01 or higher Ir was measured, was 39 pieces, in other
words, 0.07% of incidence. Accordingly, it was found that the current leakage
was sufficiently inhibited.
                                    Example 2
[0046]     FIG. 9 shows the test results of the 5542 pieces of the light emitting
elements 100 according to Example 2 which were provided in a same or similar
manner to those in Example 1 except for setting the width of the first protective
layer 14 in a short direction to 30 [Lm.    As such, with respect to Example 2,
among the 5542 pieces of the light emitting elements 100 obtained, the number
of the light emitting elements 100 with which 0.01 or higher Ir was measured,
was 42 pieces, in other words, 0.08% of incidence. Accordingly, it was found that
the current leakage was sufficiently inhibited.
                                    Example 3
[0047]    FIG. 10 shows the test results of the 5534 pieces of the light emitting
elements 100 according to Example 3 which were provided in a same or similar
manner to those in Example 1 except for setting the width of the first protective
layer 14 in a short direction to 40 [m. As such, with respect to Example 3,
among the 5534 pieces of the light emitting elements 100 obtained, the number
of the light emitting elements 100 with which 0.01 or higher Ir was measured,
was 36 pieces, in other words, 0.07% of incidence. Accordingly, it was found that
the current leakage was sufficiently inhibited.
                             Comparative Example
[0048]     As Comparative Example, light emitting elements 200 were prepared
which were different from those in Example 1 such that the regions of the p-side
nitride semiconductor layer 12p overlapping the intended dividing lines 13 of the
semiconductor wafer 2 in a top view were etched off. In other words, corners 21
existed in the semiconductor part 12 because recessed portions 20 were formed
                                        19

 by etching in the case of the semiconductor wafer 2.         Otherwise, the light
 emitting devices are same as or similar to those in Example 1.
 [0049]   In the case of Comparative Example, as shown in FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B,
 the width of a recessed portion 20 of the semiconductor part in a short direction
was set to 50 [tm.    In other words, the peripheral edges of the p-side nitride
 semiconductor 12p in the light emitting elements 200 were etched off by 25 ptm
each.
 [0050]    In the case of Comparative Example, 4050 pieces of the light emitting
elements 200 each having a square shape, each side being 650 [tm long, were
provided. These light emitting elements 200 were tested to measure the Ir that
flowed when applying a reverse voltage of 5V. As shown in FIG. 11, among the
4050 pieces of the light emitting elements 200 obtained, the number of the light
emitting elements 200 with which 0.01 or higher Ir was measured, was 599
pieces, in other words, 14.8% of incidence. Accordingly, it was found that the
current leakage was not sufficiently inhibited.
 [0051]      In the light emitting elements 200 of Comparative Example, the
recessed portions 20 in a short direction was greater than the widths of the first
protective layers 14 in short directions in Examples 1 to 3. However, because the
recessed portions 20 were formed by etching, it is presumed that the corners 21
of the semiconductor part 12 were damaged by the laser beam L resulting in the
occurrence of current leakage.      In contrast, the light emitting elements 100
according to Examples 1 to 3, current leakage were sufficiently inhibited despite
the fact that the width of the protective layer 14 in a short direction was smaller
than compared to the width of the recessed portions 20 in a short direction of the
light emitting elements 200.
