Abstract:
Blockchain formulation innovation to accommodate such as but not limited to large Bank, financial institutions and
monetary fund numbers and instruments such as but not limited to One Undecillion 10A36 for credit and debt, assets,
liabilities, commodities, property agriculture anywhere and everywhere large numbers are required to be seen managed
and transferred to and using this new blockchain innovation formula can be exploited under license agreement.
In this new Blockchain innovation the Blockchain wallet is split into two areas, the left area before the decimal place and
the right area after the decimal place. Each side of the decimal place will have but not limited to per this example
unlimited and/or fixed positions on the left and unlimited and/or fixed positions on the right however as per this
example there will be 12 on the left before the decimal place and 12 on the right. These would be considered but not
limited to digital mine discoveries/mining mined assets, commodities, and property as per the specific law in the
associated country.
This blockchain formulation innovation would work well with entities such as but not limited to the Vatican, World Bank,
United Nations, Gary McAlister and Fowler Estate, Aipotu Trust entities such as these could exploit this blockchain
innovation via a license agreement as it is open and transparent making it possible to manage waste fraud and abuse
and makes the entire process of cross border value transfer and debt settlements of the actual true value instrument
quicker and more efficient and eliminating the costs associated as the up to 10% mine POS proof of stake would cover
those costs in full.

Description:
Blockchain formulation innovation to accommodate such as but not limited to large Bank, financial institutions and
monetary fund numbers and instruments such as but not limited to One Undecillion 10A36 for credit and debt, assets,
liabilities, commodities, property agriculture anywhere and everywhere large numbers are required to be seen managed
and transferred to and using this new blockchain innovation formula can be exploited under license agreement.
In this new Blockchain innovation the Blockchain wallet is split into two areas the left area before the decimal place and
the right area after the decimal place refer to image 1. Each side of the decimal place will have but not limited to per this
example unlimited and/or fixed positions on the left and unlimited and/or fixed positions on the right however as per
this example there will be 12 on the left before the decimal place and 12 on the right. These would be considered but
not limited to digital mine discoveries/mining assets, commodities, and property.
Second blockchain which is integral to this blockchain innovation formulation as it connects both sides of the decimal
point together to form a continuous string on a 1 to 1, 1:1 basis
1 digit from our new blockchain innovation claim 1 which looks like this: 0.000,000,000,001 the 1 having a valuation of
USD$1T by the valuation and rating capabilities of the BCR Bankcoin Reserve and turns that into single dollars single
monetary units on our second blockchain which would look like this 1.000 000 000 000 that would be US$1T then they
can break that down into single dollar denominations example this second blockchain could handle anything up to the
12 digits on the right as well as 12 on the left this number can also be increased example to 15 either side if required.
Blockchain fixed price formula Innovation - Bankcoin Reserve Fixed Price Formula currently pegged, coupled to the 1 oz
price of gold where the ceiling of the 1 oz gold market price for a given month becomes the floor price of the asset for
the following month these time frames can be determined and adjusted accordingly to suit specific requirements
example GDP.
POS Proof of Stake Secondary Mining mine discovery from but not limited to the principle in the digital blockchain wallet
will apply using this innovation formula as an example but not limited to High Quality Assets, Commodities, Bonds,
Stocks, Shares, Insurance, Superannuation, Derivatives, debt-based or equity-based, Securities, Futures, forwards,
Swaps, FX foreign exchange, currencies, loans, deposits, T Bill, commercial paper, off balance sheet using this formula
now have the ability to continuously mint/mine/discover a percentage of their portfolios as an example up to 10% per
annum from but not limited to a single and multiple digital blockchain wallets containing the property, assets,
commodities mines that are required to but not limited to earn, return, yield perform a certain function and a certain
way to be determined that is beneficial to its but not limited to principle holder, owner, management firm.
Ratings valuation example but not limited to A AA AAA B BB BBB C CC CCC
The Blockchain digital asset/commodity mine discovery which is what is in the digital blockchain wallet and could be
called a coin example Bankcoin or BankUS being country specific could have as an example but not limited to an AAA
rating. As per the Bankcoin Reserve BCR indices formula which this would fall under that rating would be using the BCR
gold tether/peg/index formula of 1 Bankcoin being market valued at this point in time US$1375.00 with no rating and a
AAA product such as BankUS being of a higher quality and purpose being rated at AAA which would give it a valuation
rating of US$1,375.000.00 per BankUS coin asset/commodity/mine.

There are nine pages of claims only

Claim 1
Blockchain formulation innovation to accommodate such as but not limited to large Bank, financial institutions and
monetary fund numbers and instruments such as but not limited to One Undecillion 10A36 for credit and debt, assets,
liabilities, commodities, property agriculture anywhere and everywhere large numbers are required to be seen managed
and transferred to and using this new blockchain innovation formula can be exploited under license agreement.
As an example but not limited to:
10A36 One Undecillion looks like the following
1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 = 36 zero's
In this new Blockchain innovation the Blockchain wallet is split into two areas the left area before the decimal place and
the right area after the decimal place refer to image 1. Each side of the decimal place will have but not limited to per this
example unlimited and/or fixed positions on the left and unlimited and/or fixed positions on the right however as per
this example there will be 12 on the left before the decimal place and 12 on the right. These would be considered but
not limited to digital mine discoveries/mining assets, commodities, and property.
Which will look like this on the right unlimited
Decimal place ==>0.000,000,000,000 1 12 + 1 digits
And this on the left of the decimal
12 + 1 digits 1 000,000,000,000. <=== Decimal place
In this example to get to undecillion we require 12 digits on the right of the decimal point connected to 12 digits on the
left of the decimal point which would be 10A24
So it would look like this as you can see the decimal point in the middle.
1 000,000,000,000.000,000,000,000
Claim 2
Second blockchain which is integral to this blockchain innovation formulation as it connects both sides of the decimal
point together to form a continuous string on a 1to 1, 1:1 basis
1 digit from our new blockchain innovation claim 1 which looks like this: 0.000,000,000,001 the 1 having a valuation of
USD$1T by the valuation and rating capabilities of the BCR Bankcoin Reserve and turns that into single dollars single
monetary units on our second blockchain which would look like this 1.000 000 000 000 that would be US$1T then they
can break that down into single dollar denominations example this second blockchain could handle anything up to the
12 digits on the right as well as 12 on the left this number can also be increased example to 15 either side if required.
1.000,000,000,000 This represents USD$1T all the way down to USD$1Dollar on the right side of the decimal place. So if
you were transferring 100M dollars you would see it and send this if this formula is on a one to one basis.
0.000,100,000,000 USD$100M
Then we have to the left of the decimal place unlimited
10.000,000,000,000 This represents USD$10T all the way down to USD$1Dollar on the right side of the decimal place.
100. = USD$100T
1000. = USD$1000T
10,000. = USD$10,OOOT

Claim 3
Blockchain fixed price formula Innovation - Bankcoin Reserve Fixed Price Formula currently pegged, coupled to the 1 oz
price of gold where the ceiling of the 1 oz gold market price for a given month becomes the floor price of the asset for
the following month these time frames can be determined and adjusted accordingly to suit specific requirements
example GDP.
Now each digit in this blockchain wallet has a valuation by the BCR Bankcoin Reserve as an example of but not limited to
1T which is where the other 12 digits come from .1000 000 000 000 for this specific model which would take us to
10A36 it could also have a valuation of $100B per digit $10B per digit $1B per digit this would change 10 to the power of
x number and or each digit could represent an asset commodity or some property of some type as it gives this
blockchain innovation new capabilities such as but not limited to underwriting and lease abilities.
Claim 4
POS Proof of Stake Secondary Mining mine discovery from but not limited to the principle in the digital blockchain wallet
will apply using this innovation formula as an example but not limited to High Quality Assets, Commodities, Bonds,
Stocks, Shares, Insurance, Superannuation, Derivatives, debt-based or equity-based, Securities, Futures, forwards,
Swaps, FX foreign exchange, currencies, loans, deposits, T Bill, commercial paper, off balance sheet using this formula
now have the ability to continuously mint/mine/discover a percentage of their portfolios as an example up to 10% per
annum from but not limited to a single and multiple digital blockchain wallets containing the property, assets,
commodities mines that are required to but not limited to earn, return, yield perform a certain function and a certain
way to be determined that is beneficial to its but not limited to principle holder, owner, management firm. As an
example this blockchain innovation would work well with entities such as but not limited to the Vatican, World Bank,
United Nations, Gary McAlister and Fowler Estate, Aipotu Trust entities such as these could exploit this blockchain
innovation via a license agreement as it is open and transparent making it possible to manage waste fraud and abuse
and makes the entire process of cross border payments and settlements of the actual true value instrument quicker and
more efficient and eliminating the costs associated as the up to 10% mine POS proof of stake would cover those costs in
full.
Claim 5
Ratings valuation example but not limited to A AA AAA B BB BBB C CC CCC
The Blockchain digital asset/commodity mine discovery which is what is in the digital blockchain wallet and could be
called a coin example Bankcoin or BankUS being country specific could have as an example but not limited to an AAA
rating. As per the Bankcoin Reserve BCR indices formula which this would fall under that rating would be using the BCR
gold tether/peg/index formula of 1 Bankcoin being market valued at this point in time US$1375.00 with no rating and a
AAA product such as BankUS being of a higher quality and purpose being rated at AAA which would give it a valuation
rating of US$1,375.000.00 per BankUS coin asset/commodity/mine. This would also be true for but not limited to all the
countries, properties, assets, commodities, mines be here on earth or in space.

One Decillion 10A33
10 to the power of 33 = 10x33 = 1000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000.
One UnDecillion 10A36
10 to the power of 36 = 10x36 = 1000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000.

Example
Bankau - Bankcoin Australia and/or BCRAU Bankcoin Reserve Australia
Bankph - Philippines and/or BCRPH Bankcoin Reserve Philippines
That's 200 Treasury country coins/assets/commodities that are sovereign to that specific country. They can be used as
trade between countries and also to instantly settle short term weekly, monthly debts deficits instantly to bypass/offset
the foreign exchange and their foreign reserves held offshore.
Plus 200 country insurance and expansion blockchains like we have with Bank and then BankA because BankA is rated A
and is 10x Bank Bankcoin valuation it only requires 10% to insure the entire amount of Bank Bankcoin in existence. Same
goes for the countries.
