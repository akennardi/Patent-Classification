                                 Field of the Invention
[0002] The present invention relates to the field of immunoassays, and in particular to
antibodies that bind to paliperidone which can be used in immunoassays for detection
of paliperidone.
                                      Background
[0003] Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating psychiatric disorder affecting
approximately    0.45-1  % of the world's       population   (van  Os,   J.; Kapur,   S.
"Schizophrenia" Lancet 2009, 374, 635-645). The principal goals of treatment are to
achieve sustained remission from         psychotic symptoms, reduce the        risk and
consequences of relapse, and improve patient functioning and overall quality of life.
While many patients with schizophrenia are able to achieve symptom stability with the
available antipsychotic medications, poor adherence to medication is a common
reason for relapse with daily administered oral medications. Several studies (Abdel
Baki, A.; Ouellet-Plamondon, C.; Malla, A. "Pharmacotherapy Challenges in Patients
with First-Episode Psychosis" Journal of Affective Disorders 2012, 138, S3-S14)
investigating the outcomes of non-compliance have shown that patients with
schizophrenia who do not take their medication as prescribed have higher rates of
relapse, hospital admission and suicide as well as increased mortality. It is estimated
that 40 to 75% of patients with schizophrenia have difficulty adhering to a daily oral
treatment regimen (Lieberman, J. A.; Stroup, T. S.; McEvoy, J. P.; Swartz, M. S.;
Rosenheck, R. A.; Perkins, D. 0.; Keefe, R. S. E.; Davis, S. M.; Davis, C. E.; Lebowitz,
B. D.; Severe, J.; Hsiao, J. K. "Effectiveness of Antipyschotic Drugs in Patients with
Chronic Schizophrenia" New England Journal of Medicine 2005, 353(12), 1209-1223).

[0004] Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is the quantification of serum or plasma
concentrations of drugs, including anti-psychotic drugs, for treatment monitoring and
optimization. Such monitoring permits, for example, the identification

of patients that are not adhering to their medication regimen, that are not achieving
therapeutic doses, that are         non-responsive at therapeutic doses, that have
suboptimal tolerability, that have pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions, or that have
abnormal     metabolism       resulting   in   inappropriate    plasma     concentrations.
Considerable individual variability exists in the patient's ability to absorb, distribute,
metabolize, and excrete anti-psychotic drugs. Such differences can be caused by
concurrent disease, age, concomitant medication or genetic peculiarities. Different
drug formulations can also influence the metabolism of anti-psychotic drugs. TDM
permits dose optimization for individual patients, improving therapeutic and functional
outcomes.    TDM further permits a prescribing clinician to ensure compliance with
prescribed dosages and achievement of effective serum concentrations.
[0005]       To date, methods for determining the levels of serum or plasma
concentrations of anti-psychotic drugs involve the use of liquid chromatography (LC)
with UV or mass spectrometry detection, and radioimmunoassays (see, for example,
Woestenborghs et al., 1990 "On the selectivity of some recently developed RIA's" in
Methodological Surveys in Biochemistry and Analysis 20:241-246. Analysis of Drugs
and Metabolites, Including Anti-infective Agents;         Heykants et al.,    1994 "The
Pharmacokinetics of Risperidone in Humans: A Summary", J Clin Psychiatry 55/5,
suppl:13-17; Huang et al., 1993 "Pharmacokinetics of the novel anti-psychotic agent
risperidone and the prolactin response in healthy subjects", Clin Pharmacol Ther
54:257-268).      Radioimmunoassays        detect one     or both    of risperidone    and
paliperidone. Salamone et al. in US Patent No. 8,088,594 disclose a competitive
immunoassay for rispeidone using antibodies that detect both risperidone and
paliperidone but not pharmacologically inactive metabolites. The antibodies used in
the competitive immunoassay are developed against a particular immunogen.               ID
Labs Inc. (London, Ontario, Canada) markets an ELISA for olanzapine, another anti
psychotic drug, which also utilizes a competitive format. The Instructions For Use
indicate that the assay is designed for screening purposes and intended for forensic
or research use, and is specifically not intended for therapeutic use. The Instructions
recommend       that  all   positive    samples    should    be    confirmed   with    gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and indicate that the antibody used
detects olanzapine and clozapine (see ID Labs Inc., "Instructions For Use Data Sheet
IDEL-F083", Rev. Date Aug. 8, 2011). Some of these methods, namely HPLC and
                                             2

GC/MS, can be expensive and labor-intensive, and are generally only performed in
large or specialty labs having the appropriate equipment.
[0006]        A need exists for other methods for determining the levels of anti
psychotic drugs, particularly methods that can be performed in a prescribing
clinician's office (where the treatment for an individual patient can be adjusted
accordingly in a much more timely manner) and in other medical settings lacking LC
or GC/MS equipment or requiring rapid test results.

                                            3

competitive binding partner thereof is labeled with a detectable marker, and wherein
sample paliperidone competes with the paliperidone or competitive binding partner
thereof for binding to the antibody; and (ii) detecting the label so as to detect sample
paliperidone.

                    Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments
[0033]        The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships
between two or more polynucleotide or amino acid sequences: "reference sequence",
"comparison     window",    "sequence identity",   "percentage    of  sequence    identity",
"substantial identity", "similarity", and "homologous".    A "reference sequence" is a
defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison; a reference sequence
may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, a segment of a full length cDNA or
gene sequence given in a sequence listing or may comprise a complete cDNA or gene
sequence; a reference sequence may comprise a segment of a complete amino acid
sequence encoding a protein as given in a sequence listing or may comprise a
complete amino acid sequence encoding a protein. Generally, a reference sequence is
at least 18 nucleotides or 6 amino acids in length, frequently at least 24 nucleotides or 8
amino acids in length, and often at least 48 nucleotides or 16 amino acids in length.
Since two polynucleotide or amino acid sequences may each (1) comprise a sequence
(i.e., a portion of the complete nucleotide or amino acid sequence) that is similar
between the two molecules, and (2) may further comprise a sequence that is divergent
between the two polynucleotide or amino acid sequences, sequence comparisons
between two (or more) molecules are typically performed by comparing sequences of
                                            6

the two molecules over a "comparison window" to identify and compare local regions of
sequence similarity. A "comparison window", as used herein, refers to a conceptual
segment of at least 18 contiguous nucleotide positions or 6 amino acids wherein the
polynucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence may be compared to a reference
sequence of at least 18 contiguous nucleotides or 6 amino acids and wherein the
portion of the polynucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence in the comparison
window may comprise additions, deletions, substitutions, and the like (L.e, gaps) of 20
percent or less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise
additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Optimal alignment
of sequences for aligning a comparison window may be conducted by the local
homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, Adv. Apple. Math 2:482 (1981), by the
homology alignment algorithm of Needlemen and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970),
by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Natil. Acad. Sci. USA
85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT,
FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0
(Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, WI), Geneworks or MacVector
software packages), or by inspection, and the best alignment (i.e., resulting in the
highest percentage of identity over the comparison window) generated by the various
methods is selected.
[0034]       The term "sequence identity" means that two polynucleotide or amino
acid sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide or amino acid
residue-by-residue basis) over the comparison window.        The term "percentage of
sequence identity" is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over
the window of comparison, determining the number of positions at which the identical
nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, or U) or amino acid residue occurs in both
sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched
positions by the total number of positions in the comparison window (i.e., the window
size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.
The term "substantial identity" as used herein denotes a characteristic of a
polynucleotide or amino acid sequence, wherein the polynucleotide or amino acid
sequence comprises a sequence that has at least 85 percent sequence identity,
preferably at least 90 to 95 percent sequence identity, more usually at least 99
percent sequence identity as compared to a reference sequence over a comparison
window of at least 18 nucleotide (6 amino acid) positions, frequently over a window of
                                           7

at least 24-48 nucleotide (8-16 amino acid) positions, wherein the percentage of
sequence identity is calculated by comparing the reference sequence to the
sequence which may include deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of
the reference sequence over the comparison window. The reference sequence may
be a subset of a larger sequence.      The term "similarity", when used to describe a
polypeptide, is determined by comparing the amino acid sequence and the
conserved amino acid substitutions of one polypeptide to the sequence of a second
polypeptide.    The term "homologous", when used to describe a polynucleotide,
indicates that two polynucleotides, or designated sequences thereof, when optimally
aligned and compared, are identical, with appropriate nucleotide insertions or
deletions, in at least 70% of the nucleotides, usually from about 75% to 99%, and
more prefereably at least about 98% to 99% of the nucleotides.
[0035]       A "label," "detector molecule," "reporter" or "detectable marker" as used
herein is any molecule which produces, or can be induced to produce, a detectable
signal. The label can be conjugated to an analyte, immunogen, antibody, or to
another molecule such as a receptor or a molecule that can bind to a receptor such
as a ligand, particularly a hapten or antibody. A label can be attached directly or
indirectly by means of a linking or bridging moiety. Non-limiting examples of labels
include radioactive isotopes (e.g., 1251), enzymes (e.g.  p-galactosidase, peroxidase),
enzyme fragments, enzyme substrates, enzyme inhibitors, coenzymes, catalysts,
fluorophores (e.g., rhodamine, fluorescein isothiocyanate or FITC, or Dylight 649),
dyes, chemiluminescers and luminescers (e.g., dioxetanes, luciferin), or sensitizers.
[0036]       The invention provides an isolated antibody which binds to paliperidone.
The invention further provides an assay kit and an assay device comprising the
antibody.    Further provided is a method of detecting paliperidone in a sample,

psychotic drug therapy by providing evidence of the attainment of minimum pK
levels;   use to    determine   bioequivalence of anti-psychotic drug       in  multiple
formulations or from multiple sources; use to assess the impact of polypharmacy and
potential drug-drug interactions; and use as an indication that a patient should be
excluded from or included in a clinical trial and as an aid in the subsequent
monitoring of adherence to clinical trial medication requirements.
ANTIBODIES
[0048]        The present invention provides an isolated antibody which binds to
paliperidone. The term "antibody" refers to a specific protein capable of binding an
antigen or portion thereof (in accordance with this invention, capable of binding to an
anti-psychotic drug or metabolite thereof). An antibody is produced in response to an
immunogen which may have been introduced into a host, e.g., an animal or a human,
by injection. The generic term "antibody" includes polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal
antibodies, and antibody fragments.
[0049]        "Antibody" or "antigen-binding antibody fragment" refers to an intact
antibody, or a fragment thereof, that competes with the intact antibody for binding.
Generally speaking, an antibody or antigen-binding antibody fragment, is said to
specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation constant is less than or equal to I
pM, preferably less than or equal to 100 nM and most preferably less than or equal to
10 nM. Binding can be measured by methods know to those skilled in the art, an
example being the use of a BlAcoreTM instrument.
[0050]        Antibodies are made up of two heavy chains and two light chains. Each
heavy chain has one variable domain or region (VH) followed by a constant domain or
region (CHI), a hinge region, and two more constant domains or regions (CH2 and
                                            11

CH3 ). Each light chain has one variable domain or region (VL) and one constant
domain or region (CL). The variable domains or regions of the heavy and light chains
form the paratope of the antibody (a structure analogous to a lock), which is specific
for a particular epitope (similarly analogous to a key), allowing the paratope and the
epitope to bind together with precision. Within the variable domain, variable loops of
p-strands, three each on the light and heavy chains, are responsible for binding to
the antigen. These loops are referred to as the complementarity determining regions
(CDRs, namely CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3).
[0051]        Antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably
the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody.       Binding fragments
include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2 , and Fv fragments; diabodies; minibodies; linear antibodies;
single-chain antibody molecules (e.g., scFV); and multispecific antibodies formed
from antibody fragments.       An antibody other than a "bispecific" or "bifunctional"
antibody is understood to have each of its binding sites identical.
[0052]        As used herein, "epitope" includes any protein determinant capable of
specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor.        Epitopic determinants
usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino
acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural
characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Two antibodies are said to
"bind the same epitope" ("compete") if one antibody is shown to compete with the
second antibody in a competitive binding assay, by any of the methods well known to
those skilled in the art (such as the BlAcoreTM method referred to above).            In
reference to a hapten (such as paliperidone or other anti-psychotic drug), an antibody
can be generated against the non-antigenic hapten molecule by conjugating the
hapten to an immunogenic carrier. An antibody is then generated which recognizes
an "epitope" defined by the hapten.
[0053]       "Isolated" when used in the context of an antibody means altered "by the
hand of man" from any natural state; i.e., that, if it occurs in nature, it has been
changed or removed from its original environment, or both. For example, a naturally
occurring antibody naturally present in a living animal in its natural state is not
"isolated", but the same antibody separated from the coexisting materials of its
natural state is "isolated", as the term is employed herein. Antibodies may occur in a
composition, such as an immunoassay reagent, which are not naturally occurring
                                             12

compositions, and therein remain isolated antibodies within the meaning of that term
as it is employed herein.
[0054]       "Cross-reactivity" refers to the reaction of an antibody with an antigen
that was not used to induce that antibody.
[0055]        Preferably, the antibody of the subject invention will bind to the drug and
any desired pharmacologically active metabolites.         By altering the location of the
attachment of an immunogenic carrier in a drug conjugate, selectivity and cross
reactivity with metabolites and/or related drugs can be engineered into the
antibodies. For paliperidone (9-hydroxyrisperidone), cross-reactivity with risperidone
or    other   risperidone    metabolites    such    as   7-hydroxyrisperidone    and   N
dealkylrisperidone may or may not be desirable. An antibody that cross-reacts with
risperidone and paliperidone may be desirable, which does not react with 7
hydroxyrisperidone or N-dealkylrisperidone, thus detecting risperidone and its major
pharmacologically active metabolite paliperidone. Alternatively, it may be desirable
to detect the pharmacologically active metabolites, risperidone and paliperidone,
separately, while still not detecting the inactive metabolites, 7-hydroxyrisperidone and
N-dealkylrisperidone.     Antibodies may be generated that detect multiple ones of
these drugs and/or metabolites, or antibodies may be generated that detect each
separately (thus defining the antibody "specific binding" properties).        An antibody
specifically binds one or more compounds when its binding of the one or more
compounds is equimolar or substantially equimolar.
[0056]       The antibodies herein are described by the nucleotide and amino acid
sequences of their variable domains. Each was generated by inoculating a host with
a conjugate comprising an anti-psychotic drug conjugated to an immunogenic carrier.
Having now provided the nucleotide and amino acid sequences thereof, the
antibodies can be produced by the recombinant methods such as are described in
U.S. Patent No. 4,166,452.
[0057]       Antibody fragments which contain specific binding sites for the anti
psychotic drug may also be generated. Such fragments include, but are not limited
to, the F(ab') 2 fragments which can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody
molecule and the Fab fragments which can be generated by reducing the disulfide
bridges of the F(ab') 2 fragments.      Alternatively, Fab expression libraries may be
constructed to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with
the desired specificity (Huse et al., Science 256:1270-1281 (1989)).         Fab, Fv and
                                             13

ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from Escherichia coli,
allowing for the production of large amounts of these fragments. Alternatively, Fab'
SH fragments can be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form
F(ab') 2 fragments (Carter et al., BioTechnology 10:163-167 (1992)).             Other
techniques for the production of antibody fragments are known to those skilled in the
art. Single chain Fv fragments (scFv) are also envisioned (see U.S. Patent Nos.
5,761,894 and 5,587,458). Fv and sFv fragments are the only species with intact
combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they are likely to show
reduced non-specific binding. The antibody fragment may also be a "linear antibody"
e.g., as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,642,870, for example. Such linear antibody
fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.
ASSAY KITS AND DEVICES
[0058]       An assay kit (also referred to as a reagent kit) can also be provided
comprising an antibody as described above.           A representative reagent kit may
comprise an antibody that binds to the anti-psychotic drug, paliperidone, a complex
comprising an analog of an anti-psychotic drug or a derivative thereof coupled to a
labeling moiety, and may optionally also comprise one or more calibrators comprising
a known amount of an anti-psychotic drug or a related standard.
[0059]       The phrase "assay kit" refers to an assembly of materials and reagents
that is used in performing an assay. The reagents can be provided in packaged
combination in the same or in separate containers, depending on their cross
reactivities and stabilities, and in liquid or in lyophilized form.  The amounts and
proportions of reagents provided in the kit can be selected so as to provide optimum
results for a particular application. An assay kit embodying features of the present
invention comprises antibodies which bind paliperidone.           The kit may further
comprise competitive binding partners of paliperidone and calibration and control
materials.
[0060]       The phrase "calibration and control material" refers to any standard or
reference material containing a known amount of an analyte. A sample suspected of
containing an analyte and the corresponding calibration material are assayed under
similar conditions.   The concentration of analyte is calculated by comparing the
results obtained for the unknown specimen with the results obtained for the standard.
This is commonly done by constructing a calibration curve.
                                            14

[0061]        Antibodies embodying features of the present invention can be included
in a kit, container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for their utilization.
When the antibodies are supplied in a kit, the different components of the
immunoassay may be packaged in separate containers and admixed prior to use.
Such packaging of the components separately may permit long-term storage without
substantially diminishing the functioning of the active components.         Furthermore,
reagents can be packaged under inert environments, e.g., under a positive pressure
of nitrogen gas, argon gas, or the like, which is especially preferred for reagents that
are sensitive to air and/or moisture.
[0062]        Reagents included in kits embodying features of the present invention
can be supplied in all manner of containers such that the activities of the different
components are substantially preserved while the components themselves are not
substantially adsorbed or altered by the materials of the container.             Suitable
containers include, but are not limited to, ampules, bottles, test tubes, vials, flasks,
syringes, envelopes, e.g., foil-lined, and the like. The containers may be comprised
of any suitable material including, but not limited to, glass, organic polymers, e.g.,
polycarbonate, polystyrene, polyethylene, etc., ceramic, metal, e.g., aluminum, metal
alloys, e.g., steel, cork, and the like. In addition, the containers may comprise one or
more sterile access ports, e.g., for access via a needle, such as may be provided by
a septum. Preferred materials for septa include rubber and polytetrafluoroethylene of
the type sold under the trade name TEFLON by DuPont (Wilmington, DE).                   In
addition, the containers may comprise two or more compartments separated by
partitions or membranes that can be removed to allow mixing of the components.
[0063]        Reagent kits embodying features of the present invention may also be
supplied with instructional materials.      Instructions may be printed, e.g., on paper
and/or supplied in an electronically-readable medium. Alternatively, instructions may
be provided by directing a user to an internet website, e.g., specified by the
manufacturer or distributor of the kit and/or via electronic mail.
[0064]        The antibody may also be provided as part of an assay device. Such
assay devices include lateral flow assay devices.          A common type of disposable
lateral flow assay device includes a zone or area for receiving the liquid sample, a
conjugate zone, and a reaction zone. These assay devices are commonly known as
lateral flow test strips. They employ a porous material, e.g., nitrocellulose, defining a
path for fluid flow capable of supporting capillary flow.        Examples include those
                                              15

shown in US Patent Nos. 5,559,041, 5,714,389, 5,120,643, and 6,228,660 all of
which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
[0065]        Another type of assay device is a non-porous assay device having
projections to induce capillary flow.     Examples of such assay devices include the
open lateral flow device as disclosed in PCT International Publication Nos. WO
2003/103835, WO 2005/089082, WO 2005/118139, and WO 2006/137785, all of
which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
[0066]        In a non-porous assay device, the assay device generally has at least
one sample addition zone, at least one conjugate zone, at least one reaction zone,
and at least one wicking zone. The zones form a flow path by which sample flows
from the sample addition zone to the wicking zone.            Also included are capture
elements, such as antibodies, in the reaction zone, capable of binding to the analyte,
optionally deposited on the device (such as by coating); and a labeled conjugate
material also capable of participating in reactions that will enable determination of the
concentration of the analyte, deposited on the device in the conjugate zone, wherein
the labeled conjugate material carries a label for detection in the reaction zone. The
conjugate material is dissolved as the sample flows through the conjugate zone
forming a conjugate plume of dissolved labeled conjugate material and sample that
flows downstream to the reaction zone.          As the conjugate plume flows into the
reaction zone, the conjugated material will be captured by the capture elements such
as via a complex of conjugated material and analyte (as in a "sandwich" assay) or
directly (as in a "competitive" assay). Unbound dissolved conjugate material will be
swept past the reaction zone into the at least one wicking zone. Such devices can
include projections or micropillars in the flow path.
[0067]        An instrument such as that disclosed in US Patent Publication Nos.
US20060289787A1       and US 20070231883A1, and US Patent Nos. 7,416,700 and
6,139,800, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, is able
to detect the bound conjugated material in the reaction zone.            Common labels
include fluorescent dyes that can be detected by instruments which excite the
fluorescent dyes and incorporate a detector capable of detecting the fluorescent
dyes.

IMMUNOASSAYS
[0068]        The antibodies thus produced can be used in immunoassays to
recognize/bind to the anti-psychotic drug, thereby detecting the presence and/or
amount of the drug in a patient sample. Preferably, the assay format is a competitive
immunoassay format. Such an assay format and other assays are described, among
other places, in Hampton et al. (Serological Methods, A Laboratory Manual, APS
Press, St. Paul, MN 1990) and Maddox et al. (J. Exp. Med. 158:12111, 1983).
[0069]        The term "analyte" refers to any substance or group of substances, the
presence or amount of which is to be determined.           Representative anti-psychotic
drug analytes include, but are not limited to, risperidone, paliperidone, olanzapine,
aripiprazole, and quetiapine.
[0070]        The term "competitive binding partner" refers to a substance or group of
substances, such as may be employed in a competitive immunoassay, which behave
similarly to an analyte with respect to binding affinity to an antibody. Representative
competitive binding partners include, but are not limited to, anti-psychotic drug
derivatives and the like.
[0071]        The term "detecting" when used with an analyte refers to any
quantitative, semi-quantitative, or qualitative method as well as to all other methods
for determining an analyte in general, and an anti-psychotic drug in particular. For
example, a method that merely detects the presence or absence of an anti-psychotic
drug in a sample lies within the scope of the present invention, as do methods that
provide data as to the amount or concentration of the anti-psychotic drug in the
sample. The terms "detecting", "determining", "identifying", and the like are used
synonymously herein, and all lie within the scope of the present invention.
[0072]        A preferred embodiment of the subject invention is a competitive
immunoassay wherein antibodies which bind the anti-psychotic drug, or the drug or
competitive binding partner thereof, are attached to a solid support (such as the
reaction zone in a lateral flow assay device) and labeled drug or competitive binding
partner thereof, or labeled antibody, respectively, and a sample derived from the host
are passed over the solid support and the amount of label detected attached to the
solid support can be correlated to a quantity of drug in the sample.
[0073]        Any sample that is suspected of containing an analyte, e.g., an anti
psychotic drug, can be analyzed in accordance with the methods of the presently
preferred embodiments.       The sample can be pretreated if desired and can be
                                            17

prepared in any convenient medium that does not interfere with the assay.
Preferably, the sample comprises an aqueous medium such as a body fluid from a
host, most preferably plasma or serum.
[0074]        It is to be understood that all manner of immunoassays employing
antibodies are contemplated for use in accordance with the presently preferred
embodiments, including assays in which antibodies are bound to solid phases and
assays in which antibodies are in liquid media. Methods of immunoassays that can
be used to detect analytes using antibodies embodying features of the present
invention include, but are not limited to, competitive (reagent limited) assays wherein
labeled analyte (analyte analog) and analyte in a sample compete for antibodies and
single-site immunometric assays wherein the antibody is labeled; and the like.
[0075]        All examples were carried out using standard techniques, which are well
known and routine to those of skill in the art, except where otherwise described in
detail.   Routine molecular biology techniques of the following examples can be
carried out as described in standard laboratory manuals, such as Sambrook et al.,
Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory       manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Habor Laboratory
Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989).

[0083]       Antibody 17.3 clone 5C7 (second)
[0084]       The   hybridoma designated 17.3 clone 5C7 (second)           secretes a
monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for aripiprazole. The antibody is designated 17.3

[00122]      After clones were identified via ELISA reactivity, competition ELISAs
were run to approximate affinity and cross-reactivity with similar compounds. Figs. 1
and 2 show the ELISA cross-reactivity results from hybridoma subclone 5_9.         Data
shows reactivity to risperidone, as well as its metabolites paliperidone and 7
hydroxyrisperidone.
[00123]      Supernatants were also tested by competition ELISA to determine if the
signals were specific to either risperidone or paliperidone. Fig. 3 shows the results
from hybridoma subclone 2A5.          Data shows reactivity to both risperidone and
paliperidone.
[00124]      Fig. 4 shows the competitive immunoassay format used on a lateral flow
assay device in which the capture antibody, risperidone/paliperidone clone 5-9, was
deposited on a chip along with a detection conjugate consisting of risperidone
conjugated to a fluorophore. In this competitive format as show in Fig. 4, a low level
of analyte (paliperidone) results in high signal, whereas a high level of analyte
(paliperidone) results in low signal. The amount of paliperidone in the sample can be
calculated from the loss of fluorescence compared to a control sample with no drug
present.   A typical dose response curve generated with risperidone/paliperidone
clone 5-9 is shown in Fig. 5.
[00125]      Fig. 6 shows the chip design of a lateral flow assay device according to
one embodiment of the subject invention. The device includes a zone or area for
receiving the sample, a conjugate zone (which contains desired labeled competitive
binding partner(s)), and a reaction zone (eight areas within the reaction zone are
indicated; each area can contain a separate desired antibody). Sample flows from
the sample zone through the conjugate zone and to the reaction zone.
[00126]      Figs. 7-10 show typical dose response curves for an aripiprazole positive
control (sample containing aripiprazole) generated with antibody 5C7 deposited in
reaction zone 2 and a labeled aripiprazole competitive binding partner in the
conjugate zone (Fig. 7), an olanzapine positive control (sample containing
olanzapine) generated with antibody 4G9-1 deposited in reaction zone 4 and a
labeled olanzapine competitive binding partner in the conjugate zone (Fig. 8), a
quetiapine positive control (sample containing quetiapine) generated with antibody 11
deposited in reaction zone 6 and a labeled quetiapine competitive binding partner in
the conjugate zone (Fig. 9), and a risperidone positive control (sample containing
risperidone) generated with antibody 5-9 deposited in reaction zone 8 and a labeled
                                           32

rispeidone competitive binding partner in the conjugate zone (Fig. 10). The labeled
competitive binding partners in the conjugate zone compete with the drugs present in
the samples for binding to the antibodies. The amount of label is detected and is an
indication of the amount of drug present in the sample (the amount of signal being
inversely proportional to the amount of drug in the sample - see Fig. 4).
[00127]              In order to confirm that conjugates of labeled competitive binding
partners do not bind to antibodies deposited in the reaction zones, negative controls
were conducted by using samples containing no drugs.                                 Referring to Table 3, a
sample containing no aripiprazole is deposited in the sample zone and moves by
capillary action through the conjugate zone (this time containing labeled olanzapine,
labeled quetiapine, and labeled risperidone, but no labeled aripiprazole) and to the
reaction zone.             The reaction zone again contains aripiprazole antibody (5C7) in
reaction zone 2. Table 3 below shows the results, confirming that there is no dose
response and the olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone conjugates that move by
capillary action through the reaction zone do not bind to the aripiprazole antibody.

[00144]           Figs. 11-14 show typical dose response curves in specific antibody
reaction zones, and proof of dose response low/high concentration for each specific
assay in the presence of other conjugates.                             In Fig. 11,     a sample containing
aripiprazole is deposited in the sample zone and moves by capillary action through
the conjugate zone (this time containing labeled aripiprazole, labeled olanzapine,

labeled quetiapine, and labeled risperidone) and to the reaction zone. The reaction
zone again contains aripiprazole antibody (5C7) in reaction zone 2. A typical dose
response curve was generated as is shown in Fig. 11 only for aripiprazole, and not
for olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone.
[00145]      In Fig. 12, a sample containing olanzapine is deposited in the sample
zone and moves by capillary action through the conjugate zone (this time containing
labeled aripiprazole, labeled olanzapine, labeled quetiapine, and labeled risperidone)
and to the reaction zone. The reaction zone again contains olanzapine antibody
(4G9-1) in reaction zone 4.      A typical dose response curve was generated as is
shown in Fig. 12 only for olanzapine, and not for aripiprazole, quetiapine, or
risperidone.
[00146]      In Fig. 13, a sample containing quetiapine is deposited in the sample
zone and moves by capillary action through the conjugate zone (this time containing
labeled aripiprazole, labeled olanzapine, labeled quetiapine, and labeled risperidone)
and to the reaction zone. The reaction zone again contains quetiapine antibody (11)
in reaction zone 6. A typical dose response curve was generated as is shown in Fig.
13 only for quetiapine, and not for aripiprazole, olanzapine, or risperidone.
[00147]      In Fig. 14, a sample containing risperidone is deposited in the sample
zone and moves by capillary action through the conjugate zone (this time containing
labeled aripiprazole, labeled olanzapine, labeled quetiapine, and labeled risperidone)
and to the reaction zone. The reaction zone again contains risperidone antibody (5
9) in reaction zone 8. A typical dose response curve was generated as is shown in
Fig. 14 only for risperidone, and not for aripiprazole, olanzapine, or quetiapine.
[00148]      Figs. 15-18 show typical dose response curves for each assay in the
presence of other conjugates and antibodies.           In Fig. 15, a sample containing
aripiprazole is deposited in the sample zone and moves by capillary action through
the conjugate zone (again containing labeled aripiprazole, labeled olanzapine,
labeled quetiapine, and labeled risperidone) and to the reaction zone. The reaction
zone again contains aripiprazole antibody (5C7) in reaction zone 2, as well as
olanzapine antibody (4G9-1) in reaction zone 4, quetiapine antibody (11) in reaction
zone 6, and risperidone antibody (5-9) in reaction zone 8. A typical dose response
curve was generated for aripiprazole, as is shown in Fig. 15.           When a sample
containing olanzapine was deposited in the sample zone of this chip, a typical dose
response curve was generated for olanzapine as shown in Fig. 16. When a sample
                                            37

containing quetiapine was deposited in the sample zone of this chip, a typical dose
response curve for quetiapine was generated as shown in Fig. 17. When a sample
containing risperidone was deposited in the sample zone of this chip, a typical dose
response curve for risperidone was generated as shown in Fig. 18.
[00149]      Figs. 19-22 show comparisons of dose response curves generated as
positive controls (Figs. 7-10) to dose response curves generated in the multiplex
format (Figs. 15-18).    The comparison for aripiprazole is shown in Fig. 19; for
olanzapine in Fig. 20; for quetiapine in Fig. 21; and for risperidone in Fig. 22. These
figures show that the positive control curves are similar to the multiplex curves.

can be used to detect multiple anti-psychotic drugs using a single sample from a
patient on one portable, point-of-care device.
