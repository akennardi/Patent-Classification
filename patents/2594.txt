CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]              This application is a divisional application of Australian application number
2013315063, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
BACKGROUND
[0002]              The present invention relates to underground mining machines, and in particular
to a cutter head for an underground mining machine.
[0003]              A hard rock continuous miner includes a cutter head having an oscillating
cutting disc. The oscillating disc cutter transmits all of the dynamic cutting forces through
the bearings, and the life of the bearings are limited due to the high loads and high speed of
the cutting discs. In addition, the oscillating discs require large face seal surface areas in
the primary cutting area, while the cutting discs oscillate at frequencies typically around 50
Hz.       It is difficult to seal a large area with a high surface velocity, and this is further
complicated due to the fact that the cutting operation generates a large amount of highly
abrasive rock particles.              The combination of the contaminated environment and high
surface velocity accelerates wear on the seals and decreases the working life of the seals.
Furthermore, the deficiencies in the seals and the highly loaded bearings can combine to
even further increase maintenance and replacement of the disc cutter assembly.               These
factors also limit the frequency and the eccentricity of oscillation of the cutting discs,
thereby limiting the total power available for rock cutting
[0004]              In addition, oscillating disc cutter systems typically lack a means for directly
monitoring the behavior of the disc cutter at the cutting surface. As a result, it is difficult to
sense a change in the cutting conditions (e.g., when the hardness of the rock changes).
Thus, the operator is unable to control the disc cutter to optimize the cutting performance.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0032]              As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a mining machine 10 includes a frame 14, a boom
18, and a cutter head 22 supported on the boom 18 for engaging a mine wall 26. The frame
14 includes tracks 30 for moving the frame 14 over a support surface or mine floor (not
shown). The frame 14 further includes a gathering head 32 positioned adjacent the mine
floor proximate the cutter head 22. The gathering head 32 includes a deck 34 and rotating
fingers 38 that urge cut material onto a conveyor (not shown). The frame 14 also includes a
pair of arms 42 pivotably coupled to the frame 14.              The arms 42 can be extended to a
position forward of the gathering head 32 in order to direct cut material onto the deck 34.
[0033]              The boom 18 is pivotably coupled to the frame 14 at one end, and operation of
one or more first actuators 46 pivot, extend, and retract the boom 18 relative to the frame
14. In the illustrated embodiment, the first actuators 46 are hydraulic cylinders. Also, in
the illustrated embodiment, the boom 18 pivotably supports the cutter head 22 on an end of
the boom 18 opposite the frame 14.             A second actuator 50 (FIG. 2) pivots the cutter head
22 relative to the boom 18. The cutter head 22 is positioned such that the cutter head 22
engages the mine wall 26 with a controlled force. Operation of the first actuators 46 moves
the boom 18 relative to the frame 14, thereby moving the cutter head 22 over the mine wall
26 to produce a desired cutting profile. The angle between the cutter head 22 and the boom
18 is continuously monitored. Sensor data for the angle is provided to a control system for
                                                     6
10326140 1 (GHMatters) P99466.AU.1

controlling the position of the boom 18.           The speed of movement of the boom 18 can be
adjusted to match the excavation rate, or the energy delivered to the mine wall 26.
[0034]              As shown in FIG. 3, a coupling member or mounting bracket 58 supports the
cutter head 22 for pivoting movement relative to the boom 18 (FIG. 2). In the embodiment
of FIG. 3, the cutter head 22 includes a first end 62, a second end 66, and a support plate 70
proximate the first end 62. In the illustrated embodiment the cutter head 22 includes a
coupling member or arm 60 for supporting the cutter head 22 on the mounting bracket 58.
Multiple pins 74 are positioned around the perimeter of the support plate 70 and extend
through the support plate 70 and the arm 60. Each pin 74 supports a spring 78, which
reacts to the forces exerted on the cutter head 22 by the mine wall 26. The springs 78 also
isolate the boom 18 against transmission of vibrational forces from the cutter head 22. In
some embodiments, each pin 74 also supports a damper.                  Referring to FIG. 3A, the
geometry and the mass of the cutter head 22 defines a combined center of mass 80 that is
generally positioned between the first end 62 and the cutting bit 86. The size, shape, and
density of the components of the cutter head 22 may be modified to adjust the position of
the center of mass 80 relative to the cutting bit 86.
[0035]              In other embodiments, a different type of cutter head (including a cutter head
having a conventional oscillating disc cutter) may be coupled to the arm 60 by the pins 74
and springs 78. In still other embodiments, a plate spring or hinge is coupled between the
support plate 70 and the boom 18.              The plate spring is made from a fatigue-resistant
material such as a carbon-fiber composite.              The plate spring eliminates the need for
mechanical pivots and reduces wear on the coupling, thereby improving the working life.
[0036]              The cutter head 22 is shown in FIGS. 4-6. The cutter head 22 includes a cutting
bit 86 proximate the second end 66, a first or inertial member 90 coupled to the cutting bit
86, and a second or exciter member 94. In the illustrated embodiment, the cutting bit 86 is
formed as a ring or disc that is secured to the inertial member 90 to move with the inertial
member 90. The cutting bit 86 includes a cutting edge 88 (FIG. 6). The cutter head 22
further includes a first motor 102, a second motor 106, a slew plate or bearing 110 coupled
                                                     7
10326140 1 (GHMatters) P99466.AU.1

to the inertial member 90, and a support plate 114 for supporting the first motor 102 and the
second motor 106. The slew bearing 110 includes a ring gear 118 that is driven by the
second motor 106. As best shown in FIG. 6, the first motor 102 drives a first shaft 126
(FIG. 6) to rotate the exciter member 94 about an axis of rotation 98. In one embodiment,
the second motor 106 rotates the ring gear 118 and the inertial member 90 about the axis
98.
[0037]              In the embodiment of FIGS. 4-6, the inertial member 90 has a generally frusto
conical shape and tapers in a direction from the first end 62 toward the second end 66.
More particularly, the inertial member 90 includes a main body 130, a housing 134
positioned proximate a narrow end of the main body 130, and a sleeve 138 that is
positioned within the body 130 and is coupled to the housing 134.                   The housing 134
supports the cutting bit 86 proximate the second end 66 of the cutter head 22. In other
embodiments, the inertial member 90 may have another construction.
[0038]              The tapered shape provides clearance for the cutting bit 86 to engage the mine
wall 26 while still permitting the boom 18 to position the cutter head 22 and produce an
optimum cutting profile. The position and shape of the inertial member 90 are inter-related
design factors, and the tapered shape allows a minimum amount of mass to provide a
relatively high "equivalent" mass or moment of inertia.               In addition, the tapered shape
facilitates cutting along tight corners and performing cut-and-break mining as described in
more detail below. It is understood that the cutter head 22 could be used for cutting a mine
wall according to other methods (i.e., the cutter head 22 is not limited to cut-and-break
mining methods). In general, the tapered shape provides a versatile cutter head 22 that
permits a variety of cutting profiles while positioning the inertial member 90 as close to the
cutting bit 86 as practicable to improve the efficiency of the cutting operation.
[0039]              In other embodiments, the inertial member 90 may have a different shape or
position, depending on the tunnel dimensions, the geometry of the boom, and the optimum
effective mass.                  The inertial member 90 may include other configurations, such as a
                                                        8
10326140 1 (GHMatters) P99466.AU.1

rotating overhung mass 142 (illustrated in FIG. 2) that allows clearance in the cutting
process, or a plate shaped mass.
[0040]              Referring to FIG. 6, the exciter member 94 is positioned within body 130 and
particularly within the sleeve 138 of the inertial member 90. The exciter member 94 is
supported for rotation relative to the inertial member 90 by high-speed bearings 144. The
exciter member 94 is elongated and coupled to the first shaft 126 for rotation about the axis
of rotation 98. The exciter member 94 is a non-contact eccentric and includes at least one
lobe 134 that is eccentrically positioned with respect to the axis of rotation 98.
[0041]              The exciter member 94 is rotated by the first motor 102, and the rotation of the
exciter member 94 "excites" the inertial member 90 and the connected cutting bit 86 and
induces a desired oscillation in the inertial member 90 and cutting bit 86. As shown in FIG.
3A, the inertial member 90 defines a first mass center 132 that oscillates or orbits about the
combined center of mass 80 at a first effective radius. The exciter member 94 defines a
second mass center 136 that oscillates or orbits about the combined center of mass 80 at a
second effective radius. As shown, movement of the exciter member 94 causes the second
mass center 136 to orbit about the combined center of mass 80, thereby causing the first
mass center 132 to orbit about the combined center of mass 80.                    In the illustrated
embodiment, the second mass center 136 has a larger effective radius than the first mass
center 132.              The cutter head 22 moves in circular movement about a point 140.     Stated
another way, a reference line 146 extending between the cutting bit 86 and point 140 traces
a conical shape as the first mass center 132 oscillates, and the cutting bit 86 moves in a
closed path 148 having a dimension that is proportional to the eccentricity of the oscillating
motion induced on the inertial member 90. In the illustrated embodiment, the path 148 is
circular. The reference line 146 defines a radius of the cutting bit 86 from the point 140,
and the point 140 defines the apex of the conical shape while the cutting bit 86 moves along
the base of the conical shape.
[0042]              More specifically, the dimension of the path 148 is proportional to the mass of
the exciter member 94 and the eccentricity (i.e., axial offset) of the exciter member 94. The
                                                      9
10326140 1 (GHMatters) P99466.AU.1

dimension is also inversely proportional to the mass of the inertial member 90.                     For
example, in one embodiment the inertial member 90 has an effective mass of 1000 kg at the
cutter, while the exciter member 94 has an effective eccentric mass of 40 kg at the cutter
and an eccentricity (i.e., an amplitude of eccentric oscillation) of 50 mm. The resultant
oscillation of the inertial member 90 is proportional to the product of the mass and
eccentricity of the exciter member 94 divided by the mass of the inertial member 90;
therefore the excitation causes the inertial member of 1000 kg to oscillate or vibrate with an
amplitude of± 2 mm (i.e., the radius of the path 148 of the cutting bit 86 is 2 mm). In other
embodiments, the relative masses of the inertial member 90 and the exciter member 94 as
well as the eccentricity of the exciter member 94 can be modified to produce a desired
oscillation response in the inertial member 90.
[0043]              When the cutting bit 86 contacts mine wall, the wall exerts a reaction force on
the cutting bit 86 that resists the oscillating motion of the inertial member 90.                    To
compensate, the feed force is exerted on the cutter head 22 by the boom 18 to urge the
cutting bit 86 towards the wall. The oscillation of the inertial member 90 and the exciter
member 94 is controlled so that the inertial member 90 has a maximum velocity in the
direction of the cut when the cutting bit 86 engages the mine wall.
[0044]              The cutter head 22 directly secures together the inertial member 90 and the
cutting bit 86.                Unlike conventional oscillating disc cutters in which all of the dynamic
cutting forces are transmitted from a cutting bit and through a bearing arrangement into an
inertial mass, the cutter head 22 provides a direct connection between the cutting bit 86 and
the inertial member 90. This direct connection permits the inertial member 90 to absorb a
significant amount of the dynamic cutting force before the load is transmitted to the
bearings 110, 144, thereby reducing the load on the bearings 110, 144.                           In one
embodiment, the high-speed bearing 144 is subject to approximately 5% of the total
dynamic cutting forces. The bearings 110, 144 are also sealed from the rock cutting zone.
Furthermore, the cutter head 22 eliminates dynamic seals in the primary rock cutting zone
operating at high speed over large areas. As a result, it is possible to increase both the
frequency and the eccentricity of cutter head 22 while also improving the working life of
                                                          10
10326140 1 (GHMatters) P99466.AU.1

the cutter head 22. Therefore, the cutter head 22 improves the efficiency of the cutting
operation. The increased frequency and eccentricity permit the cutting bit 86 to exert more
dynamic power on the wall to break rock without requiring larger cutter components.
[0045]              In one embodiment, the frequency (i.e., rotational speed) and the mass of the
inertial member 90 as well as the feed force provided by the boom 18 are generally the
same as that of a conventional oscillating disc cutter, but the mass and eccentric radius of
the exciter member 94 are increased. The increased excitation increases inertial member 90
travel (i.e., oscillation amplitude) and results in greater impact energy for the rock cutting
process. In one embodiment, the impact energy is three to four times more than the impact
energy provided by a conventional oscillating disc cutter.
[0046]              Alternatively, a smaller cutter head 22 can be used to generate the same cutting
forces as a conventional cutter head, permitting a lower cost machine that can access and
operate in tightly constrained areas of the underground mine.                 For example, in one
embodiment, the inertial member 90 is sized with the same mass and oscillates at the same
frequency as a conventional oscillating disc cutter, but only requires half of the feed force
(i.e., the external force applied to the cutter head by the boom 18) to impart the same
amount of energy into the rock.
[0047]              FIGS. 1, 7, and 8 illustrate a method for cutting rock from the mine wall 26.
Although the method described below refers to the cutter head 22, it is understood that the
method may be performed using a cutter head having a different shape or disc cutter
configuration, such as a conventional oscillating disc cutter.             In one embodiment, the
perimeter of the mine wall 26 is first cut (i.e., a wall relief cut) to define a profile 150 (FIG.
1) of the mine wall 26. The profile 150 may be cut by multiple passes of the cutter head 22
in order to increase the depth to a desired level, such as the maximum practical cutting
depth of the cutter head 22. In one embodiment, the depth of the cut is in the range of
approximately 200 mm to approximately 400 mm. After the profile 150 is formed, the
cutter head 22 subsequently cuts multiple slots 154 into the mine wall 26, leaving uncut
rock sections 158 adjacent the slots 154. Cutting the slots 154 may require multiple passes
                                                      11
10326140 1 (GHMatters) P99466.AU.1

in order to cut the slots 154 to the desired depth. In the illustrated embodiment, the slots
154 are cut in a generally horizontal direction. In other embodiments, the slots 154 may be
cut vertically or at an angle across the mine wall 26 in order to facilitate fracturing. Also,
the terms "tall", "high", and "height" as used herein to describe this method generally refer
to a vertical dimension of the slots 154 and the uncut sections 158 as shown in the
embodiment of FIGS. 1, 7 and 8. Although the embodiment illustrated in these figures
shows the slots 154 and uncut sections 158 in a substantially horizontal orientation, it is
understood that the slots 154 and uncut sections 158 could be formed in a different
orientation, in which case other terms may be used to refer to the transverse dimension of
these features.
[0048]              As the cutter head 22 makes a final cutting pass through a slot 154, (e.g., as the
cutter head 22 cuts the slot 154 to a desired depth), the protruding (i.e., uncut) rock sections
158 above and below the slot 154 are undercut and overcut, respectively, to a maximum
allowable depth of the cutting bit 86. That is, a base of each side of the rock section 158 is
notched to create a fracture line adjacent the mine wall 26 (FIG. 7). The ends of the
protruding rock section 158 are similarly relieved during the perimeter cut. After forming
the initial notch 160, the cutter head 22 contacts the protruding rock section 158. The force
exerted on the cutter head 22 by the boom 18 and/or the vibration of the inertial member 90
causes the protruding rock section 158 to break away from the wall 26. Alternatively, the
mining machine 10 may include a breaker attachment (for example, mounted on a separate
boom from the cutter head) that is applied against the rock section 158 to break the rock
section 158 along the fracture line.
[0049]              Unlike conventional methods that require cutting virtually all of the rock on the
mine wall 26, the method described above permits the operator to selectively cut rock in
such a way to maximize the potential for rock fracturing, and subsequently breaking uncut
rock sections 158. Depending on the type of rock, the presence of shear planes, and the
size of the mine wall 26, the "cut-and-break" method described above can mine the rock
such that the ratio between the amount of rock that is broken from the wall 26 to the
amount of rock that is cut from the wall 26 exceeds 1:1. That is, the method requires
                                                     12
10326140 1 (GHMatters) P99466.AU.1

cutting less than half of the rock that is removed from the wall 26.                          The method
substantially reduces cutting time and energy consumption, and also reduces the wear on
the cutting bit 86 and other components of the cutter head 22. In some embodiments, the
method described above more than doubles the productivity in underground entry
development, when compared with conventional rock cutting processes.
[0050]              In one embodiment, the cutting bit 86 has a diameter of 400 mm and cuts a slot
154 that is nominally 400 mm tall and 250 mm deep, leaving uncut protruding rock
sections 158 that are 200 mm tall and 250 mm deep. The cutter velocity is approximately
100 mm per second and cuts a depth of 50 mm per pass. The mine wall 26 is generally
about 5 m wide by 4.8 m tall. The protruding sections 158 are broken from the mine wall
26 as described above. The cutting method according to this embodiment requires cutting
at least 25% less rock than conventional hard rock cutting methods.                     This configuration
(i.e., a wide cutting bit diameter and narrower uncut rock sections 158) may be particularly
useful for mining extremely hard, competent rock (i.e., rock into which unsupported
openings may be cut).
[0051]              In another embodiment, the cutting bit has a diameter of 250 mm and cuts a slot
154 that is nominally 250 mm tall and 250 mm deep, leaving protruding uncut rock
sections 158 that are generally 400 mm tall and 250 mm deep. The protruding sections 158
are then broken as described above.                    The cutting method according to this embodiment
requires cutting less than half of the rock than would be cut using conventional hard rock
cutting methods.                   This configuration (i.e., a narrower cutting bit diameter and relatively
wide uncut rock sections 158) may be particularly useful for mining hard rock with shear
planes and fractures, or rock that has medium strength.
[0052]              Furthermore, the cut-and-break method provides cuts or slots 154 that are
separated by uncut rock sections 158, permitting a mining machine 10 to incorporate
additional cutter heads 22 supported on additional booms 18 and operating simultaneously,
effectively doubling the cutting rate. In addition, each of the cutter heads 22 in a multiple
cutter head arrangement can operate toward one another, effectively counteracting the
                                                             13
10326140 1 (GHMatters) P99466.AU.1

majority of cutting-induced boom forces that are typically transmitted through the machine
10 and into mine floor or the surrounding rock mass. Also, an embodiment including two
cutter heads 22 supported on separate booms 18 can impart much larger forces on the
protruding rock sections 158, thereby increasing the allowable height of the protruding rock
section 158 to be broken. Each boom 18 can simultaneously impart loads from an undercut
and an overcut position. By maintaining separation between the centers of the booms 18,
the cutter heads 22 apply a torque on the rock in addition to exerting a direct force and
dynamic cutting action.
[0053]              FIG. 9 illustrates another embodiment in which the cutter head 22 includes an
arm 60 coupled to the mounting bracket 58 and supported by multiple hydraulic cylinders
72.        The illustrated embodiment includes four hydraulic cylinders 72a positioned at
approximately 90 degree intervals around the perimeter of the cutter head 22. The arm 60
includes a fifth cylinder 72b extending from the center of the support plate 70 to the
mounting bracket 58, and the cutter head 22 oscillates about a point 140 at the joint
between the cylinder 72b and the mounting bracket 58. Other embodiments may include
fewer or more hydraulic cylinders. The cylinders 72 are coupled to one or more hydraulic
accumulators (not shown) such that the cylinders 72 behave similar to the springs 78 to
react to the forces exerted on and by the cutter head 22. In addition, the hydraulic cylinders
72a can be actuated to pivot the cutter head 22 relative to the mounting bracket 58, and the
center cylinder 72b extends the cutter head 22 relative to the mounting bracket 58.
[0054]              The operation of the cylinders 72 provides omni-directional control of the cutter
head 22 in order to maintain a desired orientation of the cutter head 22 relative to the mine
wall 26 (i.e., the angle of attack). In addition, the cylinders 72 can more accurately sense
the force feedback from the cutter head 22, providing accurate measurement of the cutting
force exerted by the cutter head 22 and permitting the operator to more precisely control the
cutting force. An automated system controls the cutting force based on various factors,
such as oscillation frequency or speed, mass of the inertial member, and eccentricity of the
exciter member. In other embodiments, a different type of cutter head (including a cutter
                                                      14
10326140 1 (GHMatters) P99466.AU.1

head that does not include the exciter mass) may be coupled to the mounting bracket 58 by
the cylinders 72.
[0055]              FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate a cutter head 222 according to another embodiment.
The cutter head 22 is generally similar to the cutter head 22 described above with respect to
FIGS. 4-6, and similar features are identified by similar reference numbers, plus 200.
[0056]              As shown in FIGS. 10 and 11, the cutter head 222 includes a cutting bit 286, an
inertial member 290, an exciter member 294, and a motor 302 for driving the exciter
member 294. The inertial member includes a body 330 and a cap 332 coupled to an end of
the body 330. The cutting bit 286 generally has a ring or annular shape and includes a
cutting edge 288. The cutting bit 286 is coupled to an end of the cap 332 by a retaining
ring 336 (FIG. 10). A radial and thrust bearing plate 340 (FIG. 10) is positioned between
the cutting bit 286 and the end of the cap 332 to support the cutting bit 286 for rotation
relative to the cap 332. The bearing plate 340 supports the cutting bit 286 against radial
and axial loads. The exciter member 294 includes an eccentric mass 334 coupled to a shaft
326.         In the illustrated embodiment, the mass 334 has two lobes 334a, 334b that are
eccentrically positioned with respect to the axis of rotation 298. The shaft 326 is driven
about the axis 298 by the motor 302. The motor 302 is coupled to a support plate 270 of
the cutter head 222.
[0057]              In the embodiment of FIGS. 10 and 11, only the exciter member 294 is driven
by the motor 302; the cutter head 222 does not include an external motor to directly drive
the inertial member 290. However, the inertial member 290 is rotatably coupled to the
support plate 270 by a bearing 308, and therefore the inertial member 290 is freely
rotatable. In addition, the cutting bit 286 is freely rotatable relative to the inertial member
290 due to the bearing plate 340. The inertial member 290 rotates about the axis 298 due to
oscillation induced by the rotation of the exciter member 294. The cutting bit 286 rotates at
a relatively low speed due to the reaction forces exerted on the cutting bit 286 by the rock
of the mine wall. In one embodiment, the cutting bit has a diameter of 400 mm and rotates
at a speed of approximately 30 RPM.
                                                      15
10326140 1 (GHMatters) P99466.AU.1

 [0058]             In another embodiment, shown in FIG. 12, the lobes 334a, 334b of the exciter
member 294 rotate independently of one another. The first motor 302 engages a first gear
316 that is coupled to a first or outer shaft 326a. The first lobe 334a is coupled to the outer
shaft 326a, and operation of the first motor 302 drives the first lobe 334a to rotate about the
axis 298. The cutter head 222 also includes a second motor 304 engaging a second gear
320 that is coupled to a second or inner shaft 326b. The second lobe 334b is coupled to the
inner shaft 326b, and operation of the second motor 306 drives the second lobe 334b to
rotate about the axis 298. The relationship between the lobes 334a, 334b can be tuned to
provide a desired moment of inertia. For example, the lobes 334a, 334b can be moved to
diametrically opposed positions (i.e., the angle between the lobes 334a, 334b is 180
degrees). If the lobes 334a, 334b have the same mass, this configuration effectively cancels
or "turns off' the excitation. When the lobes 334a, 334b are positioned in the same relative
position about the shaft 326, the maximum power is delivered to the inertial member 290.
 [0059]             In other embodiments, the lobes 334a, 334b are counter-rotating such that the
lobe 334a rotates about the axis 298 in a first direction while the other lobe 334b rotates
about the axis 298 in an opposite second direction. When the counter-rotating lobes 334a,
334b have the same mass, the cutter head 222 produces a jackhammer-like action on the
cutting edge of the cutting bit.           Due to the configuration of the cutting bit 286, the
jackhammer effect acts at a 90 degree angle. Alternatively, if the lobes 334a, 334b have
different masses, the counter-rotating exciter member 294 will drive the edge of the cutting
bit 286 along a path 148 (FIG. 3A) having an elliptical shape.
 [0060]             As shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, the cutter head 222 includes an internal fluid flow
path 370 for a cutting clearance system. The flow path 370 is in fluid communication with
a fluid source, such as a pump (not shown). The flow path 370 includes a first passage 374
extending through the shaft 326 of the exciter member 294 and multiple second passages
378 extending through the cutting bit 286. In the illustrated embodiment, the first passage
374 extends into a ring carrier of the cutting bit 286 and is in fluid communication with the
second passage 378. The second passages 378 extend radially (i.e., in a direction that is
non-parallel to the axis 298) from the first passage 374 through the cutting bit 286 to
                                                    16
10326140 1 (GHMatters) P99466.AU.1

nozzles 382 positioned along the perimeter of the cutting bit 286 between the cutting tips
386 (FIG. 14). The clearance fluid (e.g., water) is pumped through the first passage 374
and through the second passage 378 before being discharged through the nozzles 382. The
fluid discharge path is aligned with the primary cutting direction.
[00611                The cutting clearance system eliminates hoses or other fluid conduit near the
cutting interface. Furthermore, the cutting clearance system does not require additional
moving parts inside the cutter head 222, since the first passage 374 is fixed and statically
sealed to the cutting bit 286. In addition, embedding the nozzles 382 in the cutting bit 286
reduces the potential for damage to the fluid circuit or blockage caused by cuttings or
debris.
[0062]              Unlike conventional oscillating disc cutter systems that merely allow for
adjusting the motion or speed of the disc cutter, the mining machine 10 monitors certain
characteristics of the cutter head 22 and incorporates feedback from the cutting interface to
adjust certain parameters.            The mining machine 10 detects changes in conditions of the
cutting operation (e.g., a change in rock hardness or density) and incorporates the sensed
information into a feedback control loop to modify the operating parameters of the cutter
head 22 and optimize cutting performance.               Such operating parameters may include the
depth of cut, the angle of attack of the cutting bit 86 relative to the mine wall, the
eccentricity of the exciter member 94, the oscillation frequency of the exciter member 94.
Other factors (such as the diameter of the cutting bit 86, the geometry of the cutting edge
and cutting tips, and the cutting clearance) may be modified through manual adjustments.
[0063]              The cutting effectiveness of the cutter head 22 at least partially depends on the
velocity of the inertial member 90 in the direction of cutting at the moment the cutting bit
86 impacts the mine wall, and on the frequency of the impacts between the cutting bit 86
and the mine wall. The velocity and frequency are controlled to optimize the velocity and
the frequency of the impact of the cutter head 22 with the mine wall. The velocity and
frequency can be controlled through various parameters, such as the effective mass of the
                                                      17
10326140 1 (GHMatters) P99466.AU.1

exciter member 94, operating frequency of the exciter member 94, the stiffness of the cutter
head 22 coupling member, the feed force from the boom, etc.
[0064]              Referring to FIG. 9A, as the cutter head 22 oscillates around the center of mass,
the cutting bit 86 moves in a generally circular or elliptical motion to engage the mine wall.
The control system synchronizes the oscillation of the inertial member 90 with the motion
of the cutting bit 86 such that the cutting bit 86 engages the mine wall when the momentum
of the inertial member 90 is directed substantially into the mine wall. This timing between
the cutting bit's engagement in the wall and the motion of the inertial member 90
maximizes the velocity of the inertial member 90 in the direction of the wall, thereby
maximizing the kinetic energy imparted to the wall by the cutter head 22.                    In other
embodiments, the cutting bit 86 may trace a different shaped path, the bit 86 may engage
the wall at a different position along the path 148, and/or the oscillation of the inertial
member 90 may be synchronized to deliver maximum velocity at a different position along
the path 148.
[0065]              In one embodiment, the control system adjusts the force exerted by the boom 18
and varies the oscillation frequency of the exciter member 94 in order to increase or
decrease cutting energy. These modifications optimize productivity by increasing cutting
velocity when possible. In addition, the condition of the tool may be monitored to detect
changes in productivity and feed force as the cutting bit becomes blunt.
[0066]              In another embodiment, the cutter head 22 is controlled by directly sensing an
indicator of the force exerted by the cutting bit 86 on the mine wall 26 in real-time. For
example, the control system may include a load cell (e.g., a multi-axis strain gauge; not
shown) positioned on the cutting bit 86 to detect the stress on the cutting bit. The cutting
force is calculated based on the measured stress.              In addition, the control system may
include sensors, such as infrared sensors, for monitoring the temperature at the cutting
interface.            The load sensor and thermal sensor provide accurate measurements of the
performance of the cutter head 22, permitting accurate adjustment of certain parameters
(such as cutting speed or feed force) in order to optimize the closed loop control and
                                                      18
10326140 1 (GHMatters) P99466.AU.1

optimize the power provided at the cutting interface. In another embodiment, the control
system includes measuring a cutting speed of the cutting bit 86 with non-contact sensors
and varying a feed rate of the cutter head 22 to optimize a cutting rate. Other embodiments
can incorporate other adaptive features to optimize performance of the cutter head 22.
[0067]              In general, increasing the power delivered by a cutter head 22 to the mine wall
26 generally results in a larger amount of rock cut from the wall 26. The power delivered
by the cutter head 22 varies depending on the rotation speed of the cutting bit 86, the
eccentricity of the cutting bit 86, the mass of the inertial member 90 and the exciter
member 94, and the cutting feed force.                In one embodiment, one or more of these
parameters remain fixed due to the inherent characteristics of the mining machine 10 and
the remaining parameters are dynamically controlled to continuously monitor and optimize
the power output of the cutter head 22. For example, a selected parameter may be varied
slightly and the system detects whether the variation increases the cutting rate. If so, the
selected parameter is adjusted further in the same direction. Otherwise, the parameter is
adjusted in the opposite direction and any change in the cutting rate is monitored. The
process is frequently repeated to ensure that the machine is generating maximum power
output.
[0068]              In another embodiment, the control system provides automated position and
force control of the boom 18. The cutter head consistently operates at maximum capacity
and at an optimum setting. In addition, the magnitude and direction of a load on the
machine is known and controlled. The cutting force is the same for different applications,
conditions, rock types etc.,              but the production rate varies depending on these
parameters. Because the system is optimally tuned for substantially all conditions, it is not
necessary to change the parameters if the mine conditions change (e.g., if the rock density
changes). The cutting operation can be slowed down if required by reducing the oscillation
speed of the cutting bit 86 and/or the exciter mass 94.
[0069]              In other embodiments, the mining machine includes multiple cutter heads 22
coupled to a common boom 18. Each cutter head 22 is force-controlled as described above,
                                                     19
10326140 1 (GHMatters) P99466.AU.1

while the common boom 18 is position-controlled. Each cutter head 22 constitutes a single
cutter system with the position-controlled common boom 18 as described above; however,
each cutter system is linked via the common boom 18.                  The multiple cutter system is
controlled to progress through the mine wall 26 at a rate that is determined by the least
productive individual cutter head 22 (i.e., the master cutter head).            The more productive
cutter head systems (i.e., slave cutter heads) are de-tuned to match the rate of the master
cutter head in order to prevent the more productive systems from overrunning the position
controlled boom 18. In one embodiment, the slave cutter(s) are de-tuned by altering one of
the operating parameters, (e.g., the rotation speed of the cutting bit). For example, a master
cutter head operates at nominal speed, while the slave cutter heads operate at speeds slower
than the rated value. If a slave cutter head begins to lag, its speed is increased until its
cutting performance matches the master cutter. The parameter(s) of the master cutter head
are continuously varied to maximize its power output as described above with respect to the
single cutter head system.
[0070]              If the speed of one of the slave cutter heads is adjusted to exceed the nominal
cutting speed due to, for example, a change in cutting conditions, the slave cutter is
automatically designated the master cutter head and the previous master cutter head
becomes a slave. Therefore, the poorest performing cutter head is continuously adjusted to
achieve its maximum possible performance and the other cutter heads are controlled to
match this performance, thereby achieving maximum performance of the combined cutter
head assembly. In one embodiment, a significant discrepancy in the relative performance
of the cutter heads indicates either differing rock characteristics or cutter condition
problems.
[0071]              Thus, the invention provides, among other things, a cutter head for a mining
machine. Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain
preferred embodiments, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of
one or more independent aspects of the invention as described.                 Various features and
