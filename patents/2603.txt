                           ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
       A chopping module is provided that is designed for grasping and pulling
plants by pushing them between a rotating knife set and chopping them into billets,
wherein the rotating knife set has a cylindrical form with its length divided into at
least two sections, wherein various cutting segments are distributed, each one
extending itself in each lengthwise section formed between the discs wherein the
segments of a section are lagged or are not lengthwise aligned to those of the
adjacent section. This module is advantageous in that it allows for considerable
reduction of the cutting forces or pressure, and consequently allows for smooth
operation and considerably increased working life of the module.

                            CHOPPING MODULE
Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a module for chopping plants from different
crops. The module is an improvement over an independent device driven by
hydraulic motors. Consequently, the module has all the features necessary
for mounting in various harvesters, including combine harvesters with the
ability to cut, harvest, and chop various crops or a single specific crop which,
for any reason, should be chopped soon after harvesting, for example, sugar
cane, wherein the harvested material is cut into billets. The improvement
relates to a module having a cylinder-shaped rotating set with various lengthwise
knives located at its external diameter, acting jointly with a counter knife, forming a
modular cutting unit used to chop plants from different cultures, such as: cotton,
sorghum, forage sorghum, sugar cane, cane for energy, cane for forage and others.
Background of the Invention
The present application is based on a prior cutting module as described below that
was defined by a cylinder with various lengthwise cutting knifes, wherein each one
of them has the cutting wire extended throughout the length of the cylinder, and
thus, each knife also passes throughout the length of the counter knife, wherein the
cut is performed by shearing and, at the same time, by the penetration of the cutting
wire of each knife.    Performed assays have shown that this module could be
improved so to reduce cutting "forces" and also reduce the impact between each
cutting knife and the counter knife.
There are currently a wide variety of devices used to cut or chop different plants.
Some of these devices are independent machines, while others are integrated into
different harvesters,   as taught, for example, by the following documents:

All these documents provide a continuous form of cutting, i.e. on one side, a plant is
pulled inside the device and, subsequently, a rotating blade assembly cuts the plant
into segments which are thrown outside, on the opposite side of the inlet of the
device.
Objects of the Invention
 The first object of the invention is to provide an improved module which has
 advantages over the prior module as described herein. In the improved module of
 the present invention, the inventors keep the counter knife as in the prior module,
 but the cutting knives are located in lengthwise lagged segments, i. e. each cutting
 knife is defined by at least two lengthwise segments, lagged to each other, so that,
while cutting (during rotation), each knife segment reaches a counter knife
 extension and the following extension is only reached by the following segment
 after the first one has already made the cut, and so on. With this embodiment, the
 set allows for considerable reduction of the cutting forces or pressure, and
 consequently allows for smooth operation and considerably increases the working
 life of the set. The present invention also provides a chopping module which can
 be easily mounted onto a harvester and which provides advantages not found in
 conventional harvesters.

Detailed Description of the Invention
In a prior embodiment of the module of the present invention, which is illustrated in
the drawing figures and the details below, more particularly FIGS. 1 to 6, a
prior art chopping module is shown which is improved upon herein by virtue
of the present invention of the improved chopping module as described
further below.       The prior module comprised a parallelepiped box-shaped
body (1), with three open sides, the first one configuring a front inlet (2) for
the plant to be chopped, the second one configuring a rear outlet (3) for the
chopped plant, and the third one configuring a lower outlet (4) for residues.
Adjacent to the front inlet (2), there are two crosswise pairs of rotating rollers
for pulling the plants to be chopped, a lower pair of stationary rollers (5a) and
an upper pair of floating rollers (5b).
                                            6

Adjacent to the lower pair of stationary rollers (5a) and the upper pair of
floating rollers (5b), a fixed shearbar (6) is mounted crosswise, aligned
parallel to the lower pair of stationary rollers (5a), wherein, a passageway (7)
for the plants to be chopped is formed between the lower pair of stationary
rollers (5a) and the upper pair of floating rollers (5b). After the fixed shearbar
(6), the passageway (7) has an extension in the form of a slide (8) sloping
downwards to the rear outlet (3) for the chopped plants; and a crosswise
rotating blade assembly (9), located above the slide (8) adjacent to the fixed
shearbar                                                                       (6).
FIGS. 7, 8 and 9 show in detail the parallelepiped box-shaped body (1),
showing that it comprises a metal tube base forming a frame (10) which
outlines the lower outlet (4) for residues and forms a support for a first side
panel (11) and a second side panel (12), both with contouring flaps (13) and
reinforcement ribs (14) on the outside. On the inside, the side panels (11)
and (12) are interconnected by a front metal crossbeam (15), and upper and
rear metal crossbeams (16), wherein the front metal crossbeam (15), the
frame (10), and the side panels (11) and (12) limit the front inlet (2) for
harvested plants to be chopped. The upper metal crossbeam (16) is placed
over the upper portion and the rear metal crossbeam (16) is placed on the
rear portion, the latter limiting the rear outlet (3). The upper and rear metal
crossbeams (16) receive cover panels (17). On the upper portion, the cover
panels (17) define two planes, a horizontal and a sloped plane, wherein, on
that portion, side panels (11)        and (12)     have an ordinary trapezoid
configuration.
The first side panel (11)     includes a first opening (18) with a cover (19),
aligned with a rectangular opening (22) on the second side panel (12). The
first side panel (11)     also includes circular openings (20), and oblong
                                           7

openings (21)     aligned to respective circular openings (20) and oblong
openings (21) equally positioned on the second side panel (12). The circular
openings (20) constituting fixing points for the respective edges of the lower
pair of stationary rollers (5a), the oblong openings (21) constituting fixing
points for the respective edges of the upper pair of floating rollers (5b), and
the first opening (18) and the rectangular opening (22) constituting fixing
points of the fixed shearbar (6).
[0042] The box-shaped body (1) also includes a complementary structure
(23) located at a front portion. The complementary structure (23) is formed by
a frame on each side, each one formed by a vertical tube (24) on the outside
of the box-shaped body (1), next to the front edge of the respective side
panels (11) and (12), the vertical tubes (24) interlinked to horizontal tubes in
a square (25). The vertical tubes (24) also constitute reinforcements for
positioning bushings (26) with rotating support for the edges of a round bar
(27) located above the front metal crossbeam (15). The round bar (27)
constitutes a point for coupling the module to the respective parts of a
harvester. The frame (10) also distributes lower plate portions (28) and rear
plate portions (29) forming additional fixing points.
FIGS. 10, 11 and 12 show in detail one of the lower pair of stationary rollers
(5a), which is formed by a tube (30) which, includes internal flanges (31) at
its edges, and radially distributes jaws in the form of toothed bands (32)
along its circumference. The two edges of each of the lower pair of stationary
rollers (5a) are equally coupled to identical hydraulic actuators (33), each one
formed by a cylindrical hub (34), fittable to the respective circular openings
(20), wherein they are fixed by its flanges (35) and respective reinforcements
(36). Inside the cylindrical hub (34), a hydraulic motor (37) is embedded and
fixed. The hydraulic motor (37) has its driven shaft (38) turned inwards and
                                          8

crossing the bottom of the cylindrical hub (34), after which it receives a bound
bushing (39). The bound bushing (39) engages with a flanged bushing (40)
fixed to a roller disc (41) which, includes an abutment ring (42), and is also
fixed to the internal diameter of the tube (30) at an appropriate depth for the
respective portion of the cylindrical hub (34) to be embedded inside the tube
(30). Therefore, we can observe that hydraulic actuators (33) at both ends of
the lower pair of stationary rollers (5a) allows the lower pair of stationary
rollers (5a) to be turned firmly and ensures equal pulling forces along the
lengths of the lower pair of stationary rollers (5a), thus avoiding fatigue at
their edges and consequently also enhancing the operation of the toothed
bands                                                                       (32).
FIGS. 13, 14 and 15 show in detail one of the upper pair of floating rollers
(5b), which are similar to the lower pair of stationary rollers (5a), except for
the means of fixing their edges, which is performed in a floating way in the
oblong openings (21). The means of fixing the upper pair of floating rollers
(5b) thus comprising, at each edge, a drop-shaped arm plate (43) having a
more acute side with a first drop-shaped arm plate hole (44) positioned
between roller reinforcements (45). The respective edge of a fixed tube (46)
and respective      internal bushings    (47) are   fixed between      the  roller
reinforcements (45), the latter ones having rotatory engagement for the
edges of end pins (48). The opposed edges of end pins (48) have fixing
plates (49) fixed to the respective side panels (11) and (12). Said plate arms
(43) are close to the internal part of said side panel (11) and (12), wherein
said plate arms (43) have a second drop-shaped arm plate hole (50) which,
is aligned to the oblong openings (21), and receives the cylindrical hubs (34).
The flanges (35) of the cylindrical hubs (34) are fixed to the drop-shaped
plate arms (43). Consequently, the edges of each of the upper pair of floating
rollers (5b) are free to move alongside the oblong openings (21), where they
                                          9

cross               said            cylindrical           hubs              (34).
With this prior embodiment, the height of the passageway (7) formed
between the lower pair of stationary rollers (5a) and the upper pair of floating
rollers (5b) is self-adjusted or automatically adjusted according to the volume
of plants which is caught and pulled inside the machine. Obviously, said
effect is provided by the floating assembly of the upper pair of floating rollers
(5b).
FIGS. 16 and 17 show in detail the arrangement of the fixed shearbar (6),
wherein we verify that it is formed by a substantially box-shaped structure
with rectangular cross section defined by two L-shaped profiles, wherein a
first L-shaped profile (51a) and a second L-shaped profile (51b) are fixed to
each other in an opposed way around internal plates (51c). The lower flap of
the second L-shaped profile (51b) distributes access openings (51d) between
the internal plates (51c). The upper rear apex of the box-shaped structure is
completed by an angle bracket (52a). The angle bracket (52a) forms a
structural complement to join both L-shaped profiles (51a) and (51b) and
configures a fixing plane (53a) over one of its flaps for the fixed shearbar.
The fixing plane (53a) and the angle bracket (52a) distribute rows of circular
fixing holes (53b) and oblong fixing holes (52b). A series of small fixing plates
(55) are positioned beneath the angle bracket (52a). Each small fixing plate
(55) is the length of the distance between two adjacent circular fixing holes
(53b) with a hole at each end that aligns with a circular fixing hole (53b) and
an oblong fixing hole (52b). Shearbar screws (54a) are inserted through the
circular fixing holes (53b) in the fixing plane (53a), the oblong fixing holes
(52b) in the angle bracket (52a), and through the holes in the small fixing
plates and are secured with shearbar nuts (54b).
                                         10

FIGS. 18 to 24 show in detail the rotating blade assembly (9), formed by a
tubular hub (56). The edges of the tubular hub (56) connect to an internal
flange (57) on each side. A first shaft (58) is fixed to one internal flange (57)
and a second shaft (59) is fixed to the other internal flange (57). The first
shaft (58) is secured to the first side panel (11) through a first blade assembly
hole (60) in the first side panel (11). The second shaft (59) is secured to the
second side panel (12) through a second blade assembly hole (61) in the
second side panel (12). The first blade assembly hole (60) is reinforced by a
first circular reinforcement (63). The second blade assembly hole (61) is
reinforced by a third circular reinforcement (63') and a second circular
reinforcement (62). Each of the shafts (58) and (59) pass through a shaft
housing (64) for shaft bearings (65) and elastic sealing rings (66), which is
sealed by a cap (67). The first shaft (58) has a fitting (68) for coupling a
driven shaft (69) of a hydraulic motor (70). The second shaft (59) receives a
flanged constituent (71) constituting fixation means for a stirring wheel (72)
which, is embedded in a circular protective cover (73) assembled jointly with
hinges (74) fixed to the second circular reinforcement (62).
Further, with reference to the prior module, and referring to FIGS. 24 to 27,
the edges of the tubular hub (56) are also fitted and fixed into central holes
(75) of a first disc and a second disc (76) on the edges of the tubular hub (56)
There is also a third disc (77) on the middle section of the tubular hub (56).
Curved plates (78) and arched plates (79) are radially positioned along the
tubular hub (56), wherein the curved plates are perpendicular to the discs
(76) and (77) and the arched plates are parallel to the discs (76) and (77).
The curved plates (78) have short straight edges (80), wherein a blade holder
(81) is welded. The blade holder (81) has a recess (82) facing outward from
the curved plates (78). Fastening strips (83) are fixed by a row of screws (84)
to the recess (82), forming a house for blade segments (85). The blade
                                          11

segments (85) include various coincident slots (86) for the row of screws
(84). The outward edges of the blade segments (85) are sharpened on a
bevel, forming a first cutting edge (87). The blade holder (81)               and the
fastening strip (83) are also sharpened on a bevel to form a second cutting
edge (88) on the blade holder (81) and a third cutting edge (89) on the
fastening strip (83). The cutting edges (87), (88), and (89) are inversely
combined to form a strong cutting front. As shown by FIGS. 27 and 28, the
strong cutting front passes next to the fixed shearbar (6), and the plants
passing through said parts are consequently cut with precision and efficiency.
Finally, with reference to the prior module, and referring to FIG. 28, the
cutting process occurs in synchronism with the pulling rollers (5a-5b) and the
displacement of the cut billets rearwards. Accordingly, the rollers (5a) and
(5b) grasp the plants to be cut and displace them rearwards, pushing them
along the passageway (7) and between the fixed shearbar (6) and the
rotating blade assembly (9). At this point, plants are cut and, simultaneously,
the curved plates (78) push the cut billets onto the slide (8), throwing the cut
billets to the rear outlet (3) establishing a continuous process. Residues,
such as earth and other particles released from the plants fall freely through
the                        lower                         outlet                    (4).
Applicant has now improved upon the prior module as discussed above and shown
in drawing figures 1-28 by providing a new module which has the improvements as
shown in particular in drawing figures 29-31 and their details as provided herein.
The chopping module of the present invention comprises, as was shown in the prior
embodiment, in particular FIGS. 1-4:
-      an ordinarily parallelepiped box-shaped body (1), with three open sides, the
first one forming a front inlet (2) of the plant to be chopped, the second one forming
a rear outlet (3) for the chopped plant, and the third one forming a lower outlet (4)
                                              12

for residues;
-      soon after the inlet opening (2), two crosswise pairs of traction rotating rollers
for the plants to be chopped are located, being one lower pair of idler rollers (5a)
and an upper pair of floating rollers (5b);
-      after the set of rollers (5a) and (5b) is assembled crosswise, the fixed counter
knife set (6), which upper side is aligned to the diameters of the lower idler rollers
(5a), forms a passageway (7) for the plants to be chopped between those and the
upper floating rollers (5b) and, after the fixed counter knife (6), that passageway
continues itself as a ramp (8) sloping downwards towards the outlet (3) for the
chopped plants; and
-      a crosswise rotating knife set (9), located above the ramp (7) and adjacent to
the fixed counter knife (6).
The modifications of the present chopping module are shown in particular in FIGS.
29 to 31.     The drawing figures 29-31 show the rotating cutting set (9), wherein
despite having been modified, the present invention still comprises the same
constituents of the prior module, starting by the tubular center (56) having its edges
with axis tips (58) and (59) with bearings on the sides of the box (1), and the edges
of the tubular center (56) have discs (76), between which another identical disc (77)
is repeated at least once, forming at least two lengthwise sections (90), wherein
each section forms a structure for various parts of curved and radially located plates
(78) and (79), all of which with their edges aligned to the external diameter of the
discs (76) and (77), where they receive cutting segments (91) which do not extend
themselves throughout the length of the set, but, as in the main application, they are
equally defined by blade carriers (81), recesses (82) and pressing rulers (83) fixed
by rows of screws (84), forming, between the latter and the first one (81), housing
for cutting blade segments (85).
In the improved version as described and illustrated in this application, the present
                                              13

invention includes features wherein each cutting segment (91) is extending itself to
each lengthwise section (90) formed between the discs (76) and (77), wherein the
segments (91) of a section (90) are lagged or are not aligned lengthwise to those of
the adjacent section.
As can be observed in the figures, lengthwise cutting segments (91) for each
section (90) are lagged to each other, so that, while cutting (rotation), each cutting
segment (91) reaches a respective length of the counter knife (6) and the following
extension is only reached by the following segment after the first one has already
made the cut, and so on. With this embodiment, the set allows for considerable
reduction in cutting forces or pressure, consequently allowing for smooth operation
and considerably increasing the speed and the working life of the set.
