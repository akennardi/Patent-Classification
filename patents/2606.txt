    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]      The present invention relates to systems and methods for generating data files
   and/or for operating a case management system. Embodiments of the invention have
   been particularly developed for modifying operation of existing case management
   system (for example a case management system including accounting software
   package) to integrate with services provided by a foreign exchange agent. While some
   embodiments will be described herein with particular reference to that application, it
   will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to such a field of use, and is
   applicable in broader contexts.
   BACKGROUND
[0002]      Any discussion of the background art throughout the specification should in no
   way be considered as an admission that such art is widely known or forms part of
   common general knowledge in the field.
[0003] It is common for a service provider to procure services from a foreign supplier in
   the course of servicing a local client. In such situations, the foreign supplier issues a
   foreign currency invoice ("foreign" by reference to the local currency of the service
   provider) to the service provider, who is responsible for payment of that invoice. The
   service provider seeks to obtain payment from the local client to cover the cost of
   paying the foreign supplier's invoice. For example, in the context of patent attorney
   firms, a local firm engages a foreign firm to assist a local client in obtaining patent
   protection in a foreign jurisdiction.    The foreign firm invoices the local firm for
   services, and the local firm issues an invoice to the local client for the local firm's
   services plus a disbursement corresponding to the foreign firm's invoice. This general
   practice requires the management of both Accounts Payable (AP) entries and Work in
   Progress (WIP) entries. Various case management systems have been developed to
   assist, such as Inprotech by CPA Global.

                                                    2
[0004] Complications arise in the sense that foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, and
    there is a delay between the issuance and payment of invoices. Importantly, there are
    delays between the service provider issuing a local currency invoice to the local client,
    the payment of that invoice by the local client, and the payment of the foreign invoice.
    Managing these complications is by no means trivial, particularly in the context of
    integration with a complex case management system.

    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0053]      Described herein systems and methods for generating data files and/or for
    operating a case management system.         Embodiments of the invention have been
   particularly developed for modifying operation of existing case management system
    (for example a case management system including accounting software package) to
    integrate with services provided by a foreign exchange agent. As context, a foreign
    currency invoice is issued to a service provider. This invoice relates to a client matter
    of the    service   provider.    The    present  embodiments     are   directed  towards
    methodologies/technologies for enabling the service provider to engage a foreign
    exchange agent to manage issues associated with foreign currency fluctuations, and
    integrate such an approach with an existing case management system.
    OVERVIEW
[0054]      FIG. 1 illustrates a method 100 according to one embodiment.         Method 100
   provides a general overview of an approach for managing foreign currency invoices.
    Embodiments of the present technology include aspects of this general methodology,
    along with hardware/software      configured to implement aspects of this general
    methodology. Method 100 includes an invoice generation phase 101, receipt/exchange
    rate management phase 102, system update phase 103, and invoice settlement
   procedure 104. Various exemplary aspects of method 100 are detailed in FIG. 2, FIG.
    3A, FIG. 3B and FIG. 4.
[0055]      FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B provide context to the parties involved in method 100,
    with FIG. 5A showing a conventional arrangement (in absence of method 100) and
    FIG. 5B showing arrangements based on an exemplary implementation of method 100.
    The parties are a supplier 500, service provider 501, client 502, and foreign exchange
    agent 503 (noting that agent 503 is not present in the conventional arrangement of FIG.
    5A).
[0056]      FIG. 6 schematically illustrates a service provider system according to one
    embodiment. This system includes one or more computer processors coupled to one or
    more memory modules. The memory module/modules carry computer executable code
    (also referred to as software instructions) executable via the one or more processors,

                                                   8
    thereby to cause the performance of various computer implementable methods
    described herein.
    GENERAL METHODOLOGY
[0057]      Referring initially to FIG. 1, method 100 commences with phase 101, which
    represents an invoice generation procedure. Phase 101 is performed by a supplier 500,
    who raises an invoice in a desired supplier currency (for example the supplier's local
    currency). This is referred to as a "foreign" currency for the present purposes. The
    debtor for the invoice raised at phase 100 is a service provider 501. That is, service
   provider 501 is ultimately responsible for payment of the invoice. The relevant invoice
    relates to a client matter of the service provider. Accordingly, service provider 501
    will seek payment from a client 502 associated with that client matter thereby to cover
    the costs of paying the invoice of supplier 500.
[0058]      As additional context, referring to FIG. 5A, a conventional approach is for
    supplier 500 to issue an invoice in foreign currency to service provider 501. Service
   provider 501 is ultimately responsible for paying that invoice in foreign currency.
    Service provider 501 issues a local currency invoice to client 502, this invoice
    including a component intended to cover the cost of making the foreign currency
   payment to supplier 500.       The client settles the local currency invoice with a local
    currency payment. It will be appreciated that the component of the local currency
    invoice intended to cover the cost of making the foreign currency payment to supplier
    500 remains constant, whereas , due to currency fluctuations over time, the actual cost
    of making the foreign currency payment to supplier 500 varies over time.
[0059]      Method 100 is, at least in some embodiments, implemented based on the
    relationships shown in FIG. 5B, which include a further party in the form of a foreign
    exchange agent 503. Foreign exchange agent 503 provides a foreign currency payment
    service which includes: (i) making a foreign currency payment in settlement of the
    supplier's invoice; and (ii) assisting service provider 501 manage complications
    associated with exchange rate fluctuations.
[0060]      Phase 102 includes an invoice receipt/exchange rate management procedure.
    This includes interactions between service provider 501 and foreign exchange agent
    503. This is discussed in additional detail further below. At a general level, the core

                                                9
   concept is that service provider 502 provides to agent 503 data indicative of the foreign
   currency invoice, and in response agent 503 provides to service provider 501 data
   indicative of a local-currency fixed payment amount.          This local-currency fixed
   payment amount is fixed amount payable by service provider 501 to foreign exchange
   agent 503 at a future date in consideration for settlement of the foreign currency
   invoice.
[0061]     Phase 103 includes a case management system update procedure. This is in
   some embodiments an automated process conducted using software modules operable
   in a computer system of service provider 501. This is discussed in additional detail
   further below.
[0062]     Method 100 concludes with an invoice settlement procedure at phase 104. In
   the present embodiment phase 104 includes the making of a foreign currency payment
   by agent 503 to supplier 500 on behalf of service provider 501.
   EXCHANGE RATE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE
[0063]     As noted above, phase 102 includes an exchange rate management procedure.
   One embodiment of phase 102 is illustrated in FIG. 2.
[0064]     Block 201 represents a process whereby an invoice is received by service
   provider 501 (being a foreign currency invoice from supplier 500 relating to a client
   matter of client 502). Block 202 represents a process including providing to agent 503
   data indicative of the invoice. At a minimum, this data includes the foreign currency
   total of the invoice.   The data may also include details such as a service provider
   reference (for example a reference number indicative of the relevant client matter), a
   date at which the invoice is to be paid, and so on. In some cases this process included
   providing a copy of the invoice to agent 503.
[0065]     Block 203 represents a process performed by agent 503 including determining a
   local-currency fixed payment amount. The local-currency fixed payment amount is a
   fixed amount (in the local currency of the service provider) payable by service provider
   501 to foreign exchange agent 503 at a future date in consideration for settlement of the
   foreign currency invoice.    The manner by which the local-currency fixed payment
   amount is defined varies between implementations, based on internal policies of agent
   503.   At a broad level, agent 503 is able to use data indicative of exchange rate

                                                  10
   fluctuations and other inputs thereby to make a prediction of how exchange rates will
   vary over a given period. The agent then makes a risk determination so as to provide a
   fixed amount, and in doing so take on risks associated with currency fluctuations
   between the date on which the fixed amount is set and the date on which the invoice is
   finally paid. It will be appreciated that agent 503 has potential to make a currency gain
   or loss.
[0066]      Block 204 represents a process performed by agent 503 including providing to
   service provider 501 data indicative of the local-currency fixed payment amount. The
   manner by which this data is provided (and hence received by service provider 501)
   varies between embodiments, as discussed further below.
[0067]      At a general level, phase 102 may include engaging a foreign exchange agent
   (such as Travelex or the like) to provide fixed local currency prices for future payment
   of foreign currency invoices. For example, consider a foreign invoice for US$X issued
   to an Australian service provider. The foreign exchange agent agrees at a date A to a
   fixed price of AU$Y to be paid by the service provider in consideration for payment by
   the agent of the US$X invoice by date B.         In doing so, the foreign exchange agent
   provides payment predictability of cost to the service provider.
    CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROCEDURE
[0068] Upon receipt of data indicative of the local-currency fixed payment amount, phase
    103 includes a procedure for updating a case management system.                  In some
   embodiments the case management system is an Intellectual Property (IP) case
   management system, such as Inprotech (by CPA Global). Examples of phase 103 are
   provided by FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B.               These methods are optionally computer
   implemented on the basis of software instructions executed on one or more processors
   of a computer system.
[0069]      Referring initially to FIG. 3, block 301 represents a process including receiving
   data indicative of a local-currency fixed payment amount. This data may be provided
   in substantially any form, including manual input, receipt of an electronic file, and so
   on. The local-currency fixed payment amount may include, or be associated with,
   other items of data. For example, in some embodiments these include the likes of a
   date on which agent 503 proposes to finalize the invoice payment (for example by

                                                  11
    making a foreign currency transfer), an internal reference to allow service provider 501
    to identify the client matter to which the amount is attributable (and the relevant client
    502), and so on. In any case, the local-currency fixed payment amount is received in a
    computer system, which triggers a process represented by block 302.
[0070]      The process of block 302 includes defining a client charge in relation to the
    client matter.   This client charge has a client charge value derived from the local
    currency fixed payment amount. The relationship between the client charge value and
    the local-currency fixed payment amount varies between embodiments.               In one
    embodiment the client charge value equals the local-currency fixed payment amount.
    In other embodiments the client charge value is greater than the local-currency fixed
   payment amount. For instance, the client charge value in some embodiments includes
    the local-currency fixed payment amount plus one or more supplements, such as a
    handling margin (optionally percentage based) and/or a transaction fee (optionally
    corresponding to a charge, in some cases being a flat charge, levied by the foreign
    exchange agent to the service provider).
[0071]      Once the client charge value is determined, a case management system of
    service provider 501 is updated.     That is, data indicative of the local-currency fixed
   payment amount and client charge is entered into a case management system, thereby
    to create:
    (i)     An accounts payable entry for paying the local-currency fixed payment amount.
            That is, the case management system conventionally includes an accounts
            payable module that polices for payments that are to be made by the service
            provider to third parties.      An accounts payable entry allows the case
            management system to police for payment of the local-currency fixed payment
            amount to agent 503.      In some cases this accounts payable entry is used to
            monitor an opportunity to prevent agent 503 from finalizing payment to
            supplier 500.   For example, this may be relevant where the supplier 500's
            invoice is in dispute, or where supplier 500 owes monies to service provider
            501. See block 303.

                                                   12
    (ii)    A WIP entry against the client matter for the client charge value. This WIP
            entry facilitates invoicing of the client charge to client 502 (in local currency).
            See block 304.
[0072]      In the present embodiment the case management system includes an interface
    for allowing the entry of data indicative of foreign currency invoices (which optionally
    automatically converts a foreign amount to a local amount based on a stored exchange
    rate value). However, the processes of blocks 303 and 304 are performed by means
    other than that interface.   That is, the method of FIG. 3A (and method of FIG. 3B)
    circumvents the conventional approach for entering supplier invoices into the case
    management system. In the present embodiment entering data indicative of the local
    currency fixed payment amount and client charge into the case management system
    includes directly accessing a database utilized by the case management system thereby
    to update one or more tables (for example one or more tables otherwise affected by the
    interface conventionally used to enter foreign currency invoices).        This "backdoor"
    access to the case management system database enables the creation of an accounts
   payable entry and WIP entry for a common supplier invoice, but with value
    relationships that are determined other than on the basis of an exchange rate known to
    the case management system.
[0073]      The tables that need to be updated in the database of the case management
    system clearly vary between embodiments. However, a person skilled in the art would
    recognize how to identify such tables when designing a practical implementation. For
    example, one approach is to use the conventional interface, and monitor modifications
    made by the case management system to the database on the basis of the utilization of
    that interface.    In any event, operation of phase 103 effectively tricks the case
    management system into believing that the conventional interface had been used, even
    through the accounts payable and WIP entries made have values that would not have
   been possible using the conventional interface.
[0074]      In the example of FIG. 3B, the the data received from the foreign exchange
    agent includes a report data file indicative of a plurality of local-currency fixed
   payment amounts, each being associated with a respective client matter. For example,
    this may be an XML file received by email, or downloaded from a web-based interface
    made available by agent 503. Such a file is received at 301a, and analyzed at 301b.

                                                  13
[0075]       In the present example the file includes details of all outstanding foreign
    currency payments being handled by agent 503 for service provider 501. Accordingly,
    301b includes processing the received report data file thereby to identify one or more
    new local-currency fixed payment amounts (being "new" in the sense that accounts
   payable and WIP entries have not already been created on the basis of a previously
    received report data file). Following this, step 302' includes defining client charges for
    each of the new local-currency fixed payment amounts. These are entered into the case
    management system at 303' and 304'.
    FINALIZATION OF INVOICE SETTLEMENT
[0076]       As noted, method 100 concludes with an invoice settlement procedure at phase
    104. In the present embodiment phase 104 includes the making of a foreign currency
   payment by agent 503 to supplier 500 on behalf of service provider 501.
[0077]       As shown in FIG. 4, on embodiment of phase 104 includes, at block 401,
   policing for an accounts payable payment and, at 402, subject to a review of payment
    factors, selectively approving the payment. The payment factors may include the likes
    of the supplier's debtor status with the service provided (for example where there is a
    mutual service supply relationship in place), and an invoice query status. In terms of
    selective approval, in some embodiments service provider 501 provides to foreign
    exchange agent 503 an instruction to release funds in settlement of the invoice. In
    other embodiments the agent operates on the basis of a default decision to release the
    funds on a specified date, and hence approval is inherent in absence of an instruction to
    refrain from releasing funds.
[0078]       Assuming approval (explicit or inferred) occurs, block 403 includes agent 503
    transferring funds (in foreign currency) to supplier 500 thereby to settle the invoice in
    question. Service provider 501 provides a local currency payment corresponding to the
    local-currency fixed payment amount to agent 503 at block 404.
[0079]       Although invoice settlement has been described on an invoice-by-invoice basis,
    it will be appreciated that in some embodiments payments are batched or the like in the
    interests of efficiency.

                                                  14
    EXEMPLARY SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE
[0080]      FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary software architecture for implementing phase
    103. At a general level, foreign exchange agent 503 operates a foreign exchange agent
    system 600, which communicates with a service provider system 601. Each of these
    systems may, in practice, be defined by one or more computer systems.
[0081]      Service provider system 601 operates a case management system 602.         Case
    management system 602 provides a WIP module 603, accounts payable module 604,
    and various other modules 605 (for example time recordal, billing, diary management,
    case data, and so on). Case management system 602 operates in conjunction with a
    database 606, which in the present embodiment is a SQL database. Database 606 may
    include a plurality of distributed databases.
[0082]      A report data file 607 is transmitted from system 600 to system 601.        The
    receipt of this report data file is recognized by a software-based monitoring module
    608, which in some embodiments operates thereby to allow automated identification of
    a received report data file. For instance, module 608 in some embodiments monitors a
    storage location thereby to identify the presence of a new report data file and
    automatically trigger phase 103.       In other embodiments it is necessary to inform
    module 608 of the presence (or anticipate presence) of report data file 607.
[0083]      Module 608 communicates with a report processing module 609 thereby to
    allow automated definition of the or each client charge based on data within a given
    report 607.   Module 609 instructs a database access module 610 to directly access
    database 606 (i.e. without using case management system 602) to make automated
    entries of data indicative of the or each new local-currency fixed payment amount and
    the or each defined client charge.
[0084] Noting the example of FIG. 6, it will be appreciated that various methodologies
    described herein are, in some embodiment, performable by one or more processors that
    accept computer-readable (also called machine-readable) code containing a set of
    instructions that when executed by one or more of the processors carry out at least one
    of the methods described herein.         Any processor capable of executing a set of
    instructions (sequential or otherwise) that specify actions to be taken are included.
    Thus, one example is a typical processing system that includes one or more processors.

                                                15
   Each processor may include one or more of a CPU, a graphics processing unit, and a
   programmable DSP unit.        The processing system further may include a memory
   subsystem including main RAM and/or a static RAM, and/or ROM. A bus subsystem
   may be included for communicating between the components. The processing system
   further may be a distributed processing system with processors coupled by a network.
   If the processing system requires a display, such a display may be included, e.g., a
   liquid crystal display (LCD) or a cathode ray tube (CRT) display. If manual data entry
   is required, the processing system also includes an input device such as one or more of
   an alphanumeric input unit such as a keyboard, a pointing control device such as a
   mouse, and so forth. The term memory unit as used herein, if clear from the context
   and unless explicitly stated otherwise, also encompasses a storage system such as a
   disk drive unit. The processing system in some configurations may include a sound
   output device, and a network interface device. The memory subsystem thus includes a
   computer-readable carrier medium that carries computer-readable code (e.g., software)
   including a set of instructions to cause performing, when executed by one or more
   processors, one of more of the methods described herein. Note that when the method
   includes several elements, e.g., several steps, no ordering of such elements is implied,
   unless specifically stated. The software may reside in the hard disk, or may also reside,
   completely or at least partially, within the RAM and/or within the processor during
   execution thereof by the computer system. Thus, the memory and the processor also
   constitute computer-readable carrier medium carrying computer-readable code.
[0085] Furthermore, a computer-readable carrier medium may form, or be included in a
   computer program product.
[0086] In alternative embodiments, the one or more processors operate as a standalone
   device or may be connected, e.g., networked to other processor(s), in a networked
   deployment, the one or more processors may operate in the capacity of a server or a
   user machine in server-user network environment, or as a peer machine in a peer-to
   peer or distributed network environment.      The one or more processors may form a
   personal computer (PC), a tablet PC, a set-top box (STB), a Personal Digital Assistant
   (PDA), a cellular telephone, a web appliance, a network router, switch or bridge, or any
   machine capable of executing a set of instructions (sequential or otherwise) that specify
   actions to be taken by that machine.

                                                  16
[0087] Thus, one embodiment of each of the methods described herein is in the form of a
    computer-readable carrier medium carrying a set of instructions, e.g., a computer
   program that is for execution on one or more processors, e.g., one or more processors
    that are part of web server arrangement. Thus, as will be appreciated by those skilled
    in the art, embodiments of the present invention may be embodied as a method, an
    apparatus such as a special purpose apparatus, an apparatus such as a data processing
    system, or a computer-readable carrier medium, e.g., a computer program product.
    The computer-readable carrier medium carries computer readable code including a set
    of instructions that when executed on one or more processors cause the processor or
   processors to implement a method. Accordingly, aspects of the present invention may
    take the form of a method, an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software
    embodiment      or an embodiment         combining   software   and hardware aspects.
    Furthermore, the present invention may take the form of carrier medium (e.g., a
    computer program product on a computer-readable              storage medium) carrying
    computer-readable program code embodied in the medium.
[0088] The software may further be transmitted or received over a network via a network
    interface device. While the carrier medium is shown in an exemplary embodiment to
   be a single medium, the term "carrier medium" should be taken to include a single
    medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and/or associated
    caches and servers) that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term "carrier
    medium" shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing, encoding
    or carrying a set of instructions for execution by one or more of the processors and that
    cause the one or more processors to perform any one or more of the methodologies of
    the present invention. A carrier medium may take many forms, including but not
    limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile
    media includes, for example, optical, magnetic disks, and magneto-optical disks.
   Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory. Transmission media
    includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise
    a bus subsystem. Transmission media also may also take the form of acoustic or light
    waves, such as those generated during radio wave and infrared data communications.
    For example, the term "carrier medium" shall accordingly be taken to included, but not
   be limited to, solid-state memories, a computer product embodied in optical and
    magnetic media; a medium bearing a propagated signal detectable by at least one

                                                 17
   processor of one or more processors and representing a set of instructions that, when
    executed, implement a method; and a transmission medium in a network bearing a
   propagated signal detectable by at least one processor of the one or more processors
    and representing the set of instructions.
[0089] It will be understood that the steps of methods discussed are performed in one
    embodiment by an appropriate processor (or processors) of a processing (i.e.,
    computer) system executing instructions (computer-readable code) stored in storage. It
    will also be understood that the invention and embodiments thereof are not limited to
    any particular implementation or programming technique and that the invention may be
    implemented using any appropriate techniques for implementing the functionality
    described herein. The invention is not limited to any particular programming language
    or operating system.
    DATA FILE GENERATION
[0090] The description above is predominately focused on the process of updating a case
    management system. Other embodiments are directed to processes for generating data
    files thereby to facilitate the updating of such a case management system.           Such
   processes are in some embodiments performed by a foreign exchange agent.
[0091] One embodiment provides a method for defining a set of rules for use in a data file
    generation process. This method includes determining a set of data values required to
   update a case management system thereby to create an accounts payable entry and a
    WIP entry, as discussed above. The method additionally includes defining the set of
    rules such that the data file generation process generates a file having all of the
    determined data values.     For example, in the case of a new WIP entry, that might
    necessitate populating a number of data fields with respective values, potentially across
    a number of tables).     Defining the rules includes determining those data filed that
    require population, and determining how to identify appropriate values with which to
   populate those fields. For example, there may be a field for maintaining a client matter
    identification number or the like. It will be appreciated that such a set of rules will be
    dependent on matters such as the nature of the case management system, and the
    implementation particulars of the case management system (which may vary between
    service providers even where the same case management platform is used).

                                                   18
[0092] Sets of rules for one or more service providers are maintained in a repository in
    computer memory, thereby to enable the generation of data files appropriate for each
    service provider.    One embodiment provides a computer implemented method for
    generating such a data file. The method includes receiving data indicative of a foreign
    currency invoice (again being an invoice that is issued to a service provider and relates
    to a client matter of the service provider). The method then includes determining a
    local-currency fixed payment amount that is payable by the service provider to a
    foreign exchange agent at a future date in consideration for settlement of the foreign
    currency invoice, wherein the foreign exchange agent is responsible for making a
    foreign currency payment in settlement of the foreign currency invoice.
[0093] The method additionally includes, identifying, in computer memory, data indicative
    of a set of rules (defined as outlined above) associated with the service provider to
    which the invoice in question is issued. These rules are used such that the data file is
    tailored to that specific service provider. In some embodiments, the rules are used to
   processing the fixed payment local-currency amount thereby to calculate a client
    charge in relation to the client matter. For example, in a simple scenario, the rules
    define a formula for calculating the client charge having a client charge value from the
    local-currency fixed payment amount (for example by applying a percentage multiplier
    or the like). The rules are additionally used in the context of executing a data file
    generation process. In this manner, the generated data file includes data indicative of
    the local-currency fixed payment amount, client charge value, and one or more
    additional data values thereby to enable updating of a case management system
    operated by the service provider to create, in respect of the foreign currency invoice, an
    accounts payable entry for paying the local-currency fixed payment amount; and a WIP
    entry against the client matter for the client charge value.
[0094] As noted above, the one or more additional data values include data values
    requiring entry into the case management system thereby to effect creation of the
    accounts payable entry and the WIP entry (for example a value indicative of the client
    matter).
[0095] In some cases the method includes receiving data indicative of a plurality of foreign
    currency invoices (for example in a batch file), the invoices being issued to common
    service provider and relating to a plurality of client matters of the service provider. In

                                                   19
    such cases the method includes determining local-currency fixed payment amounts and
    client charges for each invoice.
[0096] A method according to claim 6 including performing steps (b) and (d) for each of
    the plurality of invoices, and the generated data file includes, for each invoice, the
    local-currency fixed payment amount, client charge value, and one or more additional
    data values corresponding to thereby to enable updating of a case management system
    operated by the service provider to create, for each invoice, a respective accounts
   payable entry and WIP entry.

    to the action and/or processes of a computer or computing system, or similar electronic
    computing device, that manipulate and/or transform data represented as physical, such
    as electronic, quantities into other data similarly represented as physical quantities.
[0099] In a similar manner, the term "processor" may refer to any device or portion of a
    device that processes electronic data, e.g., from registers and/or memory to transform
    that electronic data into other electronic data that, e.g., may be stored in registers
    and/or memory. A "computer" or a "computing machine" or a "computing platform"
    may include one or more processors.
[00100]     It should be appreciated that in the above description of exemplary
    embodiments of the invention, various features of the invention are sometimes grouped
    together in a single embodiment, FIG., or description thereof for the purpose of
    streamlining the disclosure and aiding in the understanding of one or more of the
    various inventive aspects. This method of disclosure, however, is not to be interpreted
    as reflecting an intention that the claimed invention requires more features than are
    expressly recited in each claim.      Rather, as the following claims reflect, inventive
    aspects lie in less than all features of a single foregoing disclosed embodiment. Thus,
    the claims following the Detailed Description are hereby expressly incorporated into

                                                  20

    following claims, any of the claimed embodiments can be used in any combination.
[00102]     Furthermore, some of the embodiments are described herein as a method or
    combination of elements of a method that can be implemented by a processor of a
    computer system or by other means of carrying out the function.         Thus, a processor
