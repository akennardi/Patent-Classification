DISPENSING SYSTEM
TECHNICAL FIELD
 [0001]      The present invention relates to the application of protective preparations and, more
particularly although not exclusively, to machines for dispensing of sunscreen.
BACKGROUND
 [0002]      It is widely known and generally understood that excessive exposure to ultra violet
(UV) radiation can lead to life-threatening cancers of the skin. The use of sunscreen lotions for
application to the skin when exposed is thus widely promoted.
[0003]       Nevertheless, people may forget to bring suitable lotion to a visit to a beach or other
leisure location where it is desired to reduce clothing. Moreover, sunscreen lotions have a limited
shelf life so that users may find that the lotion they have brought is no longer effective, or the
quantity insufficient for the duration of their exposure.
[0004]       It is an object of the present invention to address or at least ameliorate some of the
above disadvantages.
Notes
[0005]       The term "comprising" (and grammatical variations thereof) is used in this specification
in the inclusive sense of "having" or "including", and not in the exclusive sense of "consisting only
of'.
[0006]       The above discussion of the prior art in the Background of the invention, is not an
admission that any information discussed therein is citable prior art or part of the common general
knowledge of persons skilled in the art in any country.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
First Preferred Embodiment
[00075]       With reference to Figure 1, in a first embodiment, a liquid dispensing system 10 is
incorporated within a dispensing machine 12 suitable for situating at places where high exposure to
UV radiation may be expected, such as along beach-front esplanades, nearby shopping areas or
recreation parks for example.
[00076]      The machine 12 is configured to dispense predetermined quantities of at least one
liquid to a user in return for payment. In this first preferred embodiment the at least one liquid is
sunscreen lotion. As can be seen in Figure 1, the machine 12, comprising an IP (Ingress Protection)
rated enclosure, is provided with a dispensing area 14 within the body of the machine, comprising,
in this embodiment an aperture 16 in the front panel 18 of the machine 12. Preferably, the aperture
                                                      7

16 is in the form of a cylindrical through aperture 20 extending from the aperture in the front panel
to an aperture in the rear panel of the body of the machine and sized so as to allow the insertion of
at least the hands and arms of a user.
[00077]       A dispensing nozzle (not visible in the view of Figure 1) is located at an upper portion
of the through aperture. A user (not shown) may insert one or both hands into the aperture 16, and if
payment has been made, this action is sensed by a motion or proximity sensor located in the through
aperture 20 causing a dispensing pump to eject a predetermined volume of sunscreen into the hand
or hands of the user. In an alternative, or additional dispensing arrangement, the machine may be
provided with a dispensing nozzle and short hose (not shown) made accessible to a user from within
a secured locker when a transaction is made.
[00078]       Sunscreen lotion is dispensed from one or more reusable sunscreen reservoirs retained
in the body of the machine 12. Preferably these reservoirs comprise injection moulded containers of
recyclable plastic. The desired, predetermined volume of sunscreen lotion is drawing from the
container currently in use by, for example, a peristaltic pump. The containers are provided with a
unique code allowing every batch of sunscreen to be monitored. Preferably, the machine is enabled
to dispense at least two grades of sunscreen, SPF30+ and SPF50+ for example. Again preferably,
the machine may provide for a selection of the quantity of sunscreen desired, for example a smaller
amount for children, or just the arms of a user or a larger volume for whole of body protection.
[00079]       The machine 12 is provided with temperature and UV sensors and displays this
information on the display screen 24. The display may include a suitable warning about the dangers
of exposure to high levels of UV. This warning may include audio announcements and may further
include the well-known Cancer Council Slip Slop Slap chimes.
[00080]       Included in the front panel 18 of the machine is a camera 22 for monitoring dispensing
transactions and the correct application of the dispensed lotion. Also provided on the front panel 18
is a data display 24 and payment facilities 26. These latter may include cash and/or credit card slots,
and a near field communication (NFC) transceiver for contactless payment via the EFTPOS
(Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale) system. The display 24 may be in the form of a touch
screen for selection of the sunscreen and volume required and the method of payment. Instructions
for use may include graphics to overcome language barriers. Further to this, a Braille panel may be
provided for user guidance.
                                                     8

[00081]      Included in the machine are an internet router and SIM card for communication via a
mobile phone service provider.
[00082]      The machine 12 is provided with a web UI (User Interface) system operated by server
109, and includes central processor and memory modules. The UI system provides for access to the
machine's operation from anywhere in the world and allows remote operations of the machine,
including the changes of machine status between operable and inoperable and purging of the
dispensing system when required. This communication link between the machine 12 and an
operating entity furthermore provides for monitoring various functions of the machine, including
the levels of sunscreen remaining in the reservoirs, the number of transactions over time and the
conditions of temperature and UV level current for each transaction. The monitoring of temperature
and UV levels allows the machine to report these conditions over time via the machines
communication links.
[00083]      As well sensors are provided for monitoring and reporting malfunction or damage so as
to provide for timely repair or service by technicians.
[00084]      In one embodiment, the machine 12 is powered from a mains power supply but
alternatively, the top or other panels of the machine may be provided with one or more photovoltaic
arrays and a battery to provide operating power. Machines are designed to generate natural cooling
convection to remove heat from within the machine and maintain the sunscreen at acceptable
storage temperature.
 [00085]     Although in some forms the machines 12 may be fixed in place, other portable versions
may be provided for hire, for example for use at outdoor events away from places where
permanently installed machines may be found. Some forms of the machine may be made in sizes
more particularly suited to the use of children, for use in schools and preschools for example, even
in the latter case, configured as some recognizable children's character.
 [00086]      In one preferred configuration of the machine 12, it is provided with a wrist band
dispensing arrangement. Once purchased, these waterproof wrist bands 110 act in place of a credit
card to facilitate touch free purchases of sunscreen through the NFC facility of the machine.
 [00087]      In one preferred embodiment, the machine 12 operates in conjunction with an
application 106 downloadable by users to a smart communication device such as a smart phone 107
                                                    9

(refer figure 2). The application will be configured to guide a would-be user to the nearest machine
or if there is a machine at a desired destination. The application may further provide reminders to a
user as to the need to re-apply sunscreen based on elapsed time since an initial application and the
UV level as recorded by the machine. One advantageous feature of the application is that it may
monitor that a child has correctly applied sunscreen a directed by a parent.
[00088]       A smart phone readable QR or matrix bar code may be provided on the machine,
through which a user may access regulatory information after a transaction.
Second Preferred Embodiment
[00089]       In this second preferred embodiment, the machine is configured as described above for
the first preferred embodiment in that it has the identical physical, connectivity and transaction
features.
[00090]       In this embodiment however, the machine is adapted for the dispensing of more than
one type of liquid. In one preferred arrangement the liquids may comprise a cleaning lotion and a
moisturising lotion, making the machine useful for work locations such as constructions sites,
manufacturing facilities and car service centres for example.
[00091]       Charged with suitable cleaning lotion, the machine in this configuration may also be
installed in hospitals and other areas of high hygiene requirements.
[00092]       With reference to figure 2 there is illustrated an electronic block diagram of a control
and communications system 100 which may be utilised to implement operations of either the first or
second embodiments described above.
[00093]       Broadly the control and communications system 100 includes a processor 101 in
communication with a memory 102 by way of a communications bus 103. The bus 103 also enables
electronic communications with inputs 104 and outputs 105.
 [00094]      A program residing in memory 102 may be executed by processor 101 to give effect to
the actions described in the above described embodiments.
 [00095]      In particular forms an application 106 executable on a smart phone 107 may
communicate via internet 108 with inputs 104 of the control and communications system 100.
                                                      10

Third Embodiment
[00096]      With reference to Figures 3A, 3B and 3C, in this third preferred embodiment, the
machine is configured as described in the first embodiment in that it has identical connectivity and
transaction features. Like components as numbered as for the first embodiment except in the 300
series.
[00097]      In this embodiment, the machine is smaller in width. The housing profile in side section
is in the shape of an "S" as best seen in the side view of Figure 3C. There are photovoltaic collector
panels 300 mounted on the vertical length of the front panel of the machine to maximise the
collection of light energy. In between the series of photovoltaic collection panels is an aperture 320.
In a preferred form the aperture is in the form of a cylinder extending through the housing from
front to rear. The aperture is sized such that the user can place their hand inside the aperture 320 to
receive the sunscreen lotion dispensed from the nozzle 302. In another embodiment, the nozzle 302
may be retractable. In use the nozzle is extended from the machine into the aperture when sunscreen
is to be dispensed onto the user's hand. The nozzle may then be retracted after the dispensing step.
A pivoting door or a similar device may be installed over the retractable nozzle so that when the
nozzle is retracted into the machine, the door will close over the nozzle so that the nozzle will be
protected from damage or tampering by third parties/peipetrators.
[00098]      In a preferred form the height of the machine 312 is 1650mm and its front panel width
is 350mm and its depth is 160mm.
[00099]      With reference to figure 4, inset A is a cross section of the nozzle 302 in the retracted
position with door 321 in a closed across the nozzle exit. Inset B illustrates nozzle 302 in an
extended position with the door 321 retracted whereby the nozzle extends into the interior of the
aperture 320. In this instance the nozzle comprises a generally Y cross section piping component
wherein a first entry tube 304 and a second entry tube 305 are in communication with an exit tube
306. In a preferred form the axis of the first tube and the second tube intersect at an angle in the
range of 45 degrees to 120 degrees.
[000100]     In this embodiment, a camera 301 is located on the roof of the machine and is directed
so as to monitor dispensing step. In preferred forms it may also monitor the correct application of
the dispensed lotion.
                                                    11

[000101]      With reference to figure 5, figure 5 illustrates a peristaltic pump 310 which feeds into
the first entry tube 304 and second entry tube 305.
[000102]      During a transaction, the user may select a predetermined amount of lotion via the use
of a button 303. Upon payment, lotion will be dispensed from the machine onto the user's hand.
The lotion is delivered by the use of at least one peristaltic pump inside the machine. The peristaltic
pumps 310 are connected to tubes 304, 305 which are connected to the storage container of the
lotion. Each lotion is stored in a disposable bladder or similar storage device within the machine.
Preferably, the tubes connected to the peristaltic pump are braided tubes to prevent collapsed tubing
or "flattening" of the tube. The amount of lotion dispensed is controlled by the number of rotations
of the rotors in the machine.
 [000103]     In another embodiment, there may be a "catchment area" 311 located at the foot of the
machine to "catch" excess lotion from the machine as illustrated in figure 6.
 [000104]     In an alternative embodiment, the lotion may be stored underground 312 beneath the
machine as illustrated in figure 7.
 [000105]     Typically, the viscosity of the sunscreen lotion used in all embodiments may range from
 10,000 centipoise to 150,000 centipoise. Preferably the viscosity of an SPF30+ sunscreen lotion will
range from 25,000 to 35,000 centipoise and an SPF50+ sunscreen lotion will range from 25,000 to
50,000 centipoise measured at 21C.
 [000106]     It will be noted that embodiments of the present invention deliver sunscreen lotion as a
predetermined portion of a continuous stream of a high viscosity liquid.
With reference to figure 5 metering is performed by controlled rotation of the rotor 314 of a
peristalitic pump sufficient to urge a predetermined portion of lotion within tube 315 along the tube
 such that a corresponding portion exits the nozzle 316.
Fourth Embodiment
 [000107]     In a further embodiment, the machine is configured as described in the third
 embodiment in that it has identical connectivity and transaction features.
                                                      12

[000108]     In this fourth embodiment, the dispensing area is not located within the cylindrical
aperture. As shown in Figure 8, the nozzle is located on the lower mid portion on the front panel of
the machine but still within the footprint of the machine. In this instance the nozzle does not extend
past the line of the front face 413 of the machine 412. During a transaction, the nozzle 414 will
extend from the machine to dispense the lotion onto a user's hand. After the transaction has
finished, the nozzle 414 will retract back into the machine and a pivoting door or similar device will
close over the nozzle for protection.
