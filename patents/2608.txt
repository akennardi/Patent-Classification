The 3D Tank Target is a modular kit that utilises an internal frame 1, and hinged
joints 11, to enable expansion form a flat packed state. Thin sheet metal panels,
2,3,4 5,7,8, are attached to the metal skeleton 12, which utilises hinges 11, and is
secured via locking pins throughout its assembly 10.
The 3D Tank Target's barrel, 5, is telescopic to enable space saving when flat
packed. Attachments, 6, are fitted on the Target to indicate realistic features of a
Modern Main Battle Tank. The hinges on the skeleton, 11, enable the single piece
side panels to extend to three times its flat packed state. The turret, 3, is attached to
the cross beams 14, as an anchor point.

                               3D Tank Target Description
The current targets used for the training of armoured vehicles comprise of 2D, flat,
wooden makeshift vehicle cut outs that do not represent a real vehicle or target. They
are disposable and often destroyed rapidly. For these reason, many areas of training
value are not tested or trained during their employment.
GaardTech Pty Ltd, has invented a new '3D Tank Target' that replicates modern
vehicles. It is based on the following concepts:
    -   The 'Tank Target' is modular and flat packable. It utilised a metal internal
        skeleton that has thin sheet metal pop riveted to it to enable ready-made
        panels. These panels are complemented with hinges and joints that are
        secured with locking pins and enable its assembly from a flat packed state.
    -   The 'Tank Target' represents a full sized Main Battle Tank.
    -   The 'Tank Target' is painted to replicate real world camouflage.
The '3D Tank Target' achieves innovation in the following manner:
    -   It is a modular kit that enables a large target to be assembled from a small flat
        packed kit.
    -   It absorbs minimal kinetic Energy (KE), meaning, it produces the lowest
        possible level of resistance when high velocity projectiles make contact with
        it, and, pass through it; thus resulting in the KE not transferring to the target.
    -   It represents a modern Main Battle Tank and enables establishment of
        doctrinal vehicle formations that are visually accurate.
The invention may be better understood with reference to the illustrations of
embodiments of the invention which:
Figure 1 describes the 'Tank Targets' assembled form.
Figure 2 describes the 'Tank Targets' frontal view.
Figure 3 describes the 'Tank Targets' right flank view.
Figure 4 describes the 'Tank Targets' Internal metal skeleton and joints.

                                            Claims
    The claims defining the invention are as follows:
1) The 3D Tank Target', is modular and flat packed for transportation. It has hinges and
    joints to enable its expansion or deconstruction, see Figure 1.
2) The '3D Tank Target' is sized to represent a full sized modern Main Battle Tank. It is
    assembled by hand and utilises locking pins to connect joints, see Figure 1.
3) The Tank Target described in claim 1, utilises thin sheet metal panels, which are
    attached on a metal piping skeleton, see Figure 4.
4) The 3D Tank Target' described in claim 1, is painted to represent the image of a
    modern Main Battle Tank.
