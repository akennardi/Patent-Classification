                             MIXER-DRUM COOLING DEVICE
                                     TECHNICAL FIELD
      [0001]     The present invention relates to a mixer drum cooling device for
     cooling a mixer drum mounted on a mixer vehicle.
                                     BACKGROUND ART

                             DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
      [0010]     A mixer-drum cooling device 100 according to an embodiment of the
     present invention will be described below by referring to the attached drawings.
     In Figs. 1 to 3, a cooling medium stored or injected is indicated by a two-dot
     chain line.
      [0011]     First, by referring to Fig. 1, entire constitution of a mixer vehicle 10
     on which the mixer-drum cooling device 100 is mounted will be described.
      [0012]     The mixer vehicle 10 is to transport so-called uncured concrete
      (hereinafter referred to as "uncured concrete") such as ready-mixed concrete
     and the like by a mixer drum 2 mounted on a base 1.
      [0013]     As illustrated in Fig. 1, the mixer drum 2 is a container rotatably
     mounted on the base 1.       The mixer drum 2 is mounted so that a rotating shaft
     is oriented to a longitudinal direction (right-and-left direction in Fig. 1) of the
     mixer vehicle 10.    The mixer drum 2 is mounted with longitudinal inclination
     so that it becomes gradually higher toward a rear part (right direction in Fig. 1)
     of the base 1.
      [0014]     The mixer drum 2 has an opening portion formed on a rear end
     thereof, and input and discharge of the uncured concrete is performed through
     the opening portion.     Above the opening portion of the mixer drum 2, a hopper
     3 for input of the uncured concrete is provided.
      [0015]     The mixer drum 2 is driven by using a running engine (not shown)
     mounted     on the mixer vehicle         10 as a power source        and performs
     forward/backward rotation and acceleration/deceleration by a drum driving

311506(PCT-1827) English Translation
                                              -  4
     device 4 mounted on the base 1.        The drum driving device 4 controls rotation
     of the mixer drum 2 in accordance with instructions from a controller (not
     shown).    When the mixer drum 2 is operated to rotate forward by the drum
     driving device 4, the uncured concrete in the mixer drum 2 is agitated.         When
     the mixer drum 2 is operated to rotate backward by the drum driving device 4,
     the uncured concrete in the mixer drum 2 is discharged to an outside.
      [0016]     Subsequently, the mixer-drum cooling device 100 for cooling the
     mixer drum 2 will be described.
      [0017]     As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, the mixer-drum cooling device 100
     includes an injection unit 20 provided below the mixer drum 2 and injecting
     water as a cooling medium from below toward the mixer drum 2, a storing unit
     30 provided below the mixer drum 2 and storing water injected by the injection
     unit 20 toward the mixer drum 2, and a pump 40 for leading the water stored
     in the storing unit 30 to the injection unit 20.
      [0018]     The injection unit 20 has, as illustrated in Fig. 2, a hollow cylindrical
     tube 21 provided by extending in the longitudinal direction of the mixer vehicle
      10 and a plurality of injection ports 23 formed in the cylindrical tube 21 so as
     to face the lower part of the mixer drum 2.
      [0019]     The cylindrical tube 21 is formed by extending in the longitudinal
     direction of the mixer vehicle 10 and by being bent so as to follow an outer
     shape of the mixer drum 2.       The cylindrical tube 21 is, as illustrated in Fig. 3,
     provided so as to be located below a center in the right-and-left direction
      (right-and-left direction in Fig. 3) in the mixer drum 2.   That is, the cylindrical
     tube 21 is provided below the lowermost part of the mixer drum 2.              In the
     cylindrical tube 21, a supply port 24 for leading the water discharged from the
     pump 40 to a hollow portion 22 inside is provided.
      [0020]     The injection ports 23 are formed in plural at a predetermined

311506(PCT-1827) English Translation
                                             -  5
     interval along the longitudinal direction of the mixer vehicle 10.        Moreover,
     the injection ports 23 are formed so as to communicate with the hollow portion
     22 of the cylindrical tube 21.    Thus, the water led through the hollow portion
     22 of the cylindrical tube 21 is injected toward the lower part of the mixer
     drum 2 from the injection ports 23.
      [0021]     As described above, since the cylindrical tube 21 is provided below
     the lowermost part in the mixer drum 2, and the injection ports 23 are formed
     in the cylindrical tube 21 so as to face the lower part of the mixer drum 2, the
     water can be injected substantially from just below the mixer drum 2.        Thus,
     as compared with the injection of the water from a side of the mixer drum 2,
     scattering of the water injected toward the mixer drum 2 in the right-and-left
     direction can be reduced.
      [0022]     The storing unit 30 is provided below the mixer drum 2 and
     substantially at the center in the right-and-left direction of the mixer vehicle
      10 so that the water injected by the injection unit 20 toward the mixer drum 2
     can be stored.     The storing unit 30 is formed of a resin material having a
     recessed shape so that an upper part is opened.       The storing unit 30 does not
     have to be formed of the resin material but can be formed of an arbitrary
     material.
      [0023]     More specifically, as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, the storing unit 30
     has a base portion 30A fixed to the base 1, a front portion 31 formed so as to
     extend upward as it goes from the base portion 30A toward the front of the
     mixer vehicle 10, and a rear portion 32 formed so as to extend upward as it
     goes from the base portion 30A toward the rear of the mixer vehicle 10.
     Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 3, the storing unit 30 has side portions 33
     formed so as to extend upward on an outer side in the right-and-left direction
     in the mixer vehicle 10 from the base portion 30A.        As described above, the

311506(PCT-1827) English Translation
                                             -  6
     storing unit 30 has the front portion 31, the rear portion 32, and the side
     portions 33 and is formed so as to cover the lower part of the mixer drum 2.
      [0024]     As illustrated in Fig. 3, the injection unit 20 is provided in an inner
     space of the storing unit 30 formed having the recessed shape covering the
     lower part of the mixer drum 2.      The injection unit 20 is provided at the center
     in the right-and-left direction of the mixer vehicle 10 in the inner space of the
     storing unit 30.    Therefore, the water injected by the injection unit 20 toward
     the mixer drum 2 is led to a bottom part of the storing unit 30 along inner wall
     surfaces of the front portion 31, the rear portion 32, and the side portions 33
     covering the lower part of the mixer drum 2.       As described above, the storing
     unit 30 functions also as a cover for preventing the water injected by the
     injection unit 20 toward the mixer drum 2 from scattering to the outside of the
     mixer vehicle 10.
      [0025]     The storing unit 30 further has, as illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3,
     folded-back portions 34 formed by protruding inward from upper ends.            The
     folded-back portion 34 is formed by protruding inward from the upper end of
     the storing unit 30, that is, an opening edge portion.    Since the storing unit 30
     has the folded-back portion 34, even if the water in the bottom part of the
     storing unit 30 shakes due to shaking of the mixer vehicle 10, the water is
     prevented from flowing across the opening edge portion of the storing unit 30
     and being spilled to the outside.
      [0026]     Moreover, in the storing unit 30, a suction port 35 for leading the
     stored water to the pump 40 is formed at the center in the right-and-left
     direction of the mixer vehicle 10 (see Fig. 2).
      [0027]     The pump 40 is driven by an instruction from the controller.        The
     pump 40 suctions the water in the storing unit 30 through a first piping 41
     connected to the suction port 35 of the storing unit 30 and discharges the

311506(PCT-1827) English Translation
                                           -7
     water to the injection unit 20 through a second piping 42 connected to the
     supply port 24 of the cylindrical tube 21 in the injection unit 20.     It is only
     necessary that the pump 40 can lead the water in the storing unit 30 to the
     injection unit 20, and a small-sized one can be used.
      [0028]     Subsequently, a cooling method of the mixer drum 2 by the
     mixer-drum cooling device 100 will be described.
      [0029]     In the storing unit 30 of the mixer-drum cooling device 100, the
     water in such a predetermined amount that the injection port 23 of the
     injection unit 20 is not closed is stored in advance.
      [0030]     When a surface temperature of the mixer drum 2 rises, the pump 40
     is driven by the instruction from the controller.  When the pump 40 is driven,
     the water in the storing unit 30 is suctioned by the pump 40 through the
     suction port 35 and is discharged to the hollow portion 22 through the supply
     port 24 of the cylindrical tube 21 in the injection unit 20.   The mixer-drum
     cooling device 100 may be started manually by providing a start switch or the
     like without using the instruction from the controller.
      [0031]     The water led into the hollow portion 22 of the injection unit 20 is
     injected from the injection port 23 toward the mixer drum 2.     As a result, the
     mixer drum 2 is cooled.      During running of the mixer vehicle 10, the mixer
     drum 2 is rotating and thus, by continuously injecting the water from below,
     the entire mixer drum 2 can be cooled.
      [0032]     Since the lower part of the mixer drum 2 is covered by the storing
     unit 30, the water injected toward the mixer drum 2 is not scattered to the
     outside of the mixer vehicle 10 but is led to the bottom part of the storing unit
     30 along the inner wall surfaces of the front portion 31, the rear portion 32,
     and the side portions 33.
      [0033]     As described above, the water injected from below the mixer drum 2

311506(PCT-1827) English Translation
                                            -  8
     is stored in the storing unit 30 and is led to the injection unit 20 again by the
     pump 40.     By circulating the water as above, the mixer drum 2 can be cooled
     with a small quantity of water.
      [0034]     Moreover, the injection unit 20 for injecting the water and the
     suction port 35 for leading the stored water to the pump 40 are provided at the
     center in the right-and-left direction in the mixer vehicle 10.       As described
     above, by performing suction and discharge of the water at the center in the
     right-and-left direction of the mixer vehicle 10, scattering of the water toward
     the right-and-left direction of the mixer vehicle 10 can be prevented more
     reliably.
      [0035]     Moreover, during running of the mixer vehicle 10, shaking can occur
     due to running on a curve or braking.       There is also a concern that the water
     injected by the injection unit 20 is scattered to the outside due to such shaking
     of the mixer vehicle 10.       In order to prevent such scattering of the water
     caused by shaking of the mixer vehicle 10, the mixer-drum cooling device 100
     only needs to be controlled so that the injection of the water from the injection
     unit 20 is stopped when shaking occurs in the mixer vehicle 10.
      [0036]     Specifically, if an operation of a brake in the mixer vehicle 10 is
     detected or if a steering angle of a steering wheel larger than a predetermined
     angle is detected, for example, the pump 40 only needs to be controlled to be
     stopped by the controller.     As described above, if the mixer vehicle 10 shakes,
     by stopping the injection of the water from the injection unit 20, scattering of
     the water to the outside of the mixer vehicle 10 can be prevented.     Stopping of
     the injection of the water from the injection unit 20 may be accomplished not
     by stopping the pump 40.        That may be accomplished by other methods such
     that a valve is provided in either of the first piping 41 and the second piping 42
     of the pump 40 and passage of the water through the first piping 41 or the

311506(PCT-1827) English Translation
                                           -   9
     second piping 42 is regulated by closing the valve.
      [0037]     Moreover, it may also be controlled so that, by providing an
     acceleration sensor in the mixer vehicle 10, if predetermined acceleration is
     detected by the acceleration sensor, the pump 40 is stopped by the controller.
     In this case, if the acceleration of the mixer vehicle 10 is at a predetermined
     amount or less, the shaking of the mixer vehicle 10 is small, and there is no
     need to stop the injection of the water from the injection unit 20.
      [0038]     According to the embodiment described above, the following effects
     are exerted.
      [0039]     According to the mixer-drum cooling device 100, by injecting the
     water from below the mixer drum 2 by the injection unit 20, the mixer drum 2
     can be cooled.     Moreover, there is no need to store a large quantity of water
     such that the mixer drum 2 is immersed therein in the storing unit 30 for
     storing the injected water in order to cool the mixer drum 2 by injecting the
     water.    Thus, scattering of the water stored in the storing unit 30 due to the
      shaking during running is suppressed.      Moreover, by injecting the water from
     below the mixer drum 2, scattering of the water hitting the mixer drum 2 is
     also suppressed.     Therefore, the scattering of the water during running of the
     mixer vehicle 10 to the outside can suppressed.
      [0040]     Moreover, the cylindrical tube 21 of the injection unit 20 is provided
     below the lowermost part in the mixer drum 2, and the injection ports 23 are
     formed in the cylindrical tube 21 so as to face the lower part of the mixer drum
     2.   As described above, by injecting the water from substantially immediately
     below the mixer drum 2, scattering of the injected water can be reduced as
     compared with the case of injection of the water from the sides toward the
     mixer drum 2.
      [0041]     Moreover, the cylindrical tube 21 of the injection unit 20 is formed

311506(PCT-1827) English Translation
                                             - 10
     by being bent along the outer shape of the mixer drum 2.           Thus, since the
     water can be injected over the entire longitudinal direction of the mixer drum 2,
     the entire mixer drum 2 can be cooled.
      [0042]     Moreover, since the storing unit 30 is formed so as to cover the lower
     part of the mixer drum 2, the water injected to the mixer drum 2 can be
     prevented from scattering to the outside of the storing unit 30.
      [0043]     Moreover, the storing unit 30 has the folded-back portion 34 formed
     protruding inward from the upper end.         Thus, even if the water stored in the
     storing unit 30 shakes due to the shaking of the mixer vehicle 10 during
     running, the water is prevented from flowing across the opening edge portion
     of the storing unit 30 and being spilled over.
      [0044]     Moreover, if shaking occurs in the mixer vehicle 10 during braking
     or during running on a curve, by controlling the mixer-drum cooling device
      100 so that the injection of the water from the injection unit 20 is stopped, the
     scattering of the injected water to the outside due to the shaking of the mixer
     vehicle 10 can be prevented.
      [0045]     Subsequently, a variation of this embodiment will be described.
      [0046]     In the aforementioned embodiment, as illustrated in Fig. 3, the
     injection unit 20 is provided at the center in the right-and-left direction of the
     mixer vehicle 10 in the inner space of the storing unit 30.      Instead of this, as
     illustrated in Fig. 4, the injection unit 20 may be provided on a front side (left
      side in Fig. 4) in a rotating direction (an arrow direction in Fig. 4) in the mixer
     drum 2 rather than the center in the right-and-left direction of the mixer
     vehicle 10.    As a result, a distance that the part of the mixer drum 2 to which
     water droplets adhere by injection of the water by the injection unit 20      moves
     facing inner space of the storing unit 30 becomes longer, whereby the water
     droplets adhering to the mixer drum 2 can be stored by the storing unit 30

     more easily.     Therefore, scattering of the injected water to the outside can be
     further prevented.
      [0047]     Moreover, in the aforementioned embodiment, as illustrated in Fig.
     3, the side portions 33 of the storing unit 30 is formed symmetrically.     Instead
     of this, as illustrated in Fig. 5, a side portion 33A on the right side in Fig. 5
     which is a forward side in the rotating direction of the mixer drum 2 in the
     inner space of the storing unit 30 may be formed longer to an upper part on the
     outer side from the side portion 33B on the left side in Fig. 5 which is a
     backward side in the rotating direction in the mixer drum 2.        As a result, the
     distance that the part of the mixer drum 2 to which the water is injected by the
     injection unit 20 and the water droplets adhere moves facing the storing unit
     30 becomes longer, whereby the water droplets adhering to the mixer drum 2
     can be stored in the storing unit 30 more easily. Therefore, scattering of the
     injected water to the outside can be further prevented.
      [0048]     Moreover, in the aforementioned embodiment, water is used as the
     cooling medium.       Instead of this, other liquids such as aqueous solutions or
     the like having excellent cooling performances, for example, may be used for
     the cooling medium.
      [0049]     Moreover, in the aforementioned embodiment, the pump 40 directly
     suctions the water stored in the storing unit 30 through the suction port 35
     and discharges it to the injection unit 20.        Instead of this, a tank through
     which the water injected by the injection unit 20 is circulated is provided
     separately from the storing unit 30, and the pump 40 may be constituted to
     suction the water from the tank and to discharge it to the injection unit 20.
      Specifically, the storing unit 30 includes a receiving portion provided below the
     mixer drum 2 and receiving the water injected by the injection unit 20 toward
     the mixer drum 2 and a tank to which the water received by the receiving

portion is led, and the pump 40 may be constituted to lead the water from
the tank to the injection unit 20. In this case, the tank can use a water
tank or the like for washing of the mixer drum 2 provided in the mixer
vehicle 10 in general. That is, the pump 40 only needs to lead the water
stored in the storing unit 30 directly or indirectly to the injection unit 20.
