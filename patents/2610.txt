    SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION
                                       BETWEEN USERS
FIELD OF INVENTION
[01]     This present invention relates to a system and method for electronic communication between
users.
[02]     The embodiments of the invention have been developed particularly to permit new ways and
improved methods for users to contact, store, use, request, access, and execute electronic calling and
messaging via a variety of media. The invention is not limited to these particular fields of use and is
also applicable more generally to enable users to establish contact with and interact with new users
(people and/or businesses) who were not already existing contacts for that user. The embodiments of
the invention are also applicable to a contact management software program for facilitating the
management and storage of contacts and the associated details of people and businesses stored in. The
embodiments of the invention also have application to telephone numbers, words, people's details and
contact details being dialled on a digital dial pad. However, the invention is not limited to the
aforementioned fields.
BACKGROUND ART
[03]     Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as
an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the
field.
[04]     Consumers, whether they are natural persons, corporate entities or other collective groups, or
a combination of any one or more of these, would always benefit in being able to more effectively
interact with people or businesses which are stored in their contacts software. It is possible, for
example, to store numeric contact phone numbers and details in a digital (contacts software) or
physical phone book but to date such interaction and available features to use with those contacts is
limited and improved and new methods of interacting and using those contacts or phone numbers are
possible. Presently contacts software and digital dial pads can perform a number of tasks, such as
storing details of a contact, editing details of a contact, dialling phone numbers, saving phone call
records and other contact point records, displaying information about contacts and more.
[05]     Most people and businesses possess a contacts software version on their phone device and
additionally possess a digital dial pad. Day to day usage of the aforementioned software and digital
types is frequent and many various types of functions are performed during this frequent use. Many
of the desired results the person using the software or dial pad wants to achieve are only possible by
many different manual steps of processes in order for the end result to be achieved by the person.
[06]     There are also other mobile phones which perform various functions commonly associated
with a mobile phone such as placing and receiving calls, sending and receiving SMS and MMS,
accessing the internet, accessing contacts and dial pads and so forth. For the purpose of brevity, such
technology in all its variations will be referred to herein as mobile phone/s, TM software, app,
software, device and other words unless the context suggests otherwise.
[07]     Many people and businesses also own a computer in the form of a digital electronic general
purpose computer, often in the form of a microcomputer, laptop computer, server computer or such
like which can sometimes have communications abilities similar to a mobile phone but also be used
for running software that will be available for many clients to connect to. For the purpose of brevity,
such computers and devices will be referred to herein as a server, a computer and other similar words
                                                    1

unless the context suggests otherwise, and note should be made that, depending on the context, the
item may also be referred to as software.
[08]     Software code is able to provide a number of different functions and perform a number of
varying tasks. To build this solution we used languages such as PHP, HTML, CSS, java, objective c,
xml and databases such as MySQL and we also use other languages, graphics and techniques to
achieve desired results. Such languages and their potential functions and tasks have been described in
a varying number of ways throughout this document such as translate, translator, translation, API,
retrieve, request, ticket, database and so forth so as the reader may determine which language they
would preferably use in any given part.
[09]     Embodiments of the present invention aim to provide one or many features for a digital dial
pad, contacts management software and any digital way of interacting with a phone contact which
addresses and improves the aforementioned problems and many other problems and time delaying
processes. Other aims and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following
description.
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[10]     Embodiments of the invention will be described below, by way of example only, with
reference to the accompanying drawings.
         Figure 1 is a first wireframe view of a plurality of screenshots of a software interface;
         Figure 2 is a second wireframe view of a plurality of screenshots of a software interface
         related to Figure 1; and
         Figure 3 is a third wireframe view of a plurality of screenshots of a software interface.
[11]     Reference is initially made to Figures I to 3 of the drawings.
[12]     A person using this invention (user) may login to the software (TM software, app, software)
by entering their registered email address plus relevant password then pressing the Log In button. If
either of the email or password entered is incorrect, an error message, by way of a pop up message,
notifies the user. The email and password are referenced from the server database and the servers
running software and storing data also used by the TM software via API (SDB, server).
[13]     The user can press this button to expand a list of options.
[14]     Two options appear after pressing the item 2 button - Password Recovery and About.
Password Recovery will load a web page which allows the user to begin the procedure of recovering a
forgotten password. About will load a web page which has further details about the software and
what the software does.
[15]     A user may press the Registration button to being the registration process.
[16]     Preferably the first registration screen allows the user to insert a profile photo and add various
Contact Points which will later be associated to a successfully registered account (user's account).
[17]     The user can press this area to load the profile photo interface and add a profile photo which
will be stored as one of the profile photos belonging to the user's account.
[18]     The user can press the icon to begin the add photo process. After the icon is pressed, the user
is prompted to 'Choose a photo from their gallery' or 'Take a photo'. If the user selects the first option
then the user's gallery is displayed and the user may select a photo. If the user selects the second
option, then the device camera is initiated and loaded then the user may take a photo which will then
                                                      2

be the photo loaded to the next section. In the next section, the user may crop and rotate the photo
with their preference. After crop and rotate are selected, the user may add a filter effect to the photo.
[19]      Once the filter effect is applied to the photo the user will be able to see the result of their
selections.
[20]      The user may also press this icon to visualise what their profile photo will look like with a
circular crop.
[21]      The user may add more types of Contact Points to the list which will then be stored onto the
user's account.
[22]      By default, the user may enter a phone number, mobile number and / or an email address.
[23]      The user may press this button to move to the next section of the registration process.
[24]      The user may select to 'Skip' this screen in which case all entered data on the screen is ignored
and the next section of the registration process is loaded.
[25]      User must enter a valid email address here. This email address must be unique as a login
email address and not already existing on the server.
[26]      User must enter a valid password which is over 5 characters.
[27]      User must enter a valid location by entering the closest town or city to where he, she or it is
located, or a town and city of their choice. While the user enters their location, the entered characters
are referenced back to the server via API which contains an extensive list of geographic locations,
including most major towns and cities around the world. An auto response list is fed back after the
first three characters are entered and the list continues to be dynamically minimised as the user enters
more characters. The user must select a location from the suggested list before being able to proceed.
The user must have entered a valid and unique email address, password and selected a location before
preceding otherwise an error response will be displayed. A prefix is added to the user ID (TMID)
based on the user's location. This prefix is generally unseen but can be used for users who want to
dial a TMID for external countries.
[28]      Once the user has successfully filled out the fields indicated in paragraphs 14, 15 and 16
above, the user is able to press this button and can proceed to the next section. It is critical for the
location to be selected before the next part of the registration process is loaded because the location is
an important key to deciphering which TMIDs will be available to that user and the location will also
decide which prefix is added to the TMID allowing the TMID to remain unique. The previous 14, 15
and 16 are all checked via API to the server.
[29]      The user may now select a valid and available TMID. The availability for the TMID is based
largely on two factors which are the location and the plan type's colour then of course the characters
used for the TMID. See point 22 below for further details regarding the uniqueness of a TMID.
[30]      The user may enter a mobile phone number in this section. The mobile phone number entered
here will be added to the user's list of Contact Points.
[31]      The user must select a plan type and colour. Four of the plan types include one default
colour. Plan l's colour is Bronze, Plan 2's colour is Silver, Plan 3's colour is Gold and Plan 4's colour
is Platinum.
                                                      3

[32]     If the user selects to have a Free account then the user will have further colour options to
select from. A list of colours for a Free account can be green, blue, black, white, yellow, pink, red,
orange however any number of colours can be added to this list.
[33]     The user can then press the register button to attempt to register their account. The success of
registration is based on specific requirements which are checked via the API to the server. Those
requirements are as follows: the email address must be unique as a login email address in the server,
the password must be valid, the user must have selected a valid location, the TMID must be unique
for that location based on the location and the plan colour selected. For example, if a user wished to
register a TMID of 'shane' in Australia with a colour of blue, the API will check with the server to see
whether the TMID of 'shane' in Australia has been registered with the colour blue. If the colour blue
has already been registered in that location with that TMID, then the user may select another colour
type that is available. This means the uniqueness of a TMID is based on the location, TMID and
colour. Additional notes of the login process can be found at 486 to 493 and the displayed in images
on Figure 3.
[34]     Accordingly, an aspect of the invention is a system and method for enabling communications
between users having respective contact identifiers that are each issued to those users by one or more
third party providers, wherein the users interact with the system with electronic communications
devices and the system includes:
         a first database for storing first data indicative of the contact identifiers and second data for
         defining a user identifier for each user;
         an interface for allowing electronic communication between the system and the electronic
         communications devices;
         a first processor that is responsive to the communication between the electronic
         communications devices and the system for selectively updating the second data such that, for
         each user, the user identifier is unique and indicative of:
                   a text string; and
                   a geographic location; and
         a second processor that is responsive to the communication between the electronic
         communications devices and the system for enabling communication between the users,
         where those users are identified to each other using their respective user identifiers.
[35]     Preferably, the user identifier is indicative of a label.
[36]     Another aspect of the invention is a system and method for enabling communications between
users having respective contact identifiers that are each issued to those users by one or more third
party providers, wherein the users interact with the system with electronic communications devices
and the system includes:
         a first database for storing first data indicative of the contact identifiers and second data for
         defining a user identifier for each user;
         an interface for allowing electronic communication between the system and the electronic
         communications devices;
                                                       4

        a first processor that is responsive to the communication between the electronic
        communications devices and the system for selectively updating the second data such that, for
        each user, the user identifier is unique and indicative of:
                  a text string; and
                  a label; and
        a second processor that is responsive to the communication between the electronic
        communications devices and the system for enabling communication between the users,
        where those users are identified to each other using their respective user identifiers.
The addressee is now referred to the continuing detailed description of the preferred embodiment.
[37]    Was a FREE or Paid account created? If it was a FREE account, then the flow will progress
to the Dial Pad screen in a logged in state with the recently created account. If it was a Paid account,
then the flow will progress to the payment screen and continue with that relevant flow. The API will
connect with the server and create the user's account.
[38]    If the user selected a paid plan, then they will be sent to the generic payment screen. If the
payment is successful, the account will be created and the flow of a paid account user will continue.
[39]    If the user had selected a plan and successfully paid for that plan, a default percentage of the
plan fee will be donated toward a charity type of the user's choice. The user will be presented with a
variety of options and also an undecided option. The choice of the user will then be recorded via the
API into the server so the amount can be appropriately donated. Once the user Accepts which option
they wish, the software will preferably proceed to login with the relevant account details and proceed
to the Dial Pad screen in a logged in status.
[40]    If the user logs in successfully then they will preferably proceed to the Dial Pad screen in a
logged in status. During login, all relevant data is synced to the software via the API from the server.
Additional notes of the login process can be found at 486 to 493 and the displayed in images on
Figure 3.
[41]    The dial pad icon from the tab bar.
[42]    The dial pad also supports a speed dial function. The number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 may
have a speed dial assigned to it and the buttons with the pound sign ( # ) and asterix ( * ) may also
have a speed dial assigned to it. The 0 (zero) button cannot have a speed dial assigned to it as the 0
key is used to create a plus (+ ) icon when the user long holds on the button.
[43]    If any of the eligible buttons do not have a contact assigned to it as a speed dial, the user may
press on any relevant button and hold it down and the process of adding a speed dial to that button
will begin. The TM software will store the number pressed and then automatically begin from 345.
Another method of adding a speed dial is via 343. Additionally a user may also locate the contact
they wish to use for a speed dial, long hold on that contact's profile image and an expand menu will
appear. From that expand menu the user may choose to add a speed dial for that contact and the
process from 345 will being after the TM software stores details of the relevant contact used.
[44]    If an eligible button has a speed dial contact assigned to it and the user long holds on that
button then the speed dial will be executed. It should be noted that there are two types of speed dial in
the TM software and each type reacts differently after the user long holds and causes action from that
button.
                                                     5

[45]     If the user causes action to occur on a button that has a Traditional style speed dial assigned to
it, then the contact point or action assigned to that speed dial will automatically take effect, for
example, if the user has assigned a call function to the speed dial then a call will be placed directly to
the chosen phone number of the contact assigned to that speed dial position.
[46]     If the user causes action to occur on a button that has a Pop Up style speed dial assigned to it,
then the whole profile of that contact assigned to the speed dial position will appear, preferably in a
pop up form, and will display the full details of that contact within the pop up window. Please see
27b for an example and explanation of this screen.
[47]     In this case we will assume that button one has been assigned a Pop Up style speed dial to it.
The user long holds on button 1 and the process of the pop up speed dial begins.
[48]     The user has executed a pop up style speed dial and therefore a pop up window has appeared
which contains details of the contact assigned to this pop up speed dial through steps after 345a. On
this pop up screen various details should be displayed as is line with 202 and or 147. The complete
list of contact points for the relevant contact should be displayed and other standard functionality and
flow from this screen should be considered identical to that of 202 (and 147 if the speed dial contact is
another user).
[49]     The dial pad also contains another feature which can be activated when the user presses or
taps within the white dotted box shapes displayed within both of the 27d locations. It should be noted
that from time to time it becomes difficult for people to remember which contact they have assigned
to a speed dial, therefore, this feature allows a quick and easy way to visually display to the user
which contact they have assigned to which position. When the user taps on the area inside these white
dotted shapes the dial pad screen will visually display which contacts have been assigned to which
eligible buttons as displayed and described in 27e. Note, the dotted shares are for reference purpose
only, the TM software does not display these boxes or any such boxes, black or white, used
throughout this document description unless otherwise noted.
[50]     The user has tapped or pressed the space displayed in 27d and therefore the TM software has
displayed the relevant contacts assigned as speed dials on the relevant and eligible buttons. The TM
software will first display the profile photo within the space and shape of each button. The icon for
each eligible button should also remain on display so that the user can identify which button has
which contact assigned to it. Note that on button 2 there is also an example where a name and type of
contact point, or the full or part of the contact point, can be displayed also to allow the user better
ability to identify which contact has been assigned to which number.
[51]     When the dial pad is in this state executed from 27d the user may also press on eligible speed
dial buttons that have contacts assigned to it in order to automatically action that speed dial whether
the speed dial has a traditional style speed dial assigned to it or a pop up style speed dial assigned to
it. Note that the action by the user to execute the speed dial feature when the dial pad is in this state is
a tap, not a long hold as is the case in 27a and 27b when the dial pad is in a different state.
[52]     If an eligible button does not have a speed dial contact assigned to it and the user taps that
button when in this state 27e, the flow to add a speed dial to the button will begin as described in 27a.
[53]     For the user to return to the previous state of the dial pad as in 27a, the user must simply tap
the area of 27d and the visual representation of the speed dials will disappear and the dial pad with
return to the state described in 27a which required the user to long hold on an eligible button to
execute a speed dial that has a contact assigned to it.
                                                     6

[54]      The numbers which are being dialled by the user on the dial pad will appear here.
[55]      This is the dial pad which has multiple functions. While a number is dialled into the dial pad,
the dialled numbers appear in 28 but at the same time scan local and external data to retrieve results
based on the numbers alpha value, known as Text on 9 Keys (T9) predictive dialling. The T9
predictive text will search local contacts, history and TMID users, especially TM Contacts which are
saved is the device local DB (TM software), and display relevant contacts, results and users under a
transparent dial pad.
[56]      The results are displayed based on T9 predictive text which means it displays both results
based on the numeric value of the keys entered and their correlating alphabetic values (for example, 2
ABC, 3-DEF, 4-GHI, 5-JKL, 6-MNO, 7-PQRS, 8-TUV, 9-WXYZ, 0-+). If the user long holds down
on any of the dial pad buttons 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,* or # then speed dial (see 344) will be initiated. If the
speed dial item has not been set for that particular number or icon then a prompt to add a contact point
to that relevant number or icon should commence (see 345).
[57]      The graphics in the dial pad must have some form of transparency which allows displayed
data and graphics under / behind the dial pad to be visible to the user. To access the data behind the
dial pad the user may reduce the dial pad using the icon in 31 or my manually sliding the dial pad
down until it disappears from view. Please the flow from 458 to understand further functions and
features on this dial pad screen.
[58]      This is the icon which will reduce the dial pad and allow the user to access data and graphics
that were previously appearing behind the dial pad.
[59]      This is the call button for the dial pad. When the  call button is pressed with a short press , it
will attempt to call the number that has been dialled into     the dial pad and appears in 28. When the
user uses a long press (presses and holds the call button      for over 1.5 seconds), a menu will appear
which allows the user to enable other options as displayed    in 33.
[60]      Example of the expanding menu after a long hold on the call button.
[61]      One item on the expanded menu is the call reminder icon. The user can select this icon to
begin the call reminder recording process 79. The Contact Point for the call reminder will be set by
default with whatever number or contact that has been entered into 28.
[62]      One item on the expanded menu is the SMS icon. The user can select this icon to open an
SMS action and ultimately send an SMS to the number which has been entered into 28.
[63]      One item on the expanded menu is the Add icon. The user can select this icon to begin the
process of adding a new contact 70. By default, the new contact will be created using the number
entered into 28.
[64]      One item on the expanded menu is the Share icon. The user can select this icon to open a
sharing option 174 in which they can begin to share either their user contact details via a vCard.
[65]      This is an internal tab on the 27 dial pad screen and is a search screen. When the user presses
this icon the search screen 42 will load.
[66]      This is an internal tab on the 27 dial pad screen and is a TM search screen. When the user
presses this icon the TM search screen will load 57.
[67]      This is the screen appearance when the dial pad is reduced. The reduced dial pad allows the
user to clearly see and interact with any results that were retrieved and displayed partly due to 29.
                                                      7

[68]     If the user presses this icon, the dial pad will be restored and displayed in the foreground of
the dial pad screen.
[69]     This is the search screen also displaying results 43. A user may type in a search phrase in this
section and then initiate a general search for whatever was entered into this section. If the user is
sharing their location then the search results will be based on their location and provide more relevant
results. If the user is not sharing their location, then results will either be general or based on the
user's selected location stored in the SDB.
[70]     This is the results section displaying a list of results from the search initiated in 42. A nice
large profile image is displayed accompanied by the name of the result and the address of the result so
that the user may more easily identify if the result is the result they were searching for. The user may
slide the result across to reveal two more icons 46 and 47.
[71]     This is the location icon, if the user presses this icon they will load a map screen which
displays the location of the result on a map 66.
[72]     This is a call icon, if the user presses this icon they will initiate a call to the phone number
associated with the result they pressed on.
[73]     This is an add icon, if the user presses this add icon they will automatically add the details of
the specific search result to their contacts list with as many details as are available.
[74]     This is a share icon, if the user presses this share icon they will be able to share the details of
this result with anyone via a TMID, email, phone number and other means.
[75]     If the user presses in this general area they will load further details about that search result 49.
[76]     This is the extra details screen of a search result. The extra details screen contains additional
information about each specific results based on the availability of such additional information. This
screen also contains more descriptive details about data formerly linked to icons in the search result
list section. Details on this screen can range between, but are not limited to, phone numbers,
addresses, website URLs, times of operation, ratings, reviews, locations and so forth.
[77]     If the user presses the area to the left then a call will be placed to the phone number being
displayed.
[78]     If the user presses the area to the left then a map will be loaded displaying the relevant
location of the address 66.
[79]     If the user presses the area to the left then the relevant URL will be loaded.
[80]     The area to the left displays times related to the opening operational hours of the search result.
[81]     A large sized photo of the search result is displayed.
[82]     The name of the search result is displayed at the top of the screen.
[83]     When the user presses this icon it will return to the dial pad screen.
[84]     This is the TM Search screen. A TMID is entered into the search field and a search is
executed based on the characters entered by the user. The search results are determined by the user's
location as set on the SDB. The results are returned based on data in the SDB and in some cases the
local device database, for example, data stored in SQLite (local db). When there are multiple results
for an identical order of characters then there is a specific display process to follow which displays
results which have certain colours associated with them over others. For example, if a user searches
for 'brad' and there are numerous instances of TMIDs called 'brad' in the SDB or local database, then
                                                       8

the results will be displayed in a specific order based on the associated colours to each instance of
'brad'. A platinum colour would be displayed at the top of the list, followed by a gold colour,
followed by a silver colour, followed by a bronze colour, followed by each other colour in no specific
order after bronze. Such colouration can be displayed in any area of the individual result section 58.
 Some ideal locations for the colour type would be as, but not limited to, boarders around the profile
photo, a badge over the profile photo, the whole profile photo area in the absence of a profile photo.
 [85]    This is an example of the individual result section of a TMID user. Generally this area will
display the profile photo, the name and/or TMID of a user, the location of a user, by default the two
top preferred Contact Points of that user.
 [86]    A user may also slide across an individual result section to reveal two more icons. Preferably
these icons will reveal two more preferred Contact Point icons, however, in the absence of any further
Contact Points being available on the result's user account, then a delete and edit icon will be
displayed in place.
 [87]    There is another type of search result that can be displayed which is slightly different from 58.
This result contains generally the same details as 58 and 59, however, in place of the Contact Point
icons there is an arrow which leads to further results under that first result and is display in a
hierarchy. This allows some TM users to have numerous results under one specific TMID. A Contact
Point may still be displayed in this result. When the user presses on the arrow icon, they will be taken
to a lower level in the hierarchy which displays access to further levels and / or results stored under
each specific level.
 [88]    Each hierarchy level will always have an option to return to the previous level via an icon or
description at the top of this section of the screen. If the user presses this option they will return to the
previous hierarchy level or back to the original results screen.
 [89]    Some hierarchy levels will have lower levels that can be reached my clicking on result
sections that have some type of arrow displayed, letting the user know there is a lower level to
explore. The number of lower hierarchy levels per hierarchy level is infinite.
 [90]    The owner for the TMID for the hierarchy levels may add results in the format of a standard
TMID user per hierarchy level. Every infinite hierarchy level may have these added. The additional
details can be added manually as unique IDs under the hierarchy of the original TMID, for example
60 in this case, or can be other TMID user holders who have been invited to be part of the hierarchy
results. The number of such listed accounts / results are infinite.
 [91]    A user may search all level of the hierarchy from this search box once at least one level of the
hierarchy has been loaded.
 [92]    An example of another hierarchy level.
 [93]    This is the map display screen for the location of a search result if a location is available. The
user may zoom in and out on the retrieved location for the search result and a display of precise
location is displayed on the map. The user may find further details of the location on this map.
 [94]    The contacts icon from the tab bar. When the user presses this icon from the tab bar the
contacts screen will be loaded and displayed. This is the central section for displaying device contacts
and TM contacts. If a TM account has been added to a group of the user then the TM account will be
displayed in this section as a TM contact. As with all such data, TM contacts and their details will be
stored and synced on a local db which will be accessible to the user even if they do not have an active
internet connect, for example, they are offline. The device contacts from the device which the
                                                      9

software is operating are also displayed as a group on this screen. The user has the option to import
their device contacts into the app while also having the ability back those device contacts up to the
SDB in the process. Once the device contacts are imported, they will be stored in the local database
of the software.
[95]     This is the group display selection feature. When the user presses this they will be presented
with a list of groups which are related to their TM and device contacts. Groups options consist of, but
may not be limited to: All, Local (device contacts), TM (TMID contacts), Friends, Family, Work,
Places, TM Shared Groups. When the user selects a group then the relevant contacts associated with
that group are displayed.
[96]     This is the search feature for contacts. When the user presses in this area the user will be able
to enter some details, preferably via keyboard or other appropriate means. The entered details will be
used to display relevant results. The user may search alphabetically or numerically and may search all
stored contacts associated with their account. The results will be returned progressively as the user
enters the details of the search. The user may also search based on logic using the first initial of a
word for each contact with a space separating each initial, for example, if a user wanted a result
returned of Bill Graham, the user could enter 'b g' into the search box 'b' being the first character in the
first word and 'g' being the first character in the second word.
[97]     When pressed, the user will be presented with options related to adding a new contact. Such
options will be, but are not limited to, adding a new device contact and adding a business card contact
via transcription. The process for adding a business card transcription type contact will be listed later
in this document via the second method to load the function from the More screen tab 115.
[98]     The profile image for the respective user is displayed here and in all similar instances
throughout the software. If the contact being viewed is a TM account, then the profile image will be
displayed based on the privacy settings between the user viewing the profile photo and the TM
account being viewed. If the contact being viewed is a device contact, a non-TM contact, then if there
is a profile photo for that contact it will be displayed here. If a TM contact or a device contact have
no photo, then a default profile image will be displayed and determined by the first character of the
contact's name or TMID if a name is not available. The chosen colour of the TM contact account
holder will also be displayed around the profile photo area as a badge, a border and/or in the default
profile photo.
[99]     You will note that there are two lines displaying text. If the contact is a TM contact, then the
top line will display the 'First and last name' of the TM contact and the second line will display the
TMID of that TM contact. If the TM contact has no name associated with the account, or, if the TM
contact does not share their name with the viewing user due to privacy settings, then the TMID will be
displayed on the top line and the location will be displayed on the second line. If the contact is a
device contact, then only the name of the device contact will be displayed on the first line and nothing
will be displayed on the second line.
[100] The two icons displayed here are icons for Contact Points. The two Contact Points which are
displayed here is determined based on the preferred Contact Point order of that TM contact or device
contact. More details on how this ordering system works can be found in flow from 147.
[101] As in 59, a user may slide the contact section across to reveal two more icons. This feature
will be available in each circumstance where a TM contact or device contact is displayed as part of a
list. The two icons revealed in such circumstances will be the next two Contact Points set behind 73
in the contact point preferred order list. If there are not one or two more contact points in such an
                                                      10

order, then by default an edit and delete icon will be displayed. The edit icon will open the contact
into edit mode and the delete icon will delete or remove the contact from the user's contact list.
 [102] This is the import, sync, backup and merge icon. If a user presses this icon then a set of
actions will commence; the software will import contacts from the device and record them into the
software local db, the software will backup the current list of imported device contacts to the SDB if
there is a live internet connection, the software will retrieve any relevant details or new device
contacts or device contact details from the SDB if there is a live internet connection. There is also
merge logic located in the API between the software with local db and the SDB; this merge logic
assists in keeping a clean record of contacts as well as elimination certain duplicates which are
displayed on the software. The logic uses the name of a contact and at least one contact point to
identify and duplicate or similar contacts and merge them to represent a clean version of the contact.
Therefore, if two contacts have the same name and at least one other separate piece of data inside that
contact the same, the contact will be automatically merged. This logic is also implemented between
the contacts on the local device and the TM Software. The logic on both sides has been created so as
not to lose any contact data, specifically in the event that a contact has the same name and same
contact point but has other data in the varying accounts which is not identical, in such a situation, the
two contacts are merged but all data which is not identical is retained and recorded individually under
the one contact name. As simple example of this would, if there were one contact called 'bob' who
had a phone number '12345', another phone number '112345' and an email address 'bobl@web.com'
and then another contact called 'bob' who had a phone number '12345', another phone number '54321',
an email address 'bobl@web.com' and another email address 'bob2@web.com' then this contact
would be merged to one contact under the name of 'bob' with three phone numbers '12345', '112345',
'54321' and two emails addresses 'bobl@web.com' and 'bob2@web.com' - this is an example and the
logic is extended to cover all data aspects of standard contact data.
 [103] It should also be noted that the user will have additional options throughout the sync process
to perform various tasks on their contacts. When the user presses this sync button, the user will first
be prompted with the option to import their contacts again from their local phone device. This prompt
is offered in case the user has since added additional contacts to their local phone and wish for those
contacts to be imported into the TM Software. The next step will send the phone contacts to the
server at which time the merge logic will be processed and applied as described above. The user will
then receive a pop up option for the TM software and server to verify phone number types and if any
phone number types have been assigned incorrectly the TM software and server will rectify those
incorrect assignments. For example, if the user has a phone number stored inside one of their
contact's details as a landline phone number, but in fact that phone number is a mobile phone number,
the TM software and server will identify this and correct the mistake assigning the correct phone
number type. The server and TM software achieve this by using a database of almost every type of
phone number type in the world and mapping those number structures in order to identify what type
of phone number the phone is.
 [104] If the TM software and server identify phone numbers to be a mobile number, the server will
automatically assign an additional type of contact point to each mobile number which is the SMS
contact point type because it is assumed that each mobile number has the ability to send and or
receive SMS text messages.
 [105] You will note that 76 is representing two areas that are above and below the number. These
two areas are similar but are examples of two different types of contacts. The upper area is a device
contact and can be identified by viewing the profile image area and noticing the circular badge
                                                    11

applied to the lower left of the profile image area being a vertically placed white rectangle icon on a
dark coloured background to represent a mobile device. The lower area is a TM contact which can be
identified by viewing the type of badge which is located in the same position on the profile image area
as the device contact, in this case being represented as TM to represent a TM contact. If the user
presses in this area then the Contact Points Profile screen will be loaded for the TM contact or the
device contact depending on which type of contact the area has been pressed for. The TM contact and
the device contact have varying profile screens with varying levels of interaction and will be recorded
and defined separately.
[106] If the user long holds on a profile photo then an expanded list will appear with 4 icon options.
This long hold expanding menu feature is available from any TM contact or device contact appearing
on the TMSoftware.
[107] This is the alarm icon. The alarm feature allows users to set alarms, alerts, reminders for
them to interact with that contact at a given time. If the user presses on this icon then the alarm
setting process will begin.
[108] This is the screen which loads after 78 is executed and the screen where the initial details for
an alarm can be setup. It should be noted that the user may also set an alert type on each alert. The
alert types supplied by default will be work, personal, shopping, chores and other but the user will
have the ability to write their own custom alert types too. The alert types can be filtered on 86 to
allow the user to quickly find and view different types of alerts that are in their list or have expired in
their list making it easy for the user to check and focus on particular tasks depending on what the user
is doing at any one time. It should also be noted that although not displayed in this diagram, the user
may also set alerts and assign those alerts to other users. An alert that has been assigned to another
user may be accepted or rejected by the that has received the alert assigned to them. If the accepts an
assigned alert then the alert will be added to the list of the user that accepted the assigned alert.
Preferably the user that assigned the alert will also be notified when alerts are accepted by the
receiving user and completed by the receiving user.
[109] This section is where the user can select what type of notification they wish to receive when
the alarm time expires. The choices are Email, in which case the user will receive a notification via
their email address, Notification, in which case the user will receive a notification on their phone
alerting them to the alarm, or Email plus Notification, in which case they will receive notifications via
both previous methods. If Email is selected then the email address which will be used by default is
the address the user signed up to when creating an account with the service.
[110] This section is where the user can set the date of their desired alarm time. When the user
presses this section, an option will appear as a popup allowing the user to select a date and then accept
the date. Once the date has been selected and accepted, it will appear set in the date section.
[111] This section is where the user can set the time of their desired alarm. When the user presses
this section, an option will appear as a popup, allowing the user to select a time and then accept that
selected time. Once the time has been selected and accepted it will appear set in the time section.
[112] This section is where the user can record some message or comment which will be saved with
the alarm date and presented to the user when the alarm expires via whichever method or methods that
the user selected in 80.
[113] The user may select a Contact Point from the list of Contact Points associated with the TM
contact or device contact that the alarm is being set for. The list here is determined by what Contact
Points are recorded under that relevant account. The only time a list is not available is when the user
                                                    12

has initiated an alarm call back via the call button on the dial pad, in which case, the alarm is set based
on the number that was entered by the user into the dial pad.
[114] After the user has populated the required fields and made the relevant selections for the alarm
to be valid the ADD button may be pressed. Once the add button is pressed, the alarm will be added
to the alarm list which can be accessed via the More tab screen list and edited as required.
[115] This is the Alarms Screen. This list can be accessed via the More tab list 278 with the option
named Alarms 279. It provides a list of all relevant Alarms (alerts) to the user. The displayed alarms
can be present or expired. The list of alarms should be displayed in order relevant to their expiry date
with the closest expiry date being displayed at the top of the list and the latest expiry date being
displayed at the bottom of the list. Expired alarms will be displayed after present and active alarms
also in order of relevance by the alarm date set.
[116] This area displays the remaining time until the alarm expires and an alert notification is
executed for the user. The amount of remaining is displayed by numbers, measure types and graphics.
A measure type would be minutes, hours, days, weeks, years. The graphical display is illustrated in a
circle around the numeric amount and measure type. The code can be set to a number between 0 and
99 and the graphic will reflect that relevant position on the graphical display indicator. Preferably
there will be different colours for different measure types, for example, red if the display type is
minutes, orange if the display type is hours, blue if the display type is days, green if the display type is
weeks, purple if the display type is years and black if the alert has already passed and is expired.
[117] The name of the contact that the alarm is set for should appear here. If the contact is a TM
contact, then the normal logic applies, if the TM contact has a name which is also available based on
the privacy rules between the two TM users, then the name can be displayed here, if the TM contact
does not have a name available for the TM user who owns the alarm, then the TMID should be
displayed here.
[118]    In this section the exact date and time for the alarm should be displayed.
[119] In this section the comment 98 for the alarm is displayed. If the comment for the alarm is too
long then only the first part of the comment will be displayed until there is no more reasonable space
to display any further content. This data was set by the user in 83.
[120] The icon to the right is shown if the user has opted to receive a notification 94 via the device
software when the alarm expires.
[121] The icon to the left is shown if the user has opted to receive a notification via email when the
alarm expires. If the user presses in this area then the notification 94 alert window will be displayed.
[122] This is the alert notification window. This window will pop up if pressed on in 93 or will pop
up when a notification of an alarm expiring is sent to the device and the user opens that notification.
This window could also pop up automatically when the alarm expires.
[123] The relevant profile photo for the contact that the alarm has been set for is displayed here. If
the contact is a device contact then the standard profile image will be displayed. If the contact is a
TM contact then the profile image will be displayed as set out in 71.
[124] You will note that there are two lines to display data. The data display method here will be
the same as adopted in 72.
[125]    The icon to the left will represent the type of Contact Point that has been associated with the
alert.
                                                      13

[126]    This section displays the full comment assigned to the alarm.
[127] The icon under, in this case represented as 'Proceed', will execute the action for depending on
the contact point type and data of that type associated with the alarm. The contact point associated
with the alarm could be a number of various types, for example, a phone number, an email, a TM
message, SMS, other software applications, for example Skype. If we assume the contact point type
in 97 is a phone number and has data recording the phone number as '123, then when the user presses
99 a phone call will be placed to 123. If the contact point type in 97 was an email and the data
recording for the email was 'some@web.com', then when the user presses 99 an email action will be
assumed and populated using some@web.com.
[128] The icon under, in this case represented as 'Postpone', will display further interface 101 to
allow the user to postpone the alarm time.
[129] This is the extended interface which is loaded once 100 is pressed. The user has two options
to change the original alarm time. The first option is to select from a predetermined list of varying
time quantities, the user may select the desired quantity and then press the save button 102, the
selected desired quantity will be added to the original alarm time and a new alarm time will be saved
based on these calculations.       The user may also select 'Set Manually'. If the user selects 'Set
Manually' then further interface will appear allowing the user to first select a new date and then a new
time which will be saved once the user has finished selecting a new date and time and then presses the
save button 102.
[130] When the user presses 100 then 99 will change function and become a 'save' button. After the
user has selected an updated time from 101, the user may press this button to save the updated time.
[131] When the user presses the 'Edit' button a screen will open allowing the user to edit recorded
contact data on the alarm.
[132] The edit alarm screen is almost identical to 79 except any existing data or selections are pre
populated into relevant fields. The user may add or edit all available fields as described in 79 and
then save those updates via the save button 105.
[133] When the user presses the save button, it will save any updated data and selections from 104.
If the user presses the delete button, the alarm will be deleted. If the user presses the cancel button
then the edit mode will be cancelled and return back to the previous screen.
[134] This is the new contact screen, the screen loaded when the user presses 70 and selects 'New
Contact'. On this screen the user can set some basic details for a new contact including the name,
location and contact points of the contact. If the user wishes to add more details to their contact, then
can do so by saving the initial details and then accessing the contact through the normal interface for a
device contact flow from 202. After the user saves their new contact details the screen should flow to
the normal interface for a device contact.
[135] The user can enter the name of their new contact here. A contact must have a name, if there
is no name entered and the user tries to save the contact then there must be a prompt stopping the
creation of the contact until a name is entered.
[136]    The user can enter the location of their new contact here.
[137] When the user presses this area a list will be displayed to the user. The list comprises of
various groups that the contact may be assigned to. The user may select a specific group from the list
and assign the new contact to that particular group.
                                                    14

[138]     When the user presses this icon they will save all added data on the screen.
[139] The user may add a profile photo for their new contact by pressing on this profile holder
section. The interface that will be loaded is 202.
[140] If the user presses this icon a list of contact point types will appear, similar to 151. The user
may select one of these contact point types and add them to the details of the new contact.
[141] By default there are three contact point types preloaded with empty fields allowing the user to
enter relevant details easily, if necessary this can be altered and there could a numerous different
fields with various contact point types as mentioned in 99. If one of these contact point fields has no
data added to it and the user presses a save button then such fields will be ignored and not displayed
on the saved contacts detail screens.
[142]     When the user presses this icon they will save all added data on the screen, the same result as
110.
[143] When the user presses this option they begin the process to have a business card transcribed
into text and be added to their contacts list.
[144] The user has two options to select a photo, on this option, the user can select a photo which is
already stored on their device. If the user selects this option, they will be presented with an option to
select the photo from their device and then progress to 120.
[145] The user may also decide to take a live photo of the business card or item they wish to have
transcribed.
[146] If the user selects 117 then the camera will automatically load and allow the user to select
what they would like to take a photo of. The user may also select other camera functions such as
whether to use a flash, focus and zoom. There should be at least 3 options for the flash which are auto
(allows the device to decide whether a flash is needed or not), forced (force the flash to be used) or off
(turn the flash off for the photo).
[147] When the user presses this button the image will be taken as a photo and the user will be
prompted 'Save' or 'Cancel' the image after viewing the result. If the user selects 'Save' then the user
will progress to 120.
[148] This is the crop and rotate screen. The user may crop the image by manipulating the corner
segments of the highlighter area.
[149] The user may also rotate the image. If the user presses the below icon, the image will rotate
anti-clockwise. The percentage of rotation can be set to any amount, however, it is recommended that
the rotation percentage be set for 90 degrees as default.
[150] If the user presses the below icon the image with rotate clockwise.              The same details
described in 121 will also apply here.
[151] When the user has finished rotating and cropping the image, they make select this icon to
move to the next stage. Once the user presses this icon, the highlighted area of the image and the
rotated angle of the image will be cropped and the dim areas of the image will be discarded. The
cropped part of the image will be used in further steps.
[152] This is the filter screen. On the filter screen the user may select a filter effect to impose onto
their image. There should be at least 23 filter options available to the user, including, but not limited
to, filters known by the names of; 1977, amaro, brannan, earlybird, hefe, hudson, inkwell, lomo,
                                                    15

lordkelvin, nashville, rise, sierra, sutro, toaster, valencia, walden, xproll, contrast, brightness, sepia,
vignette, tonecurve, lookup. The user may select various filters via an options list that previews the
expected results of the filter onto the actual image. When the user selects one of these previews it will
automatically display in a larger format to allow the user a good idea of how the image will be altered.
If the user does not select any filter then the photo will just retain its normal appearance.
[153] When the user has finished selecting the filter effect, if any, they may press this icon and
progress to the next screen which allows the user to review the final image.
[154] After the user presses 125 a confirmation screen will load. The image will be displayed here
allowing the user to view the quality of the final image product. The user should be able to zoom in
on the image if required.
[155] There should be a note confirming that the user should check that the image is legible so that
the image may have a higher success rate at being transcribed.
[156] If the image is not satisfactory to the user then the user may restart the process by pressing
this option.
[157] If the user is satisfied with the quality of the image and wishes to continue then the user may
press this option and progress. At this stage the user should be prompted and asked whether the user
would like to upload a second image of the other side of the business card. If the user selects to add
another photo the flow from 115 should begin again.
[158] A final note of the transcription may be displayed before the process is activated. Note the
user should have a live internet connection before the request can be completed as the transcription
occurs outside of the local software solution. After the user has confirmed the final step in 129 or 130
then 131 should be loaded automatically.
[159] Note, this screen can be accessed via the More list screen 278. Once the final step of the
transcription request has been activated, the general details of the transcription will be displayed on
this screen, the business card transcription list screen. This screen will display a complete list of all
transcriptions and their current status. Successful cards will also be listed here but could be removed
after any type of user confirmation or removed based on a timed system.
[160]     An image of the business card which was transcribed should be displayed here.
[161] The time and date of that the transcription was done should be displayed here which will
include the time, day, month and year.
[162] The status of the scan will be displayed in this section. The statuses can range between
scanned, rejected, in progress or awaiting internet connection.
[163] A user can also add a business card transcription request from this screen by pressing on this
icon. If the user presses on this icon then 116 and 117 will be displayed and the process will progress
as illustrated.
[164] If the transcription has been successful then the user may press in this area and load another
screen which displays details of the successful transcription. Once a transcription is successful the
transcribed details will be automatically added to the user's contact list as a business card device
contact on the TM software.
[165] This screen will display a list of details which have been transcribed for the relevant
transcription request. The name of the transcribed contact should be displayed at the top of the list as
well as an image of the transcribed business card. The image of the transcribed business card can be
                                                      16

manipulated (zoom, scroll, etc) so that the user may view the image in detail without loading the
image into a new screen making it easier for the user to compare the business card image and the
transcribed data below.
[166] Additional details that have been transcribed on the card will be listed here, including but not
limited to details such as, company name, position, business type, location, address, phone number,
mobile number, fax number, web URL, social media URL, email address, notes and any additional
details found on the business card. All such details will be displayed under the title of "KEEP" and
have a green background colour so that the user understands the details in this section will be kept
should the user Accept the transcribed data.
[167] The user also has the ability to manually add additional data to the transcribed data returned
and displayed on this screen. By tapping an icon designed to allow the additional data option to
appear, the user will be able to choose from a list additional data types, such as those listed in 138 and
elsewhere in this document, and add that new data and data type to the transcribed data as many times
as they desire.
[168] There may be parts of the image that have not been transcribed accurately or incorrect. The
user may choose to reject and 'Retry' the transcription process over again. Should the user press
Retry, there will be 3 options that appear 144, 145 and 146.
[169] If the user accepts the transcribed data the flow should proceed based on whether the user has
processed a free transcription (standard structure) or a paid transcription. If the user has paid for
credits and used credits to transcribe the data, then the user will be given a choice or Viewing the
newly created contact (based on the data the user has just accepted) or returning to the transcription
list 131. If the user has proceeded based on a free transcription the user will then be prompted to
notify the owner of the business card that the transcription has been completed on this software
service and an email or text message or similar notification option carrying a message to notify the
owner of the business card will be sent. Preferably the email or the phone number of the recipient
(owner of the business card) will be derived from the transcribed data of the business card,
alternatively, the user may manually enter a contact point to send the notification to or if there is no
email or mobile phone number the transcription process can be completed without any notification
and the contact is then added to the user's contact list inside the TM software.
[170] To edit returned data the user may press and hold down on any piece of data they wish to edit.
In this case the user may hold down on the data +61732212416 and an edit box will appear 142.
[171] The user noticed the number has been correctly transcribed, but the data type assigned was
incorrect. The data type assigned was a mobile number, however, the data is a landline number so the
user left the data intact and changed the data type to the correct landline data type. Once the user has
finished editing the data or the data type the user can press "Save" and the updates will be
immediately saved back to 138. It should be noted that the user may not edit the contact name and
assign a new data type without selecting a replacement data type to be the new contact name. A user
may select any piece of data in section 138 and assign it as the contact name in which case the contact
name will then be moved into 138 after being replaced with the newly selected contact name data.
[172] The user may easily discard or keep various data that has been returned in the transcription.
In this case, the address, "Level 19/144 Edward Street .." had been located in the Keep (green) section
of 138 but the user tapped that item and it automatically was moved to the Discard (red) section and a
brief pop up notification was shown so the user is informed about what happened to the data. If the
                                                    17

user presses Accept (140) and there is data located in the Discard section, that data will be
permanently deleted and removed from this contact's details.
[173] This option has appeared after the user pressed 139. This option states that parts of the
transcription are correct but the user would like to retry the transcription process to fix the remaining
incorrect parts and if the user chooses this option the user should be given the opportunity to select
which parts of the transcription are presently correct. The parts of the transcription that the user labels
as being presently correct will then be stored and saved on the TM Software throughout the next
process and displayed again after the new transcription request has been completed. If this option 144
is pressed then the process should begin again from 115.
[174] The second option states that no part of the transcription is correct and if the user selects this
option the process should restart again from 115 and all details of the previous transcription should be
automatically and permanently discarded.
[175] The third option allows the user the opportunity to return to the previously transcribed data
screen and manually edit any mistakes.
[176] When the TM contact is pressed in the displayed area of 76 then the TM contact's contact
point profile screen is loaded.
[177] If the owner of the TM contact account being viewed has a name on their account and that
name is available to the user through the application of privacy then the name of the TM account
owner should be displayed here. If the TM contact account being viewed does not have a name on
their account or the name is not available because of privacy restrictions, then the TM ID should be
displayed here. This is also described in 72.
[178]    The location of the TM user should be displayed here.
[179] The relevant profile image of the TM account holder should be displayed here, please check
71 for more details regarding how it should be displayed and which image should be displayed. As
with the description in 77, any profile photo inside the TM software may be pressed and held down
for 1 to 1.5 seconds and after such time an extend menu will appear allowing the user to access
features and interact further with that respective contact.
[180] This is the TM add contact point icon. A user may add contact points to another TM account
but any such added contact points may only be viewed by the adding TM user unless the other TM
account holder approves the contact point and accepts it as part of their list.
[181] This is the share icon. The user may press on this share icon if they wish to share details of
the TM contact they are viewing with another person.
[182] If the user presses this section there will appear a list of various grouping options. The user
may select a group from the list and add that TM contact to the particular group that is selected. One
result of a TM contact being added to a particular group could give that TM contact in that particular
group access to different or additional details on the TM user who has grouped that contact. The list
of group names can expand as necessary, but an example of group options are; Friends, Family,
Places, Work, None (no group allocation).
[183] To the right is the TM contact point icon. If the user presses this icon or the data to the right
of this icon then it will load a chat message conversation with that respective TM user.
[184] To the right is a landline phone contact point icon. If the user presses on this icon or the data
to the right of this icon then a phone call will be placed to the respective number.
                                                      18

[185] To the right is a mobile phone contact point icon. If the user presses on this icon or the data
to the right of this icon then a phone call will be placed to the respective number.
[186] To the right is an email contact point icon. If the user presses on this icon or the data to the
right of this icon then an email compose screen will be opened by the device using the default email
app on the device of the user. The email compose screen will automatically be populated with the
relevant email data associated with that particular contact point.
[187] To the right is a SMS contact point icon. If the user presses on this icon or the data to the
right of this icon then a SMS conversation or compose screen will be opened. This function can
operate differently on various devices, but generally the user will be taken to the SMS interface using
the respective number associated with the SMS icon.
[188] To the right is a call back request icon. If the user presses on this icon or the data to the right
of this icon then the call back request process will begin.
[189] There are other types of contact points that are not represented in this image. Such contact
point types are, but are not limited to, Skype, facebook, twitter, instagram, wechat, kakaotalk, viber,
linkedin, googleplus, meetup, pininterest, vine, VK. Any type of service that allows messaging and
any type of service that allows communication, such as but not limited to, voice over internet protocol
calls. When the user presses on any such contact points the TM software will load the relevant
software related to that contact point and preferably link directly with the message section, phone
section or conversation section of such software using API and URI mapping techniques. For
example, if a TM user has a skype contact point and that contact point is pressed, then the TM
software will check whether there is skype software present on the user device, then if there is skype
software present, use the skype username and details to locate and load the relevant data associated
with the TM contact point. This may also happen in a web environment.
[190] This area represents the general section that a TM contact's contact points are displayed in.
Contact points can be ordered by the TM user viewing another TM account holder who is a contact of
the TM user. Contact points can also be ordered by the owner of a TM account as explained in 287.
For example, assume that the contact points list being displayed in the dash lined box has been set the
TM contact account owner, in this case 'Abby'. Abby has listed her preferred contact point order
beginning with her TM message contact point, id423432(position 1), followed by her landline phone
number, 434 12345678(position 2), followed by her mobile phone number, 123 132 2341(position 3),
followed by her email address, somebody@gmail.com(position 4), followed by her email address,
another@mail.com(position 5), followed by her request a call back(position 6). A note should be
made that in this scenario, if Abby owned the account being displayed in 74 then Abby's contact point
positions 1 to 4 would be displayed from left (starting on position 1) to right. Under the assumption
that Abby has set the order of her contact points and the user viewing the contact points in Abby's
contact points profile screen has not re-ordered them, then the default order that the user viewing the
contact points in will be the order set by Abby. The user viewing the contact points can also change
the order of Abby's contact points to their own preferred order thus altering the original order set by
Abby, the owner of the TM contact account that is being viewed. In such a scenario there should be
multiple copies of the preferred order list of Abby's contact points, one copy, the master copy, which
only Abby can set will remain unchanged and then a new ordered list set by the user viewing Abby's
TM account will also be recorded. For example, assume there are 3 TM users, TM1, TM2 and TM3.
TM1 has 3 contact points and sets them as: Phone number 1234 in position 1, email hello@mail.com
in position 2 and TM message contact point in position 3. When TM2 loads TMl's contact profile
screen the contact point list is displayed in the above order as TM1 has set it. TM2 then adds TM 1 to
                                                      19

their contact list and decides to alter TMl's contact points order list. TM2 changes TMl's TM
message to position 1, hello@mail.com to position 3 and phone number 1234 to position 2. TM2 now
has an updated order of TMl's contact point list which is stored individually for TM2. The original
order that TM1 set is not altered, so when TM3 views TMl's contact point list, TM3 will see the
original list that TM1 has set, being position 1, phone number 1234, email hello@mail.com position 2
and TM message contact point in position 3. TM3 then adds TMI to TM3's contacts and then decides
to alter the order of the contact point list on TM1. TM3 changes the phone number 1234 from
position 1 to position 3. When the position of the phone number is changed, the other remaining
positions automatically slide up, so position 2, the email, becomes position 1 and position 3, the TM
message, becomes position 2. The same works in the reverse effect for a contact point being moved
from a lower position to a higher position. The final result is that TM3 also has a new individually
recorded order of TMl's contact points, TM2 has a different individually recorded list of TMl's
contact points and TM 1 still has their master version of TM l's preferred order of TM l's own contact
point. Any other TM users aside from TM2 and TM3 who have not set a preferred order on the
contact points of TM 1 will be default see the order that TM 1 has set on TM l's contact points list until
such time as the other TM users add TM1 to their contact list and alter TM's contact points order list
individually. If the viewing user wishes to alter the list via the TM software, the user must press and
hold down on the contact point for at least 1 second. After that period the contact points list will
become manoeuvrable. The user must continue to hold down on the contact point and then, while
continuing to hold down, move the contact point up or down the contact points list. As the contact
point is moved in the aforementioned scenario, the other contact points will slide accordingly to make
space for the moving contact point to fit. Once the user is happy with the position that they wish to
place the contact point they user may release the hold and the contact point will be placed in that
position and saved. The updated order of contact points will also be reflected in every other part of
the TM software where the general details, such as those displayed in 73 and 74 and 58 and so forth
are displayed.
[191] When the user presses this icon the TM contact's more screen will be loaded. As with all
other sections, on this screen only details that the viewing user has access to can be viewed. The
access is determined by privacy settings set by the TM contact account owner.
[192] This icon represented the audio icon for the TM contact. If the user presses on this icon and
the TM contact has an audio file uploaded that is also accessible to the user viewing based on the
privacy settings, then the audio message will be played back to the user.
[193] This is the web tab. When the user presses the web tab then the web tab details will be
displayed in the lower section of the screen.
[194] If the TM contact has added social media web links to their account then such will be
displayed here under an icon. If the user has added an extensive list of social media web links then
the list should scroll horizontally. If the user presses on a social media icon then the web link the TM
contact has associated with that social media icon will be loaded for the user.
[195] If the TM contact has added any general web links to share then they will be displayed in this
area. Each web link will have a title and then the actual web link address displayed together. If the
user presses on the title or the web link then that web link will load into a browser automatically.
[196] If the user wishes to share the web link with someone then they may press on this icon. When
the icon is pressed the TM software will call default share options on the user device that the web link
details may be shared via.
                                                     20

[197] This is the about tab. When the user presses the about tab then the about tab details will be
loaded and displayed in the lower section of the screen.
[198] If the TM contact has set a primary master web link then such will be displayed on this screen
in this general area.
[199]     If the TM contact has set a blurb on their TM account then that blurb will be displayed here.
[200] This is the feed tab. If the user presses on the feed tab then the feed tab details will be
displayed in the lower section of the screen.
[201] If the TM contact has posted any feed items to their feed screen then those feed items will be
displayed here. Generally each feed item consists of a title, text content and if the user has added a
photo then also a photo will be displayed.
[202] Below is the first screen in the share contact screens interface. This share screen feature is a
process which allows a user to send details of their own or details of one of their contacts to another
person either via email, phone or through the TM network though the options should not be limited to
the aforementioned three. The software breaks up the details being sent into individual pieces of data
as is displayed throughout the share screens. The user can decide exactly which data to send based on
the relevant data that is on hand for the particular contact whose details are being sent, in some
scenarios, if the user has selected to send their own personal data from an option on the More screen
list or from another such option inside the TM software then the relevant data may be of the user too.
[203]      This section displays the number of individual data pieces that are being attached to the
contact share. A data pieces is any piece of data that can be optionally selected in the lower section
178 of this screen. Some examples for data pieces are any type of contact point, address, profile
photo, business name and so forth. A data piece could be any type of data associated with a contact
whether the contact be a TM contact or a device contact. As a piece of data is selected or deselected
the counter in this section will be adjusted to reflect such actions by the user.
[204] The user must select how the shared contact details will be sent to the party receiving the
share. The user will have, but is not limited to having, three options to choose from which determine
how the data will be sent to the receiving party. If the user selects this first option then the data will
be sent via email once the share process has been completed. The selected data will be attached to
the email in VCF format or another format.
[205] Please read 175 for further details. If the user selects this second option then the data will be
sent via the TM network. The selected data will be attached to the TM network notification in VCF
format or another format.
[206] Please read 175 for further details. If the user selects this third option then the data will be
sent via phone, by default SMS, with the selected data attached to the SMS in VCF format or another
format.
[207] This is the lower section of the share screen which in this case displays the available data
which can be sent for the relevant contact. The user may select or deselect pieces of data by pressing
on the squares to the right of the highlighted area. Once a box is selected it will be highlighted to the
user and the data counter 174 will reflect the number of data pieces selected by the user.
[208] It should be noted that if the user has multiple profile photos as described in flow after 320
and the user wishes to share their own details with another person via this flow from 174, then the
user will have the ability to tap on the profile photo detail as displayed under 178a and a new screen
                                                     21

will load giving the user the ability to choose their desired photo from the profile photo images added
in the 320 flow.
[209] The user may tap on their desired photo from the list and the new photo should be displayed
in a way that the user understands that is the photo they are selecting. If the user selects a photo and
presses 'Select', then that photo should be displayed in 178a in place of the profile photo icon.
[210]    The user may select all available pieces of data by pressing on this 'All' option.
[211] When the user has finished making selections in this part of the share screen the 'Next' button
may be pressed and the share process will begin to the next screen. All data selected in this section
will be stored and remembered by the TM software until the data needs to be set into VCF format or
another format.
[212] This is the second screen of the share process. On this screen the user may select who the
recipient or recipients of the contact data selected in the first step should be.
[213]    If the user presses this icon then the share process will return to the first share screen 173.
[214] Similar to 174, this area will display the number of recipients who will receive the data. As
the user selects recipients via the lower section of this screen or via adding recipients manually the
counter will increase and decrease accordingly.
[215] The user may add recipients manually by pressing this icon. Recipients may only be added
based on the selection the user made in 175, 176 or 177. If the user selected 175 for example, email,
then the user may only add email addresses for further recipients of this particular share scenario. If
the user select 176, then only other TM users may be added as recipients or if the user selected 177
then only phone numbers may be added to the recipients list.
[216] The user may press this section and search for recipients to add to the recipient list. There is a
specific list of options displayed in 186, this search box will only return results from that specific list
as that specific list will be populated only with particular contacts as described in 186.
[217] This is the lower section of the second share screen which displays possible contacts the user
may select to share the data which was selected on the first share screen 173. This list is determined
based on the method the user selected to share the data via, 175, 176 or 177. Contacts, whether the
contacts be TM contacts or device contacts, which have data stored against them which is the same as
the selection the user made in 175, 176 or 177 will be displayed in this list 186. For example, if the
user 175 as the method to send the data via, then only TM contacts and device contacts which have an
email available in their individual contact points list will be displayed as options in 186 to send the
data to. If there are more than one email address as a contact point per result displayed in 186, then
multiple results for the one account should be displayed as often as needed to display each email
contact point for each relevant result contact, an example of how this would look for one contact that
has two email address is 188. If the user selected 176, then only TM contacts will be displayed in the
186 section. If the user selected 177, then only TM contacts and device contacts which have a phone
number will be displayed in the 186 section and results that have more than one phone number as a
contact point will be displayed using the same logic as explained above for users that have multiple
email contact points. Each result may be selected using the box on the right side of this highlighted
area similar to the explanation in 178.
[218]    If the user presses this option then all available results in 186 will be selected.
[219] The area displayed inside the box is an example of how results would be displayed for a result
that has multiple contact points that are the same type and relevant to what the user selected in 175,
                                                      22

176 or 177. In this example, the user has selected 175, email, and the TM software has returned a list
of all TM contacts and device contact which have at least one email in their contact points list. For
TM contacts or device contacts that have more than one email address in their contact points list each
contact point of the relevant type will be displayed under the same name or TMID. In the case of 188
the contact result, Jimmy Muso, has two email addresses in his contact point list, both of which are
available to the user, therefore, one result is displayed for each of Jimmy Muso's email addresses.
The name of the contact is displayed on the top line and the contact point details are displayed on the
line under it for each result. The same application will be adapted for when the user selects 177 by
following the above guidelines for email addresses. If the user selects 176 then only TM contacts will
be displayed without any data display in the lower section.
[220] As illustrated in 188, the top line will display the name or TMID of the contact using the
general guidelines conveyed earlier in this document. The lower line is reserved to display the contact
point data or nothing depending on the logic assumed from 188.
[221] When the user has finished making selections from 181 and 184 (if necessary), they may
press the 'Share' icon to view a final list of contacts the details are being sent to.
[222] If the user selected 175 and then wanted to add additional recipients by pressing 184, then this
screen will load. On this screen, the user may manually add additional email addresses of recipients if
required.
[223]    The user may enter an email into the below section.
[224] Once the user has entered an email into 192, the user may press this icon to the right and add
the email to the list area below 194. The user may continue to manually add emails as desired.
[225] The area below is used to display the list of manually added email addresses. As each email
is added from 193, there will be an automatic selected state passed to the data which is displayed in
the box to the right with a tick inside. The user may deselect or reselect any manually added email
addresses as desired. The user may select a hybrid of contacts from 181 and 191, all will be recorded
and passed when the user activates 190.
[226] The below icon allows the user to toggle back to the 181 screen, the second share screen. The
user may visit 191 again via 184.
[227] If the user selected 177 and then wanted to add additional recipients by pressing 184, then this
screen will load. On this screen, the user may manually add additional phone numbers of recipients if
required. The general flow and logic on this screen is the same as 191 - 194 except manually added
contact point type is a phone number, not an email address.
[228] If the user selected 176 and then wanted to add additional recipients by pressing 184, then this
screen will load. On this screen, the user may manually add additional TMIDs of recipients if
required. The general flow and logic on this screen is the same as 191 - 194 except TMIDs are being
manually added, not email addresses.
[229] When the user presses 198 this screen will and displayed a listed result of all the selected
recipients, both added from 181 and either 191, 196 or 197. The list allows the user to confirm who
they are sharing the contact data selected on 173 with.
[230]    If the user presses this icon it will automatically remove the recipient from the list.
[231] If the user presses the 'Cancel' option, then the 198 pop up screen will disappear and the user
will be returned to the screen which they pressed 'Share' 190 on.
                                                      23

[232] If the user presses the 'Ok' option, then the share process will commence to the final stage
depending whether the user selected 175, 176 or 177. If the user selected 175, the a local email app
will be called on the user's device and a new compose email screen will be loaded. The email
addresses of all the selected recipients will be automatically placed in the new compose email receiver
section under the BCC (Blind Carbon Copy) option by default. Some default text will populate the
email title and content which the user may edit if they so wish. The list of data selected in 173 will be
compiled into a VCF (virtual card file) format, also known as vCard, or another format and will be
automatically attached to the compose email screen and will be sent with the email once the user
executes the send email option on that screen. If the user selected 177 a text message interface will be
called on the user's device and a new text message screen will be loaded. The phone numbers of all
the selected recipients will be automatically placed into the receiver section of this screen. There will
be some default text that populates the content section of the text message which can be edited by the
user if required. The list of data selected in 173 will be compiled into a VCF (virtual card file)
format, also known as vCard, or another format and will be automatically attached to the compose
text message screen and will be sent with the text message once the user executes the send option on
the screen. If the user selected the 176 option then the list of data selected in 173 will be compiled
into a VCF (virtual card file) format, also known as vCard, or another format and will be
automatically sent to the other TM recipients over the TM network.
[233] When the device contact is pressed in the (upper) displayed area of 76 then the device
contact's contact point profile screen is loaded. This screen has very similar functionality as 147,
however, some key differences are the ability to add and edit contact points freely. Essentially, the
device contact is a contact that has no owner operating it besides the user, this is unlike the TM
contact which has an owner who is a different TM user and who controls and sets various data on the
TM contact.
[234]    The name of the contact is displayed here. The contact must have a name.
[235] The location or address of the contact is displayed here.           If the contact does not have an
address or location then this space is left empty.
[236] The profile image of the contact is displayed here. If the user does not have a profile photo
then a default image is displayed. If the user wishes to add or edit a profile photo for the contact then
the user may press the white plus icon located toward the lower right of the image holder area. Once
that icon is pressed the process to add or replace the profile image will begin . The device contact is
identifiable by the badge in the top right position of the circular profile image.
[237] This is the share icon. The user may press on this share icon if they wish to share details of
the device contact they are viewing with another person. When the user presses this icon the flow
listed in 173 will begin.
[238] The user may press on this 'All' button and a list of group options will appear. The user may
add the contact to a particular group via this dialog. For more details please read 153.
[239] This is the device contact add contact point icon. A user may add contact points to their
device contact via the pop up screen. All contact points may be added apart from'request a call back'.
[240] This area represents the general section that a device contact's contact points are displayed in.
The explanation of this section is covered in 161, however, there are some slight differences. In 161
the explanation is for a TM contact though in this section 209 is relevant for a device contact. A
device contact's contact points and profiles are predominately accessed via the logged in TM user who
has that device contact synced into their TM software either by 75 or another means, therefore, the list
                                                     24

of contact points here can predominately be controlled by the TM user who is logged into their device
using the TM software. The user can order and reorder this list of contact points using the same
method explained in 161, the order of the contact points for the device contact must be saved for the
logged in user. The device contact is not a live TM user and cannot control its own contact material,
the user is responsible for updating details to a device contact, therefore, the ordered contact list only
needs to be recorded for the user. Typical contact point types for this section are described in 154,
155, 156, 157, 158, 160 and other areas of this document.
[241] Above is the edit icon for the device contact's contact point profile screen. When the user
presses this icon the screen will change to edit mode 211.
[242] After the user presses 210 the device contact's contact point profile screen will enter into edit
mode. All of the contact points for that relevant device contact will be editable by the user. Once the
user has edited any required contact points the updates may be saved via the icon on below 211.
Preferably if the user forgets to press the icon below 211 then the updates will be automatically saved
once the user leaves the screen.
[243] In edit mode the user will also be able press the icon below to delete the contact point from
the list. The user should be prompted when using the delete option to confirm whether the user does
or does not want to delete the contact point pressed.
[244] The icon below when pressed by the user will take the user to the device contact's more
profile screen where additional details which are not displayed on the device contact's contact point
profile screen 202 can be displayed.
[245] This is the device contact's more screen. Some additional details of the device contact are
displayed on this screen which includes, but is not limited to, an address and or a location, websites,
social media URLs, birthday, job type or position, name of business and so forth. You will note that
as with other areas within the TM software, some parts of this screen are similar with other screens
which already have explanations set on the various features and in the interest of brevity will not be
explained again here.
[246] The user may press this icon to add new addition details to the device contact's contact details.
Such additions were mentioned in 214.
[247] The user may view or edit the location and or address of the device contact here. If there is a
valid location or address in this section to the right and the user presses on this section then a map will
be loaded displaying a location using the relevant details supplied in 216.
[248] The user may view or edit a website URL of the device contact here. If there is a valid
website URL in this section to the right and the user presses on this section then a web page will load
the relevant details supplied in 217.
[249] The user may view or edit a social media URL of the device contact here. If there is a valid
social media website URL on display to the right and the user presses on this section then a web page
will load using the relevant details supplied in 218.
[250]     The user may view or edit the birthday of the device contact here.
[251]     The user may view or edit the job title of the device contact here.
[252]     The user may view or edit the name of the workplace of the device contact here.
[253]     Above is the edit icon for the device contact's more profile screen. When the user presses
this icon the screen will change to edit mode 223.
                                                     25

 [254] After the user presses 222 the device contact's more profile screen will enter into edit mode.
All of the details for that relevant device contact will be editable by the user. Once the user has edited
any required details the updates may be saved via the icon on below 223. Preferably if the user
forgets to press the icon below 223 then the updates will be automatically saved once the user leaves
the screen.
 [255]   The user may edit the name of the contact here.
 [256] The user may delete a detail which is displayed in edit mode by pressing on an icon such as is
displayed below 225.
 [257]   This is the message tab icon. When the user presses on this tab the message screen will load.
 [258] The user may press on this section and a list of relevant groups will appear. The relevant
groups are determined by the types and names of groups the user has applied to their contacts and as
an example would be something similar to that explained in 68. The user may select one of the listed
groups and upon selected such a group on conversations from contacts stored in that group will be
displayed in the message list section of this screen.
 [259] The icon to the right is the search icon. If the user presses on this icon they will have the
option to search their entire message content for a particular phrase or reference. If the user enters
any type of phrase or reference into this section then only conversations which have such relevant
records of such phrase or reference will be displayed in the message list section of this screen.
 [260] The user may press on the icon to the left to begin a conversation with a new person. The
user will have an option to start a text message conversation with another person via manually
entering a phone number. A conversation with a TM user can also be started via the TM profile
screens.
 [261] This section displays the profile image of the user. As with any profile image display in the
TM software, if the user long holds onto the profile image they will receive an expanded list of
options which they can choose from to interact with that user, one such example is displayed in 77. If
the user presses on the profile image quickly, not a long hold, then the contact points profile screen of
that device contact or TM contact will be loaded.
 [262] Below is where the name of the contact will be displayed. If it is a device contact then the
name of the device contact will be displayed. If it is a TM contact then the TM ID will be displayed,
however, if the user has access to the TM contact's name based on privacy settings, then the name of
the TM contact will be displayed. If it is not a device contact or a TM contact, for example, if it is
just a text (SMS) conversation with another person which has been stored on the device and that
person or phone number has not been recorded as a device contact on the phone, then the phone
number of the other party involved in the conversation will be listed in this section.
 [263] Below is where the location of the contact will be listed if the contact is a TM contact. If the
contact is a device contact then the phone number that the text conversation of the device contact will
be listed. If it is not a device contact or a TM contact but a text (SMS) conversation with another
person who is not stored as a device contact, then nothing will be displayed here.
 [264] This section displays the time and date of the last message sent or received in the relevant
conversation. This could be displayed in time and date format or one of many other formats,
including the 'how long ago' format, for example, 5 mins ago, 2 hrs ago, 4 days ago, 1 week ago, 2
months ago, 5 years ago etcetera.
                                                     26

[265] The section to the left is where a partial excerpt of the most recent message is displayed. If
the message is longer than a certain number of characters then only the first part of the message will
be displayed, whatever amount that can be displayed on the space given for this section. Please see
235 if the last message was an image.
[266]    The icon to the left is shown if the last message in the conversation contained an image.
[267] There should be some type of display to notify the user whether the message is a new unread
message or a read message. In this example we have used the upper example displayed as an unread
message by having a shaded area around the highlighted area of the conversation summary listed
article and the lower example displayed as a read message by having no shaded area in the same area.
[268] If the user presses in this area then the conversation screen will be loaded with all relevant
chat conversation with that person or contact 238.
[269] This is the chat conversation screen. On this screen all of the chat content for a conversation
between the user and another contact or contacts or person or people is listed, all of the
aforementioned may be understood as parties. Relevant conversation, photo and file details between
relevant parties is displayed on this screen.
[270] Below is where the name or TMID of the contact should be displayed or the phone number if
the conversation is not with a contact. The logic to determine which should be displayed is explained
throughout this document, for example, most recently in 231.
[271] To the left is an icon which displays whether the user is currently online or not. This is only
applicable for other TM users.
[272] The profile photo of the recipient should be displayed. If the contact does not have a profile
photo, or the other party is not a contact but just a phone number, then a default profile image should
be displayed. As with all profile images throughout the TM software, if the user long holds on the
profile image then an expanding menu will appear. If the user taps on the profile image then the
contact point profile screen will be loaded for that respective contact. If the profile image is
representing a phone number which is not yet a contact then nothing will happen when the profile
image is tapped.
[273] This area should display message content from the other party or parties in the conversation.
Such details as, but not limited to, text message content, name of other party, files, photos, time, date
and emoticons can be displayed in this area.
[274] As with 242, this area should display message content from the user. Details of what could be
displayed in this area can be found in 242.
[275] The user may see their own profile image in this part below and standard interaction with
profile images applies.
[276] If the user wishes to delete a conversation they may press on the highlighted area below and
then a delete option will appear here in 245. The user may then delete the selected part or parts by
then pressing on 245.
[277] If the user presses this icon an interface will open which will allow the user to send a file or
photo to the other party or parties in the conversation. If the receiving party is also a TM user then the
file or photo will be sent via the TM network. If the receiving party is a device contact or a phone
number, then a photo will be uploaded to the TM server and a URL directly accessing the photo will
                                                     27

be sent to the receiver via standard SMS text message. The receiver can then access the file or photo
via the URL that is sent to them via SMS.
[278] The user may press in this area to type their desired message in characters available from the
QWERTY keyboard. A user may send a photo or file and add a message also via 247. Once the user
is satisfied with their message they may press the send button 248 and the content of the message will
be sent in it the appropriate format.
[279] Below is the send icon. The user may press this icon to action the sending of the message or
file or photo added from 246 and 247. Once 248 has been pressed there will be a display allowing the
user to see that the message is trying to be sent. Once the message has been sent successfully it will
appear as normal in the conversation screen chat flow. If the user is trying to send a message or file
or photo to another TM user and the user sending does not have an active internet connection, then the
message will be set in a queue in the TM software and sent automatically once the TM software
detects an active internet connection.
[280] If the user has selected to send a photo then a pop up option box will appear which allows the
user to select a photo from their device gallery or take a live photo 250. If the user selects to choose a
photo from their device gallery the device gallery will then be loaded.
[281]     The user may select to take a live photo, this general process has already been described in
117.
[282] The user may navigate and select a photo from their device on this screen. Once the user has
located and selected their photo the process will automatically load that photo into the crop and rotate
screen.
[283] This is the crop and rotate screen where the user may crop and rotate the image they selected.
A further explanation can be viewed in 120.
[284]     The user may press this icon to proceed to the next screen in the process.
[285] This is the filter screen. The user may select from a list of filters and apply that filter onto the
photo which has just been cropped and rotated. A further explanation of this screen can be viewed in
124.
[286] Once the user is happy with the final step of the process, selecting the filter, the user may
press this icon and proceed back to the conversation screen and have the photo added and ready to be
sent.
[287] The process photo image will be displayed here as a miniature thumbnail and a message may
be attached to the image if required.
[288] The user may press this icon when ready and the photo message will be sent accordingly.
More details can be viewed in 248.
[289] Once the photo message has been sent successfully, the image and any message will appear in
the conversation list flow. As with most parts of the TM software, details are stored locally on the
TM software in an internal database, images are also included in the data stored in the local internal
database and are synced with the main server when an internet connection is active. If the user
presses on an image in the chat flow they can load a larger version of the image which can be
manipulated and saved 259.
                                                    28

[290] Here is the screen that is loaded when the user presses an image in the conversation flow, for
example, the image in 258. A larger version of the relevant image is loaded and the user may zoom in
260 and manoeuvre the image as desired.
[291] Here is an example of a zoomed in view of the image. The user may also scroll once the
image has been zoomed and manoeuvre to view various parts of the image closer.
[292] The user may press on this icon to display an option which allows the user to save the
relevant image to their local device. Once the user presses on 'Save picture' then the image will be
automatically saved to the user's local device storage and accessible via their standard device
interface. The image will continue to be available on the TM software interface as well.
[293] This is the history and filter screen tab icon. On this screen all call and message records are
displayed both from internally inside the TM software and externally imported from the device call
and message history list. The device call and message history can either be displayed based on the
user's device data or imported directly into the TM software and stored locally in the data base then
synced with the server.
[294] The user may press this and select from a list of groups which will appear, for more details
please see 227. The TM contacts or contacts will be displayed below based on what group the user
selects.
[295] The user may search their call and message history from this field. The user may enter any
particular search terms and the data will be returned based on what details the user enters.
[296] There are various filters displayed on this screen. When a filter is active it will manipulate
the results display of call and message history and display relevant details to the selected filter or
filters which are active. In some cases multiple filters may be selectable at any given time. The filters
displayed in this example are included but not limited to Contact, TM, Business, Recent, Popular and
Favourite. In this example, 'Contact', if the user presses on this filter then only device contacts and
TM contacts will be displayed in the history list, other entries in the history list, such as phone
numbers that have not been added as any type of contact, will not be displayed. By default, all results
will be displayed in order of date from the most recent.
[297] If the user presses on the 'TM' option, then only contacts or user's which are on the TM
network will be displayed in the results, all other non-TM network based results will be omitted.
[298] If the user presses on the 'Business' option, then only business history results will be
displayed. A business result is considered as a TM user which has registered their TM account as a
business or a call placed via screen 38.
[299] If the user presses on the 'Recent' option, then the relevant list will be displayed in order of
most recent correspondence. By default, all lists will be displayed in recent order unless the user has
selected otherwise.
[300] If the user presses on the 'Popular' option, then the relevant list will be displayed based on the
number of interactions the user has had with particular device contacts, TM contacts or phone
numbers. Popular selected alone will display the aforementioned based on tallied results over the
whole history of the recorded call and message relationship between the user and the TM contact,
device contact or phone number. One phone call would equal one tally point and one message would
equal one tally point.
                                                     29

[301] If the user presses on the 'Favourite' option, then the relevant list will be displayed based on
which TM contacts or device contacts that the user has set as their favourite contacts and will be
displayed in order from most recent actively.
[302] The user may select multiple filters at the same time which will create varying results in the
history list section. The results of such various mixed selections will be listed here. Further
descriptions of each filter may be required and can be found in 265, 266, 267, 268\, 269, 270 and
other places in this document. Contact and TM: The selection of these two filters will display only
TM contacts in the history list starting from most recent in order. Contact and Business: The selection
of these two filters will display any business category listings which are also a device contact or TM
contact and by default will be displayed in recent order. Contact and Popular: The selection of these
two filters will display contacts which are often used by the user in order from most popular to least
popular. Contact and Favourite: The selection of these two options will display the contacts which
have had favourite applied to it. TM and Business: The selection of these two filters will display all
TM users which are also a Business and will be displayed in recent order. TM and Recent: The
selection of these two filters will display all TM users in recent order. TM and Popular: The
selection of these two filters will display all TM users in the order of most popular to least based on
the history of the user. TM and Favourite: The selection of these two filters will display all TM users
which have had favourite applied to it by the user. Contact and TM and Popular: The selection of
these three filters will display all Contacts which are also TM users in order of most popular to least
popular. Contact and Business and Popular: The selection of these three filters will display all
Contacts which are Business and display them in order of most popular to least popular. TM and
Business and Popular: The selection of these three filters will display all TM users which are
Business and list them from the most popular to the least popular. Contact and TM and Popular and
Favourite: The selection of these four filters will display all Contacts which are TM users and have
been set as a favourite by the user and display them in the order of most popular to least popular. TM
and Business and Popular and Favourite: The selection of these three filters will display all TM users
which are also businesses and have been set as favourite by the user and display them in order from
most popular to least popular. Using the definitions supplied above the other various selections can
be determined,        other filter selection varieties        include:     Contact+Popular+Favourite,
TM+Popular+Favourite, Business+Popular+Favourite, Popular+Favourite, Favourite+Recent. For
Favourite plus Recent the selection of these two filters will display all favourites in history and
display then in a recent order. For Popular plus Favourite the selection of these two filters will
display all favourites in order of most popular to least popular.
[303] The profile image should be display accordingly as described earlier in this document and
displayed based on whether the history entry is a device contact, TM user or phone number.
[304] As with other sections of the TM software the name, TMID or phone number should be
displayed here depending on the history type. Please see 231 for more details.
[305] Relevant Contact Points should be displayed here if the history item is a TM user, TM user
which is also a TM contact or a device contact, please see 73 and 74 for more details. The items in
the history may also slide to reveal two additional Contact Points if existing. If the history item is a
phone number which is not a device contact then the a call icon and SMS icon should be displayed as
the two Contact Point items. When the user presses on any of the icons the appropriate action should
commence depending on which contact point was pressed. If the history item is a phone number then
when the SMS or call icon is pressed the relevant phone number should be used to action the
appropriate event.
                                                    30

[306] The area above displays the date of the history item and the type of contact that was made
concerning the history item. These two details should be displayed in this area. The date can be either
a traditional date style or a 'recent' time style as described elsewhere in this document. The type of
contact can also be multiple types, including but not limited to, incoming call, missed call, outgoing
call, sent message, received message, skype call, TM call and so forth. History results may also be
grouped into sections with titles, for example, today, yesterday, last week, a specific date and all
relevant history data can be stored under each title.
[307] This is an example of a history item that is not a TM contact, TM user or device contact. The
phone number of the history item is displayed accordingly. If the user presses in this highlighted area
then the user will be prompted to add that history item as a device contact. If the history item is a
phone number then when the slide function is initiated the two additional icons should be a plus icon,
to add the phone number as a contact, and a share icon, which brings up the standard share UI as in
174.
[308] If the history item is a TM user or device contact and the user presses in this highlighted area,
then the relevant contact's contact point profile screen should be loaded. If the history item is a TM
user who is or is not a TM contact then the TM user's contact point profile screen for that history item
should be loaded 147. If the history item is a device contact then the device contact's contact point
screen for that history item should be loaded 202.
[309] This is the more screen tab icon. When the user presses on this tab icon then the more screen
will be loaded with a list of various options. Access to features such as, but not limited to, the alerts
or alarms list, settings, view and edit my profile, share and invite, share my contact, backup contacts,
plans, privacy summary, TM groups and call-backs may all be accessed via the more screen.
[310] This is the alerts list item. If the user presses on this item the user may access the list of alerts
that they have set or past on their account at any given time. 86 is loaded when this part is presses,
please see 86 for further details regarding alerts.
[311] This is the settings list item. If the user presses on this item the user may access the settings
screen. The settings screen allows the user to adjust various aspects of the TM software and some of
those options can be found from 427 and following numbers.
[312] This is the View and Edit My Profile list item. If the user presses on this item the user may
access details regarding their profile and view and edit those details.
[313] This is the first View and Edit My Profile screen for the TM user's contact points profile
screen. The user may view, add and edit various details from their contact points profile screen on
this screen such as their contact points and their contact points order. The displayed arrow is pointing
to 'My Name' on this screen, in this part the user's TMID will be displayed. The TMID may not be
edited or deleted.
[314] If the user presses on the icon below then 174 will load and use the logged in user's details by
default throughout the share process - such details are taken from the process after 281. This icon 283
has the same function as 348.
[315] If the user presses on the icon below the user's contact points will change into edit mode and
more descriptions can be found in 285.
[316] This screen is an example of what the contact points profile screen appears like once the 284
edit mode icon has been activated. All contact points belonging to the user may be edited, deleted or
have privacy settings changed on it. The TMID may not be edited or deleted as this is a constant
                                                     31

primary key. Once the user has finished edited or deleting any contact points, they may press the icon
to the right to save any changes. Preferably there is a mechanism attached which allows any changes
to be automatically saved in case the user forgets to press the save icon to the right.
[317] Below is an example of the privacy icon. If the user presses on this icon the user will be able
to alter the privacy setting for that particular contact point, in this case a phone number which is
4(34)4232341. The privacy settings on each contact point will determine which other TM users or
non-TM public users will be able to view and access this particular contact point data. Examples of
the privacy options are, but are not limited to, public, contacts, friends, family, work, places, select
user, only me and shared. To view an example of this pop up list menu please view 335 . For more
details about how each of these privacy options function, please read 335.
[318] Below is an example of the user's contact point delete icon. If the user presses on this icon
then the relevant contact point will be deleted. The TM ID contact point ID cannot be deleted.
[319] In this highlighted section the contact points of the user will be displayed. For general details
about this section in normal mode you may see 161. In addition to the contact points and types
explained in 161, there is also an explanation about TM user's being able to set an order to their own
contact points and such an order is set on this screen. Contact points may be reordered in different
ways, however, for this example we have chosen a long hold strategy to allow the user to reorder their
contact points visually. The user may press and hold on any of their contact points, after 1.5 seconds
the contact point will be loosened from the list and the user may, while still holding down on the
unloosened contact point, manoeuvre that contact point up or down in the list of contact points and set
the contact point's new position by releasing the hold. Once a contact point has been moved to a
different position it will then be backed up and saved to be displayed to other TM users in the new
order set by the owner of the TM account. The contact point order set here by the TM user on their
own contact points list will be the default displayed to the public or other TM users who are accessing
or viewing the relevant TM user's profile details or contact points. The order set here will also
determine the order displayed in areas such as 58, 59, 73, 74, 161, 274 and so forth. As described in
161, if the accessing user is another TM user and such a TM user saves this TM user to their contact
list, then that TM user may rearrange the contact point order list for their own preference and in such
a scenario a new record only for that TM user will be established and this TM user's preferred contact
point order will remain intact also.
[320]     The user may press this icon to the right to add a new contact point to their contact point list
288.
[321] This is an example of the add a new contact point screen. A user may add a variety of contact
points to their contact point list. Various types of contact points that may be added here are
mentioned in 160 and 99. For this example we have five options being displayed.
[322] The section below is where the user may enter the particular details of any relevant contact
point. The prompt and the keyboard type should be altered based on the type of contact point the user
has selected to add. In this example you will note the that landline phone number icon has been
highlighter and therefore the prompt is appropriately 'New landline'. Because the contact point is a
phone number a dial pad soft keypad should appear 292. If, for example, the new contact point was
an email then the soft keyboard should appear in QWERTY format and preferably in email mode
meaning default icons such as '@' and or '.com' will be displayed by default. If the new selected
contact point was a skype ID for example, then the soft keyboard would appear in standard QWERTY
mode. As the user toggles between various contact point types the prompts and the keyboards should
automatically be adjusted to reflect the correct prompt and correct keyboard type.
                                                    32

[323] A dial pad soft keyboard has appeared by default in this example because the user has
highlighted the landline phone number icon 294.
[324] If the user presses the above icon then 291 will give the user the opportunity to add an email
type contact point to their contact list. The prompt should read 'Add an email address' and the soft
keyboard type should be QWERTY with default display of the '@' symbol and preferably a '.com'
option as well.
[325] If the user presses the above icon then 291 will give the user the opportunity to add a landline
phone number type contact point to their contact list. The prompt should read 'New Landline' and the
soft keyboard type should be a phone dial pad similar to the one displayed below in definition 292.
[326] If the user presses the above icon then 291 will give the user the opportunity to add a mobile
phone number type contact point to their contact list. The prompt should read 'New Mobile' and the
soft keyboard type should be a phone dial pad similar to the one displayed below in definition 292. If
the user adds a mobile number then by default there will also be a SMS version of that number added
to their contact list.
[327] If the user presses the above icon then 291 will give the user the opportunity to add a SMS
phone number type contact point to their contact list. The prompt should read 'New SMS Number'
and the soft keyboard type should be a phone dial pad similar to the one displayed below in definition
292. If the user adds a SMS contact point to their contact point list then no standard mobile number
should be added, only the SMS contact point alone.
[328] If the user presses the above icon then 291 will give the user the opportunity to add a call
back type contact point to their contact list. In this case there should be no prompt and no ability to
add any further data as the call back contact point is initiated by other public or TM user's pressing on
the contact point and requesting a call back from the TM user who has listed this type of contact point
as an option in their contact point list.
[329] The above 'Cancel' option will cancel any entered details and return to the user to the previous
screen.
[330] If the user presses on the above 'Add' option then the selected contact point and entered
details will be posted and saved to the TM user's contact point list. By default, the privacy on each
new contact point should be 'private' or 'only me' which only allows the TM user to see the contact
point. The TM user must update the privacy on their new contact point to reflect who they would like
to have access to their contact point data either via 286 or 335.
[331] If the user presses on this icon then the user's 'more' profile screen will be loaded in view and
edit mode.
[332] This is an example of the TM user's 'more' profile screen in edit mode, more precisely, an
example of the screens without any previous data added to the various sections, therefore, each
section has a prompt suggesting what content the user should add to each section. There are also 3
tabs in the lower half of the screen which allow the user to edit various data under each tab. In this
example the 'Web' tab has been selected and is actively displaying relevant features for that screen
option in the lower part.
[333] If the user presses the icon to the left then the user will be able to add various social media
URLs to their profile. 165 has some further definition on the function of this section for a another
user or public viewing this screen. Once the user presses 302 then a pop up list of options will load
allowing the user to select and add their desired social media URLs 303.
                                                     33

 [334] This screen will be displayed once the user presses 302. Below is an example list containing
some of the options the user will have with regards to adding specific social media links. Most any
type of social media option may be added to this list, but for this example there has been a list created
which comprises of, but should not be limited to, facebook, twitter, linkedin, YouTube, flickr, google
plus, instagram, meetup, pininterest, reddit, tumblr, vine and VK. Once the user has made a selection
this drop down list will disappear and display the relevant selection social media type icon and name
as chosen by the user. Under this display there in another option, which is currently obscured by the
drop down list, which will allow the user to enter the URL of the relevant social media type they have
selected in this part. An example of this field which accepts the URL can be found in 306.
 [335] If the user presses this icon then the user will be able to add any type of URL to their profile
screen which will comprise of a title, a URL and a share option as displayed in 166 and 167.
 [336] Once the user has pressed on 304 this screen will be loaded. The first field below will allow
the user to add a title or short description for the URL the user wishes to add to their profile shared
URL list. Details on display of 305 and 306 can be found at 166.
 [337] In this section the user may add the exact URL which they wish to be displayed with 305 on
their profile screen.
 [338] The URL entered into 306 will be linked to the title entered into 305 once the user presses this
'Add' button and the details will be added to the user's profiles and displayed accordingly.
 [339] If the user presses the icon below they will be prompted to add or replace their sound file
which was explained in 163. The user will have the option to record or upload an audio file. Once
the user has decided which option they would prefer then 309 will display.
 [340] If the user selected to record a message from 308 then after the message is recording a
progress bar will appear showing the progress of the audio upload. If the user opted to select an audio
file then the progress bar will appear showing the progress of the selected audio file upload.
 [341] This is an example of the TM user's more screen with the 'About' tab selected and active.
When the About tab is active then the lower part of the screen will display an area for the user to add,
delete or edit a primary website URL and a blurb.
 [342] If the user has not yet entered a primary web URL then when the user taps the section to the
left a pop up screen will appear which allows the user to add their primary URL. If the primary URL
has already been added then the user may long hold on the displayed data and be presented with
further options regarding the data. See 313 for more details on how this works.
 [343] If the user has not yet entered blurb data then when the user taps the section to the left a pop
up screen will appear which allows the user to add some blurb data to and save to their profile. If the
user has already added blurb data then 313 will apply.
 [344] With the exception of the user's profile photos, most sections within the user's 'More' profile
screen can be edited, deleted and have privacy changed by the user pressing and holding down on the
data or feature the user wishes to edit. After the user has pressed and held down for at least 1.5
seconds, then a menu will appear like the one above. The user will be presented with three options,
delete, edit and privacy. If the user selects delete then the relevant data or feature will be deleted. If
the user selects edit, the middle icon, then the user will be presented with a pop up interface which
allows the user to edit the current data of that feature and the option to then save those changes. If the
user selects privacy, then a pop up interface will appear and will allow the user to select and save a
particular privacy setting for the relevant feature or data. This long hold menu will pop up for, but is
                                                     34

not only limited to, existing data presented or displayed in 302, 304, 311, 312, 314, 315 and 317, the
user may set privacy settings on any of the aforementioned and any details inside their profile screens.
[345] The section to the left is where the user's location will be displayed. All TM user's must have
a valid location which matches locations stored in the server database, read 16 for more details. The
user may action 313 to edit their location. The user may not delete their location. If the user selects
to edit their location then an auto prompt should be returned to the user as the user types a new
location, this process is explained in 16.
[346] The section below is where the TM user's name is displayed. The TM user may action 313 to
add, edit, delete or set privacy onto their name.
[347] This is an example of the TM user's more screen with the 'Feed' tab selected and active.
When the Feed tab is active then the lower part of the screen will display an area for the user to add,
delete or edit their posts and feeds being displayed or posted in this section.
[348] If the user presses the icon below then the user will see a pop up interface which allows the
user to enter details and make a post of data to the feed section of their more profile screen. If the
user has made previous posts and can view those post details on this screen, then the user may action
313 to edit, delete or set privacy on those posts. The user may also set up their account to display
feeds from other social media sites in this section, feeds from places such as, but not limited to,
facebook, twitter, YouTube, instagram, pininterest and so forth.
[349] The pop up interface which appears after the user presses on 317 will allow the user to add
various data to their post before posting it. The user may add an image, a title, a text description and
any additional URL data. Once the user has added the data they wish to include in their post they may
press the OK button to post the data to their feed screen.
[350] If the TM User presses on their profile photo display image from this screen the profile
photos screen will load and allow the user to interact with their profile photo or profile photos.
[351] A TM user may also add profile photos to their account, it should be noted that the TM user
may add multiple profile photos (one or more than one) at any given time. For example, at this stage,
the TM user can add up to 6 profile photos and each profile photo can be assigned a specific privacy
setting which allows the TM user to have a variety of profile photos that can only been seen by
specific audiences.
[352] Preferably the TM user will have some way of viewing any existing profile photos and in this
example we have used the lower section of the screen built with a horizontal scroll feature to allow
the user to view their existing profile photos. When the user presses on a profile photo the photo is
then focused and loaded into the above section 322.
[353] The selected photo in 321 is focused and enlarged in this section and the user should realise
that profile photo is now in focus. The user must also be able to edit the profile photo they have
selected and is in focus. This may be achieve by an edit icon or word and in this example we have
added an edit icon which displays over the profile photo in the center of the image. When the user
taps this edit icon the user will have further options to action for that displayed profile photo as
explained in 323.
[354] When the TM user presses the Edit icon explained in 322, a list of options will appear.
Included in that list of options should be at least 4 selectable actions which are described in 323, 324,
325 and 326. The actions may be represented as icons or by written language.
                                                     35

[355] One action should be Delete. The Delete action will delete the relevant profile photo that is in
focus on 322. If the user selects the Delete action there should be a confirmation pop up allowing the
user to confirm they definitely wish to delete that profile photo. If the user agrees to the confirmation
pop up then the profile photo should be permanently deleted and any preferences or settings on that
profile photo should also be deleted.
[356] One action should be Privacy Summary. The Privacy summary action will load the Privacy
Summary screen 335 list and display the current privacy setting for all profile photos, including the
relevant profile photo focused on 322 and will allow the user to edit those privacy settings.
[357] One action should be Change Image. If the user selects the Change Image action then the
user will have the opportunity to change the image of that relevant profile photo and the new image
will retain all settings previously associated with that profile photo. For example, if the user has a
profile photo which has been "Set as Default" and also has a privacy setting of "Public" and then
selected the Change Image action, the user could change the image of that profile photo and the new
image would retain the settings of "Set as Default" and privacy of "Public". Essentially, the profile
photo retains the same name and setting in the database except the image has been changed.
[358] One action should be Set as Default. If the user selects the Set as Default action then that
relevant profile photo will be the default image viewed by the logged in TM user when they see their
own profile. If the user has chosen to have multiple profile photos then we also need to know which
profile photo the logged in TM user wishes to see of them self on their own profile when they view
their own profile screen and the Set as Default action is the way the user can set the profile photo they
wish to see of them self. Note, a Set as Default profile photo can also have any type of privacy
setting, the Set as Default settings is only relevant for the logged in TM user and owner of the logged
in account to determine which image the user sees on their own profile.
[359] When the user presses the Cancel action then the popup menu will close and will return to the
322 screen.
[360] According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a system and method for
enabling communications between a first user and a second user having respective contact identifiers
that are issued to those users by one or more third party providers, wherein the users interact with the
system with electronic communications devices, and wherein the system includes:
         a first database for storing first data indicative of the contact identifiers for the users, second
         data for defining a user identifier for each of the users, third data indicative of a plurality of
         profile images associated with the first user and fourth data indicative of a relationship
         between the users;
         an interface that is responsive to the electronic communications device of the second user for
         allowing the second user to access the user identifier of the first user;
         a processor that is responsive to:
                  the first, second and fourth data and the accessing of the user identifier of the first
                  user for selecting one of the plurality of profile images; and
                  the above selection for allowing that the second user to access the selected image.
[361]    The addressee is now directed to the continuing description of the preferred embodiment.
                                                       36

[362] The current privacy setting for each focused profile photo should be on display. In this
example we have chosen a section below the focused profile photo to display its current privacy
setting.
[363] Below 330 there is a small triangular icon. This icon is an alternative way to 321 which
allows the user to navigate the display of their profile photos. Preferably a similar style icon will
appear on the left or right of the screen when there is another available profile image to be changed to
in each relevant direction.
[364] If the profile photo in focus is the "Set as Default" profile photo explained in 327, then a
display notifying the user of such should be shown. In this example we chose to display this in
writing above the focused profile photo as "Currently Default". If the user taps on this writing then a
small description will appear to allow the user to understand what a default photo is.
[365] The small icon to the right of 332 when pressed will display the focused profile photo inside a
circle so the user may understand how their profile photo will appear to other users in a circular form.
[366] The small plus icon above 333 allows the user to add more profile photos to their profile
photo list. In this case we have restricted the maximum number of profile photos to 6, therefore, once
the maximum number of profile photos has been added we and the user presses the plus icon, we will
show a pop up notifying the user that they have added the maximum number of profile photos and
they must delete or edit existing profile photos if they wish to add a different profile photo. The
maximum number of profile photos can be expanded or reduced to any number.
[367] The Privacy Summary is an option from the More list in the application. When the user
presses the Privacy Summary option a screen will be loaded which displays all of the current user's
profile data and the privacy setting for each individual piece of data. The user may change the
privacy setting per each piece of data. All data which can have a privacy setting should be displayed
in this list apart from the feed posts described in 317 and 318 which have their privacy setting
displayed in the Feed tab of the Profile screen.
[368] On the Privacy Summary screen all pieces of data relating to the TM user's profile should be
displayed. Preferably the data will be displayed in a grouped format, grouping data that is related, for
example, in this case we have displayed data in groups of Profile Photos, Contact Points, About,
Social Media and Shared URLs. Additional groups may be added if more data is added to the TM
user profile.
[369] The Profile Photos group should display all of the current profile photos that have been added
to the logged in TM user's account and this list of data should be pulled and displayed from screen
320 or a similar screen. A display of the image should be present in addition to the name title
assigned to each profile photo (in this case we used a generic naming system to automatically assign a
name to each profile photo). A display of the current privacy setting per each profile photo should
also present. If the user taps or presses on a profile photo or name then screen 320 should be loaded
(the screen which allows the user to add, edit and delete the multiple profile photos). A special note
should be made regarding possible privacy settings for profile photos - only one profile photo have a
Public, Contacts, Groups, Specific Groups, TM Users setting at any given time, there may be multiple
profile photos with the Private privacy setting only.
[370] The Contacts Points group should display all of the current contact points related to the
currently logged in TM user's account and this list of contact points should be pulled and displayed
from section 288 or a similar section. Preferably a relevant icon for the contact point type should be
displayed along with the appropriate data for each contact point. There should also be a display of the
                                                    37

privacy setting per each contact point. When a new contact point has been added, by default it should
be assigned a setting of "Private".
[371] The About group should display a list of other data related to the TM user, most of which can
be found in sections 308 (audio file), 315(name), 314(location), 310(about tab), 311(main website)
and 312(blurb) and the data is pulled from the aforementioned sections. Any additional information
about the user may be displayed in this section which has not been listed. There should also be a
display of the privacy setting per each piece of data displayed in the About group.
[372]     The Social Media group should display a list of the social media data supplied in sections
301, 302 and 303 (social media URLs). Preferably a relevant icon should be displayed next to each
social media item and the appropriate data per each record should also be displayed, for example, for
a facebook social media URL you should display a facebook social media icon followed by the URL
content. There should also be a display of the privacy setting per each social media item listed.
[373] The Shared URLs group should display a list of the shared URLs data supplied in sections
304, 305 and 306. Preferably a relevant icon will be displayed next to the title of the and / or the link
data (the URL content) followed by the display of the current privacy setting per item.
[374] When a user undertakes an action to edit the privacy setting (for example displayed in 342) on
any given data there should be an interactive user interface that appears and contacts the various
privacy options for that piece of data. The options inside the privacy list should consist of Public,
Contacts, TM Users, Groups, Individual(s), Private and more if necessary. After the user has made a
selection there should be a user interface display to save the selection. A brief description of each of
the aforementioned privacy settings : Public - any person can access and view that data, TM users
any registered person who is logged in on the software network can access and view that data,
Contacts - any registered person who is logged in and saved inside the profile owner's contacts can
access and view that data, Groups - any registered person who is logged in, saved as a contact in the
profile owner's contacts and is also stored inside a specific group of the logged in user's contacts can
view and access that data, Individual - any registered person who is logged in and the owner of the
profile has directly shared the data with can access and view that data and Private - only the owner of
that profile can view that data when they are logged in.
[375] Inside the dotted lined box you can see the examples of the current privacy setting attributed
to each piece of data. The user may interact on each of these to edit the settings via 341.
[376] Within the software application there should also be a screen that will allow the user to add
and edit speed dial items to their dial pad. A speed dial item is any type of contact point, whether it
be a phone number, mobile number, email, skype ID or other type of contact method.
[377] On the speed dial add and edit screen the user may view all the potential speed dial options.
There should be a display of at least 11 options for speed dial items which will preferably consist of
the relative buttons on a dial pad, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,* and # - note that the 0 should not be set as a
speed dial as the O's secondary use on a dial pad is normally to display the + icon (with long hold).
After a contact item has been set as a speed dial, some contact details should be displayed to allow the
user to understand which contact details are related to which speed dial. Each speed dial should
display the number or icon of the speed dial digit, preferably this should be displayed over the circular
profile image with an appropriate amount of transparency, an image or photo of that contact, the name
or title of that contact if the item is a contact from contacts stored on the software application,
otherwise, the actual data of the contact point may be displayed and the type contact point (i.e. Phone,
Mobile, Email, TipeME, Skype and so forth.
                                                    38

[378] It should be noted that all speed dial items need to be backed up to the user details on the
server when an internet connection is available which will allow the user to save their preferences and
not have re-add their speed dial list each time they login to a fresh software install.
[379] If the user taps on an empty speed dial item a user interface should appear allowing the user
to assign a new contact point to that relevant number or icon. For convenience the user should be able
to search their contacts and select a contact from the results based on their entered criteria.
[380] When the user has selected the desired contact the user may then press Ok. After the user
presses ok there should be a pop up option appear which allows the user to choose which type of
speed dial the user would like to add.
[381] The user will have two types of speed dial types to choose from, each option has a slightly
different function. The traditional option will cause the main selected contact point in 346 to be
immediately executed upon action from the user, this means, that when the user sets a traditional style
speed dial the user will then, on the dial pad screen, hold down the relevant number and that contact
point will be executed immediately. The Pop Up option differs in that if the user selects this option
the user action will cause a pop up box to appear which contains more details about the contact set in
that speed dial. Please see the flow from 27a for more details.
[382]    If the user wishes to apply a Pop Up action to the speed dial the user should select this option
345c - Pop Up.
[383]    if the user wishes to apply a Traditional action to the speed dial the user should select this
option 345d - Traditional.
[384] The user selected the Pop Up action to apply to the speed dial. Because of the feature 347 the
user must still select one priority contact point from the available list of the relevant contact being
added as the speed dial and that selected contact point will be used to display on 347. Once the user
selects Done on this screen or on 346 the speed dial will then be added to the dial pad, see the flow
from 27a to understand logic for executing the speed dial feature from the dial pad.
[385] When the user presses this icon they can toggle between a traditional style speed dial and a
pop up style speed dial - this icon should be displayed when the user edits existing speed dials as well.
To edit an existing speed dial the user simply needs to tap on any already set speed dials inside 344.
[386] The user selected the Traditional action to apply to the speed dial. In this step the user will
have to assign the exact contact point for the speed dial item. A new screen should be loaded which
will display various but relevant details about the selected contact, which must include, the name of
the contact, the image of the contact (if any) and the available contact points of that contact. The user
should select only 1 contact point from the list provided and once a selection has been made the user
can press "Done" to complete the process.
[387] Additionally, the software should also have a widget display of at least the first 10 speed dial
items. This display can be shown in various ways depending on the device and operating system it is
installed on, for example, on an iOS / iPhone operating system, we chose to display the top 10
contacts from the speed dial list in the pull down notifications bar. The user can easily access their
top 10 speed dial items by using this method. Each item should display an image (if any), the name of
the contact and the type of contact point associated with each relevant speed dial item. When the user
presses on an item from this list the action of the relevant contact point assigned to that speed dial
item should be executed. Note that in this example a different set of speed dial contacts are displayed,
a different set from 344.
                                                    39

[388]    Please see 283.
[389] By pressing on this option the user may commence the procedure of transcribing a business
card into a contact. Two methods should be available to the user. The first method is using OCR
(Optical Character Recognition). The second method is the preferred method, which is to allow the
user to send an image to the software servers and the image is then transcribed manually by a person
or a central computer. For more details see the flow from 115. If 349 is pressed then screen 131 (the
transcription list screen) will be loaded. Preferably on 349 there will also be a display of pending
transcription requests displayed in a number depending on how many transcription requests are
awaiting the user's review.
[390] By pressing on this option the user may access their TipeME Shared Groups screen. TipeME
Shared Groups is a solution that allows a user to create a TipeME shared group or receive an
invitation to a TipeME shared group and add other users to that group or phone contacts to that group.
The contacts added to the group are pooled together and any active member of the TipeME Shared
Group will be able to access and use the contact details of the contacts added to the TipeME Shared
Group.
[391] This screen displays the main TipeME Shared Groups (hereon referred to as group, groups
until otherwise defined) list screen. On this screen user can create a new group, access groups that
belong to the user, access groups that the user has been invited to and view all groups together. The
user will also be able to see particular details of each group such as the title, number of contacts
shared inside a group and how many members are active inside a group.
[392] If the user presses on this plus icon the user will then be able to create a new group.
Preferably a pop up screen will appear and prompt the user to add a name for the new group. When
creating a group the user creating the group may also allow members of the group to invite other users
to the group, if this option is not selected by the creator of the group then only the creator
(administrator) of the group may invite other users to become members of the group.
[393] If the user presses on this option the user will be able to see a complete list of all groups
owned by the user and all groups the user has been invited to.
[394] If the user presses on this option the user will be able to see a complete list of all groups that
are owned by the user.
[395] If the user presses on this option the user will be able to see a complete list of all groups the
user has been invited to (and is not an administrator for).
[396] Here an example of a group in listed format can be found. Notice that the group consists of
displayed details such as a name, a profile image (if any), the number of contacts inside the group and
the number of members inside that group. If the user taps on this option a new screen will load
displaying further information about the respective group.
[397] Contacts that have been added to the group are displayed in a list format. The display and
interaction with these contacts is similar to 76 and the flow following 202. Only approved members
may view contacts listed inside each group and access the details of those contacts listed inside the
group.
[398] When the user presses on this option the user will have access to various actions that can be
applied to the relevant group opened from 356.
[399] If the user presses this option the user will be able to search, select and add a contact from
their TM Software contact's list 67.
                                                    40

[400] The user can type the name of the contact they wish to add to the group and select the desired
contact. As stated in 359 the results are derived from the users TM Software contact's list. The user
should press Ok once the desired contact has been located and selected from the results.
[401] A display of the contact details related to the contact selected in 360 should be displayed to
the user. The user may choose various details from the displayed list.
[402] In this case the user has selected All details of the selected contact from 360. The user may
then press Add Contact to proceed. If the user selects Add Contact then the selected data in this step
362 will be added as a new contact to the relevant group. This contact and it's added details will then
be accessible to all members of that group who have access to the group. Should the user wish to quit
the process of adding the contact to the group the user may press the vacant space above the detail
selecting user interface which will cancel the flow and return to the group list screen.
[403] The creator of the group can invite other users to have access to the contacts shared inside the
group and become members of the group. When inviting a user the contact can decide whether to
allow the pending member to have the ability to invite other members or not. If the group creator
does assign the ability for the invited user to invite other users to the group then this invited user will
have the same available commands as the creator of the group except for Group Access, Rename
Group and Delete Group.
[404] Once the invited user accepts the invitation that user will become a member of the group. As
a member of the group the user may also add contacts to the group from the member's own TM
Software contact's list and edit those contacts, add their own contact details to the group and edit their
contact details or leave the group and cease becoming a member of that group ultimately removing
their own access to the group and it the contacts inside the group. When a member opts to leave a
group the member should be given the opportunity to remove their own contact details from the group
list. If the user chooses not to remove their contact details from the group list at the time of leaving
the group and ultimately leaves the group, the user will no longer have the ability to remove their
contact details from that group unless they once again become a member of that relevant group.
[405] The creator of the group can view and edit group access of members inside the group if the
creator of the group presses on this option. The creator of the group can revoke access to the group
from members without the members permission.
[406] If the creator of the group presses on this option the ability to edit the name of the group will
be possible.
[407] If the creator of the group presses on this option the ability to add their own contact details to
the group will be possible using the same type of options in 361 and 362. The creator's contact details
will be retrieved from their user profile screen and the details contained on that screen.
[408] If the creator of the group presses on this option the ability to delete the group will be
possible. There must be a prompt to the user before completely deleting the group to confirm that the
user does in fact wish to delete the group. Should the group be deleted, all contacts shared inside that
group will be deleted and no retrievable and all members of the group will automatically have
accessed revoked from the group as the group will no longer exist.
[409] If the user presses this option the user will have to ability to lock the app by way of a general
PIN code process. The user will need to enter a 4 to 6 digit PIN code, confirm that PIN code and then
the app will be locked. Each time the app is closed and opened again the PIN code will need to be
entered to access the TM software inside the app.
                                                     41

[410] If the user presses on this option the user will have the ability to edit, set and customise the
dial pad 27 both visually and with audio.
[411] If the user presses on this option the user will have the ability to edit the display of their dial
pad screen 27. A new screen should load 371.
[412] The logic and display of this screen has been implemented to allow the user the ability to set
various display options on for their dial pad screen and visually view those various settings in real
time. In this case the Custom option is selected which will allow the user to choose one colour or
design from the left vertical column of colour options (which will set the background colour of the
dial pad) and choose one colour or design from the lower middle horizontal two stacked row (which
will set the colour and design of the call button). Once the user has selected the colours they prefer
the user may press "Save" and those colours will be saved and displayed onto the dial pad 27. The
users preferences should also be backed up to the server and saved via API.
[413]    The user may also select to view visual options for the dial pad via suggested options.
[414] If the user selects to view visual options for the dial pad via the Suggested toggle, the display
of colour and design selects will preferably change to a lower horizontal stacked view. The user can
then select a colour from this list and a suggested match of colours between background and call
button will be presented to the user. Once the user is satisfied with their selection the user may press
Save and the set colours will be represented and displayed on the dial pad 27.
[415] If the user presses on this option the user will have the ability to access the Custom Dial Pad
Sounds list screen.
[416] On this screen the user will have the ability to toggle the dial pad sound on and off, backup
their current dial pad sounds, set custom dial pad sounds or select from a group of predetermined
sounds. Ultimately the sounds selected from the flow from this screen will be set, saved and played
when the user dials numbers and buttons on their dial pad screen 27.
[417] The user may toggle the sound for their dial pad screen 27 on and off If the toggle is on their
the sound will play on the dial pad screen and if the sound is off then no sound will play on their dial
pad screen when the user is dialling the buttons.
[418] The user may set up sounds on the dial pad as described above. One type of sound is the
custom sounds which can be a mixture of set sounds or custom recorded sounds by the user. The user
will have the ability to backup these sounds and save them under their account on the server using
API methods that allow backup, retrieval and editing. The user may choose to backup multiple
custom sounds.
[419] If the user presses this option the user will load screen 379 and have access to create custom
dial pad sounds.
[420] On this screen the user will be able to create custom sounds and associate those sounds with
relevant buttons on their dial pad. After a sound is assigned to a relevant button, when that button is
pressed on the dial pad the sound set will play.
[421] Playback on various hardware devices can produce different sounds. It is preferable that any
option is available for the user to increase or decrease the volume of the sound played by the buttons
via a software controlled audio option. When the user presses on this option a user interface will
appear that will allow the user to increase or reduce the sound level made when the buttons are
pressed and played.
                                                    42

[422] The user may press and hold down on any button they wish to add a sound to and the options
to assign sounds to buttons will be for all those visually displayed on this screen, namely, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 0, #, * and the call button. The call button should also have additional sounds that are more
adequate to be played when a call button is pressed, for example, a voice which says "Calling Now".
[423] After the user long holds on a button as described in 381, the user will see a pop up screen
with options to proceed. Preferably the options will be for the user to record their own custom sound
via a built in microphone or via an existing sound file stored on the user's device. Should the user
choose to record a sound using their microphone, the user should also be given the opportunity to edit
that sound recording after the recording has been made in order to reduce any unneeded sounds and
reduce the length of the audio file so that when it is played back on screen 27 the sound is short and
concise. The user will also have the ability to add predetermined sounds and ultimately may create a
mixture of both predetermined sounds and custom recorded sounds.
[424] After the user has set their preferred sounds the user may press this "Select" option and the set
sounds for each button will be saved into the TM software. When the user opens screen 27 and
presses on the buttons, the relevant sounds will play back as that which have been set on this screen
379.
[425] The user may also select to set a sound from one of the predetermined sound options. In this
case if the user presses on this option, Voice (British), screen 385 will load and the user will have the
option to save a predetermined set of a British accent voice verbally stating the name of each button.
[426] On this screen, if the user long holds on any button (0-9, #, * or the call button) then a pop up
will appear. The pop up will allow the user to automatically transfer these predetermined sounds to
the custom sound screen 379 and further interact with those sounds in the custom screen environment.
[427] Group Unsorted Contacts. If the user presses on this option the user will access a screen
(flow for that screen begins on 387) that gives the user the ability to quickly and accurately group the
contacts inside the TM software that have not yet been assigned to a group.
[428] Before the user accesses the screen preferably there will be some hint text to display to allow
the user some understanding of how to use this screen.
[429] The user may scroll to view more details of the hint text if required. Once the user has
completed viewing the hint text the user may press the Ok option to make it disappear.
[430] This screen is the main screen used for profiling contacts and sorting ungrouped or previously
grouped contacts into groups. By default, this screen will only display contacts stored inside the TM
software that have not yet been assigned to a group by the user. Some details of the contact ready to
be grouped will be displayed in the center of the screen and contain a profile photo, name, phone
number and other details if required. The user can then choose one of two methods to assign this
contact to a group. The user may either press and hold down on the contact profile image and then
drag the contact to the group they wish to assign the contact to or the user may simply tap on a group
and the user will be immediately assigned to that group.
[431] A section of screen 389 should be dedicated to display the number of contacts that have been
ungrouped from the contacts stored in the TM software for the user. This number should reduce or
increase based on how many contacts the user groups, deletes, adds or uses the undo option for and
should be an accurate reflection of the number of ungrouped contacts at all times.
[432] By default there should be at least 5 options available for the user to assign contacts to. These
options can, for example, be Family, Friends, Work, Places and No Group. Each time a user assigns a
                                                     43

contact to a group, that contact will then be recorded as being assigned to the relevant group and the
assignment of that group for the contact may be changed by opening the contact's profile screen from
other areas inside the TM software, for example, from the screens located directly from the flow of
202. Each time a contact is assigned to a group or deleted, records of such actions should be recorded
via API to the server.
[433] If the user does not wish to delete a contact but also does not wish for that contact to remain
ungrouped, then the user may assign such a contact to the No Group option. Once a contact is
assigned to No Group then contact will no longer be listed as an unsorted (ungrouped) contact and
will no longer appear in this display list. The user may be unsure of which group to assign a contact
to or may not wish to have that contact in a specific group. The contacts that have been assigned to
No Group will appear at the bottom of the contacts list screen when being displayed.
[434] When this icon is pressed the contact in focus will be deleted. A prompt should be displayed
confirming that the user does in fact wish to delete the contact before the delete action is complete. If
the user still chooses to delete that contact then the contact will be permanently deleted.
[435] The focused contact should be displayed in the center of the screen to allow the user the
ability to quickly review and group the contact - this is a preferable requirement. The user should be
able to view certain details about this contact that will allow the user to generate an idea about which
contact is ready to be grouped. A minimum number of details should be displayed, the name, the
profile photo, a contact point. If the user wants to know more information about the contact to
confirm the contact's identity then the user can press on the profile image and load another screen
which will display further contact details. This screen display will be identical to the standard display
of a TM software contact as shown in the flow from 202.
[436] This section will display the latest history of the grouping flow. The previously grouped
contact will be displayed here and will include the contact name and the group that contact was
assigned to. The action of the grouping may be undone by 396 in which case this historic display
should also be removed.
[437] This option when pressed will cause the last grouping action from the user to be undone. If
no grouping action has been executed by the user then this Undo option should remain hidden and
only appear after a grouping action has occurred.
[438] This option when pressed will allow the user to search for a specific contact stored on the TM
software and group that contact alone or search and group multiple contacts.
[439] This option when pressed will allow the user to manage the existing groups, edit names and
also add additional groups.
[440]    This screen will allow the user to edit, create and manage the groups for their contacts.
[441] If the user presses on this option a window will appear which will allow the user to enter a
group name and create a group using the group name the user entered into the pop up window.
[442] During 400 the user created a group named Good people. After the group is created it is then
displayed as an option on 389 and the user may assign contacts to that group. The user may also tap
on an existing group, for example the group named Good people, and edit the name of that relevant
group or delete that group. If the user deletes a group the contacts, if any, that were assigned to that
group will be assigned a new value of unsorted / ungrouped contacts and will reappear in the flow of
389 until the user assigns those contacts to a new group.
                                                     44

[443] When the user presses on 397 this screen 402 will load. On this screen the user will be able to
search one or multiple contacts and assign that contact or those contacts to a specific group. If the
user wishes to leave this screen without completing the assignment of contacts then the user may
press the Cancel option.
[444] Preferably the number of contacts the user selects on this screen will be tallied and displayed
in a position clear and visible to the user allowing the user feedback each time a contact is added or
removed.
[445] The user will be able to search the contacts stored inside the TM software via this field. A
complete list of all contacts stored inside the TM software is listed in 405, however, if the user wishes
to locate an individual or multiple contacts the user may use 404 to search for those contacts by input
of characters associated with the desired contact's name. If that contact exists and is stored inside the
TM software the contact will be listed in a progressively refined list displayed in 405. A user may
search and select a contact or contacts and then delete the search and search again for another contact
without deselecting previously selected contacts which means a user may complete multiple searches
while selecting multiple contacts from those search results all the while increasing the tally in 403 and
saving selected contacts for the next stage.
[446] The user will have the option to select all of the listed contacts in the lower section (406). It
should be noted that this function can also be used when viewing refined results returned from the
search feature 404. For example, if the user searches for "contact" and there are 5 contacts returned
with the name "contact" or part of their name is "contact" then the user may press 405 and select all of
the 5 contacts listed in the lower section at that time. The user may then delete the search criteria of
"contact" and those 5 selected contacts will still remain selected. The 'All' option applies to all the
listed contacts in the lower section at the time it was pressed. Once the search criteria is removed or
changed the 'All' option should automatically return to a negative state.
[447] A list of contacts stored inside the TM software is displayed in this section. The user may
scroll through the list and view the contacts listed from the TM software. If the user wishes to
identify a contact in more detail the user may press and hold down on the desired contacts profile
photo and a pop up will appear containing further details about that contact.
[448] The user may tap or swipe or press on these buttons to select or deselect a contact in the list.
If the user selects a contact then that contact will be stored a saved as a contact being assigned to a
group in the next section.
[449] The user will also have the option to alter the contacts displayed in 406 using this feature.
The user may choose to display ALL contacts, that is every contact stored inside the TM software at
that time and any contact that has or has not been assigned to a group, or, the user may choose to
display only the contacts that have not yet been grouped. The default display should be ALL contacts
in section 406.
[450] As described in 408, the user may choose to display ALL contacts or only Contacts that are
yet to be grouped via the options displayed here in 409.
[451] Once the user has selected one or multiple contacts via the functionality of this screen 402 the
user may then press Next and proceed to the next stage 411.
[452] On this screen 411 the user may assign the contact or contacts selected on 402 to a group. It
should be noted that the user may only select one group from the list presented or create a group and
select that one group.
                                                     45

[453] If the user wishes to create a new group the user may press this option and a pop up will
appear allowing the user to enter the name of the new group. Once the user has entered a valid name
and pressed save the user will then be able to view and select that from the lower section list of this
screen.
[454] The lower section of this screen 411 will display the list of available groups that contacts
selected from 402 maybe assigned to. The user may select one group from the list.
[455] Once the user has selected their desired group from 413 the user may press this option to
Review their selections from this screen and the previous screen.
[456] On this screen 415 the user will be able to review the selections made from 402 and 411.
This screen should have a place that displays the name of the group the contact or contacts are being
assigned to as well as a list of the contacts that are being assigned to that group.
[457] In this section of the screen there should be a statement which informs the user that the below
contact or contacts are being added to the relevant group name selected in 411.
[458] A list of all the contacts selected in 402 will be displayed in this lower section to the user.
The user may scroll to view additional contacts should the number of contacts require additional space
to display.
[459] On this screen 415 the user will still have the ability to review and remove selected contacts
from 402 by pressing on the selector buttons in this section 418.
[460] After the user has reviewed the data presented on 415 the user may execute the action by
selecting a button to proceed, in this case the button is named "Do it!". When the user presses this
button the contacts that are still in a selected state from 417 and 418 will be assigned to the relevant
group mentioned in 416 and therefore will be displayed in their relevant position on the contacts
screen and elsewhere within the TM software.
[461] After the user has pressed on 419 the grouped contacts will be displayed on the contacts
screen as per their group assignment. Note that this example, and many throughout this document, do
not use the exact same contact data to display results, the contacts displayed on this screen for
example were not used throughout the flow after 402.
[462] Here is an example of a Family group title. Care should be taken to display the number of
contacts that have been assigned to that group, in this case the number of contacts in the group named
Family is 3.
[463] The user has pressed on the search field box as displayed under 420. When the user presses
on this search field box a list should appear below the box containing the names of every group the
user has created and assigned contacts to. This list can be used by the user as a faster way to locate a
contact or focus on a particular group. When the user presses on a group inside this list that group
will automatically load and display only the contacts assigned to that group.
[464] It should be noted that the user may also choose not to tap and a group and just begin the type
the criteria for the contact the user wishes to locate. The soft keyboard has already been summoned
and is ready for the user to type with. When the user types on the soft keyboard a normal search
function will proceed and the criteria entered by the user will be used to determine a results list to
display in the background of the screen. The search criteria will preferably be applied to all data
inside every data detail of every contact allowing the user to not only search by name but also find
contacts based on their phone number, email address, company name or other details stored within
each individual contact.
                                                      46

[465] If the user presses on a group with the list 422, on this occasion we will assume the user has
pressed on "Friends", then the contacts assigned to the Friends groups will automatically be displayed
in the contacts list screen as displayed on 242.
[466] Preferably a visual method will be used to display to the user which group they are displaying
at a given time and also to allow the user the ability to manually enter characters to should they wish
to type a group instead of press on the group from the drop down list. In this case the group name
followed by period sign ( Friends.) has been adapted. Any characters entered after the period sign
within the field will be used to narrow the results within that group based on the characters entered by
the user more of which is described and displayed in the below image 425.
[467] In this case 425 the user wanted to refine the search results and search for a contact within the
group of Friends. The user has added more characters after the "Friends." display within the search
field. The user has added the letters 1 and i making the full string now "Friends.li". Because of this
addition the results displaying within the Friends group is automatically refined and now displays any
contacts within the friends group that can be related to 'li'.
[468] The lower part of this screen should display details of contacts that are assigned to the group
selected by the user in 422. The list, flow and details should be identical to that described in 67 and
other places within this document description.
[469] According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a system and method for
allowing the grouping of contacts for a user, wherein the user interact with the system using a
electronic communications device and the system includes:
         a database for containing first data indicative of the contacts, second data indicative of a set of
         groups, and third data indicative of the contacts contained in each group;
         an interface for: providing a first signal to the device indicative of at least a subset of the
         groups and the identity of at least one of the contacts that is not contained in a group; and
         receiving a second signal from the device indicative of a group selected from the at least a
         subset to which the at least one of the contacts is to be assigned; and
         a processor that is responsive to: the first, second and third data for generating the first signal;
         and the second signals for updating the third data to reflect the group selected.
[470] The addressee is now directed to the continuing description of the preferred embodiment of
the invention.
[471] This is the settings screen, it will display various details to the user regarding their account,
settings and allow the user to set and interact with other features.
[472] The dial pad has three different modes the user made choose that result in differing display
and data returned when the user dials a number or enters characters with a keyboard on the dial pad
screen as described in the flow from 458. If the user presses on this 428 an option will appear which
will allow the user to select either Dial a Number, Find by Number or Find by Name and after the user
selects one of these options, that option will be displayed on the dial pad by default each time the dial
pad is opened within the TM software.
[473] The user may press on this option to toggle sound of the dial pad on and off The sound of
the dial pad may be set as described in the flow from 374.
                                                      47

 [474] The user may press on this option to toggle the sound of the call button on and off. More
details regarding sound button is described in the flow from 374.
 [475] The user may press on this option to toggle between Dial Pad and Keyboard to display when
the user has selected the Find by Name option on the dial pad. The Find by Name option is a feature
that focuses on returning and focusing on the contact's name in the main results section of the dial pad
and more details can be found with further description of this feature within 467.
 [476] As described in 29 and 458 to 482 , the dial pad will display results on the dial pad screen
based on user input using T9 style logic. The TM software also contains a section which records,
stores or imports and displays call and message history. The user may toggle this option on and off to
include call history and message items to be displayed in the results on the dial pad. If the user sets to
'No' then the dial pad will only return data based on the contacts stored with the TM software, if the
user presses Yes then the TM software will return results on the dial pad also from the TM software
call and message history storage.
 [477] In addition to the contacts tab screen described in 67 the TM software should display a button,
preferably a floating button, above the contact list section which when the user presses will present a
menu of options and features the user can action and interact with. 433 can be located by following
the linking line from 67 on the visual diagram.
 [478] When the user presses on this option the user will being a flow that will allow the user to
manually merge two contacts together.
 [479] When the user presses on 434 this screen will load and begin the process of allowing the user
to merge two contacts, that are stored in the TM software, together.
 [480] Preferably there will be a indicator display how many contacts have been selected by the user.
There must be at least two contacts in order for the merge to process to proceed.
 [481] The user will be able to search the contact's stored in the TM software via a search field
available on this screen 435. The user may enter criteria into the search box and the lower results will
update reflecting the criteria that the user has entered into this search box 437.
 [482] The lower section of this screen will display the contacts stored on the TM software and will
also display the refined results if the user uses 437 to search for particular contacts.
 [483] The user may select and deselect contacts by pressing on the buttons displayed in this area. In
this example the user has selected two contacts, Andrew Joss and Andrew Le Lievre.
 [484] Once the user has selected the desired number of contacts the user can press the Next button
and proceed to the next stage of the merge process.
 [485] On this screen 441 the details of the contacts selected in screen 435 will be displayed to the
user. By default, all details from both of the contacts mentioned in 439 which were selected by the
user, will be displayed in a KEEP state with a green background to suggest those details are being
kept in the merge.
 [486] The profile photos or images of the contacts should be displayed here. If two contacts were
selected by the user then preferably one contact profile will be displayed in the foreground and large
and the second profile image will be displayed in the background and smaller with a 50 percent
opacity applied to it. The user may tap the background image to bring that image to the foreground
and if the background image is tapped then the foreground image will automatically be swapped to
the background position. If there are more than two profile photos then a similar flow to 178a should
                                                     48

be adapted. The photo being displayed in the foreground will be the photo assigned as the main
profile photo image after the contacts have been merged.
[487] The names of the contacts being merged should also be displayed in a similar way to the
profile photos with one name being in the foreground and displayed in larger more stand out font and
another name being displayed in the background in a smaller size with less prominent font. The user
may tap the background name to bring that name for the foreground and at the same time the
foreground name will be placed in the background. If the user is merging more than two contacts then
a similar flow to 178a should be adapted except with names in place of the profile images. The name
that is in the foreground when the user merges the contacts will become the main name of the newly
created merged contact.
[488]     As noted in 441 the details of the contacts being merged will be displayed in this lower
section and all such details will automatically be assigned to the KEEP group. The KEEP group will
have a green background or other type of display which allows the user to understand that the details
within this section will be kept and stored inside the newly merged contact. The type of details that
are displayed in this lower section are every type of data mentioned inside this document that is
related to being stored for the user or for a contact, such details include but are not limited to, phone
numbers, email addresses, web URLs, job titles, company names, social media IDs, contact point
identification points and other types of data associated with contacts throughout this documentation.
[489] The user may also quickly discard any details the user does not wish to merge into the newly
merged contact. If the user taps an item displayed in the KEEP section it will be automatically
assigned to the DISCARD section. Any items in the KEEP section at the time the user completes the
merge for the contacts will be kept and saved into the newly created merged contact.
[490] The DISCARD section will be displayed beneath the KEEP section and will display details
that have been tapped by the user in the KEEP section as explained in 444. The DISCARD section
should have a red background or another or other type of display which allows the user to understand
that the details within this section will be discarded when the user finalises the newly merged contact.
The type of details that are displayed in this section are any details described and mentioned in 444
and have been discarded from section 444.
[491] The user may keep any discarded details if the user taps on that discarded detail before the
merge process is complete. If the user taps on an item inside the DISCARD section that detail will
automatically be reassigned to the KEEP section. The user may repeat the process of KEEP and
DISCARD as many times as they wish until the merge of the contacts has been completed. Any
details displayed in the DISCARD section when the merge of the contacts is completed and the newly
created merged contact is made will be discarded from view of the user by not deleted.
[492] Then the user has selected which details the user wishes to keep from the details displayed on
441, the user may complete the merge process and create a new contact based on those selected
details. When the user taps on this button the merge will take place and a new contact will be created
based on the details the user decided to highlight and keep.
[493] A special note should be made with storing the details of the contacts that were selected in the
merge. The full details of each contact selected in 439 on screen 435 need to be stored and saved out
of view from the user inside the TM software and promptly backed up to the server for storage. These
contacts should be attributed with a special note within the database, such as iSmerged so these
contacts may be differentiated from other contacts. These iSmerged contacts are not displayed to the
user but the contact names and details of iSmerged contacts are used to avoid importing contacts
                                                     49

stored within other software or devices which is imported into the TM software.                A further
explanation of this process can be read at 483.
[494]      Another option that is present and accessible by the user is Left / Right Hand Configuration.
This solution will allow users to make a number of selections and changes to the way the user
interface is displayed in order for it to be more comfortable for the user to use. When the user presses
on this option 447 a new screen will load 448.
[495] This screen 448 will load after the user presses on 447. This screen will allow the user to
manipulate, choose and set the preferred layout for their contacts to be display as well as the direction
of the expanding menu from the profile images. By manipulating the way the user's contacts are
displayed the user can choose a custom layout that is more comfortable and easy for them to access
their contacts with depending on which hand the user uses to interact with their device. For example,
a user may hold a smart phone device with their left hand and tend to use that device with their left
hand when holding the device with one preferred hand (the left hand in this case). The user may place
objects displayed in the contact's list screen closer to where their hand is holding the device making it
easier to access and more productive for the user.
[496] It should be noted that part of the display on this screen comprises of 3 column like displays.
One column displays the contact profile photos, one column displays the contact's contact points (or
icons of the contact points) and one column displays the contact's name and other details. Each of
these columns can be moved and rearranged by the user when the user presses and holds down on a
column and then drags it to a new position. In this screen 148 you will note that in the first column
the contact's profile photos are being displayed, in the second column the contact's names are being
displayed and in the third column the contact's contact points are being displayed.
[497] This screen is a display of updates from the user manipulating columns from 448. You will
note that the user pressed and held down on the contact's profile photo column, moved it one column
to the right and let go which caused the column to drop into the middle position. The name column
which was formerly in the middle position automatically moved to the left position when the user
hovered the profile photo column over it in the action mentioned above. As the user moves a column
the column underneath will move to the closest vacant position to make way for the moveable column
to be dropped.
[498] There can be a number of variations the columns may be arranged in. In this example screen
450 the photo column has been moved to the right, the name column has been moved to the middle
and the contact point column has been moved to the left.
[499] This screen 451 displays another variation where the contact point column has been moved to
the left, the profile photo column has been moved to the middle and the name column has been moved
to the right.
[500] After the user has manipulated the columns positions to the positions the user desires the user
may Save the progress and proceed to the next step.
[501] As described throughout this documentation each profile photo within the TM software can
be held down for a short period and an expand menu will appear offering additional options for the
user to interact with that contact. After the user has pressed save in 452 a new screen should load
with a pop up appearing prompting the user to answer a question. The question should ask the user
whether the user would like the expand menu to appear to the left side or the right side of the profile
photo. The user may choose LEFT or RIGHT to answer this question. If the user chooses LEFT then
                                                     50

the expand menu will appear to the left side of the photo and if the user chooses RIGHT the expand
menu will appear to the right side of the profile photo when the expand menu is activated by the user.
[502] It should be noted that the background screen behind the pop up should display the identical
selections the user made before pressing the 452 save option and in addition to that display the screen
should also display the expand menu options to the user so the user understands what the options
appear like.
[503] It should also be noted that if the user chose the profile photo column to be displayed on the
right or left side then this pop up step 453 will not be necessary. If the user chose the profile photo
column to be on the left side then the expand menu will need to appear to the right side of that column
by default when the user activates the expand menu and if the user chose the profile photo column to
be on the right side then the expand menu will need to appear to the left side of that column by default
when the user activates the expand menu.
[504] When the user make a selection of LEFT or RIGHT from 453 or if the user set the profile
photo column to the left or right before 452 then a screen should load which displays an example of
how the current options will appear for the user in various places within the TM software. It should
be noted that the user should have an option to EDIT these selected options as is displayed in this case
to the top right side of the screen. This screen 454 should also accessible from other parts of the TM
software, such as, but not limited to, the Settings screen.
[505] The selections the user has made throughout the flow from 448 will be reflected in throughout
various parts of the TM software, any part that a list of contacts is displayed, a list of user's is display,
a list of search results are displayed and so forth (some places are, but is not limited to, 27, 42, 57, 40,
67, 262, 357). In this example 455 there is a display of how the contact tab screen 67 will now appear
after the selections the user has made. The profile images are displaying in the middle, the contact
points are displaying to the left and the contact names are displaying to the right.
[506] Note that also from screen 455, when the user presses and holds down on a profile image the
expand menu will expand in the direction the user set it to expand toward, the left side of the profile
image. If the user chose for the expand menu to expand to the right side of the profile image in 453
then the expand menu would appear to the right side of the profile image in this example 456.
[507] Accordingly, in another aspect the invention provides a handheld computing device
including:
          a processor for executing code to enable a graphical user interface (GUI) having a plurality of
          GUI elements, wherein the GUI elements include at least one control element for accepting
          input from a user of the device; and
          a display that is responsive to the processor for presenting the GUI to the user, wherein the
          GUI is configurable to allow different placement of the at least one control element relative to
          at least one other of the plurality of GUI elements.
[508]     The addressee is referred now to the continuing description of this preferred embodiment.
[509] The user may choose a custom setup for the display of the columns as described from 448,
however, there should also be preset configurations for the user to select and automatically apply
across the TM software. In this example two options have been listed, however, more variations may
preferably be offered to the user. In this example if the user chooses the LEFT option, which would
insinuate the user holds their phone with the left hand, the automatic configuration would be set to the
                                                      51

contact point column appearing to the left, the profile photo column appearing the middle and the
name column appearing to the right and the expand menu appearing to the left side of the profile
photo. If the user chooses the RIGHT option, which would insinuate the user holds their phone with
the right hand, the automatic configuration would be set to the contact point column appearing to the
right, the profile photo column appearing the middle and the name column appearing to the left and
the expand menu expanding to the right side of the profile photo.
[510]     Reference is now made specifically to Figure 3 of the drawings.
[511] These details are follow on details further explaining the dial pad listed in 27 and 30 and area.
The dial pad will have the ability to returns differently displayed results based on user input and will
have at least three different modes that the user may toggle between. On this screen "Dial a Number"
is being displayed as the dialling function active at present.
[512] This is the toggle icon, it will switch between the three different modes of dialling available
on this dial pad screen. When the user taps this icon the mode will change to the next mode, in this
case if the user taps this icon the mode will change to "Find by Number" 461.
[513] When a user dials a number on the dial pad when 358 is active, the number will be displayed
in this top section as seen in this image. The number will appear in a larger size than the other
selectable modes.
[514] Note that the dial pad T9 logic is still being utilised and results from that T9 logic are being
displayed behind the dial pad. The dial pad is intentionally see through so that the user may view
results while dialling a number.
[515] The user may tap this icon to minimise the dial pad and reveal contacts displayed in 461. The
user may tap this icon again to maximise the dial pad screen. Preferably when the dial pad is
minimized the circle of this icon should change to a dotted border allowing the user to identify a
change in the icon display and know to tap it once again to reveal the dial pad.
[516] The call button can be pressed once the user has dialled the desired number. When the user
presses the call button the number displayed in 460 will be dialled. The user may also hold down on
the call button to reveal and expanding menu that will allow the user more options to interact with the
number displayed in 460.
[517] If the user taps on 459 the next mode will load and this mode is Find by Number. In this
mode the logic for the dial pad will be changed to allow the user to see a top result in this section 464.
[518] This icon may be tapped by the user to change to the next dial pad mode which is Find by
Name.
[519] As the user dials the number is this mode 464 a suggestion will appear in this area 465. This
suggestion is a suggested contact in the results being returned based on the number or numbers the
user is dialling on the dial pad. In this case the user has dialled a number, 0412551007, which has
resulted in a contact being located that is associated with that number. The suggestion is displayed
progressively based on user input. If the user has only entered 04125510 then the aforementioned
numbers will be displayed in a full font and any suggested numbers remaining will be displayed in a
lesser font so the user may differentiate between which numbers the user has dialled and which
numbers are being suggested to the user.
[520] The suggestion displayed in this section 465 should be the contact returned in the top of the
list of results being displayed under the transparent dial pad based on the T9 logic used by the dial
pad.
                                                    52

[521] The user may tap on this number at any time to focus on it, if the user does tap on the number
the contact will be completely selected and the user may then use features such as the expandable
menu from the call button to interact directly with this focused contact.
[522] When the user taps 465 the next dial pad mode will load and the logic for this mode will be
loaded ready for the user to use. In this example this mode is named Find by Name. In this mode the
name of contacts will be used as the focus point on displaying a suggested results in this top section.
[523] The user will have two options of how the user would prefer to use Find by Name mode. If
the user has not previously recorded or set a preference a pop up box should appear prompting the
user to choose an option. The user may choose between a dial pad interface and a keyboard interface
and the user will have the choice to record their selecting in the TM software otherwise if the user
does not select for the TM software to remember the user's choice this prompt must display each time.
[524] If the user chooses this Dial Pad option then the logic used on this Find by Name mode will
be based on the input of the dial pad.
[525] If the user chooses the Keyboard option then the logic used on this Find by Name mode will
be based on the input of a keyboard.
[526] In this case the user has selected 469, the dial pad. The user has dialled the numbers 47222.
These numbers should appear in the upper section but should appear in small font so that the name
must be the primary and larger visible result in this mode. Based on T9 logic the name Isaac has been
returned. Shane Isaac is the top result amongst other possible results and is therefore displayed in this
upper section 471. Other results are visible behind the dial pad but are not deemed as good a match as
Shane Isaac.
[527]    Shane is appearing in a faded font with some opacity. This displays to the user that the result
being suggested in 471 is based on Isaac and not Shane. Shane Isaac is being displayed as a full name
because Shane is the remaining part of the name from Isaac which has been returned and the primary
result.
[528] The user may tap on Shane or Isaac. When the user taps on the writing Shane Isaac here in
471 then Shane Isaac will automatically be selected and become focused on by the dial pad 473.
[529] The user has tapped on 472, Shane Isaac, and the display has changed to this view. The first
stored phone number of Shane Isaac has automatically been displayed in this section 473 and above
the number the contact name Shane Isaac in smaller fonts is being displayed that the user may
understand that contact is selected and focused on at present. The user may now use any of the
functions available on the call button to directly interact and perform actions with this contact Shane
Isaac.
[530] On this screen is displayed the visual appearance of the expand menu from the call button
after the user has pressed and held down on the call button. When the user presses and holds down on
the call button a menu will appear with various options that when selected will perform functions for
the contact or number displayed in the top section of the dial pad, in this instance Shane Isaac.
[531] If the user selects this option from the call button expand menu then a process will begin
which allows the user to send an audio message to the contact or number focused in the top section.
The user may send this audio via a URL link via SMS. The user will record a message, playback the
message and accept the message if they so wish. After the user has accepted the message the message
will be uploaded to the server and a unique URL will be created for that audio file. The URL will be
                                                    53

posted back to the user and the user may send that URL in a text message to the relevant phone
number. The message will be played back via the URL.
[532] If the user selects this option from the call button expand menu then a process will begin
which allows the user to request contact details from the number or contact displayed in the top
section. A more detail explanation of this flow may be found at 499.
[533] If the user selects this option from the call button expand menu then a process will begin
which allows the user to open up an SMS window using the number or contact in the top section.
[534] If the user selects this option from the call button expand menu then a process will begin
which allows the user to send their own contact details to the number or contact in the top section
using the contact sharing flow explained above in this document.
[535] If the user selects this option from the call button expand menu then a process will begin
which allows the user to set an alert for the phone number or contact displayed in the top section.
[536] In this case the user has selected 470, the Keyboard. After the user selects 470 a keyboard
will appear and the dial pad will be removed from view. The user can now type in criteria and use
that criteria to locate a contact. Similar logic is used from 471 though the input method is a keyboard.
Please read 471 to understand the display interface being used on this screen.
[537] As described in 472, the user may still tap on the name being displayed. Once the name is
tapped by the user the focus of the dial pad will be on that selected contact.
[538] After the user tapped on Shane Isaac the contact was focused on and the dial pad will
automatically reappear allowing the user to interact with the focused contact using the call button and
the features available from the call button.
[539] This following flow is an additional description for more details regarding the login flow of
the user on the TM software. This flow will begin after the user presses 26, 22 or 24 depending on
whether the user is logging in with an existing account, signing up for a free account or signing up for
a paid account. It should be noted that after logging in the TM software will need to connect to the
server to import some details about the user including verification of the password and login, profile
photos, contact points and other relevant data. It should also be specially noted that the TM software
will also import contact details for any contacts previous merged by the user on the flow from 434 to
446, the details of those contacts will be used to identify any contacts being imported by the TM
software presently that need to be skipped. If the TM software detects contacts that are iSmerged
from the 434 flow then the TM software will skip those contacts to the contacts are not imported and
displayed again because the user has previously merged those contacts in the past and would not wish
to see those contacts in the previous state again.
[540] The user will see a screen that should allow the user to understand the process of logging in is
proceeding. The TM software will being importing the users contacts from the mobile phone or
hardware device. The TM software will also be analysing the contacts as the contacts are imported
and stored into the TM software. If the TM software detects any contacts that have not been assigned
a name then a pop up window will appear asking the user how the user would like to proceed.
[541]     There should be at least three options presented to the user.
[542] The user may choose this option by tapping on it. If the user chooses this option then the TM
software will import contacts that have an email address but do not have a name. It should be noted
that if the user chooses 485 the user may also choose 486 if desired.
                                                      54

[543] The user may choose this option by tapping on it. If the user chooses this option then the TM
software will import contact that have a phone number but do not have a name. It should be noted
that if the user chooses 486 the user may also choose 485 if desired.
[544] The user may choose this option by tapping on it. If the user chooses this option then the TM
software will skip all contacts without names and set them aside in a separate list that the user may
review after all the contacts are sorted and imported.
[545] After the user has made a selection from 485 and 486 or 487 the user may press this button to
proceed with importing contacts from the mobile phone or hardware device.
[546] Preferably there will be a screen displayed that will inform the user of the progress during the
importation of the contacts into the TM software. A progress bar is preferable and a message should
be displayed depending on whether the user had contacts without a name detected or not.
[547] If the TM software detected contacts without a name and the user decided not to import any
of those contacts during steps 485, 486 and 487 and therefore contacts without an assigned name were
marked with a skipped note during the import process, then a list of those contacts which were
skipped should be displayed to the user.
[548] The user should be presented with a way to scroll and view those skipped contacts and
preferably a method to search those skipped contacts if the user wishes to search for a specific contact
that may have been skipped. The user should also be presented with a way to keep any of the contacts
that are in this skipped list. In this example we used a method that the user may tap or swipe the item
of the skipped contact to the left and that will cause the contact to be imported into the TM software
and not discarded after this screen.
[549] After the user has reviewed the skipped contacts list the remaining items in the list on this
screen 490 should be permanently discards and deleted from the TM software and the next step on the
login process should continue. It should be noted that at this time the TM software will sort through
the imported contacts and check for any duplicated contacts. If the TM software detects duplicated
contacts those contacts should be merged automatically without losing data. The logic for merging
two contacts should be as follows: the name of the suspected duplicated contacts should be identical,
at least one contact point of the suspected contact points should be identical - if there is a match in this
logic then the TM software should proceed to merge the duplicated contacts without losing any
contact data. The TM software can avoid losing contact data by merging data that is identical from
the duplicated contacts and then also importing data that is not identical.
[550] The user should next be prompted to sync their contacts to the server. The user may choose
to skip this step if desired.
[551] If the user chooses to sync then contacts now then the syncing process with the server will
begin and the flow will continue to 495 after the syncing process is complete.
[552]     If the user chooses to Skip the syncing process then the flow will continue to 495.
[553] The TM software will detect with the server whether the user has set dial pad sounds in the
past and backed those dial pad sounds up to the server. If the user has backup up dial pad sounds to
the server in the past then a prompt will appear asking the user if the user wishes to import and use
their backed up dial pad sounds to this version of the TM software. If the user chooses yes then any
previous dial pad sounds will be imported to the TM software and be played back from the dial pad
screen automatically. If the user chooses no then the dial pad sounds previously backed up will not be
imported.
                                                     55

[554] The user should now be offered to group their contacts should they desire. If the user chooses
to group their contacts now then the grouping flow from 387 should appear. After the user has
finished grouping their contacts the login flow will be completed and the TM software will finish
logging in the user and will load the dial pad screen by default.
[555] The user may send a contact details update request (update request) to any person. A contact
details update request is when a request and form is sent to a person and the flow of the process
allows for a person to receive a notification from the user, a means of accessing details from the
notification and loading a form, filling out that form and returning new or updating information about
their contact and business and personal details. The user may send an update request to an existing
contact or a new person. Both scenarios will be detailed in the following flow.
[556] To begin the flow of an update request the user should preferably enter a phone number on
the dial pad. The user may also begin an update request using other methods, such as holding down
on a contact's profile photo, revealing the expand menu and selecting to begin an update request for
that particular contact. In this flow a description will first be listed regarding a new phone number
begin used to begin the update request.
[557] After the user has entered a number in 498 the user may long hold on the call button and
reveal the expand menu which will include the option to start an update request.
[558] The number from 498 is stored by the TM software and displayed to the user in this notice
pop up 500. The user will be required to add a name or word for the phone number entered on 498,
the word or name the user enters will be considered as the contact's name from this point until the
person receiving the update request changes it.
[559] When the user has entered a word or name for the number the user may press OK and proceed
to the next screen. When the user presses Ok a request will be made to the server for a unique URL to
be created specifically for this contact request. When the server receives the number and name used
in the flow via API the server will create a record and create a unique URL and return that URL to the
user. Preferably the extension of the URL will be 7 characters and the characters should be letters
and numbers preferably.
[560] A new screen will load, in this case it is a SMS messaging screen on a mobile device. The
user may also load an email screen depending on the method the user wishes to send the update
request via. For example, if the user is sending an update request for an existing contact and that
contact has an email address as one of the contact's contact points then the user may select that email
address to be the recipient of the update request, or, the user may manually enter an email address
form the update request to be sent to.
[561] Note that the number entered in 498 is being used now and the contact point to receive the
update request in this example. The TM software passed this number to the SMS text screen directing
the SMS text screen to use this number as the method of contact.
[562] The content of the message should be informing the recipient of the update request about
what is occurring and why the recipient is receiving the message. A note should be made that the
name from 500 is being used to address the recipient and to the recipient the sender will appear from
the user via the user's phone number in this case.
[563] The user may also opt to copy the text from this screen and sent the text via another means of
communication, such as a messaging service, a social media service or so forth. The key for the
process to continue is the unique URL 504.
                                                    56

[564] The URL must be included in the message 503.                     In this example the URL is
http://74.208.253.253/_4aDxwU3 . In other scenarios the IP address in the aforementioned URL
would be replaced with a domain name, such as tipeme which would make the URL
http://tipeme.com/_4aDxwU3 . This URL will allow the recipient to view and add and edit details the
user may already have about the recipient and allow the recipient to add and edit and remove such
details. If the user wishes to proceed and send the message to the recipient via SMS in this case then
the user may now press send and send the text message to the number 502.
[565] The recipient will then receive the notification from the user, which in this case is via SMS,
and will receive the message sent from the user in 503 which must include the unique URL 504.
[566] The recipient may then tap on the URL which was included in the notification sent to the
recipient from the user, in this case a text message. When the user taps on the URL a new window
will load which is a web page window.
[567] The URL from 506 will be passed to the users web browser and the web browser will load the
web page for the user. On this page there should be wording which allows the user to understand in
more detail why they are receiving this request from the user preferably. Preferably the wording will
be "A person you know uses a service. That person has sent you a free request via this service to
make sure they have your latest contact details. you can add to or edit the details below, even add an
updated photo. Once you have finished press Save and the person who sent you this request will
receive the updated details you have added.
[568] The recipient may then scroll down on the web page loaded in 407 and interact with various
parts of this web page. In this place 508 the recipient may upload a photo by tapping on the profile
image. The profile photo the recipient uploads will be sent back to the user. If the recipient was
already a contact in the user's TM software and that contact had a profile photo, that profile photo
would display here so the recipient can view what data the user has about the recipient for 508
previously.
[569]     In this place 509 the recipient may update their first and last name. The name the recipient
adds will be sent back to the user. If the recipient was already a contact in the user's TM software and
that contact had a name, that name would display here so the recipient can view what data the user has
about the recipient for 509 previously.
[570] In this place 510 the recipient may view the phone numbers that the user has recorded for the
recipient at present. The recipient may edit phone numbers that appear in this section if desired or if
the number is incorrect. The recipient may also delete the phone number if desired. If the recipient
was already a contact in the user's TM software and that contact had contact points (such as numbers,
emails, faxes and so forth), those contact points would display here so the recipient can view what
data the user has about the recipient for 510 previously.
[571] The recipient may also add additional details to the details on display in 510. Such details
may be contact points in this section of the web page. If the user taps this option a new pop up will
appear allowing the user to add additional contact points. See 513.
[572] There may also be additional details the user has about the recipient that was stored in the
contact form of the recipient in the user's TM software account. If the user presses on this icon such
details will be displayed to the user and the user may add or edit more details to those which are
displayed.
                                                    57

[573]     If the recipient presses on 511 then a pop up 513 should appear. The recipient may choose
from a variety of contact points, such as email, landline, mobile, fax and iphone in this example,
however, other contact points may also be added such as custom contact points with a title and
content decided by the recipient. The recipient may select a contact point type to add and then fill in
content details related to that contact point type.
[574] After the recipient has added the contact point details the recipient wishes to add the recipient
may press Add and return to the previous web page and view the contact point has been added and
displayed in section 510.
[575] On this screen an example has been provided where the recipient has added multiple contact
points to the initial one contact point that was provided.
[576] The recipient has also added a cute photo of their youngest daughter who is four years old and
a very happy little girl and the recipient has also added their last name.
[577] The recipient has pressed on 512 and additional details have been displayed. If the recipient
was already a contact in the user's TM software and that contact contained any of the following details
such as organisation, website (which may include social media web address and so forth), addresses,
birthdays, job titles business hours or other information, such details would display here within this
section of the web page so the recipient can view what data the user has about the recipient for 517
previously.
[578] The recipient may add, delete or edit any additional information related to them self here and
once saved those details will be forwarded to the user who requested the updated details. It should be
noted that although not visually displayed, there should also be an option that allows the recipient to
add a custom title and custom content in case the recipient wants to add additional details about them
self.
[579] Once the recipient has added, edited or deleted all desired details about them self from these
steps 505 to 518, the recipient may then press the Save button. Once the recipient presses the save
button, all of the added, edited or deleted details between 505 and 518 will be backed up and saved to
the server ready for the user who requested the updated details to review.
[580] Preferably the user that requested the updated contact details from the recipient will receive a
notification once the recipient has completed 505 to 518 and pressed the save button. The notification
will preferably be via mobile push notification or via email though other methods may also be
incorporated and used.
[581] When the user opens the notification on the mobile, for example, the TM software should be
notified and load a relevant screen which lists the update requests that have been completed by
recipients and saved but are yet to be reviewed and accepted by the user. This screen which lists such
pending data should also be accessible from inside the TM software manually by the user.
[582] In this case we can see the listed item of "Shane" in the requested data pending review list.
Shane was the name entered by the user on 500 and is used to display in the list here even if the
recipient has altered, deleted or added to the name in 509 so the name used in the list is something the
user who sent the update request is familiar with.
[583] When the user presses on this 521 a new screen should load which will display the updated
data from the update request as added, edited or deleted by the recipient and will load screen 522.
[584] On this screen the relevant data added, edited or deleted by the recipient will be displayed to
the user so the user may review, edit and save such data. Preferably if the recipient added a new
                                                     58

profile photo throughout the request update then that photo should be displayed in the foreground of
522. The photo displayed in this case is the photo the recipient added at 516. The previously assigned
profile photo should also be available for the user to select should the user wish to do so and is
displayed in the background behind the profile photo in the foreground. If the user taps on this
background image then that image will come to the foreground and the foreground image will be
placed to the background. The image in the foreground at the point of saving will be the stored image
for updating the contact details of the contact.
[585] Further details similar to this 522 and how it should work can be found at 442. It should be
noted that if the user chose to update an existing contact that already had a profile photo, that profile
photo would be displayed here in 522 so that the user may choose to keep the previously existing
profile photo as opposed to a new photo that the recipient may add and therefore no data is lost.
[586] This section will display the name the recipient added or edited from 509. If the user does not
add, edit or delete a name it will be displayed here. The name previously assigned to the contact
before the update request was sent will still be available for the user to select and should, by default,
be displayed in the background behind the foreground name (the foreground name should be the name
that the recipient has added, edited or accepted from 509. The user may tap on the background name
to bring that name to the foreground and the foreground name should be automatically assigned to the
background. The name in the foreground when the user saves that data from this screen will be
accepted as the new contact name for the recipients details.
[587] This section will display the details entered by the recipient between 510 to 517 which
includes contact details and additional details related to the recipient. The returned details will be
displayed to the user in two sections, the KEEP section which will display the details in text and have
a green background and the DISCARD section which will display the details in text and have a red
background. The details displayed in the KEEP section are the details the user would like to KEEP in
regards to the contact (recipient) and the details displayed in the DISCARD section are the details the
user would like to DISCARD in regards to the contact (recipient).
[588] In the displayed case from 499, 500 and 501, the user sent an update request to a new person
who was not already a contact in the users TM software, therefore, the details displayed in this section
524 will at first be default of KEEP with a green background. The user may review the details added
by the recipient in this KEEP section and decide which details to KEEP and which details to
DISCARD. If the user wishes to DISCARD a details from the recipient in this KEEP section then the
user can tap on that specific detail and the detail will automatically disappear from the KEEP section
and appear in the DISCARD section and the display associated with the DISCARD background. An
example of how the DISCARD section appears like can be found in 143 and 445.
[589] An update request may also be sent to an existing contact in the user's account on the TM
software in which case there will be existing details on that contact recipient. If the recipient edit,
updated or deleted any details during the update request process then those details will automatically
be displayed in the DISCARD section to allow the user to understand the recipient has edited, updated
or deleted such details and those details may not be relevant any more. Any new details, or any
details that were not edited, updated or deleted by the recipient will be automatically displayed in the
KEEP section so that the user may understand that the recipient has added those details as new or has
not changed any previously existing details to allow the user to understand that those details may be
relevant and up to date.
[590] If the user taps on a detail in the KEEP section and that detail is automatically assigned to the
DISCARD section, the user may then tap again on that same detail to return it back to the KEEP
                                                    59

section. If the user taps on a detail in the DISCARD section and that detail is automatically assigned
to the KEEP section, the user may then tap again on the same detail and return it back to the
DISCARD section. The user may repeat this process as often as desired until the user decides the
details of the recipient have all be allocated to the correct sections and the user has assigned the
details to the sections reflecting which details of the recipient that the user wants to KEEP and the
user wants to DISCARD.
[591] The user may decide that a detail in the DISCARD section are still relevant and wish to keep
that detail which the user may do so by tapping on the detail and sending it to the KEEP section. The
user may decide that a detail in the KEEP section is not relevant and wish to discard that detail which
the user may do so by tapping to the detail and sending it to the DISCARD section.
[592] Once the user has reviewed and decided which details to keep and which details to discard (if
any) through 522, 523 and 524, the user may press this 525 the Save button. When the user presses
this Save button, the details in the foreground of 522 and 523 and the details in 525 which are
displayed in the KEEP section will be used to create or update the contact. If the update request was
sent to a new person and not via an existing contact in the TM software then a new contact will be
created using the relevant details chosen by the user in 522, 523 and 524. If the update request was
sent to an existing contact in the TM software then the previous details of the relevant existing contact
in the TM software will be replaced with the new details selected by the user in 522, 523 and 524.
[593] In this screen the contact, as described in the recent process after 499 and recently described
in 525, has been created and should automatically be displayed to the user after the user presses 525.
This contact has been created and saved into the TM software and may also be automatically synced
back to the server if the user has previously synced their contacts in this instance of the TM software.
On this screen the profile photo in the foreground of 522 has been saved, the name in the foreground
of 523 has been saved and the details in the KEEP section of 524 has been saved and all have been
displayed to the user.
[594] If the user enters a phone number or contact point detail into 498 and then presses 499 then
the TM software should run a quick referencing check to scan current contacts inside the TM software
and check whether that phone number or contact point in 498 is already allocated to an existing
contact of the user within the TM software and if this is true then a pop up should appear notifying the
user of this detection. The user should be given the a choice of sending an update request using the
contact details which are associated with the phone number or contact point entered in 498 or sending
a new update request directly to the number or contact point entered in 498 and not using any existing
contact details related to that number or contact point entered in 498.
[595] Preferably the wording of the pop in such a situation to the user would be similar to: This
phone number belongs to one of your contacts already. Would you like to request updated
information (update request) from 'the contact's name'?
[596] If there is more than one contact within the TM software that has the phone number or contact
point entered in 498 then the user should be prompted with an option to select exactly which contact
the user would like to send the update request to if the contact selects 529.
[597] If the user selects this 528 (No) to prompt of 527 then the flow should proceed to 500 using
the phone number or contact point entered in 498.
[598] If the user selects this 529 (Yes) to the prompt of 527 then the flow should proceed to 502
using the phone number or contact point entered in 498 and also associating all other details and data
stored in the TM software of that relevant contact which is related to the phone number or contact
                                                   60

point in 498 and all such details and data should be assigned to the URL 504 and displayed to the
recipient on 507 to 518 so that the recipient may review any details and data stored on the TM
software by the user and review and edit or add to such details as desired.
[599] This 530 displays another method the user can execute in order to send an update request to
an existing contact. In this case the user may preferably press and hold down on a profile image of a
contact stored within the TM software and an expand menu will appear (this method is the preferred
method but other methods, icons or flows could be implemented to achieve the same result). The user
can then select one of the options from that menu which will begin the update request flow from 502
using the relevant phone number or email address from the relevant contact the user selected to send
the update request to. If the relevant contact has more than one phone number or email address the
user may send the update request to, then the user should be presented with a list of the possible
contact points that may receive the message and URL created in 503 and 504 and the user may choose
their desired contact point from the presented list.
[600] Visual flow can be found on Figure 2. If the user presses this option the user will be able to
begin a flow that will allow the user to send one or multiple update requests to people and contacts.
[601] Preferably a list of contacts stored on the TM software will be displayed to the user and the
user will have the ability to open, select and interact with the list of contacts displayed on this screen.
[602] The user should be able to display contacts that are contained within this list based on which
type of contact point method the user would like to use to send the update request to the contact or
contacts. If the user would like to send the update request via email then the user should select the
email icon. If the email icon is selected then all contacts stored within the TM software that have an
email address assigned to their contact details should be displayed here as an option for the user to
select. If a contact has more than one email address then each email address should be displayed here
within this list as is the case displayed below with Adam Pidding and the user may select precisely
which contact point or contact points to send the update request to..
[603] If the user would like to send the update request via mobile phone number then the user
should select the mobile phone icon. If the mobile phone icon is selected then all contacts stored
within the TM software that have a mobile phone number or a phone number assigned to their contact
details should be displayed here as an option for the user to select. If a contact has more than one
mobile phone number then each mobile phone number should be displayed within the list so that the
user may select precisely which contact point or contacts points to send the update request to. It
should be noted that additional contact points should also be available to the user where necessary and
a contact point may be an method that can receive a message or transmission from the user via a
contact point kept as part of the contact details stored for a contact within this document description.
[604] The user should have the option of a toggle that is titled with 'All'. If the user activates this
toggle then all contacts being displayed in the lower section should be actively selected. If the user
deactivates this toggle then all contacts being displayed in the lower section should be actively
deselected and set to a non-selected state.
[605] The user should have the ability to search the displayed list of contacts to locate a specific
contact stored within the TM software. In this case the user has searched for 'isaac' and each contact
with the name or detail Isaac has been displayed to the user. You will note that the list of possible
contacts displayed are only contacts that contain a phone number as the user has selected the mobile
icon in 534.
                                                     61

[606] The user has now selected the email icon with a search criteria of 'isaac' and the list below is
displaying results of each contact with the name or contact detail of 'isaac' that also has an email
address as a contact point within the contact details of that contact.
[607] In this case the user has selected the email addresses belonging to Shane Isaac and Shane
Isaac Two. One or multiple contacts may be selected each time this process is initiated by the user
and contacts may be selected from different search results and saved together collectively.
[608] After the user has selected the desired contact or contacts to send the update request or update
requests to the user may then press this 'Send' button. If the user has selected multiple contact points
there are preferably two ways the flow will proceed in order to distribute those update requests to the
relevant selected contacts (recipients). It should be noted that each recipient needs to receive a unique
URL (as described in 504, 506) which links to their relevant data being displayed and editable (flow
from 507). Because of this requirement the flow needs to proceed in a way that will allow these
unique URLs to be delivered to each individual recipient correctly.
[609] There are two preferred options for this requirement to be fulfilled. The first option is that the
user sends each request individually to each of the selected contacts in 537. The second option is that
the server sends each request individually to each of the selected contacts in 537.
[610] In this flow the display for sending individual update requests to each selected contact via
email will be displayed using the send by server option and sending individual update requests via
mobile phone number will be display using the send by user option. It should be noted that each of
these options may be reversed and used for the other contact method type, for example, the user may
send unique update requests to the selected contacts via email and the server may send unique update
requests to the selected contact via mobile phone (SMS). The user may or may not be presented with
selection a preferred method by the TM software.
[611] In this flow the user has opted to, or the TM software has been set to, send unique update
requests to the selected contacts via the server. After the user presses 538 (Send) data of the selected
contacts should be sent or referenced to the server via API containing details of all the selected
contact details, including the exact contact points (in this case email addresses) selected by the user in
537. The server will then use this data to create unique URLs and link relevant details for each
selected contact to the unique URLs so that each selected contacts details will be displayed in web
page format when the unique URL is accessed by the recipient (as displayed in flow from 507).
[612] Immediately after the user presses 538 via this flow of 539 the email addresses of the selected
contacts should be used to create a new email that should be sent from the user's email software on
their mobile phone or device. This email is a courtesy email from the user to notify that recipients
that an update request will be sent to them from the server email address as well as allowing the
recipients to feel at ease knowing the update request was initiated by the user (someone the contact
will most likely know).
[613] The email addresses from 537 should be populated into the BCC option by default for the
user so that email addresses are not shared or viewable between the recipients and should also contain
a short descriptive email explaining what the recipient can expect in the chosen flow an example of
which is given on this screen. The user may change the wording as so desired.
[614] After the server has received details in 539 the server will then send out emails to each
selected contact (recipient) and one email will be sent to each individual email address from 537 and
will contain a unique URL which will link the recipient to a web page that will display the current
                                                    62

contact details stored by the user in the TM software about the recipient and the flow will then
proceed from 507.
[615] In this flow the user has opted to, or the TM software has been set to, send unique update
requests to the selected contacts via the user. After the user presses 538 (Send) data of the selected
contacts should be sent or referenced to the server via API containing details of all the selected
contact details, including the exact contact points (in this case mobile phone numbers) selected by the
user in 537. The server will then use this data to create unique URLs and link relevant details for each
selected contact to the unique URLs so that each selected contacts details will be displayed in web
page format when the unique URL is accessed by the recipient (as displayed in flow from 507).
[616] After the server has processed and created unique URLs for each selected contact (recipient)
the API should return such data back to the TM software and the TM software should store the unique
URLs and other required data and wait for further action by the user.
[617] Preferably on this screen 543 there should be some brief instructions for the user as well as a
list of the selected contacts and the relevant contact point for each of the selected contacts that the
user may press on and select from individually.
[618] The user may tap and select one of the intended recipients (selected contacts) from the list to
actively select that contact.
[619] After the user has actively selected an intended recipient the user may then press the 'Send'
button.
[620] When the user presses the send button 545, the TM software will call the mobile phone or
device's texting software (SMS software) and automatically open a window containing a short
message and the unique URL that was specifically created by the server to link the recipient to
relevant details about the recipient via the URL which will be displayed and accessed by the recipient
on a web page.
[621] The message will be automatically addressed to the relevant contact point details as selected
by the user in 537 and selected in 544.
[622] The unique URL which links the intended recipient to the unique web page should also be
included within the message and when the recipient receives the message the recipient may then press
on the unique URL and be directed to the flow from 507 viewing current contact details stored by the
user in the TM software about the recipient.
[623] After the user has sent the message from screen 546 the TM software flow should return to
screen 543 and the details of the recipient should be removed from the list of intended recipients who
are still waiting to be sent their message and unique URLs. The remaining details in the list should
consist of selected contacts that have not yet been sent a message and unique URL.
[624] Accordingly, in a further aspect, the invention provides a system and method for enabling
communications between a first user and a second user having respective contact identifiers that are
each issued to those users by one or more third party providers, wherein the users interact with the
system with electronic communications devices, and wherein the system includes:
          a first database for storing first data indicative of the contact identifier for the first user and
          second data for defining a user identifier for the first user;
                                                        63

         an interface that is responsive to the electronic communications device of the first user
         providing the contact identifier for the second user for updating the first data to be indicative
         also of the contact identifier for the second user;
         a processor that is responsive to:
                  the first data for establishing communication with the electronic communications
                  device of the second user to seek a confirmation signal from the second user; and
                  the confirmation signal from the second user for updating the second data to also
                  define a user identifier for the second user.
[625] According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a system and method for
enabling communications between a first user and a second user having respective contact identifiers
that are each issued to those users by one or more third party providers, wherein the users interact
with the system with electronic communications devices, and wherein the system includes:
         a first database for storing first data indicative of the contact identifiers for the users and
         second data for defining a user identifier for each of the users;
         an interface that is responsive to the electronic communications device of the first user for
         updating the first data to be indicative of a new contact identifier for the second user;
         a processor that is responsive to:
                  the updating of the first data for selectively establishing communication with the
                  electronic communications device of the second user to seek a confirmation signal
                  from the second user; and
                  the confirmation signal from the second user for updating the second data to also
                  define the new contact identifier for the second user.
[626]    The addressee is now directed to the continuing description of this preferred embodiment.
[627] After the user has selected each intended recipient and sent messages containing the unique
URL to each intended recipient the user should then be displayed with an option to select "Finished"
and should be redirected back the dial pad or contacts tab. Preferably the user will automatically be
directed back to the dial pad or contacts tab immediately after sending the final message to the last
remaining intended recipient from the list in this screen.
[628] Preferably the user will be able to create a theme for their dial pad screen display which will
allow an image to be utilised and a involved a variety of display settings (an image themed dial pad
display or ITDPD). It should be noted that the ability to add an ITDPD is in addition to 370 to 373.
An option within the TM software should allow the user access to begin the flow of adding or selected
an ITDPD. When the user presses on this 550 'Set Image Background' screen 551 will load.55 1. This
screen allows the user to view a list of pre-existing ITDPDs, interact with those ITDPDs and create
new ITDPDs.
[629] Preferably each ITDPD will be assigned a name              by the user, however, in the event that the
user does not assign a name through the creation process         a default name will be assigned by the TM
software so that item may be identified as different from       other listed ITDPDs on this screen. In this
case the existing ITDPD is named "Food". The ITDPDs             should be displayed in a list that will allow
                                                       64

unlimited number of ITDPDs to be displayed. If the user taps on this 552 then a pop up menu will
appear 578. If the user selects "View" from that pop up menu then 556 will load.
[630] There can be multiple ITDPDs set up by the user on the TM software, therefore, a method of
displaying to the user which ITDPD is selected and presented on the dial pad screen should be
present. In this case we have illustrated the selected ITDPD by displaying the word "Selected" to the
right of the ITDPD name. An icon such as a tick or similar would also suffice.
[631] The user must also be able to edit or delete an ITDPD. In this case we have adapted a method
of displaying the edit and delete options if the user makes a right to left sliding motion on top of the
ITDPD listed item. If the user taps on EDIT then the user will be able to edit that ITDPD with
regards to the name, image and theme. If the user taps on DELETE then the user will delete the
record of that ITDPD and the image and theme settings.
[632] The user must also be able to create a new ITDPD. In this case we have used an icon
displayed in the lower right of the screen. If the user taps on this icon the flow of adding a new
ITDPD will begin first starting with the user selecting an image for their ITDPD.
[633] The user has pressed on 552 and selected View from the pop up menu. The user is now
viewing the ITDPD for 'Food' 552.
[634] The user will have an option to select this ITDPD. If the user presses on this Select option
then this ITDPD will be set as 'Selected' 553 and will be displayed on their TM software dial pad
screen.
[635] After the user has pressed 555 the user should be able to select an image to add for the
ITDPD. In this case we have accessed the devices local storage and presented image options from
that storage.
[636] Once the user has selected an image from 558 the image should be displayed to the user and
require the user to crop the image to a vertical rectangular shape as displayed below. The shape
should be cropped in this particular shape to allow for a clear display on a dial pad which is more
likely to have a vertical rectangular shape. After the user has decided which part of the image to crop
the user may press "Done" and proceed to the next screen.
[637] This screen will allow the user to view an example of how their selected image will appear on
their dial pad screen and will also allow the user to set a background colour (BGC) and a call button
style (CBS).
[638] To the left is a camera icon. If the user presses on this icon the user will be able to restart the
flow from 558 and select a different image.
[639] Below 562 there is a vertical list of colours displaying. If the user taps on a colour from this
list, that respective colour will be set as the BGC and will be displayed as the BGC for the ITDPD. A
preview of how this will appear on the dial pad screen will be displayed to the user to the left of 564.
[640] To the right of 563 is a horizontally stacked list of colours displaying. If the user taps on a
colour from this list then the CBS will change depending on which colour the user has tapped. A
preview of how this will appear on the dial pad screen will be displayed to the user to the left of 565.
[641] The BCG selected from 562 is being displayed to the user in the tab bar section of the dial pad
screen. Because the user has selected to add a ITDPD the image will be displayed across the majority
of the dial pad screen background instead of the BGC.
                                                    65

[642] The CBS selected from 563 is being displayed to the user in the position where the call button
is displayed on the dial pad screen.
[643] The image selected by the user through 558 and 559 should be displayed and previewed to the
user in this section so that the user may gauge of the image will appear and look on the dial pad
screen.
[644] After the user has completed selection options from 560-566 the user may press next and
proceed to the next screen. All items selected by the user so far should be stored on the local database
that the user return and edit options before completing the flow of adding the ITDPD.
[645] The user should be prompted to assign a name to the ITDPD. In this case the user has
selected a name 'Tree'. If the user chooses to skip this step then a name must be assigned by the TM
software so the ITDPD is identifiable to the user and other users.
[646] An option for the CBS to have a glowing effect should also be available for selection to the
user. If the user selects Yes on this option then the CBS on the dial pad screen should have an
animated glowing effect applied.
[647] On this screen 568 the user will be able to select the colour of icons and buttons (IBC - the
IBCs include three icons at the top of the dial pad screen, the prompt words (i.e. Dial a Number), the
toggle icon to the right of Dial a Number, the colour of the dial pad number buttons if the user has
selected standard display and the colour of the icons and the text displayed in the tab bar at the bottom
of the dial pad screen) , the colour of icons and buttons when those icons and buttons are selected
(IBCSS) and the style of the dial pad screen buttons (DPSB).
[648] Below 570 is a vertical list of colours being displayed. If the user taps on a colour from this
list, the colour display of the IBCs will be altered. Note that IBCs are illustrated and identified in
screen 573 within the blue dotted lines.
[649] To the right of 571 is a horizontal stacked list displaying various colours. If the user selects a
colour from this list then the display of colour of the IBCSS will be altered. Some of the icons on the
dial pad screen and in the tab bar can be in a selected state and the user may select the colour
displayed when that icon or button is in a selected state. In this case the IBCSS is Yellow as is
pointed out in this screen 569 within the green dotted lines.
[650] To the right of this 572 is a toggle button which allows the user to select the DPSB. The user
may choose between a Glass display or a Standard display. In this case the user has selected Glass
and therefore the dial pad buttons preview is displayed with a Glass effect as illustrated within the
white dotted lines on this screen 569.
[651] An example is made on this screen 573 after the user has selected to display a Standard
DPSB. The dial pad screen buttons are changed from the glass effect to a standard colour effect. In
this case the colour has been selected as white from 570.
[652] It should be noted that the user may not select an identical or similar colour from 570 and 571
otherwise the IBCs may not be visible to the user.
[653] In this screen example 575 the user has selected a colour of green for the ICBs and a colour of
white for the ICBSSs and changed the DPSB to Glass.
[654] After the user has selected their desired display settings the user may press the Save option
and save the ITDPD. When the user presses Save all of the final selected set by the user from 568 to
576 should be recorded inside the TM software local database and synced to the server when there is a
                                                    66

live internet connection so that the ITDPD will be completely backed up and saved also allowing the
ITDPD to be imported on other devices should the user use the TM software on another device. The
data saved in the ITDPD should be the name of the ITDPD, the image, the BGC, the CBS, the IBC,
the IBCSS, the DPSB and any other relevant data. It should be noted that the selections made by the
user and displayed here on screen 576 are the final selections before the user saved the theme.
[655] The ITDPD saved and created on 576 has now been listed on this screen and has been
automatically assigned a Selected state and will be automatically displayed on the user's dial pad
screen until the user selects a different ITDPD or sets up a different dial pad screen colour theme.
[656] If the user taps on a listed item on this screen then a pop up menu will appear which will
allow the user to select various methods of interacting with the ITDPD.
[657] If the user presses this option VIEW then 556 will load and will allow the user to ability to
view the preview of the ITDPD and also change that ITDPD to a selected state.
[658] If the user presses this option Edit Colour Background then the TM software will load 560
and allow the user to edit various available settings on that screen.
[659] If the user presses this option Edit Buttons, Text and Icons Display then the TM software will
load 596 and allow the user to edit various available settings on that screen.
[660] If the user presses Cancel then this pop up menu will cease display and the user will be
returned to access on the previous screen.
[661] If the user presses this option Send, then the user will have the ability to send their ITDPD or
one of their Custom Dial Pad Sound Themes (CDPST) to another user. It should be noted that
CDPSTs are defined particularly in 378, 379, 380, 381, 382 and 383 throughout the dial pad custom
sound flow. A user may send a ITDPD or a CDPST to another user and the ITDPD or CDPST will be
assigned to the other users dial pad screen and displayed and played when the user views or interacts
with their personal dial pad screen.
[662] Preferably an option to Send a CDPST from 378 will be available to the user. Additionally,
when the user presses on this 583 the user may also select from a pop up option to send a CDPST as
well. If the user chooses Yes to send a CDPST then a list of existing CDPSTs will be presented to the
user and the user may select one of those CDPSTs to send to another user.
[663] After the user has selected options from 583 the user will be able to select with other user
they would like to send the ITDPD and or CDPST to. Preferably there will be an option for the user
to view other existing users that are stored as contacts within the TM software. The user should also
be able to search for these user contacts to find them easier. The user may select one or more user
contacts to send the ITDPD and or CDPST to. In this case the user has select a contact user (now the
receiving user) with the identifier of sixplus. Please follow the flow from the TM software of sixplus
from 585.
[664] It should be noted that this is now a different instance of the TM software from 584 and this
screen is a shot of the dial pad screen of user sixplus. It should also be noted that this image is
displaying the current theme chosen by sixplus and displayed on the dial pad screen belonging to
sixplus.
[665]    Sixplus will receive a notification informing user sixplus that another user has sent a custom
theme to them. Details of the notification will be displayed within a screen on the TM software, in
this case we have used a screen called the Discovery screen and displayed it under the Activity tab.
                                                    67

[666] Details of which user has sent the ITDPD and or CDPST to the other user (in this example
sixplus) should be displayed to the receiving user.
[667] An option for the user to Accept the ITDPD and or CDPST would be available to the
receiving user. When the receiving user presses this option "Accept" the ITDPD or the CDPST will
immediately be assigned to Selected status on the receiving users device and TM software and be
displayed or played when the user accesses the relevant screen that plays and displays the details, in
this case the dial pad screen. When the user presses Accept the user should also be displayed a pop up
option offering the user to 'Always Accept Themes from <the name or ID of the sending user". If the
receiving user presses "Yes" the any future ITDPDs and or CDPSTs sent by that particular sending
user will be 'automatically' accepted by the receiving user and automatically assigned for display or
playback on the receiving user's device.
[668] It should be noted that the receiving user may already have an active ITDPD and or CDPST
selected and displayed on their device before they press Accept (Prior ITDPD and or CDPST). This
Prior ITDPD and or CDPST must not be lost and must be backed up by the TM software before
assigning the sending user's ITDPD and or CDPST (Sent ITDPD and or CDPST). In this displayed
case, the receiving user (sixplus) will be able to revert back to the custom theme displayed on 585
which would be considered as the Prior ITDPD and or CDPST.
[669] In order to achieve this the TM software will automatically save details of the Prior ITDPD
and or CDPST to the receiving user's 551 list (if ITDPD) or 375 list (if CDPST) using the name of
the ITDPD and or CDPST and all relevant details set up for those items by the receiving user, before
assigning the Sent ITDPD and or CDPST to the receiving user's TM software. This way the receiving
user will not lose their any existing ITDPDs and or CDPSTs and will be able to revert back to any
prior ITDPDs and or CDPSTs as they so wish.
[670] It should also be noted that when a receiving user Accepts an ITDPD and or CDPST from a
sending user, the complete details (including the name of the theme) are saved, stored and backed up
to the server under the receiving users account and are treated as property of the receiving user. The
receiving user may edit, resend, delete and have any other normal ability to interact with the Sent
ITDPD and or CDPST from another user.
[671] When the receiving user now loads their dial pad screen, the Sent ITDPD and or CDPST
(sounds) from the sending user is now displayed on the receiving user's dial pad screen. In this case
the data selected by the sending user from 558 to 576 is not set as display on the receiving user's
device. If the sending user sent a CDPST then when the receiving user presses relevant buttons on the
dial pad, those CDPSTs will playback.
[672] Accordingly, in a further aspect, the invention provides a system and method for applying a
theme to a graphical user interface (GUI) of an electronic communications device of a user, wherein
the system includes:
         a first database for storing first data for at least one theme and second data for defining a
         theme identifier for each theme;
         an interface for receiving a first signal from the communications device indicative of a
         selection of one of the theme identifiers and providing a second signal to the device for
         allowing the selected one of the themes to be applied to the GUI of the device; and
         a processor that is responsive to the first signal and the second data for selectively accessing
         the first data and generating the second signal.
                                                       68

[673] The preferred embodiments of the invention are able to offer the following advantageous
functions and advantages:
[674] A piece of software that can import, create, manipulate, edit, add to, request from, store,
connect to, more easily define, and facilitate access details about people or entities using unique
methods which are presently non-existent, including reducing time for users to perform existing
functions and to enable the users to perform new functions.
[675] A system which allows easier identification of a user ID allowing more premium and easier to
remember user IDs to be used as a contact point by users. (This is the unique concept of attributing a
colour to a user ID that is already defined by geographical location therefore allowing an expanded
number of premium IDs to be used. For example, at least one user ID needs to be unique for a person
to contact that other person, an email address for example should be developerbrisbane@gmail.com
and there cannot be another email address with the exact same name otherwise the recipient will not
be guaranteed to receive correspondence. With the embodiments of the invention the possible unique
IDs are able to be extended over ten-fold using a colour system and even more so using geographical
locations. The colour system is easy for a person to remember and also easy for a person to identify
and relate to. Previously you could have developerbrisbane@gmail.com, but with the system used in
the     present     preferred     embodiments       it    is   possible     to    have,   for     example,
developerbrisbane@gmaill.com (blue) (green) (black) etc. The initial unique ID is used to allow the
easy contact to a unique ID that is still easy for the person to identify with (i.e. Jack(black)
Jack(Gold), Jack(Silver) etc.
[676] A process which allows the user to interact with phone numbers or contact points in numerous
ways using an expanding menu from the call button. (To date the call button on a software dial pad is
used to place a call or display a recently called phone number. In this software, the user can enter a
phone number (or load a contact from the software into the focused area in the dial pad) then press
and hold down on the call button to display an expand menu which contains numerous other useful
interactive abilities for the user - i.e. send a message directly to the focused number / contact, send an
audio message to the focused number / contact, request information from the focused number /
contact, send your contact details to the focused number / contact, create an alert/reminder to call or
email (or other) for the focused number / contact).
[677] A service which allows the user to set and interact with speed dial contacts in new ways. (To
date a user can assign a contact to a number or button on their dial pad and when the user presses that
corresponding number or button the contact will be called. Using this software the user can do a
number of additional features not invented before. The user can assign a traditional style speed dial as
discussed, or the user can also assign a pop up speed dial which means that when the user presses on a
button with a pop up speed dial assigned to it, a pop up will appear displaying a complete profile for a
contact and allowing a user to access numerous details instantly.
[678] A tap and display method which allows the user to tap in a certain area on the dial pad and
display profile photos, profile images, names of contacts that area assigned to buttons on the dial pad.
(this is a new invention that allows the user to quickly remember who they have assigned to which
button and switches between different software methods when doing it (so when displaying the speed
dial contacts the user can tap on those items to get the same action as a long hold would usually create
and can toggle between the two displays easily)).
[679] Dial Pad toggle method type which allows the user to switch between different display
methods based on the data the user enters into the dial pad. (To date a user can dial a number on a
                                                       69

dial pad or just T9 logic to find a contact. In this software, the user can easily tap and switch between
3 different methods - 1) Dial a number 2) Find by Name and 3) Find by Number. 1 is standard, 2
means that when the user is dialling on the dial pad the name of the contacts stored within the
software is used and displayed in large font using T9 logic (enhanced T9 logic) 3 means that the user
is using T9 logic to find a contact and the number is larger and the main focus on the screen. Once
the user sees the contact they desire they can tap on that display and auto select that contact).
[680] Dial pad transparent list display. (The dial pad is transparent so that a list of further possible
contacts that may match the logic used in the preceding paragraph but are not the top possible match
are still displayed and viewable by the user behind the dial pad. The user can tap to reduce the dial
pad at any time and access the list behind the dial pad to access their desired contact from the results
faster / more easily).
[681] Contact Point ordering. (A user can order their contact points for their user account. For
example, if a user prefers to be contacted via a certain contact point the user can place that contact
point at the top of their contact point list. That list is then displayed to other people / users in the
order the account user set it to so the viewer of those contact points can see the order the user wishes
to be contacted by. For example, a person may prefer to receive emails so they put their email contact
point at the top of the list. Or a person may prefer to be contacts by skypeTM, so they put their skypeTM
contact point at the top of the list. Next the user may prefer texting than calls so the user puts their
SMS contact point next and so forth).
[682] A user can also set contact point ordering for their other contacts so the user can contact
people in their preferred method too.
[683] A user can have up to multiple profiles on their account. (In the presently envisaged
embodiments this is capped at six profiles as a practical limitation. However, in other embodiments,
different numbers of profiles are allowed). Each profile photo may have a different privacy setting
assigned to it so that different audiences may see different profile photos. (for example, a user might
want to have a profile photo for their work colleagues to see, but another profile photo that they would
prefer their friends to see .. and another profile photo again that they would like their partner to see..
family to see etc).
[684] Certain processes to allow the user to merge any contacts and for the system to detect and
prevent those contacts from being imported again. (This is able to be supplemented by using a
flagging system that allows the user to manually merge any contacts within the software and we flag
merged contacts in a way that those contacts cannot be re-imported into the software after they have
been manually merged).
[685] Left / Right hand configuration. (We implemented a system which allows the user to choose
display of content based on what hand they use to hold their phone / device. The user can mix and
match a number of variables to achieve a desirable display which makes it easier for the user to access
important data while holding the phone with one hand (even more useful today with phone screens
increasing in size)).
[686] Contact request feature. (This is a new concept flow that allows the user to send an update
contact request to a new person or an existing contact. User might meet a new person, dial in their
phone number to the dial pad, long hold on the call button, select details update request and the flow
will commence to send a unique URL to the phone number and that person can fill in their own details
etc).
                                                     70

[687] Business card transcription flow. (This includes transcribing business cards using the
software and external servers, but the flow is very unique and allows the user to review / keep /
discard / edit details much easier than other methods to date).
[688] Shared Groups - this functionality allows a user to create a group, add contacts to that group
and pool / share those contacts with other users. The creator of the group is able to grant and revoke
access to the group, and so forth. Other users are able to add / edit their own details within the group.
[689] Grouping contacts - have created a user interface that groups contacts faster than any other UI
presently commercially available. This allows for large time savings for users by facilitating the
grouping of a users contacts.
[690] Dial pad sounds feature (which includes sounds played when the user uses the dial pad, the
ability to create and use custom sounds, and the ability to assign a different sound to each button on
the dial pad).
                                                    71
