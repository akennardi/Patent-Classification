10       GENERAL BACKGROUND
         4-benzyloxy-3-methoxy-4'-methylbenzophenone           is  a   kind   of    synthesis
   intermediates, it is used for the production of anti-parkinson's disease drug tokamycin.
   procainamide However, most of the existing synthesis methods are using a mixture of
   hydrochloric acid, chromium oxide and pyridine constitutes a reactant. In this method
15 of production, the chromium oxide will lead to higher post-reaction pollution
   treatment costs, hydrochloric acid's volatility and corrosivity will lead to higher
   anticorrosion requirements for equipment, equipment maintenance costs is higher, it is
   not conducive to lower production costs, the synthesis method is complicated.
   Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new synthetic method.
