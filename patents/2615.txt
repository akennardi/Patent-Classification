                                      Invention Title
 Method for controlling a railway vehicle, associated control system and railway vehicle
The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method
                            of performing it known to me/us:-

                                                     1a
              The present invention relates to a method for controlling a railway vehicle,
   comprising the following steps: moving the railway vehicle forward, wherein the railway
   vehicle is driven by a traction system, and receiving, via a railway vehicle control system, a
   stop command defining an extreme stop position located in front of the railway vehicle.
 5            This method is typically intended to assist in the parking of the railway vehicle in a
   railway siding. The extreme stop position is thus the position of one end of the siding for the
   railway vehicle.
              Due to civil engineering constraints on the layout of sidings, the size of the siding is
   sometimes too short to allow automatic vehicle parking without having the railway vehicle
10 come into contact with the end of the vehicle siding at a non-zero collision speed.
              When the size of the siding is too short, the only existing choices are then to
   sacrifice the criterion of safety of the absence of collision with the end of the garage track, or
   to have manual parking of the vehicle by its driver.
              The first choice may not be always acceptable. The second choice runs counter to
15 an approach for automating the driving of railway vehicles, nor does it guarantee that there
   will be no collision with the end of the railway siding.
              The invention therefore aims to reduce the minimum stopping distance required for
   the railway vehicle in order to prevent it coming into contact with an obstacle or overshooting
   the end stop position.
20            For this purpose, the invention relates to a method for controlling a railway vehicle
   of the aforementioned type which also comprises the following steps: determination of a
   traction inhibition zone extending behind the extreme stop position, and activation of a
   traction inhibition module to prevent the traction system driving the railway vehicle forward
   when the railway vehicle is in the traction inhibition zone.
25            Furthermore, the method may have one or more of the following features, taken
   alone or in any technically feasible combination:
              -   a current speed of the railway vehicle is measured and, during the activation
                  step, the traction inhibition module is activated when the railway vehicle is in the
                  traction inhibition zone and the current speed is below a threshold speed;
30            -   a current speed of the railway vehicle is measured, and the traction inhibition
                  module is deactivated when the current speed is greater than a threshold speed;
              -   the threshold speed is comprised between 3 km/h and 6 km/h;

                                                     2
              -   the traction inhibition zone extends from the extreme stop position to a threshold
                  position located behind the extreme stop position, at a threshold distance from
                  the extreme stop position;
              -   a current speed of the railway vehicle is measured, and the traction inhibition
 5                module is deactivated when the current speed is zero;
              -   a current speed and a current distance of the railway vehicle relative to the
                  extreme stop position are measured, wherein the control system of the railway
                  vehicle comprises an engagement module for an emergency braking system of
                  the railway vehicle, wherein it is programmed to engage the emergency braking
10                when the current distance of the railway vehicle falls below a warning distance
                  associated with the current speed, wherein the engagement module has a first
                  mode of operation when the rail vehicle is outside the traction inhibition zone
                  and/or that the traction inhibition module is deactivated, wherein the warning
                  distance has a first value, and a second operating mode when the railway
15                vehicle is in the traction inhibition zone and the traction inhibition module is
                  activated, wherein the warning distance has a second value lower than the first
                  value;
              -   the extreme stop position is the position of one end of a railway siding of the
                  railway vehicle.
20           The invention also relates to a control system of a railway vehicle that is
   programmed to receive a stop command defining an extreme stop position located in front of
   the railway vehicle, wherein the control system comprises an electronic computer that is
   programmed to determine a traction inhibition zone extending behind the extreme stop
   position, in order to prevent a railway vehicle traction system from driving the railway vehicle
25 forward when the railway vehicle is in the traction inhibition zone.
             The invention also relates to a railway vehicle comprising a control system as
   defined above.
             The invention will be better understood upon reading the description which follows,
   given solely by way of example and with reference to the appended drawings, wherein:
30            Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of a vehicle according to the invention;
              Fig. 2 shows a graph showing examples of changes in the current speed of the
                      railway vehicle as a function of the current position; and
              Fig. 3 shows a flowchart of a method according to the invention.

                                                   3
              Fig. 1 shows a railway vehicle 10 according to the invention.
             The railway vehicle 10 comprises a traction system 12 designed to move the vehicle
   10 along a railway track, a braking system 14 of the vehicle 10, and a control system 16
   monitoring the operation of the railway vehicle 10. The traction system 12 and the braking
 5 system 14 are connected to the control system 16.
             The vehicle 10 further comprises wheels (not shown) for traveling on the railway. In
   the remainder of the description, the terms "front" and "rear" are applied with respect to the
   direction of circulation of the vehicle 10.
             The vehicle 10 has a front end and a rear end.
10            For example, the vehicle 10 may be a passenger train or an urban transport vehicle
   such as a subway. Alternatively, it may be any type of guided vehicle traveling on a dedicated
   infrastructure, such as a monorail.
             The traction system 12 is particularly suitable for driving the vehicle 10 forward. For
   this purpose, the traction system 12 typically comprises one or more motors for moving the
15 vehicle 10 along the railway track and a power module to supply power to the, or each, motor.
   These elements are well known and are not illustrated or described in more detail here.
             The braking system 14 comprises a service brake 18 and an emergency brake 20.
   The emergency brake 20 is configured to ensure that braking is available in all situations,
   even in the event of failure of the service brake 18. For this purpose, the emergency brake 20
20 is designed to meet SIL 4 level certification according to the standards EN 50126, EN 50128,
   EN 50129.
             The control system 16 comprises a system 22 for measuring a current speed of the
   railway vehicle 10, a system 24 for determining a current position of the vehicle 10 along the
   railway, a system 26 for receiving external information, an automated driving module 28, an
25 engagement module 30 for an emergency braking system of the railway vehicle 10, and an
   electronic computer 32.
             The systems and modules of the control system 16 are connected to the electronic
   computer 32.
             The measurement system 22 measures a current speed of the railway vehicle 10,
30 and may be, for example, an odometer. The current speed is here defined as the
   instantaneous speed of the front end of the vehicle 10.

                                                    4
             The system 24 for determining the current position is designed to measure the
   current position of the railway vehicle 10. The current position of the railway vehicle 10 is here
   defined as the position of the front end of the vehicle 10 along the railway track.
             For this purpose, the determination system 24 comprises, for example, an odometric
 5 system capable of calculating the displacement of the train as a function of the movement of
   the wheels relative to a known reference point identified by reading a beacon. Such an
   odometric system is known per se and will not be described in more detail here.
           The system 26 for receiving external information is designed to receive information
   external to the railway vehicle 10. This information is typically transmitted by a railway
10 signaling system outside the vehicle 10 by means of a communications system, for example
   comprising a radio link of the GSM-R or WiFi or LTE type, or with transponders fixedly placed
   along the railway and inductively coupled to a corresponding receiver on the vehicle 10.
             This information preferably comprises a stop command defining an extreme stop
   position Pa situated in front of the railway vehicle 10.
15           The external information reception system 26 is thus designed to receive a stop
   command defining an end stop position Pa (see Fig. 2) located in front of the railway vehicle.
   This extreme stop position Pa is, for example, the position of one end of a railway track of the
   railway vehicle 10. In a variant, the extreme stop position Pa is a position from which the rail
   vehicle 10 is obliged to reverse.
20           The automated driving module 28 is designed to regulate the current speed of the
   vehicle 10 and to replace a driver.
             For example, the automated driving module 28 is an ATO (Automatic Train
   Operation) type module.
             The automated driving module 28 is designed to control the traction system 12 and
25 the braking system 14. Specifically, the automated driving module 28 is programmed to
   actuate, cut out and/or control the service brake 18 and the traction system 12.
             In particular, the automated driving module 28 is designed to determine, as a
   function of the extreme stop position Pa received, a deceleration profile of the railway vehicle
   10 until an effective stop position Pe.
30           An example of a deceleration profile is illustrated in Fig. 2 by the curve C1.
             The engagement module 30 is intended to ensure that the railway vehicle 10 does
   not overshoot the extreme stop position Pa. For this purpose, the engagement module 30 is

                                                    5
   typically in the form of a module known under the acronym ATP (Automatic Train Protection)
   and as defined by the IEEE 1474 standard.
              The engagement module 30 is programmed to engage the emergency brake 20 of
   the braking system 14 when, for a given current speed Vd, the current distance of the rail
 5 vehicle 10 from the extreme stop position Pa is less than a warning distance Da with respect
   to the extreme stop position Pa.
              The curve C2 of Fig. 2 is an example of a curve relating to the warning distance Da
   regulated by the engagement module 30. The engagement module 30 is programmed to
   engage the emergency brake 20 in the case where the curve C1 passes over the curve C2.
10            The warning distance Da depends on the current speed of the vehicle 10. In
   particular, for a given current speed Vd, the warning distance Da is calculated from a
   minimum braking distance Dm. For a given current speed Vd, this minimum distance Dm is
   the distance below which the emergency brake 20 is unable to brake the vehicle 10 before
   the extreme stop position Pa.
15            The minimum distance Dm is defined as a function of the configuration of the track,
   such as the presence of a steep curve or gradient, and the emergency braking capability.
              The curve C3 of Fig. 2 is an example of a curve relating to the minimum braking
   distance Dm. In the case where the curve C1 passes over the curve C3, the emergency
   brake 20 is not able to stop the vehicle 10 before the extreme stop position Pa. This case
20 must never occur since the emergency brake 20 is triggered on the curve C2.
              For a given current speed Vd, the warning distance Da is greater than the minimum
   distance Dm. The difference between the warning distance Da and the minimum distance Dm
   constitutes a first safety margin M1. This first safety margin M1 is defined in more detail
   below.
25            For a given speed Vd, the automated driving module 28 is advantageously designed
   to regulate the deceleration profile so that the current position has a second safety margin M2
   between the current position and a warning position, wherein the warning position is located
   at the warning distance Da from the extreme stop position Pa.
              For a given speed, this second safety margin M2 corresponds, for example, to the
30 distance traveled by the vehicle 10 at the given speed for two seconds. This second safety
   margin M2 is calculated by the automated driving module 28.
              The electronic computer 32 comprises a module for determining a traction inhibition
   zone 34, and a traction inhibition module 36.

                                                     6
              These modules 34, 36 are typically implemented in the form of programs stored in a
   memory 38 of the computer 32 and executable by a processor 42 of the computer 32. As a
   variant, these modules 34, 36 may be at least partially implemented in the form of
   programmable logical components, or in the form of dedicated integrated components within
 5 the electronic computer 32.
              The module 34 for determining a traction inhibition zone is designed to determine a
   traction inhibition zone ZI (shown in Fig. 2) extending behind the extreme stop position Pa.
              The traction inhibition zone ZI extends from the extreme stop position Pa to a
   threshold position Ps located behind the extreme stop position Pa at a threshold distance Ds
10 from the extreme stop position Pa.
              The threshold distance Ds is here independent of the current speed of the vehicle
   10. The threshold distance is advantageously between 10 m and 40 m.
              The traction inhibition module 36 may be activated and deactivated by the computer
   32.
15            The traction inhibition module 36 is designed to be activated at least when the
   railway vehicle 10 is in the traction inhibition zone ZI and the current speed is neither zero nor
   greater than a threshold speed Vs. The railway vehicle 10 is considered to be in the traction
   inhibition zone ZI when the distance between the front end of the vehicle 10 and the extreme
   stop position Pa is less than the threshold distance Ds. More particularly, the railway vehicle
20 10 is considered to be in the traction inhibition zone ZI when the current position is situated
   between the threshold position Ps and the extreme stop position Pa.
              When the traction inhibition module 36 is activated, it is designed to prevent the
   traction system 12 from driving the railway vehicle 10 forward when the railway vehicle 10 is
   in the traction inhibition zone ZI.
25            In the example of Fig. 2, the traction inhibition module 36 is designed to be
   deactivated when the current speed of the railway vehicle 10 is greater than a threshold
   speed Vs.
              The threshold speed Vs is here independent of the current position of the vehicle
   10. The threshold speed Vs is advantageously comprised between 3 km/h and 6 km/h.
30            The traction inhibition module 36 is also designed to be deactivated when the
   current speed of the railway vehicle 10 is canceled when the railway vehicle 10 is in the
   traction inhibition zone ZI.

                                                      7
              When the traction inhibition module 36 is deactivated, the traction system 12 of the
   railway vehicle 10 is allowed to drive the railway vehicle 10 forward, even when the railway
   vehicle 10 is in the traction inhibition zone ZI.
              When the railway vehicle 10 is thus outside the traction inhibition zone ZI and/or
 5 when the traction inhibition module 36 is deactivated, the module 30 for engagement of the
   emergency braking has a first mode of operation wherein, for a given current speed Vd, the
   warning distance has a first value Da.
              For a given current speed Vd, the first value of the warning distance Da is
   calculated from the minimum distance Dm as a function of an estimated delay required to cut
10 off traction towards the front of the traction system 12 caused by a traction command sent to
   the traction system 12 and as a function of an estimated delay for activation of the emergency
   brake 20.
              The safety margin of the first value of the warning distance Da with respect to the
   minimum distance Dm is thus calculated in order to be greater than the sum of the distances
15 traveled as a result of these two delays.
              This first mode of operation is illustrated in Fig. 2 by the curve C2.
              When the railway vehicle 10 is in the traction inhibition zone ZI and the traction
   inhibition module 36 is activated, the engagement module 30 has a second mode of
   operation wherein, for a given current speed Vd, the warning distance has a second value
20 Da'.
              For a given current speed Vd, the second value of the warning distance Da' is less
   than the first value of the warning distance Da.
              In fact, for a given current speed Vd, the second value of the warning distance Da' is
   calculated from the minimum distance Dm as a function of the estimated activation delay for
25 the emergency brake 20 and, advantageously, only as a function of this delay. As the forward
   traction of the vehicle 10 by the traction system 12 is prevented, the second value of the
   warning distance Da' is not calculated as a function of an estimated delay to cut off forward
   traction of the traction system 12.
              The safety margin M1' of the second value of the warning distance Da' with respect
30 to the minimum distance Dm thus no longer includes the estimated delay for cutting off
   forward traction of the traction system 12.
              This second mode of operation is illustrated in Fig. 2 by the curve C2'.

                                                     8
              The automated driving module 28 is designed to determine a first deceleration
   profile (curve Cl) that is applicable when the traction inhibition module 36 is deactivated, and
   a second deceleration profile (curve C1') that is applicable when the inhibition module traction
   36 is activated and the railway vehicle 10 is in the traction inhibition zone ZI. The second
 5 deceleration profile Cl' defines an effective stop position Pe' closer to the stop end position
   Pa than the actual stop position Pe defined by the first deceleration profile C1. This is made
   possible by the fact that the first safety margin M1' of the warning distance Da' with the
   minimum distance Dm is reduced when the traction inhibition module 36 is activated and the
   railway vehicle 10 is in the traction inhibition zone ZI.
10            A method of controlling the railway vehicle 10 according to the invention will now be
   described with reference to Fig. 3.
              The method is applicable here in the case where the railway vehicle 10 is to be
   parked on a railway siding having an end against which the vehicle 10 must not come into
   contact.
15            The railway vehicle 10 thus moves forward, driven by the traction system 12.
              During this process, the measurement system 22 determines the current speed of
   the railway vehicle 10, while the system 24 determines the current position of the railway
   vehicle 10.
              This current speed and this current position are transmitted to the electronic
20 computer 32.
              A railway signaling system outside the vehicle 10 sends a stop command defining
   the extreme stop position Pa located in front of the railway vehicle 10, wherein this extreme
   stop position Pa is here the position of the end of the railway siding
              The system 26 of the railway vehicle control system 10 for receiving external
25 information receives this stop command and transmits it to the electronic computer 32 during
   a reception step 100.
              This step 100 is followed by a step 102 for determining the traction inhibition zone
   during the course of which the determination module 34 determines a traction inhibition zone
   ZI extending behind the extreme stop position Pa, to a threshold position Ps.
30            The method then comprises a step 104 for activating the traction inhibition module
   36. This step is preferably engaged when it is detected that the current position is ahead of
   the threshold position Ps, and that the current speed is less than a threshold speed Vs. The

                                                     9
   traction inhibition module 36 then prevents the traction system 12 from driving the railway
   vehicle 10 forward as long as the railway vehicle 10 is in the traction inhibition zone ZI.
              Once the traction inhibition module 36 has been engaged, the automated driving
   module 38 regulates the current speed of the vehicle 10 according to the second deceleration
 5 profile Cl' during a step 106. The automated driving module 38 actuates and controls the
   service brake 18 accordingly.
              In a variant, the automated driving module 38 presents the second deceleration
   profile Cl' to a driver of the vehicle 10 who himself controls the service brake 18 as a function
   of the second deceleration profile C1'.
10            The railway vehicle 10 finally stops at an effective stop position Pe' defined by the
   second deceleration profile Cl' during a stopping step 108.
              After the stopping step 108, the method comprises a step 110 for deactivating the
   traction inhibitor module 36.
              By virtue of the invention, the safety margins over the distances are reduced and
15 the railway vehicle 10 may be stopped closer to the extreme stop position Pa without coming
   into contact with or overshooting this position. The stop may also be performed automatically,
   without the intervention of a driver.
              In comparison with a conventional control system, the control system 16 according

              7. Control method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein a current
   speed and a current distance of the railway vehicle relative to the extreme stop position are
   measured,
              and wherein the railway vehicle control system comprises a module for engaging an
 5 emergency braking system of the railway vehicle that is programmed to engage emergency
   braking when the current distance of the railway vehicle becomes less than a warning
   distance associated with the current speed, wherein the engagement module has a first mode
   of operation when the railway vehicle is outside the traction inhibition zone and/or the traction
   inhibition module is deactivated wherein the warning distance has a first value, and a second
10 operating mode when the railway vehicle is in the traction inhibition zone and the traction
   inhibit module is activated wherein the warning distance has a second value less than the first
   value.
              8. Control method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
15 extreme stop position is the position of an end of a railway siding of the railway vehicle.
