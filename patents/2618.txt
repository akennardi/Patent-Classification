   5    This application claims the benefit of New Zealand Provisional Patent Application
       No. 544432 filed December 23, 2005, which is incorporated by reference herein in its
        entirety.
                                   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 10    This invention relates to methods and compositions for determining the prognosis of
       cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, in a patient. Specifically, this invention relates
       to the use of genetic markers for determining the prognosis of cancer, such as
       colorectal cancer, based on prognostic signatures.
 15                          BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in the developed world,
       and its incidence is continuing to increase. Although the progression of colorectal
       cancer from benign polyp to adenoma to carcinoma is well studied (1), the molecular
      events influencing the transition and establishment of metastasis are less well
20    understood. The prognosis and treatment of CRC currently depends on the clinico
      pathological stage of disease at the time of diagnosis, and primary surgical treatment.
      Unfortunately disease stage alone does not allow accurate prediction of outcome for
      individual patients. Ifpatient outcomes could be predicted more accurately treatments
      could be tailored to avoid under-treating patients destined to relapse, or over-treating
25    patients who would be helped by surgery alone.
     Many attempts have been made to identify markers that predict clinical outcome in
     CRC. Until recently most studies focused on single proteins or gene mutations with
     limited success in terms of prognostic information (2). Microarray technology
30   enables the identification of sets of genes, called classifiers or signatures that correlate
     with cancer outcome.       This approach has been applied to a variety of cancers,
     including CRC (3-5), but methodological problems and a lack of independent
     validation has cast doubt over the findings (6,7).       Furthermore, doubts about the
     ability of classifiers/signatures to predict outcome have arisen due to poor
                                                  1

       WO 2007/073220                                                           PCT/NZ2006/000343
       concordance of identified by different researchers using different array platforms and
       methodologies (8).
       There is a need for further tools to predict the prognosis of colorectal cancer. This
   5   invention provides further methods, compositions, kits, and devices based on
       prognostic cancer markers, specifically colorectal cancer prognostic markers, to aid in
       the prognosis and treatment of cancer.
                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 10    In certain embodiments there is provided a set of markers genes identified to be
      differentially expressed in recurrent and non-recurrent colorectal tumours. This set of
      genes can be used to generate prognostics signatures, comprising two or more
      markers, capable of predicting the progression of colorectal tumour in a patient.
 15   The individual markers can differentially expressed depending on whether the tumour
      is recurrent or not. The accuracy of prediction can be enhanced by combining the
      markers together into a prognostic signature for, providing for much more effective
      individual tests than single-gene assays. Also provided for is the application of
     techniques, such as statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data mining
20   to the prognostics signatures to generate prediction models. In another embodiment,
     expression levels of the markers of a particular prognostic signature in the tumour of a
     patient can then be applied to the prediction model to determine the prognosis.
     In certain embodiments, the expression level of the markers can be established using
25   microarray methods, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), or
     immunoassays.
     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES
              This invention is described with reference to specific embodiments thereof and
30   with reference to the figures, in which:
              Figure 1 depicts a flow chart showing the methodology for producing the
     prognostic signatures from 149 New Zealand (NZ) and 55 German (DE) colorectal
     cancer (CRC) samples.           New Zealand RNA samples were hybridized to
                                                 2

       WO 2007/073220                                                           PCT/NZ2006/000343
        oligonucleotide spotted arrays, with a 22-gene signature produced via leave one out
        cross validation (LOOCV), and then independently validated by LOOCV using the 55
        sample DE data set. German RNA samples were hybridized to Affymetrix arrays,
        with a 19-gene signature produced via LOOCV, and then independently validated by
   5   LOOCV using the NZ data set.
               Figure 2 depicts a Kaplan-Meier analysis of disease-free survival time with
       patients predicted as high versus low risk of tumour recurrence: a, using NZ 22-gene
       signature on 149 tumours from NZ patients; b, using DE 19-gene signature on 55
 10    tumours from DE patients; c, NZ prognostic signature validated on 55 tumours from
       DE patients; d, DE prognostic signature validated on 149 tumours from NZ patients.
       P-values were calculated using the log-rank test.
               Figure 3 depicts a Kaplan-Meier analysis of disease free survival time with
 15    patients predicted as high versus low risk of tumour recurrence: a, using the 22-gene
      NZ signature on NZ patients with Stage II and Stage III disease; b, using the19-gene
       DE signature On NZ Patients with Stage HI and Stage IIl disease.
               Figure 4 shows the predictive value of signatures of varying lengths for
20    prognosis of colorectal cancer. These signatures were derived from 10 replicate runs
      of 11-fold cross validation. Each replicate 11-fold validation run is indicated by the
      various dashed lines; the mean across replicates by the bold line. In each fold of the
      cross-validation, genes were removed if the fold-change across classes was < 1.1 (for
      the remaining samples .not removed in that particular fold). The genes were then
25    ranked using a modified t-statistic, obtaining a different set of genes for each fold, and
      classifiers using the top n- genes (where n=2 to 200) were constructed for each fold.
      The genes therefore may differ for each fold of each replicate 11-fold cross validation.

             Figure 6 shows a pairs chart of "top counts" (number of times each gene
     appeared in the "top-n" gene lists, i.e., top 10, top 20, top 100, and top 325 as
     described in Example 17) using three different normalization methods produced using
     the R statistical computing package(10,39) , in accordance with Example 17, below.
 15  The "pairs" chart is described in by Becker et al, in their treatise on the S Language
     (upon which R is based; see reference 39) To compare methods, use row and column
     as defined on the diagonal to obtain the scatter plot between those two methods,
    analogous to reading distances off a distance chart on a map

    appeared in the "top-n" gene lists, i.e., top 10, top 20, top 100, and top 325 as
    described in Example 17) using three different filtering statistics: (a) two-sample
    Wilcoxon test (41), (b) t-test (modified using an ad-hoc correction factor in the
    denominator to abrogate the effect of low-variance genes falsely appearing as
25  significant) and (c) empirical Bayes as provided by the "limma"(10,40,42) package
    of Bioconductor (12,40).
    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    Definitions
30  Before describing embodiments of the invention in detail, it will be useful to provide
    some definitions of terms used herein.
    The term "marker" refers to a molecule that is associated quantitatively or
    qualitatively with the presence of a biological phenomenon. Examples of "markers"
                                                 4

      WO 2007/073220                                                            PCT/NZ2006/000343
      include a polynucleotide, such as a gene or gene fragment, RNA or RNA fragment; or
      a gene product, including a polypeptide such as a peptide, oligopeptide, protein, or
      protein fragment; or any related metabolites, by products, or any other identifying
      molecules, such as antibodies or antibody fragments, whether related directly or
  5   indirectly to a mechanism underlying the phenomenon. The markers of the invention
      include the nucleotide sequences (e.g., GenBank sequences) as disclosed herein, in
      particular, the full-length sequences, any coding sequences, any fragments, or any
      complements thereof, and any measurable marker thereof as defined above.
 10   The terms ."CCPM" or "colorectal cancer prognostic marker" or "CCPM family
     member" refer to a marker with altered expression that is associated with a particular
     prognosis, e.g., a higher or lower likelihood of recurrence of cancer, as described
     herein, but can exclude molecules that are known in the prior art to be associated with
     prognosis of colorectal cancer. It is to be understood that the term CCPM does not
 15  require that the marker be specific only for colorectal tumours. Rather, expression of
     CCPM can be altered in other types of tumours, including malignant tumours.
     The terms "prognostic signature," "signature," and the like refer to a set of two or
     more markers, for example CCPMs, that when analysed together as a set allow for the
20   determination of or prediction of an event, for example the prognostic outcome of
     colorectal cancer. The use of a signature comprising two or more markers reduces the
     effect of individual variation and allows for a more robust prediction. Non-limiting
     examples of CCPMs are set forth in Tables 1, 2, 5, and 9, while non-limiting examples
     of prognostic signatures are set forth in Tables 3, 4, 8A, 8B, and 9, herein. In the
25   context of the present invention, reference to "at least one," "at least two," "at least
    five," etc., of the markers listed in any particular set (e.g., any signature) means any
    one or any and all combinations of the markers listed.
    The term "prediction method" is defined to cover the broader genus of methods from
30  the fields of statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data mining, which
    can be used to specify a prediction model. These are discussed further in the Detailed
    Description section.
                                                  5

       WO 2007/073220                                                             PCT/NZ2006/000343
        The term "prediction model" refers to the specific mathematical model obtained by
        applying a prediction method to a collection of data. In the examples detailed herein,
        such data sets consist of measurements of gene activity in tissue samples taken from
       recurrent and non-recurrent colorectal cancer patients, for which the class (recurrent
   5   or non-recurrent) of each sample is known. Such models can be used to (1) classify a
       sample of unknown recurrence status as being one of recurrent or non-recurrent, or (2)
       make a probabilistic prediction (i.e., produce either a proportion or percentage to be
       interpreted as a probability) which represents the likelihood that the unknown sample
       is recurrent, based on the measurement of mRNA expression levels or expression
 10    products, of a specified collection of genes, in the unknown sample. The exact details
       of how these gene-specific measurements are combined to produce classifications and
       probabilistic predictions are dependent on the specific mechanisms of the prediction
       method used to construct the model.
 15    "Sensitivity", "specificity" (or "selectivity"), and "classification rate", when applied to
      the describing the effectiveness of prediction models mean the following:
       "Sensitivity" means the proportion of truly positive samples that are alsopredicted(by
      the model) to be positive. In a test for CRC recurrence, that would be the proportion
      of recurrent tumours predicted by the model to be recurrent. "Specificity" or
20    "selectivity" means the proportion of truly negative samples that are also predicted(by
      the model) to be negative. In a test for CRC recurrence, this equates to the proportion
      of non-recurrent samples that are predicted to by non-recurrent by the model.
      "Classification Rate" is the proportion of all samples that are correctly classified by
      the prediction model (be that as positive or negative).
25
     As used herein "antibodies" and like terms refer to immunoglobulin molecules and
     immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules, i.e., molecules
     that contain an antigen binding site that specifically binds (immunoreacts with) an
     antigen. These include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric,
30   single chain, Fc, Fab, Fab', and Fab 2 fragments, and a Fab expression library.
     Antibody molecules relate to any of the classes IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, and IgD, which
     differ from one another by the nature of heavy chain present in the molecule. These
     include subclasses as well, such as IgGl, IgG2, and others. The light chain may be a
     kappa chain or a lambda chain. Reference herein to antibodies includes a reference to
                                                    6

        WO 20071073220                                                        PCT/NZ2006/000343
         all classes, subclasses, and types. Also included are chimeric antibodies, for
                                                                                        example,
        monoclonal antibodies or fragments thereof that are specific to more than one source,
        e.g., a mouse or human sequence. Further included are camelid antibodies, shark
        antibodies or nanobodies.
   5
        The terms "cancer" and "cancerous" refer to or describe the physiological condition in
        mammals that is typically characterized by abnormal or unregulated cell growth.
        Cancer and cancer pathology can be associated, for example, with metastasis,
        interference with the normal functioning of neighbouring cells, release of cytokines or
 10     other secretary products at abnormal levels, suppression or aggravation of
       inflammatory or immunological response, neoplasia, premalignancy, malignancy,
       invasion of surrounding or distant tissues or organs, such as lymph nodes, etc.
       Specifically included are colorectal cancers, such as, bowel (e.g., large bowel),
                                                                                           anal,
       and rectal cancers.
 15
       The term "colorectal cancer" includes cancer of the colon, rectum, and/or anus, and
       especially, adenocarcinomas, and may also include carcinomas (e.g., squamous
       cloacogenic carcinomas), melanomas, lymphomas, and sarcomas. Epidermoid
       (nonkeratinizing squamous cell or basaloid) carcinomas are also included. The cancer
20    may be associated with particular types of polyps or other lesions, for example, tubular
      adenomas, tubulovillous adenomas (e.g., villoglandular polyps), villous (e.g.,
      papillary) adenomas (with or without adenocarcinoma), hyperplastic polyps,
      hamartomas, juvenile polyps, polypoid carcinomas, pseudopolyps, lipomas, or
      leiomyomas. The' cancer may be associated with familial polyposis and related
25    conditions such as Gardner's syndrome or Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. The cancer may
      be associated, for example, with chronic fistulas, irradiated anal skin, leukoplakia,
      lymphogranuloma venereum, Bowen's disease (intraepithelial carcinoma), condyloma
      acuminatum, or human papillomavirus. In other aspects, the cancer may be associated
     with basal cell carcinoma, extramammary Paget's disease, cloacogenic carcinoma, or
30   malignant melanoma.
     The terms "differentially expressed," "differential expression," and like phrases, refer
     to a gene marker whose expression is activated to a higher or lower level in a subject
     (e.g., test sample) having a condition, specifically cancer, such as colorectal cancer,
                                                   7

       WO 2007/073220                                                            PCT/NZ2006/000343
       relative to its expression in a control subject (e.g., reference sample). The terms also
       include markers whose expression is activated to a higher or lower level at different
       stages of the same condition; in recurrent or non-recurrent disease; or in cells with
       higher or lower levels of proliferation. A differentially expressed marker may be
   5   either activated or inhibited at the polynucleotide level or polypeptide level, or may be
       subject to alternative splicing to result in a different polypeptide product. Such
       differences may be evidenced by a change in mRNA levels, surface expression,
       secretion or other partitioning of a polypeptide, for example.
 10    Differential expression may include a comparison of expression between two or more
      markers (e.g., genes or their gene products); or a comparison of the ratios of the
       expression between two or more markers (e.g., genes or their gene products); or a
       comparison of two differently processed products (e.g., transcripts or polypeptides) of
      the same marker, which differ between normal subjects and diseased subjects; or
 15   between various stages of the same disease; or between recurring and non-recurring
      disease; or between cells with higher and lower levels of proliferation; or between
      normal tissue and diseased tissue, specifically cancer, or colorectal cancer. Differential
      expression includes both quantitative, as well as qualitative, differences in the
      temporal or cellular expression pattern in a gene or its expression products among, for
20    example, normal and -diseased cells, or among cells which have undergone different
      disease events or disease stages, or cells with different levels of proliferation.
     The term "expression" includes production of polynucleotides and polypeptides, in
     particular, the production -ofRNA (e.g., mRNA) from a gene or portion of a gene, and
25   includes the production of a polypeptide encoded by an RNA or gene or portion of a
     gene, and the appearance of a detectable material associated with expression. For
     example, the formation of a complex, for example, from a polypeptide-polypeptide
     interaction, polypeptide-nucleotide interaction, or the like, is included within the scope
     of the term "expression". Another example is the binding of a binding ligand, such as
30   a hybridization probe        or antibody, to     a gene or other polynucleotide          or
     oligonucleotide, a polypeptide or a protein fragment, and the visualization of the
     binding ligand. Thus, the intensity of a spot on a microarray, on a hybridization blot
     such as a Northern blot, or on an immunoblot such as a Western blot, or on a bead
                                                  8

       WO 2007/073220                                                        PCT/NZ2006/000343
        array, or by PCR analysis, is included within the term "expression" of the underlying
        biological molecule.
                The terms "expression threshold," and "defined expression threshold" are used
   5    interchangeably and refer to the level of a marker in question outside which the
       polynucleotide or polypeptide serves as a predictive marker for patient survival
       without cancer recurrence. The threshold will be dependent on the predictive model
       established are derived experimentally from clinical studies such as those described in
       the Examples below. Depending on the prediction model used, the expression
 10    threshold may be set to achieve maximum sensitivity, or for maximum specificity, or
       for minimum error (maximum classification rate). For example a higher threshold
       may be set to achieve minimum errors, but this may result in a lower sensitivity.
       Therefore, for any given predictive model, clinical studies will be used to set an
      expression threshold that generally achieves the highest sensitivity while having a
 15   minimal error rate. The determination of the expression threshold for any situation is
      well within the knowledge of those skilled in the art.
               The term "long-term survival" is used herein to refer to survival for at least 5
      years, more preferably for at least 8 years, most preferably for at least 10 years
20    following surgery or other treatment.
      The term "microarray" refers to an ordered or unordered arrangement of capture

      and organisms.
      The term "polynucleotide," when used in the singular or plural, generally refers to any
  5   polyribonucleotide or polydeoxribonucleotide, which may be unmodified RNA or
      DNA or modified RNA or DNA.             This includes, without limitation, single- and
      double-stranded DNA, DNA including single- and double- stranded regions, single
      and double-stranded RNA, and RNA including single- and double-stranded regions,

 10  typically, double-stranded or include single- and double-stranded regions. Also
     included are triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA.
      Specifically included are mRNAs, cDNAs, and genomic DNAs, and any fragments
     thereof. The term includes DNAs and RNAs that contain one or more modified bases,
     such as tritiated bases, or unusual bases, such as inosine. The polynucleotides of the
 15  invention can encompass coding or non-coding sequences, or sense or antisense
     sequences. It will be understood that each reference to a "polynucleotide" or like
     term, herein, will include the full-length sequences as well as any fragments,
     derivatives, or variants thereof.
20   "Polypeptide," as used herein, refers to an oligopeptide, peptide, or protein sequence,
     or fragment thereof, and to naturally occurring, recombinant, synthetic, or semi
     synthetic molecules. Where "polypeptide" is recited herein to refer to an amino acid
     sequence of a naturally occurring protein molecule, "polypeptide" and like terms, are
    not meant to limit the amino acid sequence to the complete, native amino acid
25   sequence for the full-length molecule. It will be understood that each reference to a
     "polypeptide" or like term, herein, will include the full-length sequence, as well as any
    fragments, derivatives, or variants thereof.
    The term "prognosis" refers to a prediction of medical outcome, for example, a poor or
30  good outcome (e.g., likelihood of long-term survival); a negative prognosis, or poor
    outcome, includes a prediction of relapse, disease progression (e.g., tumour growth or
    metastasis, or drug resistance), or mortality; a positive prognosis, or good outcome,
    includes a prediction of disease remission, (e.g., disease-free status), amelioration
    (e.g., tumour regression), or stabilization.

       The term "qPCR" or "QPCR" refers to quantative polymerase chain reaction as
       described, for example, in PCR Technique: Quantitative PCR, J.W. Larrick, ed., Eaton
       Publishing, 1997, and A-Z of Quantitative PCR, S. Bustin, ed., IUL Press, 2004.
 10    The term "tumour" refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation, whether
       malignant or benign, and all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues.
               "Stringency" of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of
      ordinary skill in the art, and generally is an empirical calculation dependent upon
 15   probe length, washing temperature, and salt concentration. In general, longer probes
      require higher temperatures for proper annealing, while shorter probes need lower
      temperatures. Hybridization generally depends on the ability of denatured DNA to
      reanneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below their
      melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the probe
20    and hybridisable sequence, the higher the relative temperature which can be used. As
      a result, it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the reaction
      conditions more stringent, while lower temperatures less so. Additional details and
      explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions, are found e.g., in Ausubel
                                                                                        et al.,

     Description of Embodiments of the Invention
30             In colorectal cancer, discordant results have been reported for prognostic
     markers. The present invention discloses the use of microarrays to reach a firmer
     conclusion, and to determine the prognostic role of specific prognostic signatures in
     colorectal cancer. The microarray-based studies shown herein indicate that particular
     prognostic signatures in colorectal cancer are associated with a prognosis.         The
                                                 12

         invention can therefore be used to identify patients at high risk
                                                                           of recurrence of cancer,
         or patients with a high likelihood of recovery.
         The present invention provides for markers for the determination of disease prognosis,
   5     for example, the likelihood of recurrence of tumours, including colorectal tumours.
         Using the methods of the invention, it has been found that numerous markers are
         associated with the prognosis of colorectal cancer, and can be used to predict disease
        outcome. Microarray analysis of samples taken from patients with various stages of
        colorectal tumours has led to the surprising discovery that specific patterns of marker
  10    expression are associated with prognosis of the cancer.            The present invention
        therefore provides for a set of genes, outlined in Table 1 and Table 2, that are
        differentially expressed in recurrent and non-recurrent colorectal cancers. The genes
        outlined in Table 1 and Table 2 provide for a set of colorectal cancer prognostic
       makers (CCPMs).
 15
       A decrease in certain colorectal cancer prognostic markers (CCPMs),
                                                                                     for example,
       markers associated with immune responses, is indicative of a particular prognosis.
       This can include increased likelihood of cancer recurrence after
                                                                              standard treatment,
       especially for colorectal cancer. Conversely, an increase in other CCPMs is indicative
 20    of a particular prognosis.      This can include disease progression or the increased
       likelihood of cancer recurrence, especially for colorectal cancer. A decrease or
       increase in expression can be determined, for example, by comparison of a test
      sample, e.g., patient's tumour sample, to a reference sample, e.g., a sample associated
      with a known prognosis. In particular, one or more samples from patient(s) with non
25    recurrent cancer could be used as a reference sample.
      For example, to obtain a prognosis, expression levels in a patient's
                                                                                    sample (e.g.,
      tumour sample) can be compared to samples from patients with a known outcome. If
     the patient's sample shows increased or decreased expression of one or more CCPMs
30   that compares to samples with good outcome (no recurrence), then a positive
     prognosis, or recurrence is unlikely, is implicated. If the patient's sample shows
     expression of one or more CCPMs that is comparable to samples with poor outcome
     (recurrence), then a positive prognosis, or recurrence of the tumour is likely, is
     implicated.
                                                   13

       WO 2007/073220                                                         PCT/NZ2006/000343
        As further examples, the expression levels of a prognostic signature comprising two
        or more CCPMS from a patient's sample (e.g., tumour sample) can be compared to
        samples of recurrent/non-recurrent cancer. If the patient's sample shows increased or
   5    decreased expression of CCPMs by comparison to samples of non-recurrent cancer,
       and/or comparable expression to samples of recurrent cancer, then a negative
       prognosis is implicated. If the patient's sample shows expression of CCPMs that is
       comparable to samples of non-recurrent cancer, and/or lower or higher expression
       than samples of recurrent cancer, then a positive prognosis is implicated.
 10
       As one approach, a prediction method can be applied to a panel of markers, for
       example the panel of CCPMs outlined in Table 1 and Table 2, in order to generate a
       predictive model. This involves the generation of a prognostic signature, comprising
      two or more CCPMs.
 15
       The disclosed CCPMs in Table 1 and Table 2 therefore provide a useful set of markers
      to generate prediction signatures for determining the prognosis of cancer, and
      establishing a treatment regime, or treatment modality, specific for that tumour. In
      particular, a positive prognosis can be used by a patient to decide to pursue standard or
20    less invasive treatment options. A negative prognosis can be used by a patient to
      decide to terminate treatment or to pursue highly aggressive or experimental
      treatments. In addition, a patient can chose treatments based on their impact on the
      expression of prognostic markers (e.g., CCPMs).
25    Levels of CCPMs can be detected in tumour tissue, tissue proximal to the tumour,
     lymph node samples, blood samples, serum samples, urine samples, or faecal samples,
     using any suitable technique, and can include, but is not limited to, oligonucleotide
     probes, quantitative PCR, or antibodies raised against the markers. It will be
     appreciated that by analyzing the presence and amounts of expression of a plurality of
30   CCPMs in the form of prediction signatures, and constructing a prognostic signature
     (e.g., as set forth in Tables 3, 4, 8A, 8B, and 9), the sensitivity and accuracy of
     prognosis will be increased. Therefore, multiple markers according to the present
     invention can be used to determine the prognosis of a cancer.

        The invention includes the use of archived paraffin-embedded biopsy material for
        assay of the markers in the set, and therefore is compatible with
                                                                                 the most widely
        available type of biopsy material. It is also compatible with several different methods
        of tumour tissue harvest, for example, via core biopsy or fine needle aspiration. In
   5    certain aspects, RNA is isolated from a fixed, wax-embedded cancer tissue specimen
        of the patient. Isolation may be performed by any technique known in the art, for
        example from core biopsy tissue or fine needle aspirate cells.
       In one aspect, the invention relates to a method of predicting a prognosis, e.g., the
  10   likelihood of long-term survival of a cancer patient without the recurrence of cancer,
       comprising determining the expression level of one or more prognostic markers or
       their expression products in a sample obtained from the patient, normalized against the
       expression level of other RNA transcripts or their products in the sample, or of a
       reference set of RNA transcripts or their expression products. In specific aspects, the
 15    prognostic marker is one or more markers listed in Tables 1, 2, or 5, , or is included as
       one or more of the prognostic signatures derived from the markers
                                                                              listed in Tables 1,
      2, and 5, or the prognostic signatures listed in Tables 3, 4, 8A, 8B, or 9.
      In further aspects, the expression levels of the prognostic markers or their expression
 20   products are determined, e.g., for the markers listed in Tables 1, 2, or 5, a prognostic
      signature derived from the markers listed in Tables 1, 2, and 5, e.g., for the prognostic
      signatures listed in Tables 3, 4, 8A, 8B, or 9. In another aspect, the method comprises
      the determination of the expression levels of a full set of prognosis markers or their
      expression products, e.g., for the markers listed in Tables 1, 2, or 5, or, a prognostic
25    signature derived from the markers listed in Tables 1, 2, and 5, e.g., for the prognostic
     signatures listed in Tables 3, 4, 8A, 8B, or 9.
     In an additional aspect, the invention relates to an array (e.g., microarray) comprising
     polynucleotides hybridizing to two or more markers, e.g., for the markers listed in
30   Tables 1, 2, and 5, , or a prognostic signature derived from the markers listed in Tables
     1, 2, and 5, e.g., the prognostic signatures listed in Tables 3, 4, 8A, 8B, and 9. In
     particular aspects, the array comprises polynucleotides hybridizing to prognostic
     signature derived from the markers listed in Tables 1, 2, and 5, or e.g., for the
     prognostic signatures listed in Tables 3, 4, 8A, 8B, or 9. In another specific aspect, the

       array comprises polynucleotides hybridizing to the full set of markers, e.g., for the
       markers listed in Tables 1, 2, or 5, or, e.g., for the prognostic signatures listed in
       Tables 3, 4, 8A, 8B, or 9.
  5    For these arrays, the polynucleotides can be cDNAs, or oligonucleotides, and the solid
       surface on which they are displayed can be glass, for example. The polynucleotides
       can hybridize to one or more of the markers as disclosed herein, for example, to the
       full-length sequences, any coding sequences, any fragments, or any complements
      thereof. In particular aspects, an increase or decrease in expression levels of one or
 10   more CCPM indicates a decreased likelihood of long-term survival, e.g., due to cancer
      recurrence, while a lack of an increase or decrease in expression levels of one or more
      CCPM indicates an increased likelihood of long-term survival without cancer
      recurrence.

         General approaches to prognostic marker detection
                The following approaches are non-limiting methods that can be used to detect
        the proliferation markers, including CCPM family members: microarray approaches
   5    using oligonucleotide probes selective for a CCPM; real-time qPCR on tumour
        samples using CCPM specific primers and probes; real-time qPCR on lymph node,
        blood, serum, faecal, or urine samples using CCPM specific primers and probes;
        enzyme-linked immunological assays (ELISA); immunohistochemistry using anti
        marker antibodies; and analysis of array or qPCR data using computers.
 10
                Other useful methods include northern blotting and in situ hybridization
        (Parker and Barnes, Methods in Molecular Biology 106: 247-283 (1999)); RNase
       protection assays (Hod, BioTechniques 13: 852-854 (1992)); reverse transcription
       polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; Weis et al., Trends in Genetics 8: 263-264
 15    (1992)); serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE; Velculescu et-al., Science 270:
       484-487 (1995); and Velculescu et al., Cell 88: 243-51 (1997)), MassARRAY
       technology (Sequenom, San Diego, CA), and gene expression analysis by massively
       parallel signature sequencing (MPSS; Brenner et al., Nature Biotechnology 18: 630
       634 (2000)). Alternatively, antibodies may be employed that can recognize specific
20     complexes, including DNA duplexes, RNA duplexes, and DNA-RNA                           hybrid
       duplexes or DNA-polypeptide duplexes.
               Primary data can be collected and fold change analysis can be performed, for
      example, by comparison of marker expression levels in tumour tissue and non-tumour
25    tissue; by comparison of marker expression levels to levels determined in recurring
      tumours and non-recurring tumours; by comparison of marker expression levels to
      levels determined in tumours with or without metastasis; by comparison of marker

      WO 2007/073220                                                         PCT/NZ2006/000343
      expression levels to levels determined in differently staged tumours; or by comparison
      of marker expression levels to levels determined in cells with different levels of
      proliferation. A negative or positive prognosis is determined based on this analysis.
      Further analysis of tumour marker expression includes matching those markers
  5   exhibiting increased or decreased expression with expression profiles of known
      colorectal tumours to provide a prognosis.
      A threshold for concluding that expression is increased will be dependent on the
     particular marker and also the particular predictive model that is to be applied. The
 10  threshold is generally set to achieve the highest sensitivity and selectivity with the
     lowest error rate, although variations may be desirable for a particular clinical
      situation. The desired threshold is determined by analysing a population of sufficient
     size taking into account the statistical variability of any predictive model and is
     calculated from the size of the sample used to produce the predictive model. The
 15  same applies for the determination of a threshold for concluding that expression is
     decreased. It can be appreciated that other thresholds, or methods for establishing a
     threshold,for concluding that increased or decreased expression has occurred can be
     selected without departing from the scope of this invention.
20   It is also possible that a prediction model may produce as it's output a numerical
    value, for example a score, likelihood value or probability. In these instances, it is
    possible to apply thresholds to the results produced by prediction models, and in these
    cases similar principles apply as those used to set thresholds for expression values.
25  Once the expression level, or output of a prediction model, of a predictive signature in
    a tumour sample has been obtained, the likelihood of the cancer recurring can then be
    determined.
             From the markers identified, prognostic signatures comprising one or more
30  CCPMs can be used to determine the prognosis of a cancer, by comparing the
    expression level of the one or more markers to the disclosed prognostic signature. By
    comparing the expression of one or more of the CCPMs in a tumour sample with the
    disclosed prognostic signature, the likelihood of the cancer recurring can be
    determined. The comparison of expression levels of the prognostic signature to
                                               38

        establish a prognosis can be done by applying a predictive model as described
        previously.
                Determining the likelihood of the cancer recurring is of great value to the
   5   medical practitioner. A high likelihood of re-occurrence means that a longer or higher
       dose treatment should be given, and the patient should be more closely monitored for
       signs of recurrence of the cancer. An accurate prognosis is also of benefit to the
       patient. It allows the patient, along with their partners, family, and friends to also
       make decisions about treatment, as well as decisions about their future and lifestyle
 10    changes. Therefore, the invention also provides for a method establishing a treatment
       regime for a particular cancer based on the prognosis established by matching the
       expression of the markers in a tumour sample with the differential expression
       signature.
 15            It will be appreciated that the marker selection, or construction of a prognostic
      signature, does not have to be restricted to the CCPMs disclosed in Tables 1,
                                                                                         2, or 5,
      herein, or the prognostic signatures disclosed in Tables 3, 4, 8A, 8B, and 9, but could
      involve the use of one or more CCPMs from the disclosed signatures, or a new
      signature may be established using CCPMs selected from the disclosed marker lists.
20    The requirement of any signature is- that it predicts the likelihood of recurrence with
      enough accuracy to assist a medical practitioner to establish a treatment regime.
      Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR)
               Of the techniques listed above, the most sensitive and most flexible
25    quantitative method is RT-PCR, which can be used to compare RNA levels in
      different sample populations, in normal and tumour tissues, with or without drug
     treatment, to characterize patterns of expression, to discriminate between closely
     related RNAs, and to analyze RNA structure.
30            For RT-PCR, the first step is the isolation of RNA from a target sample. The
     starting material is typically total RNA isolated from human tumours or tumour cell
     lines, and corresponding normal tissues or cell lines, respectively. RNA can be
     isolated from a variety of samples, such as tumour samples from breast, lung, colon
     (e.g., large bowel or small bowel), colorectal, gastric, esophageal, anal, rectal,
                                                  39

      WO 2007/073220                                                        PCT/NZ2006/000343
      prostate, brain, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, testis, ovary, uterus, etc.,
      tissues, from primary tumours, or tumour cell lines, and from pooled samples from
      healthy donors.    If the source of RNA is a tumour, RNA can be extracted, for
      example, from frozen or archived paraffin-embedded and fixed (e.g., formalin-fixed)
  5   tissue samples.
              The first step in gene expression profiling by RT-PCR is the reverse
      transcription of the RNA template into cDNA, followed by its exponential
      amplification in a PCR reaction. The two most commonly used reverse transcriptases
 10   are avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT) and Moloney urine
      leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT). The reverse transcription step is
      typically primed using specific primers, random hexamers, or oligo-dT primers,
      depending on the circumstances and the goal of expression profiling. For example,
     extracted RNA can be reverse-transcribed using a GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin
 15  Elmer, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. The derived cDNA can
     then be used as a template in the subsequent PCR reaction.
             Although the PCR step can use a variety of thermostable DNA-dependent
     DNA polymerases, it typically employs the Taq DNA polymerase, which has a 5'-3'
20   nuclease activity but lacks a 3'-5' proofreading endonuclease activity. Thus, TaqMan
     (q) PCR typically utilizes the 5' nuclease activity of Taq or Tth polymerase to
     hydrolyze a hybridization probe bound to its target amplicon, but any enzyme with
     equivalent 5'nuclease activity can be used.
25           Two oligonucleotide primers are used to generate an amplicon typical of a
     PCR reaction. A third oligonucleotide, or probe, is designed to detect nucleotide
     sequence located between the two PCR primers. The probe is non-extendible by Taq
    DNA polymerase enzyme, and is labeled -with a reporter fluorescent dye and a
     quencher fluorescent dye.     Any laser-induced emission from the reporter dye is
30  quenched by the quenching dye when the two dyes are located close together as they
    are on the probe.      During the amplification reaction, the Taq DNA polymerase
    enzyme cleaves the probe in a template-dependent manner. The resultant probe
    fragments disassociate in solution, and signal from the released reporter dye is free
    from the quenching effect of the second fluorophore. One molecule of reporter dye is
                                                40

        WO 2007/073220                                                           PCT/NZ2006/000343
         liberated for each new molecule synthesized, and detection of the unquenched
         reporter dye provides the basis for quantitative interpretation of the data.
                 TaqMan RT-PCR can be performed using commercially available equipment,
   5     such as, for example, ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Perkin-Elmer
        Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), or Lightcycler (Roche Molecular
        Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). In a preferred embodiment, the 5' nuclease
        procedure is run on a real-time quantitative PCR device such as the ABI PRISM
        7700tam Sequence Detection System. The system consists of a thermocycler, laser,
 10     charge-coupled device (CCD), camera, and computer. The system amplifies samples
        in a 96-well format on a thermocycler. During amplification, laser-induced
        fluorescent signal is collected in real-time through fibre optics cables for all 96 wells,
        and detected at the CCD. The.system includes software for running the instrument
       and for analyzing the data.
 15
                5' nuclease assay data are initially expressed as Ct, or the threshold cycle. As
       discussed above, fluorescence values are recorded during every cycle and represent
       the amount of product amplified to that point in the amplification reaction. The point
       when the fluorescent signal is first recorded as statistically significant is the threshold
20     cycle.
                To minimize errors and the effect of sample-to-sample variation, RT-PCR is
      usually performed using an internal standard. The ideal internal standard is expressed
      at a constant level among different tissues, and is unaffected by the experimental
25    treatment. RNAs most frequently used to normalize patterns of gene expression are
      mRNAs for the housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase
      (GAPDH) and-actin.
     Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)
30             A more recent variation of the RT-PCR technique is the real time quantitative
     PCR, which measures PCR product accumulation through a dual-labeled fluorigenic
     probe (i.e., TaqMan probe). Real time PCR is compatible both with quantitative
     competitive PCR and with quantitative comparative PCR. The former uses an
     internal competitor for each target sequence for normalization, while the latter uses a
                                                   41

      WO 2007/073220                                                           PCT/NZ2006/000343
      normalization gene contained within the sample, or a housekeeping gene for RT-PCR.
      Further details are provided, e.g., by Held et al., Genome Research 6: 986-994 (1996).
              Expression levels can be determined using fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues as
  5   the RNA source. According to one aspect of the present invention, PCR primers and
      probes are designed based upon intron sequences present in the gene to be amplified.
      In this embodiment, the first step in the primer/probe design is the delineation of
      intron sequences within the genes. This can be done by publicly available software,
      such as the DNA BLAT software developed by Kent, W. J., Genome Res. 12 (4):
 10   656-64 (2002), or by the BLAST software including its variations. Subsequent steps
     follow well established methods of PCR primer and probe design.
              In order to avoid non-specific signals, it is useful to mask repetitive sequences
     within the introns when designing the primers and probes. This can be easily
 15  accomplished by using the Repeat Masker program available on-line through the
     Baylor College of Medicine, which screens DNA sequences against a library of
     repetitive elements and returns a query sequence in which the repetitive elements are
     masked. The masked sequences can then be used to design primer and probe
     sequences using any commercially or otherwise publicly available primer/probe
20   design packages, such as Primer Express (Applied Biosystens); MGB assay-by
     design (Applied Biosystems); Primer3 (Steve Rozen and Helen J. Skaletsky (2000)
     Primer3 on the WWW for general users and for biologist programmers in: Krawetz S,
     Misener S (eds) Bioinformatics Methods and Protocols: Methods in Molecular
     Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ, pp 365-386).
25
             The most important factors considered in PCR primer design include primer
    length, melting temperature (Tm), and G/C content, specificity, complementary primer
    sequences, and 3 ' end sequence. In general, optimal PCR primers are generally 17-30
    bases in length, and contain about 20-80%, such as, for example, about 50-60% G+C
30  bases. Melting temperatures between 50 and 80*C, e.g., about 50 to 70 0 C, are
    typically preferred. For further guidelines for PCR primer and probe design see, e.g.,

   5     Microarray analysis
                 Differential expression can also be identified, or confirmed using the
        microarray technique. Thus, the expression profile of CCPMs can be measured in
        either fresh or paraffin-embedded tumour tissue, using microarray technology. In this
        method, polynucleotide sequences of interest (including cDNAs and oligonucleotides)
 10     are plated, or arrayed, on a microchip substrate. The arrayed sequences (i.e., capture
       probes) are then hybridized with specific polynucleotides from cells or tissues of
        interest (i.e., targets). Just as in the RT-PCR method, the source of RNA typically is
       total RNA isolated from human tumours or tumour cell lines, and corresponding
       normal tissues or cell lines. Thus RNA can be isolated from a variety of primary
 15    tumours or tumour cell lines. If the source of RNA is a primary tumour, RNA can be
       extracted, for example, from frozen or archived formalin fixed paraffin-embedded
       (FFPE) tissue samples and fixed (e.g., formalin-fixed) tissue samples, which are
       routinely prepared and preserved in everyday clinical practice.
20              In a specific embodiment of the microarray technique, PCR amplified inserts
      of cDNA clones are applied to a substrate. The substrate can include up to 1, 2, 5, 10,
       15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or 75 nucleotide sequences. In other aspects, the
      substrate can include at least 10,000 nucleotide sequences. The
                                                                                 microarrayed
      sequences, immobilized on the microchip, are suitable for hybridization under
25    stringent conditions. As other embodiments, the targets for the microarrays can be at
      least 50, 100, 200, 400, 500, 1000, or 2000 bases in length; or 50-100, 100-200, 100
      500, 100-1000, 100-2000, or 500-5000 bases in length. As further embodiments, the
     capture probes for the microarrays can be at least 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 80, or 100
     bases in length; or 10-15, 10-20, 10-25, 10-50, 10-75, 10-80, or 20-80 bases in length.
30
               Fluorescently labeled cDNA probes may be generated through incorporation
     of fluorescent nucleotides by reverse transcription of RNA extracted from tissues of
     interest. Labeled cDNA probes applied to the chip hybridize with specificity to each
     spot of DNA on the array. After stringent washing to remove non-specifically bound
                                                    43

      WO 2007/073220                                                         PCT/NZ2006/000343
       probes, the chip is scanned by confocal laser microscopy or by another detection
       method, such as a CCD camera. Quantitation of hybridization of each arrayed
       element allows for assessment of corresponding mRNA abundance. With dual colour
       fluorescence, separately labeled cDNA probes generated from two sources of RNA
   5   are hybridized pairwise to the array. The relative abundance of the transcripts from
       the two sources corresponding to each specified gene is thus determined
       simultaneously. An exemplary protocol for this is described in detail in Example 4.
               The miniaturized scale of the hybridization affords a convenient and rapid
 10    evaluation of the expression pattern for large numbers of genes. Such methods have
      been shown to have the sensitivity required to detect rare transcripts,. which are
      expressed at a few copies per cell, and to reproducibly detect at least approximately
      two-fold differences in the expression levels (Schena et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
      USA 93 (2): 106-149 (1996)).            Microarray analysis can be performed by
 15   commercially available equipment, following manufacturer's protocols, such as by
      using the Affymetrix GenChip technology, Illumina microarray technology or Incyte's
      microarray technology. The development of microarray methods for large-scale
      analysis of gene expression makes it possible to search systematically for molecular
      markers of cancer classification and outcome prediction in a variety of tumour types.

      RNA isolation, purification, and amplification
              General methods for mRNA extraction are well known in the art and are
      disclosed in standard textbooks of molecular biology, including Ausubel et al.,
      Current Protocols of Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons (1997). Methods for
25   RNA extraction from paraffin embedded tissues are disclosed, for example, in Rupp
     and Locker, Lab Invest. 56: A67 (1987), and De Sandres et al., BioTechniques 18:
     42044 (1995). In particular, RNA isolation can be performed using purification kit,
     buffer set, and protease from commercial manufacturers, such as Qiagen, according to
     the manufacturer's instructions. For example, total RNA from cells in culture can be
30   isolated using Qiagen RNeasy mini-columns. Other commercially available RNA
     isolation kits include MasterPure Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit
     (EPICENTRE (D, Madison, WI), and Paraffin Block RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion,
     Inc.). Total RNA from tissue samples can be isolated using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test).

         RNA prepared from tumour can be isolated, for example, by cesium chloride density
         gradient centrifugation.
                  The steps of a representative protocol for profiling gene expression using
   5     fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues as the RNA source, including mRNA
                                                                                      isolation,
        purification, primer extension and amplification are given in various published journal
         articles (for example: T. E. Godfrey et al. J. Molec. Diagnostics 2: 84-91 (2000); K.
         Specht et al., Am. J. Pathol. 158: 419-29 (2001)). Briefly, a representative process
        starts with cutting about 10 gm thick sections of paraffin-embedded tumour tissue
 10     samples. The RNA is then extracted, and protein and DNA are removed. After
        analysis of the RNA concentration, RNA repair and/or amplification steps may be
        included, if necessary, and RNA is reverse transcribed using gene specific promoters
        followed by RT-PCR. Finally, the data are analyzed to identify the best treatment
        option(s) available to the patient on the basis of the characteristic gene expression
 15    pattern identified in the tumour sample examined.
       Immunohistochemistry and proteomics
                 Immunohistochemistry methods are also suitable for detecting the expression
       levels of the proliferation markers of the present invention. Thus, antibodies or
20     antisera, preferably polyclonal antisera, and most preferably monoclonal antibodies
       specific for each marker, are used to detect expression. The antibodies can be
       detected by direct labeling of the antibodies themselves, for example, with radioactive
      labels, fluorescent labels, hapten labels such as, biotin, or an enzyme such as horse
      radish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase. Alternatively, unlabeled primary antibody
25    is used in conjunction with a labeled secondary antibody, comprising antisera,
      polyclonal antisera or a monoclonal antibody specific for the primary antibody.
      Immunohistochemistry protocols and kits are well known in the art and are
      commercially available.
30              Proteomics can be used to analyze the polypeptides present in a sample
                                                                                         (e.g.,
     tissue, organism, or cell culture) at a certain point of time. In particular, proteomic
     techniques can be used to assess the global changes of polypeptide expression in a
     sample (also referred to as expression proteomics). Proteomic analysis typically
     includes: (1) separation of individual polypeptides in a sample by 2-D gel
                                                 45

       WO 2007/073220                                                            PCT/NZ2006/000343
        electrophoresis (2-D PAGE); (2) identification of the individual polypeptides
        recovered from the gel, e.g., by mass spectrometry or N-terminal sequencing, and (3)
        analysis of the data using bioinformatics.          Proteomics methods are valuable
        supplements to other methods of gene expression profiling, and can be used, alone or
   5   in combination with other methods, to detect the products of the proliferation markers
        of the present invention.
       Once the expression level of one or more prognostic markers in a tumour sample has
       been assessed the likelihood of the cancer recurring can then be determined. The
 10    inventors have identified a number of markers that are differentially expressed in non
       recurring colorectal cancers compared to recurring colorectal cancers in patient data
       sets. The markers are set out in Tables 1, 2, and 9, in the examples below.
       Selection of Differentially Expressed Genes.
 15   An early approach to the selection of genes deemed significant involved simply
      looking at the "fold change" of a given gene between the two groups of interest.
      While this approach hones in on genes that seem to change the most spectacularly,
      consideration of basic statistics leads one to realize that if the variance (or noise level)
      is quite high (as is often seen in microarray experiments), then seemingly large fold
20    change can happen frequently by chance alone.
      Microarray experiments, such as those described here, typically involve the
      simultaneous measurement of thousands of genes. If one is comparing the expression
      levels for a particular gene between two groups (for example recurrent and non
25   recurrent tumours), the typical tests for significance (such as the t-test) are not
     adequate.       This is because, in an ensemble of thousands of experiments (in this
     context each gene constitutes an "experiment"), the probability of at least one
     experiment passing the usual criteria for significance by chance alone is essentially
     unity. In a test for significance, one typically calculates the probability that the "null
30   hypothesis" is correct. In the case of comparing two groups, the null hypothesis is
     that there is no difference between the two groups. If a statistical test produces a
     probability for the null hypothesis below some threshold (usually 0.05 or 0.01), it is
     stated that we can reject the null hypothesis, and accept the hypothesis that the two

         hypothesis by chance alone could be expected 1 in 20 times (or 1 in 100). The use of
         t-tests, or other similar statistical tests for significance, fail in the context of
         microarrays, producing far too many false positives (or type I errors)
   5    In this type of situation, where one is testing multiple hypotheses at the
                                                                                      same time,
        one applies typical multiple comparison procedures, such as the Bonferroni Method
        (43). However such tests are too conservative for most microarray experiments,
        resulting in too many false negative (type II) errors.
  10    A more recent approach is to do away with attempting to apply a probability for a
        given test being significant, and establish a means for selecting a subset of
        experiments, such that the expected proportion of Type I errors (or false discovery
       rate; 47) is controlled for. It is this approach that has been used in this
                                                                                   investigation,
       through various implementations, namely the methods provided with BRB Array
 15    Tools (48), and the limma (11,42) package of Bioconductor (that uses the R statistical
       environment; 10,39).
       General methodology for Data Mining: Generation of Prognostic Signatures
 20
      Data Mining is the term used to describe the extraction of "knowledge", in other
      words the "know-how", or predictive ability from (usually) large volumes of data (the
      dataset). This is the approach used in this study to generate prognostic signatures. In
      the case of this study the "know-how" is the ability to accurately predict prognosis
25    from a given set of gene expression measurements, or "signature" (as described
     generally in this section and in more detail in the examples section).
     The specific details used for the methods used in this study are described in Examples
      17-20. However, application of any of the data mining methods (both those described
30   in the Examples, and those described here) can follow this general protocol.
     Data mining (49), and the related topic machine learning (40) is a complex, repetitive
     mathematical task that involves the use of one or more appropriate computer software
     packages (see below). The use of software is advantageous on the one hand, in that
                                                   47

     WO 2007/073220                                                           PCT/NZ2006/000343
      one does not need to be completely familiar with the intricacies of the theory behind
      each technique in order to successfully use data mining techniques, provided that one
      adheres to the correct methodology. The disadvantage is that the application of data
     mining can often be viewed as a "black box": one inserts the data and receives the
  5   answer. How this is achieved is often masked from the end-user (this is the case for
     many of the techniques described, and can often influence the statistical method
     chosen for data mining. For example, neural networks and support vector machines
     have a particularly complex implementation that makes it very difficult for the end
     user to extract out the "rules" used to produce the decision. On the other hand, k
 10  nearest neighbours and linear discriminant analysis have a very transparent process
     for decision making that is not hidden from the user.
     There are two types of approach used in data mining: supervised and unsupervised
     approaches. In the supervised approach, the information that is being linked to the.
 15  data is known, such as categorical data (e.g. recurrent vs. non recurrent tumours).
    What is required is the ability to link the observed response (e.g. recurrence vs. non
    recurrence) to the input variables. In the unsupervised approach, the classes within the
    dataset are not known in advance, and data mining methodology is employed to
    attempt to find the classes or structure within the dataset.
20
    In the present example the supervised approach was used and is discussed in detail
    here, although it will be appreciated that any of the other techniques could be used.
    The overall protocol involves the following steps:
25
         * Data representation. This involves transformation of the data into a form that
             is most likely to work successfully with the chosen data mining technique. In
             where the data is numerical, such as in this study where the data being
             investigated represents relative levels of gene expression, this is fairly simple.
30           If the data covers a large dynamic range (i.e. many orders of magnitude) often
             the log of the data is taken. If the data covers many measurements of separate
             samples on separate days by separate investigators, particular care has to be
             taken to ensure systematic error is minimised. The minimisation of systematic
             error (i.e. errors resulting from protocol differences, machine differences,
                                                 48

     WO 20071073220                                                         PCT/NZ2006/000343
              operator differences and other quantifiable factors) is the process referred to
              here as "normalisation".
        *     Feature Selection. Typically the dataset contains many more data elements
   5          than would be practical to measure on a day-to-day basis, and additionally
             many elements that do not provide the information needed to produce a
             prediction model. The actual ability of a prediction model to describe a
             dataset is derived from some subset of the full dimensionality of the dataset.
             These dimensions the most important components (or features) of the dataset.
 10          Note in the context of microarray data, the dimensions of the dataset are the
             individual genes. Feature selection, in the context described here, involves
             finding those genes which are most "differentially expressed". In a more
             general sense, it involves those groups which pass some statistical test for
             significance, i.e. is the level of a particular variable consistently higher or
 15         lower in one or other of the groups being investigated. Sometimes the features
            are those variables (or dimensions) which exhibit the greatest variance.
            The application of feature selection is completely independent of the method
            used to create a prediction model, and involves a great deal of experimentation
            to achieve the desired results.       Within this invention, the selection of
20          significant genes, and those which correlated with the earlier successful model
            (the NZ classifier), entailed feature selection. In addition, methods of data
           reduction (such as principal component analysis) can be applied to the dataset.
       *   Training. Once the classes (e.g. recurrence/non-recurrence) and the features of
25         the dataset have been established, and the data is represented in a form that is
           acceptable as input for data mining, the reduced dataset (as described by the
           features) is applied to the prediction model of choice. The input for this model
           is usually in the form a multi-dimensional numerical input,(known as a
          vector), with associated output information (a class label or a response). In the
30        training process, selected data is input into the prediction model, either
          sequentially (in techniques such as neural networks) or as a whole (in
          techniques that apply some form of regression, such as linear models, linear
          discriniinant analysis, support vector machines). In some instances (e.g. k
          nearest neighbours) the dataset (or subset of the dataset obtained after feature
                                               49

     WO 2007/073220                                                            PCT/NZ2006/000343
             selection) is itself the model.       As discussed, effective models can be
             established with minimal understanding of the detailed mathematics, through
             the use of various software packages where the parameters of the model have
             been pre-determined by expert analysts as most likely to lead to successful
  5          results.
         * Validation. This is a key component of the data-mining protocol, and the
             incorrect application of this frequently leads to errors. Portions of the dataset
             are to be set aside, apart from feature selection and training, to test the success
 10          of the prediction model. Furthermore, if the results of validation are used to
             effect feature selection and training of the model, then one obtains a further
            validation set to test the model before it is applied to real-life situations. If this
            process is not strictly adhered to the model is likely to fail in real-world
            situations. The methods of validation are described in more detail below.
 15
        * Application. Once the model has been constructed, and validated, it must be
            packaged in some way as it is accessible to end users. This often involves
            implementation of some form a spreadsheet application, into which the model
            has been imbedded, scripting of a statistical software package, or refactoring
20          of the model into a hard-coded application by information technology staff.
     Examples of software packages that are frequently used are:
           - Spreadsheet plugins, obtained from multiple vendors.
           - The R statistical environment.
25         - The commercial packages MatLab, S-plus, SAS, SPSS, STATA.
           - Free open-source software such as Octave (a MatLab clone)
           - many and varied C++ libraries, which can be used to implement prediction
           models in a commercial, closed-source setting.
30  Examples of Data Mining Methods.
    The methods can be by first performing the step of data mining process (above), and
    then applying the appropriate known software packages. Further description of the
    process of data mining is described in detail in many extremely well-written texts.(49)
                                                50

      WO 2007/073220                                                       PCT/NZ2006/000343
         * Linear models (49, 50): The data is treated as the input of a linear regression
             model, of which the class labels or responses variables are the output. Class
             labels, or other categorical data, must be transformed into numerical values
    5        (usually integer). In generalised linear models, the class labels or response
             variables are not themselves linearly related to the input data, but are
             transformed through the use of a "link function". Logistic regression is the
            most common form of generalized linear model.
  10    e Linear Discriminant analysis (49, 51, 52). Provided the data is linearly
            separable (i.e. the groups or classes of data can be separated
                                                                           by a hyperplane,
            which is an n-dimensional extension of a threshold), this technique can be
            applied. A combination of variables is used to separate the classes, such that
            the between group variance is maximised, and the within-group variance is
  15       minimised. The byproduct of this is the formation of a classification rule.
           Application of this rule to samples of unknown class allows predictions or
           classification of class membership to be made for that sample. There are
           variations of linear discriminant analysis such as nearest shrunken centroids
           which are commonly used for microarray analysis.
 20
       * Support vector machines (53): A collection of variables is used in conjunction
           with a collection of weights to determine a model that maximizes the
           separation between classes in terms of those weighted variables. Application
           of this model to a sample then.produces a classification or prediction of class
25         membership for that sample.
       " Neural networks (52): The data is treated as input into a network of nodes,
          which superficially resemble biological neurons, which apply the input from
          all the nodes to which they are connected, and transform the input into an
30        output. Commonly, neural networks use the "multiply and sum" algorithm, to
          transform the inputs from multiple connected input nodes into a single output.
          A node may not necessarily produce an output unless the inputs to that node
          exceed a certain threshold. Each node has as its input the output from several
          other nodes, with the final output node usually being linked to a categorical
                                              51

    WO 2007/073220                                                            PCT/NZ2006/000343
            variable. The number of nodes, and the topology of the nodes can be varied in
            almost infinite ways, providing for the ability to classify extremely noisy data
            that may not be possible to categorize in other ways. The most common
            implementation of neural networks is the multi-layer perceptron.
  5
        * Classification and regression trees (54): In these. variables are used to define a
            hierarchy of rules that can be followed in a stepwise manner to determine the
            class of a sample. The typical process creates a set of rules which lead to a
            specific class output, or a specific statement of the inability to discriminate. A
 10         example classification tree is an implementation of an algorithm such as:
                      if   gene A> x and gene Y > x and gene Z = z
                      then
                             class A
                      else if      geneA = q
 15                         then
                        class B
       * Nearest neighbour methods (51, 52). Predictions or classifications are made
           by comparing a sample (of unknown class) to those around it (or known class),
           with closeness defined by a distance function. It is possible to define many
20         different distance functions. Commonly used distance functions are the
           Euclidean distance (an extension of the Pythagorean distance, as in
           triangulation, to n-dimensions), various forms of correlation (including
           Pearson Correlation co-efficient). There are also transformation functions that
           convert data points that would not normally be interconnected by a meaningful
25         distance metric into euclidean space, so that Euclidean distance can then be
          applied (e.g. Mahalanobis distance). Although the distance metric can be
          quite complex, the basic premise of k-nearest neighbours is quite simple,
          essentially being a restatement of "find the k-data vectors that are most
          similar to the unknown input, find out which class they correspond to, and
30        vote as to which class the unknown input is".
      * Other methods:
          - Bayesian networks. A directed acyclic graph is used to represent a collection
          of variables in conjunction with their joint probability distribution, which is
                                                52

        WO 2007/073220                                                          PCT/NZ2006/000343
                 then used to determine the probability of class membership for a sample.
                 - Independent components analysis, in which independent signals (e.g., class
                 membership) re isolated (into components) from a collection of variables.
                 These components can then be used to produce a classification or prediction of
   5             class membership for a sample.
                Ensemble learning methods in which a collection of prediction methods are
                combined to produce a joint classification or prediction of class membership
                for a sample
 10    There are many variations of these methodologies that can be explored (49), and
       many new methodologies are constantly being defined and developed. It will be
       appreciated that any one of these methodologies can be applied in order to obtain an
       acceptable result. Particular care must be taken to avoid overfitting, by ensuring that
       all results are tested via a comprehensive validation scheme.
 15
       Validation
       Application of any of the prediction methods described involves both training and
       cross-validation (43, 55) before the method can be applied to new datasets (such as
20     data from a clinical trial). Training involves taking a subset of the dataset of interest
      (in this case gene expression measurements from colorectal tumours), such that it is
      stratified across the classes that are being tested for (in this case recurrent and non
      recurrent tumours). This training set is used to generate a prediction model (defined
      above), which is tested on the remainder of the data (the testing set).
25
      It is possible to alter the parameters of the prediction model so as to obtain better
      performance in the testing set, however, this can lead to the situation known as
      overfitting, where the prediction model works on the training dataset but not on any
      external dataset. In order to circumvent this, the process of validation is followed.
30    There are two major types of validation typically applied, the first (hold-out
     validation) involves partitioning the dataset into three groups: testing, training, and
     validation. The validation set has no input into the training process whatsoever, so
     that any adjustment of parameters or other refinements must take place during
                                                 53

       WO 2007/073220                                                          PCT/NZ2006/000343
       application to the testing set (but not the validation set). The second major type is
       cross-validation, which can be applied in several different ways, described below.
       There are two main sub-types of cross-validation: K-fold cross-validation, and leave
   5   one-out cross-validation
       K-fold cross-validation: .The dataset is divided into K subsamples, each subsample
       containing approximately the same proportions of the class groups as the original.
       In each round of validation, one of the K subsamples is set aside, and training is
 10    accomplished using the remainder of the dataset. The effectiveness of the training for
      that round is guaged by how correctly the classification of the left-out group is. This
      procedure is repeated K- times, and the overall effectiveness ascertained by
      comparison of the predicted class with the known class.
 15   Leave-one-out cross-validation: A commonly used variation of K-fold cross
      validation, in which K=n, where n is the number of samples.
      Combinations of CCPMS, such as those described above in Tables 1 and 2, can be
      used to construct predictive models for prognosis.
20
      Prognostic Signatures
      Prognostic signatures, comprising one or more of these markers, can be used to
      determine the outcome of a patient, through application of one or more predictive
      models derived from the signature. In particular, a clinician or researcher can
25    determine the differential expression (e.g., increased or decreased expression) of the
      one or more markers in the signature, apply a predictive model, and thereby predict
     the negative prognosis, e.g., likelihood of disease relapse, of a patient, or alternatively
     the likelihood of a positive prognosis (continued remission).
30   A set of prognostic signatures have been developed. In the first instance, there are
     two signatures developed by cross-comparison of predictive ability between two
     datasets: the set of microarray experiments encompassing the German colorectal
     cancer samples, and the set of microarray experiments encompassing the New
     Zealand samples (discussed in example 6). In the second instance there has been an
                                                54

      WO 2007/073220                                                      PCT/NZ2006/000343
       exhaustive statistical search for effective signatures based solely on the German
      dataset (discussed in example 17).
      As described in Example 6 below, a prognostic signature comprising 19 genes has
 5    been established from a set of colorectal samples from Germany (Table 4). Another
      prognostic signature, of 22 genes, has also been established from samples of
      colorectal tumours from patients in New Zealand (Table 3). By obtaining a patient
      sample (e.g., tumour sample), and matching the expression levels of one or more
      markers in the sample to the differential expression profile, the likelihood of the
10    cancer recurring can be determined.

25   Example 1: Patients and methods
     Two cohorts of patients were included in this study, one set from New Zealand (NZ)
     and the second from Germany (DE). The NZ patients were part of a prospective
     cohort study that included all disease stages, whereas the DE samples were selected
     from a tumour bank. Clinical information is shown in Table 6, while Figure 1
30   summarises the experimental design.
     Example 2: Tumour samples
     Primary colorectal tumor samples from 149 NZ patients were obtained from patients
     undergoing surgery at Dunedin Hospital and Auckland Hospital between 1995-2000.

    Tumor samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. All surgical specimens were
   reviewed by a single pathologist (H-S Y) and were estimated to contain an average of
    85% tumor cells.    Among the 149 CRC patients, 12 had metastatic disease at
   presentation, 35 developed recurrent disease, and 102 were disease-free after a
 5 minimum of 5-year follow up.
   Primary colorectal tumor samples from DE patients were obtained from patients
   undergoing surgery at the Surgical Department of the Technical University of Munich
   between 1995-2001. A group of 55 colorectal carcinoma samples was selected from
10 banked tumours which had been obtained fresh from surgery, snap frozen in liquid
   nitrogen. The samples were obtained from 11 patients with stage I cancer and 44
   patients with stage II cancer.   Twenty nine patients were recurrence-free and 26
   patients had experienced disease recurrence after a minimum of 5-year follow up.
   Tumor content ranged between 70 and 100% with an average of 87%.

 5  Example 3: RNA Extraction and target labeling
   NZ tumours: Tumours were homogenized and RNA was extracted using Tri-Reagent
    (Progenz, Auckland, New Zealand).           The RNA was then further purified using
   RNeasy mini column (Qiagen, Victoria, Australia).      Ten micrograms of RNA was
   labelled with Cy5 dUTP using the indirect amino-allyl cDNA labelling protocol.
                                                                                       A
10 reference RNA from 12 different cell lines was labelled with Cy3 dUTP. The

       fluorescently labelled cDNA were purified using a QiaQuick PCR purification kit
       (Qiagen, Victoria, Australia) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
       DE tumours: Tumours were homogenized and RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini
   5   Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cRNA preparation was performed as described
       previously (9), purified on RNeasy Columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and eluted
       in 55 ptl of water. Fifteen micrograms of cRNA was fragmented for 35 minutes at
       95*C and double stranded cDNA was synthesized with a oligo-dT-T7 primer
       (Eurogentec, Kbln, Germany) and transcribed using the Promega RiboMax T7-kit
 10    (Promega, Madison, WI) and Biotin-NTP labelling mix (Loxo, Dossenheim,
       Germany).
      Example 4: Microarray experiments
      NZ tumours: Hybridisation of the labelled target cDNA was performed using MWG
 15   Human 30K Array oligonucleotides printed on epoxy coated slides. Slides were
      blocked with 1%BSA and the hybridisation was done in pre-hybridisation buffer at
      42*C for at least 12 hours followed by a high stringency wash. Slides were scanned
      with a GenePix Microarray Scanner and data was analyzed using GenePix Pro 4.1
      Microarray Acquisition and Analysis Software (Axon, CA).
 20
      DE tumours: cRNA was mixed with B2-control oligonucleotide (Affymetrix, Santa
      Clara, CA), eukaryotic hybridization controls (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), herring
      sperm (Promega, Madison, WI), buffer and BSA to a final volume of -300 pl and
     hybridized to one microarray chip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) for. 16 hours at
25   45*C. Washing steps and incubation with streptavidin (Roche, Mannheim, Germany),
     biotinylated goat-anti streptavidin antibody (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), goat-IgG
     (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany), and streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes,
     Leiden, Netherlands) was performed in an Affymetrix Fluidics Station according to
     the manufacturer's protocol. The arrays were then scanned with a HP-argon-ion laser
30   confocal microscope and the digitized image data were processed using the
     Affymetrix@ Microarray Suite 5.0 Software.

        WO 2007/073220                                                         PCT/NZ2006/000343
        Example 5: Data pre-processing
        NZ data: Data pre-processing and normalization was performed in the R computing
        environment (10). A log 2 transformation was applied to the foreground intensities
        from each channel of each array. Data from each spot was used on a per array
                                                                                         basis to
   5    perform print-tip loss normalization via the limma package (11) from the
        Bioconductor suite-of analysis tools (12). Scale normalization (13) was then used
                                                                                               to
        standardize the distribution of log intensity ratios across arrays. Post-normalization
        cluster analysis revealed the presence of a gene-specific print-run effect present in the
       data. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) normalization was used to estimate and remove
 10    print run effects from the data for each gene. Replicate array data was available for
       46 of the 149 samples. Cluster analysis of the entire data set indicated that the
       duplicate arrays clustered well with each other suggesting internal consistency of the
       array platform. Genes with low intensity, large differences between replicates (mean
       log2 difference between duplicates higher than 0.5), and unknown proteins were
 15   removed from the data set. After the initial normalization procedure, a subset of
       10,318 genes was chosen for further analysis.
      DE data: All Affymetrix U133A GeneChips passed quality control to eliminate scans
      with abnormal characteristics, that is, abnormal low or high dynamic range, high
20    perfect match saturation, high pixel noise, grid misalignment problems, and low mean
      signal to noise ratio. Background correction and normalization were performed in the
      R computing environment (10, 40). Background corrected and normalized expression
      measures from probe level data (cel-files) were obtained using the robust multi-array
      average function (14) implemented in the Bioconductor package affy.
25
      Example 6: Prognostic signatures and cross validation
     Data analysis was performed using the BRB Array-Tools package (hypertext transfer
     protocol://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html).       Gene selection was performed
     using a random variance model t-test. In the DE data, 318 genes were found to be
30   differentially expressed when using a significance threshold of 0.001. As most of the
     differentially expressed genes exhibited relatively small changes in expression, a
     condition requiring the mean log2 fold change between the two classes to be higher
     than 1.1 was added to the gene selection process for the DE data. Gene-based
     prognostic signatures were produced using leave one out cross validation (LOOCV)
                                                 63

      WO 2007/073220                                                         PCT/NZ2006/000343
      in each of the NZ and DE data sets. To avoid the problem of over-fitting, both the
      gene selection and signature construction were performed during each LOOCV
      iteration. After LOOCV, the prediction rate was estimated by the fraction of samples
      correctly predicted. In order to find a gene set that could make the best prediction for
  5   unknown samples, different t-test thresholds using a random variance model were
      investigated in conjunction with six classification methods: compound covariate
      classifier (CCP), diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLD), 3- nearest neighbours
      (3-NN), 1- nearest neighbours (1-NN), nearest centroid (NC), and support vector
      machines (SVM).
 10
      To establish the validity of the NZ and DE.prognosis signatures, reciprocal validation
     was performed, with the NZ signature validated using the DE data set, and vice versa.
     To test the NZ genes, probes relating to the 22 genes from the NZ signature were
     identified in the DE data, and LOOCV was used to assess the performance of a
 15  signature for the DE samples, based only on these probes. Similarly, probes relating
     to the 19 genes in the DE signature were identified in the NZ data and LOOCV was
     used to assess the performance of a signature for the NZ samples. In both cases a
     significance threshold of 0.999 was used to ensure that all genes were used in each
     LOOCV iteration. Differences between the platforms (in particular, log-ratio data
20   versus log-intensity data) meant that direct application of a prediction rule across data
     sets was not feasible. The consequence of this is that only the gene sets, and not the
    prediction rules used, can be generalized to new samples. The significance of the
    LOOCV prediction results was calculated by permuting the class labels of the samples
     and finding the proportion of times that the permuted data resulted in a higher
25  LOOCV prediction rate than that obtained for the unpermuted data. All permutation
    analysis involved 2000 permutations, with small P-values indicating that prediction
    results were unlikely to be due to chance.
    Example 7: Survival analysis
30  Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for censored data was performed using the survival
    package within the R computing environment. Survival was defined to be "disease
    free survival" post surgery. For each analysis, survival curves were constructed, and
    the log-rank test (15) was used to assess the presence of significant differences
    between the curves for the two groups in question. Censoring was taken into account
                                                64

         WO 2007/073220                                                           PCT/NZ2006/000343
         for both the NZ and DE data sets. For the disease-free survival data,
                                                                                   right censoring
         prior to five years could only occur for non-recurrent patients as a result of either
         death, or the last clinical follow-up occurring at less than five years. Odds ratios and
         confidence intervals were produced using the epitools package for R.
   5
        Example 8: Identification of markers co-expressed with chemokine ligands
        Genes in the DE data which had a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.75
        with at least one of the four chemokines appearing in the predictor in the non-relapse
        group were selected for ontology analysis. Ontology was performed using DAVID
 10     (hypertext transfer protocol://appsl.niaid.nih.gov/david/).
       Example 9: Results and analysis
       To identify robust prognostic signatures to predict disease relapse for CRC, two
       independent sets of samples from NZ and DE were used to generate array expression
 15    data sets from separate series of primary tumours with clinical follow-up of five or
       more years. After normalization, each data set was analyzed using the same statistical
      methods to generate a prognostic signature, which was then validated on the alternate
       series of patients. As such, the DE prognostic signature was validated on the NZ data
      set and the NZ prognostic signature was validated on the DE data set.
20
      Example 10: Exhaustive Identification of differentially expressed markers
      DE Data Set: The BRB Array Tools class comparison procedure was used to detect
      probes exhibiting statistically significant differences in average intensity between
      relapse and non-relapse samples. The RVM (random variance model) was again used
25   to produce p-values for each probe in the data set. In this second round, a total of 325
     probes were found to be significantly differentially expressed between the two sample
     classes using an arbitrary significance threshold of 0.05. Note this selection of genes
     did not apply any fold-change threshold, and used a significance cut off of 0.05, rather
     than the threshold of 0.001 that was used in Example 6. The purpose of this less
30   stringent threshold (p=0.05 instead of p=0.001) was to put forward a larger number of
     genes for construction of the second round of signatures (see example 17) These
     probes represent 270 unique genes (Table 1 and Table 2).

       Explicitly, the test for significance (random variance model) comprises the following:
       generating a test statistic for each gene which was identical to that of a standard two
       sample t-test (45) except that the estimate of the pooled variance was obtained by
       representing the variance structure across all genes as an F-distribution, and then
   5   using the parameters, a and b, of this distribution (obtained via maximization of the
       empirical likelihood function) to form the following estimate of the pooled variance
       (see next page),

       where S2 is the new estimate of the pooled variance, S2 pooed is the standard estimate of
       pooled variance (45), n is the number of samples, and a and b are the parameters of
      the F-distribution (46). Based on the t-statistic formed, a t-distribution with n-2+2a
       degrees of freedom was used to obtain a p-value for each gene. To adjust for multiple
 15   hypothesis testing, the False Discovery Rate controlling procedure of Benjamini and
      Hochberg (7) was used to produce adjusted p-values for each gene. A gene was
      considered to have undergone significant differential expression if its adjusted p-value
      was less than 0.05.
20    Example 11: Identification of correlated markers
      In order to identify additional genes that can be used as prognostic predictors,
      correlation analysis was carried out using the R statistical computing software
     package. This analysis revealed 167 probes that had a Pearson correlation coefficient
      (40, 44, 45) of at least 0.8. Of these probes, 51 were already present in the set of 325
25    significantly differentially expressed probes, while the remaining 116 were reported
     as non-significant (using a 0.05 threshold for the FDR, or "false-discovery rate" (47)
     controlling procedure, the RVM, or rando variance model). These 116 probes
     represent 111 distinct genes (Table 2).

     different signatures were constructed, with a support vector machine (SVM) using a

        Example 13: External validation of the NZ and DE prognostic signatures
        To validate the NZ signature, the 22 genes were used to construct a SVM signature in
       the DE data set by LOOCV. A prediction rate of 71% was achieved, which was
   5   highly significant (p=0.002; Table 7). The odds ratio for recurrence in DE patients,
       using the NZ signature, was 5.9 (95% CI 1.6-24.5). We surmise that the reduction in
       prediction rate, from 77% in NZ patients to 71% in DE patients (Table 7), was due to
       four genes from the NZ signature not being present in the DE data. Disease-free
       survival for DE patients predicted to relapse, according to the NZ signature, was
  10   significantly lower than disease-free survival for patients predicted not to relapse
       (p=0.0049, Fig. 2C).
       The DE signature was next validated by using the 19 genes to construct a 3-NN
       signature in the NZ data set by LOOCV. The prediction rate of 67% was again
 15    significant (p=0.046; Table 7), confirming the validity of the DE signature. The odds
      ratio for recurrence in NZ patients, using the DE signature, was 2.6 (95%
                                                                                  CI 1.2-6.0).
      We consider that the reduction of the prediction rate was due to five genes from DE
      signature not being present in the NZ data set. This was confirmed when removal of
      these five genes from the DE data set resulted in a reduction of the LOOCV prediction
 20   rate from 84% to 67% (Table 7). Disease-free survival for NZ patients predicted to
      relapse, according to the DE signature, was significantly lower than disease-free
      survival for patients predicted not to relapse (p=0.029; Fig. 2D).
      Example 14: Comparison of NZ and DE prognostic signatures with current staging
25    system
      Significant differences in disease-free survival between patients predicted to relapse
      or not relapse were also observed within the same clinico-pathological stage (Figure
      3).   When patient predictions were stratified according to disease stage, the NZ
      signature was able to identify patients who were more likely to recur in both Stage II
30   (p=0.001 3 , Fig. 3A), and Stage III subgroups (p=0.0295, Fig. 3A). This was mirrored
     to a lesser extent when the DE signature was applied to the NZ data set, where the
     difference was only observed for Stage III patients (p=0.0491, Fig. 3B). Again, the
     decreased predictive accuracy of the DE signature was likely due to the absence of
     five genes from the NZ data that decreased the LOOCV prediction rate.

       Example 15: Genes in signatures are related to CRC disease progression
       A number of genes in the NZ signature (Table 3) including G3BP2 (16), RBMS1
       (17), HMMR (18), UBE2L3 (19), GNAS (20), RNASE2 (21) and ABCC9 (22) have
       all been reported to be involved in cancer progression, while RBMS1 (23), EIF3S7
   5   (24) and GTF3C5 (25) are involved in transcription or translation. PBK is a protein
       kinase, which is involved in the process of mitosis (26), and the only gene common to
       the NZ and DE signatures. Eleven of 19 genes in the DE signature (Table 4) are
       involved in the immune response including 4 chemokine ligands (CXCL9, CXCL10,
       CXCL11, CXCL13;'(27)), PBK (28), INDO (29), GBP1 (30), GZMB (31), KITLG
 10    (32), and two receptors of the tumor necrosis factor family (TNFRSF llA, FAS; 33)).
      Eighty six genes were found to be moderately correlated (Pearson correlation
      coefficient > 0.75) with at least one of the four chemokine ligands in the DE data.
      Ontology analysis found that 39 of these 65 genes were in the category of immune
 15   response (p<l0-26). This result suggests a key role for the host immune response in
      determining CRC recurrence.
      Example 16: Discussion of NZ and DE Prognostic Signatures
      It has been shown that the two different prognostic signatures can be used to improve
20    the current prognosis of colorectal cancer.
      For the DE signature, it was surprising and unexpected that the stage I/II samples
      could be used to predict stage III outcome. It was also surprising that many genes
      associated with recurrent disease are related to the immune response. The immune
25   response has an important role in the progression of different cancers and T
     lymphocyte infiltration in CRC patients is an indicator of good prognosis (36-38). All
     of the eleven immune response (Table 5) genes were down-regulated in recurrent
     patients which would be unexpected based on known biological mechanisms.
30   To further confirm these results, 4 chemokine genes were chosen for further analysis.
     Chemokine ligands not only reflect the activity of the immune system and mediate
     leukocyte recruitment but also are involved in chemotaxis, cell adhesion and motility,
     and angiogenesis (36). To investigate the role of the immune response genes, 86
     genes co-expressed with the chemokine ligands were identified. Almost half of these
35   genes had a Gene Ontology classification within the "immune response" category
                                                70

       WO 2007/073220                                                          PCT/NZ2006/000343
        suggesting that the primary function of these genes in the recurrence process is the
        modulation of the immune response. Furthermore, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell antigens
        (CD8A, CD3, PRF1, TRA@, TRB@) or functionally related antigens,
                                                                                   for example,
       major histocompatibility molecules, interferon gamma induced proteins,
                                                                                    and IL2RB,
   5   were found in the co-expressed gene list. The activation of tumor specific CD4+ T
       cells and CD8+ T cells has been shown to result in tumour rejection in a mouse
       colorectal cancer model (37). Collectively, these findings suggest that the lyphocytes
       form part of a tumor-specific host response involved in minimising the spread of cells
       from the primary tumour.

       Example 17: Selection of additional prognostic signatures
       The performance of the two prognostic signatures described above was excellent in
      terms of cross-validation between the two data sets. Further studies were carried out,
      using a purely statistical approach, to develop a range of signatures, in addition to the
 15   aforementioned, that would also predict prognosis for other data sets. One of the
      additional goals of these studies was to ensure that the method used to normalize the
      microarray data (robust multi-array average) was not exerting undue influence on the
      choice of genes.
20    Figure 4 shows the classification rates obtained from signatures of varying lengths.
      The classification rate is the proportion of correct relapse predictions (expressed as a
      percentage of total predictions), i.e., the proportion of samples correctly classified.
      The classification rates were determined using 11-fold cross validation. 'For this cross
      validation, a randomly selected stratified sample (i.e. same ratio of recurrent to non
25   recurrent tumours as the full data set) was removed as a validation set prior to gene
      selection of the genes, and model construction (using the training set of the remaining
     50 samples). Cross-validation was then repeated a further ten times so that all 55
     samples appeared in one validation set each. This 11-fold cross-validation process
     was repeated as 10 replicates, and the results plotted in Figure 4 and Figure. The
30   classification rates shown were corrected using bootstrap bias correction (43), to give
     the expected classification rates for the signatures to be applied to another data set.
     From this analysis, it was ascertained that shorter signatures produced the best
     classification rate. In addition, analysis of the genes that most frequently appeared in
     classifiers show that the discriminatory power was mostly due to the effectiveness of
                                                 71

      WO 2007/073220                                                         PCT/NZ2006/000343
      two genes: FAS. and ME2. This is illustrated most clearly by figure 5 shows the
      effectiveness of the signatures, once the two genes FAS and ME2 were removed from
      the data set. For more detail see the legend to Figure 5.
  5   The effect of normalization on feature selection was thoroughly investigated by
      generating gene lists from 1000 stratified sub-samples of the original set of tumours,
      each time removing 5 samples (i.e. 1/11 of the total number of samples) from the data
      set. (This is effectively the same as performing 11-fold cross-validation). A tally was
     made of the number of times each gene appeared in the "top-n" gene lists (i.e., top 10,
 10  top 20, top 100, and top 325). This value was termed the "top count". Top counts
     were generated using three different normalization methods (40) (Figure 6), and three
     different filtering statistics (Figure 7). There was substantial correlation in the top
     count between normalization schemes and filtering statistics (41, 42) used. Thus,
     while normalization and feature selection methods were important, many genes
 15  appeared -in the gene lists independently of the method used to pre-process the data.
     This indicates that the choice of normalization method had only a minimal effect on
     which genes were selected for use in signature construction. The top count, summed
     across all normalization methods and statistics, was found to be a robust measure of a
     gene's differential expression between recurrent and non-recurrent tumours.
20
     Genes from the gene lists (see Table 1 and Table 2), were used to generate signatures
     by random sampling. The generation of samples was weighted, such that genes with
     higher "top count" were more likely to be selected.        A range of signatures was
     generated, using between 2 and 55 Affymetrix probes. Signatures were selected if
25  they exhibited >80% median classification rate, using three methods of classifiers: k
    nearest neighbours, with k=1; k-nearest neighbours, with k=3; and support vector
    machines, with a linear kernel function, and using leave-one-out cross-validation.
    On average, longer prognostic signatures were preferred over shorter signatures in
30  terms of ability to predict prognosis for new data sets (Figure 4 and Figure 5). The
    genes FAS and ME2 were also important (discussed, above). These two facts were
    used, along with the fact that short signatures that do not contain either FAS or ME2
    perform less effectively, to select candidate signatures as shown in Table 9, below.
    Signatures were selected (from the pool of randomly generated signatures) if they
                                                72

          WO 2007/073220                                                         PCT/NZ2006/000343
           exhibited >80% median classification rate (using three methods of classifiers: k
          nearest neighbours, with k=l; k-nearest neighbours, with k=3; and support vector
          machines, with a linear kernel function), using leave-one-out cross-validation.
    5     In addition, because, on average, longer signatures (>10 genes/signature) tended to
         perform better, we selected signatures with 20 or more genes/signatures from a pool
          of signatures with 30 or more probes/signature. It is expected that these signatures
          (Table 10) will perform with a classification rate of around 70% when applied to other
         data sets, on the basis of the results shown in Figures 4 and 5. It was found that all of
  10     the signatures generated in this way contained both ME2, and all but one contained
         FAS, which may be due to the importance of these genes in providing prediction of
         prognosis. It was noted that the high classification rate obtained using this approach
         on the in-house data set did not necessarily mean that these signatures that would be
         expected to perform better than those set forth in Example 12, on other data sets.
  15     Rather, the purpose was to produce a range of signatures expected to apply to other
         data sets as least as well as the previous signatures. The markers comprising the
         prognostic signatures are set forth in Table 9.

     Example 20: Specific Application of Prediction Methods
  5  In selection of the gene signatures described here, two different statistical methods
     were used to characterise the signatures: k-nearest neighbours, and support vector
     machines. These methods are provided as packages to the R statistical software.
     system (ref), through the packages class (ref) and e1071 (ref)..
     The signatures described in this document were tested as follows. In both cases, the
10   data used to develop the prediction models for a given signature were the gene
     expression values (raw normalised intensities from the Affymetrix array data) for the
     probes corresponding to genes that comprise that signature, across both recurrent and
     non-recurrent samples:
         o   For k-nearest neighbours, we used leave-one-out cross validation with k=1 and
15           k=3 to obtain sensitivity (proportion of positive, i.e. recurrent, samples
            correctly classified) and specificity (proportion of negative samples, i.e. non
            recurrent samples correctly classified) described in table 9
                                                125

       WO 2007/073220                                                          PCT/NZ2006/000343
                The dataset was used to generate leave-one-out cross-validation sensitivity and
                specificity data using the following support-vector machine parameters: The
                support vector machine models were generated using a linear kernel, and all
                other parameters used were the default values obtained from the svm function
   5           of the e1071 package.
       Note the genes comprising the signatures were themselves obtained from the list of
       significantly differentially expressed probes, and those from the list of genes which
       were found to correlate with genes from the NZ 22-gene signature. In some cases
      there was more than one significant (or correlated) probe per gene. In these cases, the
 10   prediction models used the median intensity data across all significant probes (i.e.
      those in the significant probe list, see table 1) for that gene.
