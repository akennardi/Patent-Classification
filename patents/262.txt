                                       Field of the Invention
[002]             The invention provides compounds, compositions, and methods of
treatment or prevention of abnormal conditions in a subject.
                                   Background of the Invention
[003]             Cholesterol circulating in the human body is carried by plasma
lipoproteins, which are particles of complex lipid and protein composition that transport
lipids in the blood. Two types of plasma lipoproteins that carry cholesterol are low
density lipoproteins ("LDL") and high density lipoproteins ("HDL"). LDL particles are
believed to be responsible for the delivery of cholesterol from the liver (where it is
synthesized or obtained from dietary sources) to extrahepatic tissues in the body. HDL
particles, on the other hand, are believed to aid in the transport of cholesterol from the
extrahepatic tissues to the liver, where the cholesterol is catabolized and eliminated.
Such transport of cholesterol from the extrahepatic tissues to the liver is referred to as
"reverse cholesterol transport."
[004]             The reverse cholesterol transport ("RCT") pathway has three main steps:
(i) cholesterol efflux, i.e., the initial removal of cholesterol from various pools of
peripheral cells; (ii) cholesterol esterification by the action of lecithin:cholesterol
acyltransferase ("LCAT"), thereby preventing a re-entry of effluxed cholesterol into
cells; and (iii) uptake of the cholesteryl ester by HDL and delivery of the HDL
cholesteryl ester complex to liver cells.

[005]            The RCT pathway is mediated by HDL particles. A pathway in the liver
involving F1-ATPase and the P2Y13 receptor (Martinez et al. 2003 Nature 421; 75-79)
that regulates HDL-cholesterol removal was recently described. The presence of a
nucleotidase activity of F 1-ATPase subunit at the cell surface of hepatocytes, allowing
the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP, which in turn stimulates the P2Y13 receptor activities
resulting in the uptake of the HDL by the cells was recently described. (Jacquet et al.
2005 Cell Mol Life Sci 62; 2508-2515). More recently, Fabre et al (Fabre et al.
Hepatology 52; 1477-1483) confirmed the relationship between P2Y13r and the reverse
cholesterol transport in mice.

[00208]          The invention further provides methods for identifying a biomarker for
one or more Conditions, comprising administering an effective amount of a compound of
the invention to a subject in need thereof and measuring the level of unesterified
cholesterol in the subject's blood. In one embodiment the Condition is a cardiovascular
related disorder. In another embodiment the biomarker is the presence of reverse
cholesterol transport from the arterial vessels to the liver or cholesterol elimination in the
bile acids, or both.
[00209]          The invention further provides the use of free cholesterol as a biomarker
of the P2Y13 activation having as consequence the functionalisation of the HDL, i.e., its
increased potency of a reverse cholesterol transport agent. Accordingly, the invention
further provides methods for determining the extent of P2Y 13 activation, comprising
administering an effective amount of a compound of the invention to a subject in need
thereof and measuring the amount of free cholesterol in the subject's blood.
[00210]          The compounds of the invention and compositions thereof can be
administered orally. The compounds of the invention and compositions thereof can also
be administered by any other convenient route, for example, by intravenous infusion or
bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral
mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and can be administered together with another
biologically active agent. Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery
systems are known, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules,
capsules, etc., and can be used to administer a compound of the invention. In certain
embodiments, more than one compound of the invention is administered to a subject.
Methods of administration include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular,
intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual,

particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The mode of administration can be left to the
discretion of the practitioner, and depends in-part upon the site of the medical condition.
In most instances, administration results in the release of the compounds of the invention
into the bloodstream.
[00211]          In specific embodiments, it may be desirable to administer one or more
compounds of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment. This may be
achieved, for example, and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery,
topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection,
by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, the implant
being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as
sialastic membranes, or fibers. In one embodiment, administration can be by direct
injection at the site (or former site) of an atherosclerotic plaque tissue.
[00212]          In certain embodiments, a compound of the invention can be introduced
into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular,
intrathecal and epidural injection. Intraventricular injection can be facilitated by an
intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya
reservoir.
[00213]          Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler
or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a
fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. In certain embodiments, the compounds
of the invention can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and vehicles
such as triglycerides.
[00214]          In another embodiment, the compounds and compositions of the
compounds of the invention can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see

Science 228:190; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al., 1989, J.
Neurosurg. 71:105). In another embodiment, a controlled-release system can be placed
in proximity of the target area to be treated, e.g., the liver, thus requiring only a fraction
of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release,
supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). Other controlled-release systems discussed in the
review by Langer, 1990, Science 249:1527-1533) may be used.

[00248]          Cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis can require surgical
procedures such as angioplasty. Angioplasty can be accompanied by the placement of a
reinforcing a metallic tube-shaped structure known as a "stent" into a damaged coronary
artery. For more serious conditions, open heart surgery such as coronary bypass surgery
can be required. These surgical procedures can entail using invasive surgical devices or
implants, and are associated with a high risk of restenosis and thrombosis. Accordingly,

[00260]           The compounds of the invention are also useful for preventing cancer, or
preventing progression of a cancer, including but not limited to the cancers listed in Table
1. Such prophylactic use includes that in which non-neoplastic cell growth such as
hyperplasia, metaplasia, or most specifically, dysplasia has occurred. Alternatively or in
addition to the presence of abnormal cell growth characterized as hyperplasia, metaplasia,
or dysplasia, the presence of one or more characteristics of a transformed phenotype, or
of a malignant phenotype, displayed in vivo or displayed in vitro by a cell sample from a
subject, can indicate the desirability of prophylactic or therapeutic administration of a
compound of the invention. Such characteristics of a transformed phenotype include
morphology changes, looser substratum attachment, loss of contact inhibition, loss of
anchorage dependence, protease release, increased sugar transport, decreased serum
requirement, expression of fetal antigens, disappearance of the 250,000 dalton cell
surface protein, etc. In a specific embodiment, leukoplakia, a benign-appearing
hyperplastic or dysplastic lesion of the epithelium, or Bowen's disease, a carcinoma in
situ, is treatable or preventable according to the present methods.

further comprise the administration of another anticancer agent.
[00264]          In one embodiment, the present invention provides methods for treating or
preventing cancer, comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound
of the invention and another anticancer agent to a subject in need thereof. The compound
of the invention and another anticancer agent can be administered concurrently. In this
embodiment, the compound of the invention and another anticancer agent can be
administered within the same composition, or can be administered from different
compositions, via the same or different routes of administration. In another embodiment,
the compound of the invention is administered during a time when the other anticancer
agent exerts its prophylactic or therapeutic effect, or vice versa.
[00265]          In another embodiment, the compound of the invention or other anticancer
agent is administered in doses commonly employed when such agents are used as
monotherapy for the treatment of cancer.
[00266]          In one embodiment, the compound of the invention or other anticancer
agent is administered in doses that are lower than the doses commonly employed when
such agents are used as monotherapy for the treatment of cancer.
[00267]          In another embodiment, the compound of the invention and other
anticancer agent act synergistically and are administered in doses that are lower than the
doses commonly employed when such agents are used as monotherapy for the treatment

and the other anticancer agent are administered within 3 hours. In another embodiment, a
compound of the invention and the other anticancer agent are administered at 1 minute to
24 hours apart.
[00268]         In one embodiment, an effective amount of a compound of the invention
and an effective amount of other anticancer agent are present in the same composition. In
one embodiment, this composition is useful for oral administration, in another
embodiment, this composition is useful for intravenous administration.
[00269]         In one embodiment, the compositions comprise an amount of a compound
of the invention and the other anticancer agent which together are effective to treat or
prevent cancer.
[00270]         In another embodiment, the compositions comprise an effective amount of
temozolomide, procarbazine, dacarbazine, interleukin-2, irinotecan, or doxorubicin, a
physiologically acceptable carrier, diluent, excipient, or vehicle, and an effective amount
of a compound of the invention.
[00271]         In one embodiment, the amount of a compound of the invention and the
other anticancer agent is at least about 0.01% of the combined combination
chemotherapy agents by weight of the composition. When intended for oral

administration, this amount can be varied from about 0.1% to about 80% by weight of the
composition. Some oral compositions can comprise from about 4% to about 50% of
combined amount of a compound of the invention and the other anticancer agent by
weight of the composition. Other compositions of the present invention are prepared so
that a parenteral dosage unit comprises from about 0.01% to about 2% by weight of the
composition.
[00272]           Cancers that can be treated or prevented by administering a compound of
the invention and the other anticancer agent include, but are not limited to, the list of
cancers set forth above in Table 1.
[00273]           In one embodiment, the cancer is brain cancer. In specific embodiments,
the brain cancer is pilocytic astrocytoma, astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma,
glioblastoma multiforme or a metastatic brain tumor.
[00274]           In one embodiment, the cancer is melanoma. In a specific embodiment,
the melanoma is metastatic melanoma.
[00275]           The compound of the invention and other anticancer agent can act
additively or synergistically. A synergistic combination of a compound of the invention
and the other anticancer agent, might allow the use of lower dosages of one or both of
these agents or less frequent administration of the agents to a subject with cancer. The
ability to utilize lower dosages of one or both of the compounds of the invention and
other anticancer agent or to administer the agents less frequently can reduce any toxicity
associated with the administration of the agents to a subject without reducing the efficacy
of the agents in the treatment of cancer. In addition, a synergistic effect might result in
the improved efficacy of these agents in the treatment of cancer and/or the reduction of
any adverse or unwanted side effects associated with the use of either agent alone.
[00276]           In one embodiment, the administration of an effective amount of a
compound of the invention and an effective amount of another anticancer agent inhibits
the resistance of a cancer to the other anticancer agent. In one embodiment, the cancer is
a tumor.

the invention and the other anti-neurodegenerative disease agent are administered within
3 hours. In another embodiment, a compound of the invention and the other anti
neurodegenerative disease agent are administered at 1 minute to 24 hours apart.
[00295]          In one embodiment, an effective amount of a compound of the invention
and an effective amount of other anti-neurodegenerative disease agent are present in the
same composition. In one embodiment, this composition is useful for oral administration.
In another embodiment, this composition is useful for intravenous administration.

of the invention and the other anti-neurodegenerative disease agent which together are
effective to treat or prevent a neurodegenerative disease.
[00297]          The compounds of the invention and other anti-neurodegenerative disease
agent can act additively or synergistically. A synergistic combination of a compound of
the invention and the other anti-neurodegenerative disease agent, might allow the use of
lower dosages of one or both of these agents and/or less frequent administration of the
agents to a subject with a neurodegenerative disease. The ability to utilize lower dosages
of one or both of the compound of the invention and other anti-neurodegenerative disease
agent and/or to administer the agents less frequently can reduce any toxicity associated
with the administration of the agents to a subject without reducing the efficacy of the
agents in the treatment of a neurodegenerative disease. In addition, a synergistic effect
might result in the improved efficacy of these agents in the treatment of a
neurodegenerative disease and/or the reduction of any adverse or unwanted side effects
associated with the use of either agent alone.

V.       Therapeuticor ProphylacticAdministration and Compositions of the Invention
[00301]           Due to their activity, compounds of the invention are advantageously
useful in veterinary and human medicine.
[00302]           When administered to a subject, the compounds of the invention can be
administered as a component of a composition that comprises a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier, diluent, excipient, or vehicle. The present compositions, which
comprise a compound of the invention, can be administered orally. The compounds of
the invention can also be administered by any other convenient route, for example, by
infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings
(e.g., oral, rectal, or intestinal mucosa) and can be administered together with another
biologically active agent. Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery
systems are known, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules and
capsules.
[00303]           Methods of administration include, but are not limited to, intradermal,
intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral,
sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical,
specifically to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. In some instances, administration will result
in the release of a compound of the invention into the bloodstream.
[00304]           In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are administered
orally. In other embodiments, it can be desirable to administer the compounds of the
invention locally. This can be achieved, for example, and not by way of limitation, by
local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound
                                               107

WO 2012/054535                                                             PCT/US2011/056780
dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository or
enema, or by means of an implant, the implant being of a porous, non-porous, or
gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.
[00305]         In certain embodiments, it can be desirable to introduce the compounds of
the invention into the central nervous system or gastrointestinal tract by any suitable
route, including intraventricular, intrathecal, and epidural injection, and enema.
Intraventricular injection can be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example,
attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir.
[00306]         Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler
of nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a
fluorocarbon oar, synthetic pulmonary surfactant. In certain embodiments, the
compounds of the invention can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders
and excipients such as triglycerides.
[00307]         In another embodiment compounds of the invention can be delivered in a
vesicle, specifically a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990) and
Liposomes in Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer 317-327 and 353-365 (1989)).
[00308]         In yet another embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be
delivered in a controlled-release system or sustained-release system (see, e.g., Goodson,
in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). Other
controlled or sustained-release systems discussed in the review by Langer, Science 249:
1527-1533 (1990) can be used. In one embodiment a pump can be used (Langer, Science
249: 1527- 1533 (1990); Sefton, CRC Crit.Ref Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald
et al, Surgery 88:507 (1980); and Saudek et al., N. Engl. JMed. 321:574 (1989)). In
another embodiment polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of
Controlled Release (Langer and Wise eds., 1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug
Product Design and Performance (Smolen and Ball eds., 1984); Ranger and Peppas, J.
Macromol. Sd. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 2:61 (1983); Levy et al, Science 228:190 (1935);
During et al, Ann. Neural. 25:351 (1989); and Howard et al, J. Neurosurg. 71:105
(1989)).

WO 2012/054535                                                                PCT/US2011/056780
[00309]         In yet another embodiment a controlled- or sustained-release system can
be placed in proximity of a target of the compounds of the invention, e.g., the spinal
column, brain, skin, lung, or gastrointestinal tract, thus requiring only a fraction of the
systemic dose.
[00310]         The present compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient so as to provide the form for proper administration
to the subject.
[00311]         Such pharmaceutical excipients can be liquids, such as water and oils,
including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil,
soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. The pharmaceutical excipients can be
saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea and the like. In
addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents can be used.
In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are sterile when
administered to a subject. Water is a useful excipient when the compound of the
invention is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and
glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, specifically for injectable
solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose,
sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol
monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water,
ethanol and the like. The present compositions, if desired, can also comprise minor
amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.
[00312]         The present compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions,
emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained
release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other
form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the composition is in the form of a capsule (see
e.g. U.S. Patent No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are
described in Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro eds.,
19th ed. 1995), incorporated herein by reference.

WO 2012/054535                                                             PCT/US2011/056780
[00313]          In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are formulated in
accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for oral administration to
human beings. Compositions for oral delivery can be in the form of tablets, lozenges,
aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs
for example. Orally administered compositions can comprise one or more agents, for
example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents
such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents,
to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill
form, the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the
gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of
time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving a
compound of the invention are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In
these latter platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by
the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through
an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery
profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time-delay
material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate can also be useful. Oral
compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch,
magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. In one
embodiment, the excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.
[00314]          In another embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be formulated
for intravenous administration. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration
comprise sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions can also
include a solubilizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration can optionally
include a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection.
[00315]          Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together
in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized-powder or water- free concentrate
in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampule or sachette indicating the quantity of
active agent. Where the compounds of the invention are to be administered by infusion,
they can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile
                                              110

WO 2012/054535                                                              PCT/US2011/056780
pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the compounds of the invention are
administered by injection, an ampule of sterile water for injection or saline can be
provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.
[00316]           Compounds of the invention can be administered by controlled-release or
sustained-release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary
skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent
Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595;
5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; and 5,733,556, each of which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Such dosage forms can be useful for
providing controlled- or sustained-release of one or more active ingredients using, for
example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable
membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes,
microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying
proportions. Suitable controlled- or sustained-release formulations known to those skilled
in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active
ingredients of Formula I to XI. The invention thus provides single unit dosage forms
suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and
caplets that are adapted for controlled- or sustained-release.
[00317]           Controlled- or sustained-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated
by various conditions, including but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in
temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of
water, or other physiological conditions or compounds. The amount of the compounds of
the invention that is effective in the treatment or prevention of a neurodegenerative
disease can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo
assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise
dose to be employed can also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness
of the Condition being treated and can be decided according to the judgment of the
practitioner and each subject's circumstances in view of, e.g., published clinical studies.
Suitable effective dosage amounts, however, range from about 10 micrograms to about 5
grams about every 4 hours, although they are typically about 500 mg or less per every 4
                                               111

4.2 g, about 4.4 g, about 4.6 g, about 4.8 g, and about 5.0 g, every 4 hours. Equivalent
dosages can be administered over various time periods including, but not limited to,
about every 2 hours, about every 6 hours, about every 8 hours, about every 12 hours,
about every 24 hours, about every 36 hours, about every 48 hours, about every 72 hours,
about every week, about every two weeks, about every three weeks, about every month,
and about every two months. The effective dosage amounts described herein refer to total
amounts administered; that is, if more than one compound of the invention is
administered, the effective dosage amounts correspond to the total amount administered.
[00318]         Compositions can be prepared according to conventional mixing,
granulating or coating methods, respectively, and the present compositions can comprise,
in one embodiment, from about 0.1% to about 99%; and in another embodiment from
about 1% to about 70% of the compound of the invention by weight or volume.
[00319]         The dosage regimen utilizing the compound of the invention can be
selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex
and medical condition of the subject; the severity of the Condition to be treated; the route
of administration; the renal or hepatic function of the subject; and the specific compound
of the invention employed. A compound of the invention can be administered in a single
daily dose, or the total daily dosage can be administered in divided doses of two, three or
four times daily. Furthermore, a compound of the invention can be administered in
intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes,
using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in
that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage
administration can be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.
Other illustrative topical preparations include creams, ointments, lotions, aerosol sprays
and gels, wherein the concentration of compound of the invention ranges from about

[00330]          Halo-esters of type 3 can be prepared by reacting compounds 2, wherein E
is a suitable leaving group, with compounds 1, wherein R2 and R3 are as defined in
Formula I. Suitable leaving groups are well known in the art, but not limited to halides,
such as chloride, bromide, and iodide; aryl- or alkylsulfonyloxy, substituted
arylsulfonyloxy (e.g., tosyloxy or mesyloxy); substituted alkylsulfonyloxy (e.g.,
haloalkylsulfonyloxy); (C6)aryloxy or subsituted (C6)aryloxy; and acyloxy groups.
Compounds 2 are available commercially (e.g., Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee,
Wisconsin) or can be prepared by well-known methods such as halogenation or
sulfonation of butanediol. Compounds 1 are also available commercially (e.g., Aldrich
Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin) or may be preared by well-known methods, such
as those listed in Larock Comprehensive Organic Transformations; Wiley-VCH: New
York, 1999, pp. 1754-1755 and 1765. A review on alkylation of esters of type 1 is given
by J. Mulzer in Comprehensive Organic Functional Transformations, Pergamon, Oxford
1995, pp. 148-151 and exemplary synthetic procedures for reacting compounds 1 with
compounds 2 are described in United States Patent No. 5,648,387, column 6 and Ackerly,
et al., J. Med. Chem. 1995, pp. 1608. The reaction can proceed in the presence of a
suitable base. In certain embodiments, a suitable base will have a pKa of greater than
about 25, in yet another embodiment a suitable base will have a pKa of greater than about
30. Suitable bases include, but are not limited to, alkylmetal bases such as lithium
diisopropylamide, methyllithium, n-butyllithium, tert-butyllithium, sec-butyllithium,
phenyllithium, phenyl sodium, and phenyl potassium; metal amide bases such as lithium
amide, sodium amide, potassium amide, lithium tetramethylpiperidide, lithium
diethylamide, lithium dicyclohexylamide, sodium hexamethyldisilazide, and lithium
hexamethyldisilazide; hydride bases such as sodium hydride and potassium hydride.
Metal amide bases, such as lithium diisopropylamide are particularly useful. In certain
embodiments of the invention, to react compounds 1 with compounds 2, a solution of
about 1 to about 2 equivalents of a suitable base can be added to a stirred solution
comprising esters 1 and a suitable organic solvent, under an inert atmosphere, the
solution maintained at a constant temperature within the range of about -95   0C  to about
room temperature, in certain embodiments at about -78 0C to about -20 0 C. In some
embodiments, the base can be diluted in a suitable organic solvent before addition. In
                                              116

some embodiments, the base can be added at a rate of about 1.5 moles per hour. Organic
solvents suitable for the reaction of compounds 1 with the compounds 2 include, but are
not limited to, dichloromethane, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide,
dimethyl sulfoxide, benzene, toluene, xylene, hydrocarbon solvents (e.g., pentane,
hexane, and heptane), and mixtures thereof. After addition of the base, the reaction
mixture can be allowed to stir for about 1 to about 2 hours, and a compound 2, which can
be dissolved in a suitable organic solvent, is added, in certain embodiments at a rate such
that the reaction-mixture temperature remains within about one to two degrees of the
initial reaction-mixture temperature. After addition of compounds 2, the reaction-mixture
temperature can be adjusted to within a temperature range of about -20 0C to about room
temperature, including to about room temperature, and the reaction mixture can be
allowed to stir until the reaction is substantially complete as determined by using an
appropriated analytical method, such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Then the reaction mixture is quenched and
compounds 3 can be isolated by workup.
[00331]          Further, compounds 3 can be reacted with substituted aldehydes by a
Grignard reaction to afford alcohols 4. For exemplary procedures for Grignard reactions
see March, J. Advanced OrganicChemistry; Reactions Mechanisms, and Structure, 4th
ed., 1992, pp. 920-929. In certain embodiments, compounds 3 are treated with Zn or Mg
in diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, as described in Drake, N. L.; Cooke, G. B. Org. Synth.
Coll. Vol. I, 1943, 406. Halides 5 can be synthesized by a variety of methods starting
from alcohols 4. One method involves conversion of the alcohol to a leaving group such
as a sulfonic ester, such as but not limited to, for example, tosylate, brosylate, mesylate,
or nosylate. This intermediate can then be treated with a source of X-, wherein X- is F,
Br, or Cl- in a solvent such as THF or ether. A general method for converting vinyl and
phenyl alcohols to thiols involves initially converting the alcohol to a leaving group (e.g.,
a tosylate) then treating with a halide nucleophile. Exemplary procedures are described
in Forrest, 0. A.; Gregory, C. F. J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2005, 127, 10482-10483 (NBS/THF),
and Possel, 0.; van Leusen, A. M. Tetrahedron. Lett, 1977, 48, 4229-4232 (HCl/MeOH).

Halides 5 can be coupled with various heterocycles to produce esters 6. Specifically,
4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine with Z1 = S in the presence of potassium
carbonate, as described in Aubert, D.; Touch, P. D.; Ferrand, C.; Ramonville, S.;
Maffrand, J. United States Patent 4,529,596. 1985. To produce compounds of the
invention with Z'  = CH 2 halides 5 are coupled with 6, 7-dihydro-5H-[1]pyrindine-3
carboxylic acid as described in Godar E.M., Mariella R.P., J. Org. Chem., 1960, 25, 557
559. To produce esters 6 with Z' = 0, halides 5 can be reacted with 4,5,6,7
tetrahydrofuro[3,2-c]pyridine as described in Koike, H.; Asai, F.; Sugidachi, Kimure, T.;
Inoue, T.; Nishino, S.; Tsuzaki, Y. United States Patent 5,288,726, 1994.   Similarly,
halides 5 can be reacted with pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester, as
described in Krichevskii, E. S.; Alekseeva, L. M.;; Granik, V. G. Chem. Hetercycl.
Compd. 1990, 1235-1238, to produce compounds of the invention with Z1      =  N.
Esters 6 could undergo subsequent functionalizations as described for instance in Carey,
F.; Giuliano, R. Organic Chemistry, McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math; 8 edition
(2010), Chapter 20. As a specific example, acids of type 7 are obtained by subsequent
hydrolysis of the ester groups in the presence of potassium hydroxide (for a general
method see Vogel's PracticalOrganic Chemistry, 4th Edition, Longman Inc.: New York
1978, pp 491).

Rieke R.D., J. Org. Chem., 1991, 56, 1445-1453. The ketone intermediate 2 can be
reduced with sodium borohydride to form alcohols 3. The alcohol can be treated with a
suitable leaving group in preparation to the subsequent coupling, as described above for
the synthesis of derivative 6 in Scheme 1. Suitable leaving groups are well known in the
art, for example, but not limited to halides, such as chloride, bromide, and iodide; aryl- or
alkylsulfonyloxy, substituted arylsulfonyloxy (e.g., tosyloxy or mesyloxy); substituted
alkylsulfonyloxy (e.g., haloalkylsulfonyloxy); (C6)aryloxy or subsituted (C6)aryloxy; and
acyloxy groups. In certain embodiments of the invention, a compound of type 4 is
treated with methanesulfonyl chloride at low temperatures, such as 0 - 5 0C in the
presence of excess triethylamine to form a mesylate. The mesylate 4 is further coupled
with the appropriate heterocycle by heating in THF with an excess of triethylamine to
form derivative 5. Nitrile derivatives 5 are subjected to transformations to various other
functionalities by well-known compendial reactions or via interconversions of carboxylic
acid derivatives.

[00334]         Scheme 1 illustrates a synthesis of pyrimidines of formula 4. The
synthesis can be accomplished by condensation of ketoesters of formula 2 and amidines
of formula 3. The condensation reaction can be conducted as described in Hull R. et al.,
1946, Journal of the Chemical Society pp. 357-362. The ketoesters of formula 2 can be
prepared from the commercially available esters of formula 1 (e.g. Matrix Scientific,
Columbia, SC) by the methods described in Raimundo, Brian C., et al., 2004, Journal of
Medicinal Chemistry 47(12), pp. 3111-3131, or the corresponding acid (e.g. Sigma
Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) by the method found in Bashford K. E. et al., 2003,
Tetrahedron Letters 44, pp. 1627-1629 and Oikawa Y. et al., 1978, Journal of Organic
Chemistry 43(10), pp. 2087-2088. The amine present can be commonly protected with
but not limited to a t-Boc, CBZ, or benzyl protective group. The amidines of formula 3
(with m being an integer from 0 to 3) are generally commercially available (e.g. Sigma
Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) but also can be prepared from the corresponding amine by
reaction with 2-methyl-2-thiopseudourea sulfate, which is also commercially available
(e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO). One such nonlimiting procedure is described
in Bonafoux D. et al., 2009, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 19(3), pp. 912
916.
[00335]         Scheme 2 describes the transformation of pyrimidines of formula 4 to the
corresponding halogenated compounds of formula 5 by the use of a halogenating agents
including but not limited to PCl5 , PBr5 , phosphorus oxychloride, and phosphorus
oxybromide. An example of this transformation is described by Altenbach R. J., et al.,
2008, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 51(20), pp. 6571-6580. The halogenated
compounds of formula 5 can be reacted with a series of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen or
sulfur neucleophiles to displace the halogen and generate more the complex pyrimidine
analogs of formula 6. The agents used for displacement are commercially available (e.g.
Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) and generally require the presence of additional
base including but not limited to triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, potassium or
sodium tert-butoxide, potassium or sodium carbonate, and sodium hydride. Examples of
these type of displacement reactions with nitrogen neucleophiles (as in Ghoneim K. M. et
al., 1986, Journal of the Indian Chemical Society, 63(10, pp. 914-917), oxygen
neuclophiles (as in Dubey P. K. et al., 2006, Indian Journal of Hetercyclic Chemistry

15(4), pp. 405-406), carbon neuclophiles (as in Gillespie R.J. et al, 2009, Bioorganic &
Medicinal Chemistry 17(18), pp. 6590-6605), and sulfur neucleophiles (as in Backer H.J.
et al, 1942, Recueil des Travaux Chimiques des Pays-Bas et de la Belgique 61, pp. 291
298) are well known in the literature.
[00336]         Scheme 3 describes the transformation of pyrimidines of formula 4 to the
corresponding O-carbonyl pyrimidines of formula 7. The O-carbonyl pyrimidines of
formula 7 can be prepared from pyrimidines of formula 4 by addition of the
corresponding acid chloride in the presence of base including but not limited to
triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, potassium or sodium tert-butoxide, potassium or
sodium carbonate, and sodium hydride. The acid chlorides are commercially available
(e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) or can be prepared by heating a commercially
available acid with chlorinating agents which include but are not limited to thionyl
chloride or oxalyl chloride. One example of the carbonylation of pyrimidines is
described in Shabbir S. et al., 2010, Tetrahedron 66(35), pp. 7204-7212.
[00337]         Scheme 4 illustrates the transformation of pyrimidines of formula 6 and
formula 7 to the final structures of formula (II). The protective group can be first
removed to generate pyrimidines of formula 8 using standard methodologies for the
protective group that was used (see Greene T. W. and Wuts P. G., 1999, Protective
Groups in Organic Synthesis 3rd edition, Wiley-Interscience, New York for removal of
common protective groups). The pyrimidines can then be alkylated with commercially
available agents (e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) in the presence of a base
including but not limited to triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, potassium or sodium
tert-butoxide, potassium or sodium carbonate, and sodium hydride. Procedures described
in Levy D. E. et al., 2008, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 18(7), pp. 2395
2398 can be used in these types of alkylations. The second commonly methodology that
can be used in the transformation of pyrimidines of formula 8 the final structures of
formula (II) is reductive amination. Pyrimidines of formula 8 can be treated with a
commercially available aldehydes or ketones (e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO)
in the presence of a weak acid (including but not limited to acetic acid, trifluoro acetic
acid, or hydrochloric acid) and a reducing reagent (including but not limited to sodium
                                             123

hydrogen bromide gas) in acetic acid at low temperature to prepare the halogenated
compound of formula 7, in the manner described in Crispi G. et al, 1982, Synthesis 9, pp.
787-788. The final products of formula III can be prepared by heating the halides of
formula 7 (e.g. the bromide of 7a) in the presence of base (including but not limited to
sodium or potassium hydroxide, potassium or sodium tert-butoxide, potassium or sodium
carbonate, and sodium hydride) with commercially available (e.g. Acc Corporation, San
Diego CA and Ryan Scientific, Mt. Pleasant SC) cyclic compounds of formula 8. The
displacement products can be prepared as described for similar compounds in the
literature (e.g. Cheng D. et al., 2008, Chinese Chemical Letters 19(6), pp. 689-692).

Mueller R. et al, 2004, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 47(24), pp. 6082-6099 outline
the alkylation reaction. The alkylated products of formula 3 can be heated in the
presence of triphenylphosphine to prepare the phosphonium salts of formula 4 in the
manner described in Parikka K. et al., 2009, Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry,
5(22), pp. 1-5. The phosphonium salts of formula 4 can be treated with base (including
but not limited to sodium or potassium hydroxide, potassium or sodium tert-butoxide,
potassium or sodium carbonate, and sodium hydride) in the presence of commercially
available aldehydes (e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) of formula 5 to generate
olefins of formula 6 in the manner described in Le Bigot Y. et al., 1988, Tetrahedron
44(4), pp. 1057-1072, as a mixture of cis and trans isomers.
[00346]          Scheme 2 illustrates a conversion of esters of formula 6 to halogenated
compounds of formula 9. The alcohols of formula 7 can be prepared by reduction of the
ester group in compounds of formula 6. A wide variety of reagents are available for
reduction of such esters to alcohols, e.g., see M. Hudlicky, Reductions in Organic
Chemistry, 2nd ed., 1996 pp. 212-217, hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference.
In certain embodiments, the reduction can be performed with a hydride type reducing
agent, for example, lithium aluminum hydride, lithium borohydride, lithium triethyl
borohydride, diisobutylaluminum hydride, lithium trimethoxyaluminum hydride, or
sodium bis(2-methoxy)aluminum hydride. For exemplary, but non-limiting, procedures
for reducing esters to alcohols, see Nystrom et al., 1947, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 69:1197; and
Moffet et al., 1963, Org. Synth., Collect. 834(4), lithium aluminum hydride; Brown et
al.,1965, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 87:5614, lithium trimethoxyaluminum hydride; Cerny et al.,
1969, Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 34:1025, sodium bis(2-methoxy)aluminum
hydride; Nystrom et al., 1949, J. Am. Chem. 71:245, lithium borohydride; and Brown et
al., 1980, J. Org. Chem. 45:1, lithium triethyl borohydride. The alcohol present in
compounds of formula 7 can be converted to the halide to prepare compounds of formula
8 (for an illustrative discussion of various methods for conversion of alcohols to halides
see March, J. Advanced Organic Chemistry; Reactions Mechanisms, and Structure, 4th
ed., 1992, pp. 431-433). Compounds of formula 9 can be directly prepared from the ester
6 by hydrolysis of the ester with base followed by standard coupling techniques (using

alcohols, amines, and thiols. Compounds of formula 9 could also be prepared form
compounds of formula 7 by alkylation or carbonylation with commercially available
alkylating and acylating reagents. Compounds of formula 9 can also be prepared by
displacement of the halide present in compounds of formula 8 with commercially
available alcohols, amines, and thiols.
[00347]         In scheme 3, the mixture of cis and trans isomers of formula 9 can be
halogenated by condensation with anhydrous hydrogen halide gas (e.g. hydrogen bromide
gas) in acetic acid at low temperature to prepare the halogenated compound of formula
10, in the manner described in Crispi G. et al, 1982, Synthesis 9, pp. 787-788.

Compounds of the formula 11 (Z = N) can be prepared as described in Taillier C. et al.,
2007, Tetrahedron 63(21), pp. 3589-3592 can coupled with the halides of figure 10 in the
presence of base (including but not limited to sodium or potassium hydroxide, potassium
or sodium tert-butoxide, potassium or sodium carbonate, and sodium hydride) to form
compounds of formula 12. The displacement products can be prepared as described for
similar compounds in the literature (e.g. Cheng D. et al., 2008, Chinese Chemical Letters
19(6), pp. 689-692). The ketones of formula 12 could be treated with base and alkylated
with a series of commercially available alkylating (or acylating) reagents to form
compounds of formula 14. The ketones of formula 12 could also be halogenated to form
formula 13 compounds by the methods described in Newman M.S. et al., 1945, Organic
Synthesis 25 and Mellegaard-Waetzig S. R. et al., 2006, Tetrahedron, pp. 7191-7198.
The halogenated compounds of formula 13 could then be displaced with commercially
available compounds containing nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur neuclophiles to prepare the
ketones of formula 14. The target compounds of formula V can be prepared by
olefination of the ketones of formula 14 with commercially available phosphonates or
phosphonium salts in the presence of base.
Additionally the compounds of Formula V can be synthesized by methods disclosed in:

[00349]          Scheme 1 describes a synthetic route for the preparation of compounds of
forumla VI. The prerparation can involve condensation of compounds with formula 2
and formula 4. Compounds of the formula 1 (Z2 = N) can be prepared as described in
Taillier C. et al., 2007, Tetrahedron 63(21), pp. 3589-3592 with a boc protective group.
The protective group can be removed by stirring in trifluoroacetic acid to prepare the
compound of formula 2. The compounds of formula 4 are either commercially available
(e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) or can be prepared from commercially
available compounds of formula 3 by acylation in the presence of a hindered base (e.g.
diisopropylethylamine). Equimolar amounts of the compounds of the formula 2 and
formula 4 can be heated in polar aprotic solvents (e.g. DMF or acetonitrile) to form the
displacement products of formula 5. Similar, but not limiting, displacement reactions are
described in the literature (e.g. Cheng D. et al., 2008, Chinese Chemical Letters 19(6), pp.
689-692).
[00350]          Scheme 2 describes a preparation of analogs of formula 7 from the
compounds of formula 5. Analogs of formula 7 can be prepared by direct condensation
of commercially available compounds (e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO)
containing sulfur and nitrogen neucleophiles, as described in Kall A. et al., 2010,
Synthetic Communications 40(12), pp. 1730-1735 with the compounds of formula 5.
Additionally, the compounds of formula 5 could be halogenated by the method described
in Marx J. et al., 1983, Tetrahedron 39(9), pp. 1529-1531 to form compound of formula
6. The compounds of formula 6 can be heated with commercially available compounds

[00351]         Scheme 3 describes a transformation of the compounds of formula 7 to the
target compounds of formula VI by olefination. Commercially available acyl
phosphonium salts or acyl-phosphonates (e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) can
be treated with base (including but not limited to sodium or potassium hydroxide,
potassium or sodium tert-butoxide, potassium or sodium carbonate, lithium
diisopropylamide, and sodium hydride) in the presence of compounds of formula 7 to
form the final compounds of formula VI. A non-limiting example of a similar procedure
is described in Lombardo L. et al., 1987, Synthetic Communications 8(7), pp. 463-468.

piperidone (e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) in the presence of a catalytic

[00356]         Scheme 1 illustrates a synthesis of amides of Formula VIII. In order to
prepare the intermediates of formula 3, commercially available (e.g. Sigma-Aldrich
Corp., St. Louis, MO) amines and phenyl hydrazines of formula 1 can be condensed with
2-chloroacrylonitrile 2 by heating in the presence of an excess of acid (e.g. sulfuric acid).

There are a few non-limiting examples of this type of condensation in the current
literature including the procedure described in Ege G. et al., 1982, Journal of
Heterocyclic Chemistry 19(6), pp. 1265-1266. Intermediates of formula 3 can be
condensed with commercially available (e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO)
Meldrum's acid 4 and commercially available (e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO)
aldehydes of formula 5 to prepare amides of formula 6 in the manner described in
Quiroga J. et al., 1998, Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry 35(2), pp. 409-412. The
amides of formula 6 can be alkylated with a series of commercially available (e.g. Sigma
Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) alkylating agents (e.g. alkyl halides, acyl chlorides,
chlorosulfonates) in the presence of base (including but not limited to sodium or
potassium hydroxide, potassium or sodium tert-butoxide, potassium or sodium carbonate,
lithium diisopropylamide, and sodium hydride) to prepare the target compounds of
formula VIII.

[00358]         Scheme 1 illustrates a synthesis of amides of formula IX. Commercially
available (e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) amines of figure 1 can be reacted
with either alkylating agents (e.g. alkyl halides, acyl chlorides, chlorocarbamates, or
chlorosulfonates) to prepare amines of figure 2. The amines of figure 2 can also be

alkyl halides, acyl chlorides, chlorosulfonates) in the presence of a reducing reagent
(including but not limited to sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, and sodium
triacetoxyborohydride). The reductive amination procedure described in Levy D. E. et
al., 2008, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 18(7), pp. 2395-2398 is commonly
used. Amides of formula 4 can be prepared by acylating structures of formula 1 or
formula 2 with commercially available halides (e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO)
of formula 3 in the presence of a hindered base (e.g. triethylamine,
diisopropylethylamine, diphenylethylamine) as described in Renzi L. et al., 1956,
Gazzetta Chimica Italiana 86, pp. 1362-1366. The target compounds of formula IX can
be prepared by displacement with amines of formula 5 with the compounds of formula 4

[00359]        Scheme 2 illustrates a general method for the synthesis of amines of
formula 5. Commercially available (e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) amino
alcohols of formula 6 can be selectively protected on nitrogen with a suitable protective
group (boc, benzyl, or CBZ) using common literature procedures. The oxygen present in
the formula 7 intermediates can be alkylated with a suitable (e.g. alkyl halides, acyl
chlorides, chlorocarbamates, or chlorosulfonates) and commercially available (e.g.
Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) alkylating agents to form intermediates of formula
8. The protective groups can then be removed using standard methodology (see Greene
T. W. and Wuts P. G., 1999, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd edition, Wiley
Interscience, New York) to prepare intermediates of formula 9. The amines of formula 5
can be prepared form the amines of formula 9 by either alkylation or reductive amination
from commercial available reagents as previously described.

[0453]          The effect of illustrative compounds of the invention on HDL
internalization was measured by an in vitro assay on HepG2 cells (figure 3).
3H  cholesterol Cholesteryl Oleate [Cholesteryl-1,2 -3 H(N)] labeled HDL ] (available
from PerkinElmer http://www.perkinelmer.com/Catalog/Product/ID/NET746L001MC)
was loaded on HepG2 cells in presence of illustrative compounds of the invention (final
concentration 1p jM). The Reference Compound was previously reported to increase the
HDL uptake in HepG2 cells in vitro (Jacquet S, Malaval C, Martinez LO, Sak K, Rolland
C, Perez C, Nauze M, Champagne E, Terc6 F, Gachet C, Perret B, Collet X, Boeynaems
JM, Barbaras R. The nucleotide receptor P2Y13 is a key regulator of hepatic high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) endocytosis. Cell Mol Life Sci. 2005 Nov,62(21):2508-15) and was
used as a positive control of the HDL uptake by HepG2 cells. It was determined that
Compounds XIa, 1Ic, Ila and Ih (R-isomer) have a strong impact on HDL uptake by
HepG2 cells; Compounds IIb,VIIa and VIIIa have a modest impact on HDL uptake by
HepG2 cells.
Consequences on bile acids physiology after IV injection of the selected molecules.
[0454]          Bile acids are derived from cholesterol and their synthesis is the
predominant pathway for catabolism of cholesterol. The HDL uptake by the liver is
directly connected with the bile acids secretion and the bile cholesterol clearance. To
demonstrate the effect of illustrative compounds of the invention on the bile physiology,
the compounds were injected into the tail of C57B16 mice and 4 hours later the mice were
sacraficed and the bile content was analyzed (figure 5). An increase of bile acids
concentration as well as of the bile volume was observed. All the compounds responded
as well as or even better than the control compound (Reference Compound).
Dose response of the selected molecules on bile physiology.
[0455]          The dose response after oral gavage was determined for illustrative
compounds of the invention. The chosen doses were 0.003, 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg. The
selected compounds of the invention were administrated by oral gavage and 6 hours later
the mice are sacrificed and the bile content was analyzed (Figures 6-11). Dose dependent
increases in bile acids, bile cholesterol and bile phospholipids were observed for all
                                              215

WO 2012/054535                                                            PCT/US2011/056780
concentrations of all the compounds. Compounds Ila, VIIIa, Ic and XIa showed an effect
at 0.003 mg/kg; Compounds Ilb and VIIa showed an effect at 0.3 mg/kg.
Consequences on bile acids physiology after one week daily treatment with
Compound Ila
[0456]           In the previous experiments, illustrative compounds of the invention were
administrated once and the impact on bile physiology was measured after 6 hours.
Compound Ila was administrated by oral gavage once daily for a week to allow
observation of the consequences on bile physiology of a longer treatment. On the day of
sacrifice, the conditions were similar to the dose response experiments. The net impact
of Compound Ila on the bile secretion was observed. The volume of the individual bile
was also affected with a significant increase compare to vehicle treatment.
 P2Y13 knock-down in Hepa 1-6 cells
[0457]           In order to relate the specific P2Y13 HDL uptake to the illustrative
compounds of the invention, a knock-down P2Y13 in a mouse liver cell line (Hepa 1-6)
was investigated. Lentiviral particles coding for the mouse P2Y13 shRNA and inducible
by the addition of doxycycline onto the cells (pTRIPZ vector from Open Biosystem)
were used. In presence of doxycycline, a decrease of the P2Y13 mRNA (Figure 11) was
observed. The uptake of HDL on this cell line was measured in the presence and the
absence of Compound Ila and doxycycline (Figure 12). A significant decrease of HDL
uptake (8.5%) was observed when the cells were treated with doxycycline (group vehicle
- p<0.05). This decrease was also observed in presence of Compound Ila (17.5%
p<0.005), thus showing that the target of Compound Ila is P2Y13.

primers (Mm03302249-g1) and ribosomal 18S primers (Mm02601777-gl) for real-time
PCR assays were purchased from Applied. HepG2 cells (HB-8065) and Hepa 1-6 (CRL
1830) were obtained from the ATCC.
Lipoprotein preparation
[0459]           Lipoproteins were purified from mice plasma by sequential
ultracentrifugation on KBr gradient. HDL were obtained at a density d=1.21. The
purified HDL were dialysed against PBS and used for the uptake experiments.

mixed with Lipoprotein delipidated serum (20 mL at 40mg/mL) and DTNB (0.4 pM final
concentration). HDL (7 mg) was added and incubated overnight at 4 'C on gentle
rotation. The HDL was purified on KBr gradient as previously described.
HepG2 and shP2Y13 transduced Hepa 1-6 HDL uptake
[0461]           Transduced Hepa 1-6 cells were plated at 300,000 cells/well in 6x-well
plates. These cells were treated every day with doxycycline (10 pM) for 3 days (for
P2Y13 extinction) or not (control for plasmid"leakage") The day of uptake, the cells
were washed once with DMEM and incubated for 1 hour in DMEM at 37 'C. 75 pag of
radio-labeled HDL (6500 dpm/pjg of HDL3.) were added to the medium and incubated
for 10 minutes at 37 'C. The cells were washed once with DMEM (2 mL) and incubated
for 1.5 hours in DMEM at 4 'C, whereupon dissociation occurred. Then the cells were
washed once more with cold DMEM (2 ml) and the incorporated cholesterol ether was
retrieved from HepG2 cells by the addition of hexane:isopropanol (3:2) solution (lmL).

Cholesterol efflux
[0463]           Cholesterol efflux capacity was quantified as previously described (Wang
et al., 2007), in blood samples from rabbit plasma collected before administration of the
dose on day 0 and after 4 weeks of administrations of Compound Ila. Briefly, oxidised
LDL (25pg/ml), labelled with [3H]-cholesterol (2 pCi/ml; Perkin-Elmer), were added to
J774 macrophages in culture for 24h in 2.5 % serum medium. [3H]-cholesterol release
was measured after 6h incubation of 2.5% (v/v) rabbit plasma or B-lipoprotein free
plasma (PTA kit - Biolabo, France). All assays were performed in triplicate. A rabbit
plasma (calibrator) was included on each plate and the values were normalized by
dividing plasma samples by this calibrator plasma to determine the normalized
cholesterol efflux capacity of the samples.
Animal protocol
[0369]           Animal housing and care were in compliance with the recommendations
of Directive 86/609/EEC, and protocol approvals were obtained from institutional ethics
commitees.
[0370]           ApoE-/- mice 'flow cessation model": Left carotid of apoE-/- mice were
ligatured and placed on Western diet. These mice were given Compound Ila once a day at

[0371]          ApoE -- "high-cholesteroldiet model": Mice were placed for two month
on Western diet (0.2% cholesterol, 21 % butter milk) then dosed with Compound Ila once
a day at 100 pg/kg (0.5% CMC, 0.2% Tween80) for 4 more weeks. The mice were
sacrificed and the aortas were collected for biochemical and immunohistological
characterizations. One set of aorta (n = 10) was detached at the base of the heart and
placed in a glass tube with 3 ml of chloroform-methanol 2:1 (v/v), and stigmasterol as the

first extensively washed with PBS, then with 4% paraformaldehyde (500pl) and finally
with tissue tek OCT (500pl). Next the aorta was embedded in OCT and frozen at -20'C.
Three step frozen sections of 10 tm separated one from the other        were processed and
stained with Oil red 0 (ORO), Sirius red and hematoxylin/eosin. Macrophages were
detected using F4/80 primary rat monoclonal antibody (Abcam) and VCAM was detected
using rat anti mouse CD 106 (AbDSerotec).

transducing units of viral vector (1.2E8TU/ml) per cells. 17 hours after transduction the
medium was replaced and the pool of transduced Hepa cells was established.
QPCR
[0465]          For quantitative PCR experiment the RNA was purified from cultured
cells with the RiboPureTM Kit (AM1924 Ambion). The RNA was reverse transcribed to
single-stranded cDNA with the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (4387406 Applied
BioSystem). The QPCR was performed using the Taqman technology according to the
manufacturer procedure (Applied Biosystems).

manufacturer protocol. Briefly, the standards were varied from 0 to 20pag/ml and 4ptl of
bile was measured in the assay. The reaction was performed for 5 minutes at 37'C.
[0468]          Bile cholesterol.Bile phospholipids were measured according to the
manufacturer protocol. Briefly, the standards were varied from 0 to 60pag/ml and 10ptl of
bile (dilution 1:10) was measured in the assay. The reaction was performed for 5 minutes
at 37 0 C.
EXAMPLE 20. EFFECT OF COMPOUND Ila ON THE P2Y13r PATHWAY
[0469]          Compound Ila demonstrated a dramatic effect on the inhibition of the
atherosclerosis progression in mice through the stimulation of HDL-P2Yl3r pathway.
The specificity of P2Yl3r pathway in vivo using adenovirus carrying P2Yl3r-shRNA in

WO 2012/054535                                                             PCT/US2011/056780
infected apoE -/- mice was also shown. Moreover, Compound Ila induced the regression
of pre-established atherosclerotic plaques in aortas of the rabbits fed with cholesterol
chow. These results demonstrate that P2Yl3r plays a strong pivotal role in the HDL
metabolism and atherosclerosis, and that P2Yl3r is a useful therapeutic target for
exploring biology of atherosclerosis.
[0470]            Heterocyclic compounds that were designed as orally active P2Y13
receptor agonists were used. These compounds were selected based on their specific
binding and activity in 1321N1 cells expressing P2Y13 receptors (not shown) (Kim, Y.
C. et al. Synthesis of pyridoxal phosphate derivatives with antagonist activity at the
P2Y13 receptor. Biochem Pharmacol70, 266-274 (2005)). The compounds were further
tested for their propensity to stimulate the [3H]-cholesterol-labelled-HDL uptake in vitro
in mouse hepatocytes (Hepa) and human hepatoma cells (HepG2). Specificity of the
uptake was also confirmed using P2Y13 siRNA probe (not shown). It was hypothesized
that administration of P2Yl3r agonists in animals would increase the reverse cholesterol
transport, i.e., the HDL uptake by the liver and subsequently enhancing bile acid and bile
cholesterol secretion. First, when C57Bl/6J mice were intravenously given Compound Ila
(10 nmol/kg), after 4 h of treatment an increase of bile acids (BA) and free cholesterol
secretion into bile was observed, the effect being slightly higher than with Cangrelor
(The Medicines Company), a known agonist of P2Yl3r (Figure 16 A and B) (Jacquet, S.
et al. The nucleotide receptor P2Y13 is a key regulator of hepatic high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) endocytosis. Cell Mol Life Sci 62, 2508-2515 (2005)). The
stimulation of the bile acid and cholesterol secretion in the bile of animals given P2Yl3r
agonist by oral gavage at doses as low as 30 pg/kg was confirmed (Figure 16 C and D).
This increase in bile acid secretion observed with P2Y 13r agonists could be a
consequence of either a secretion of BA from an intra-hepatic pool to the bile duct
(Schwartz, C. C., Halloran, L. G., Vlahcevic, Z. R., Gregory, D. H. & Swell, L.
Preferential utilization of free cholesterol from high-density lipoproteins for biliary
cholesterol secretion in man. Science 200, 62-64 (1978)) or a de novo synthesis of BA by
the liver following stimulation of the HDL uptake by the P2Yl3r pathway. An increase
in liver bile acid content at 30 pg/kg of P2Yl3r agonist in agreement with the stimulation
of the HDL uptake by the liver which in turn results in an increase in the BA synthesis

was clearly shown (Figure 16 E). It is noteworthy that the plasma cholesterol and HDL
were not significantly affected (Figure 16 F) after 4h of treatment with the exception of
the unesterified cholesterol, which could represent specific HDL cholesterol liver uptake
as already described (Schwartz, C. C., Halloran, L. G., Vlahcevic, Z. R., Gregory, D. H.
& Swell, L. Preferential utilization of free cholesterol from high-density lipoproteins for
biliary cholesterol secretion in man. Science 200, 62-64 (1978)). To further delineate the
implication of the HDL in the increase of bile secretion after treatment of the mice with
Compound Ila, in vivo liver uptake analysis of [3H]-cholesterol labelled mouse HDL
(Figure 16G), [3H]-cholesterol ester labelled mouse HDL (Figure 16H) and [3H]
cholesterol labelled mouse LDL (Figure 161) was performed. The intravenous treatment
of the animals with 10 nmole/kg with the P2Yl3r agonist showed a specific stimulation
of the uptake of the HDL as compared to LDL, which supports the hypothesis of a
stimulation of the HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport
The effect of the stimulation of the P2Yl3r pathway by the agonists on the
atherosclerotic plaque lesions in apoE -/- mice that are very susceptible to develop
atherosclerosis on a short term Western (i.e. high-cholesterol) diet was investigated. To
be closer to human pathology, atherosclerotic lesions were developed using the
methodology described as "flow cessation model" in apoE -/- mice (Godin, D., Ivan, E.,
Johnson, C., Magid, R. & Galis, Z. S. Remodeling of carotid artery is associated with
increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases in mouse blood flow cessation model.

atherosclerotic lesion growth depends on matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity.
Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol 24, 2123-2129 (2004)). Briefly, the left carotid artery of
the mouse was ligated to cause local inflammation, resulting in well-defined
atherosclerotic lesions after 2 weeks of feeding with Western diet. The concomitant
dosing with the P2Yl3r agonist for 2 weeks along with high-cholesterol diet showed a
dose-dependent inhibition of the progression of the atherosclerosis lesions compared to
control animals based on the lesion cholesterol content (RiedmUller K, Metz S, Bonaterra

withdrawal on plaque development and composition in the thoracic aorta of New Zealand
White rabbits. Atherosclerosis 210 407-13(2010)) (Figure 17A). The quantification of
plaque components by histo-pathological analysis of the treated carotids with
hematoxylin-eosin (Figure 17B, E, H), oil-red 0 staining (Figure 17C, F, I) and with
CD68 antibody (specific of the macrophages), (Figure 17D, G, J) further confirmed this
observation. The staining clearly showed a decrease in lipid content of the carotids of the
treated animals. The P2Yl3r agonist inhibition of cholesterol deposit was also observed
in the non-inflammatory right carotids of the "flow cessation model" apoE-/- mice (for
example, 18.2 +/- 3.6 and 7.5 +/- 3.4 nmole/mg of tissue for vehicle and Compound Ila at
100 pg/kg, respectively.
[0471]          To certify the P2Yl3r specificity, prior to carotid ligation and Western
diet, the mice were infected with adenovirus carrying either mock or specific shRNA
targeted against the P2Yl3r where a strong knock-down of P2Yl3r was observed (Figure
18 A). The concomitant dosing with the P2Yl3r agonists (at 0.1 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks
along with high-cholesterol diet showed a remarkable decrease in the cholesterol content
(60 % decrease) of the ligated carotids in mock adenovirus, indicating a significant
inhibition of the progression of the atherosclerosis lesions as compare to control animals
(Figure 18 B). This observation was further confirmed by histo-pathological analysis of
the treated carotids with hematoxylin-eosin and oil-red 0 staining (not shown). The
effects of P2Yl3r agonist on cholesterol content in carotids were abolished in mice
treated with shRNA targeted against the P2Yl3r, strengthening the specificity of the
P2Yl3r in this model when P2Yl3r expression was knocked-down (Figure 18 B). This
specific role of P2Yl3r was also observed on plasma cholesterol content (Figure 18 C)
and more specifically on LDL and VLDL cholesterol (Figures 18 E and D, respectively),
the main lipoprotein classes in this particular animal model, where a decrease was
observed in mock adenovirus P2Yl3r agonist-treated mice and abolished in to P2Yl3r
shRNA agonist-treated mice. These data represent the first evidence that the stimulation
of P2Yl3r could have a positive influence on the atherosclerosis progression.
[0472]          The prevention of progression of the plaque in aorta was further evaluated
                                             223

WO 2012/054535                                                             PCT/US2011/056780
in the cholesterol diet-fed apoE-/- mice (Figure 19). After 8 weeks of diet followed by 4
weeks treatment at 100 pg/kg/day of Compound Ila, the treated animals had significant
decreases in plaque area (Figure 4B, 4G and 4J), cholesterol content (Figure 19A),
VCAM1 expression using specific antibody CD106 (Figure 4F, 41 and 4L), decreased
macrophage content (F4/80 antibody - Figure 19C) of the aortic wall and the plaque and a
decrease of the lipid staining (Figure 19D, H and K). The collagen content of the wall
was improved (Figure 19E).
[0473]          The issue of whether stimulation of the P2Yl3r pathway could affect the
regression of atherosclerosis pre-induced in the high-cholesterol diet fed rabbits was also
addressed. These animals, after 2 months of high-cholesterol diet (0.5 % cholesterol in
the diet) followed by a 3 weeks wash-out period, developed atherosclerotic lesions in the
aorta. In addition, they expressed cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP, not expressed
in mice) and also presented a lipoprotein pattern similar to the human. Following lesion
induction and washout period, these animals were treated with Compound Ila given
orally at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg for 4 weeks. There was significant regression of the
atherosclerotic plaques in aorta (30 % decrease) of the agonist treated animals as
measured by the cholesterol content of the entire artery (Figure 20 A). Again, the
immuno-histological analysis of different parts of the aortas (from proximal-to-distal)
using hematoxylin-eosin, HHF35 antibody (specific for smooth muscle cells) and
RAM 11 antibody (specific for macrophages) confirmed the regression of the plaques (not
shown). The lipoprotein profiles analyzed by HPLC showed a trend towards an increase
of the HDL cholesterol (Figure 20 D) as well as the rabbit apoA-I, as measured by
SELDI-TOF analysis, while the VLDL and LDL decreased slightly (Figures 20 B and C,
respectively). No change in mRNA expressions (as measured by QPCR) of LDL
receptors and SR-BI was observed in the liver of treated rabbits (not shown). These
observations indicated that the activation of P2Yl3r did not have direct impact on the B
lipoprotein metabolism, also confirmed by the modest modulation of the plasma VLDL,
LDL apoB and triglycerides. As observed previously in mice (Figure 16), the bile acid
content in the liver increased in the rabbits treated with P2Y 13r agonists (Figure 20G)
strengthening the role of P2Yl3r pathway in the observed effects in the rabbits. This
relatively modest effect on the plasma HDL levels could be due to a neo-synthesis of new
                                              224

WO 2012/054535                                                             PCT/US2011/056780
HDL particles, which would compensate the uptake of mature HDL by the liver due to
Compound Ila effect. As a confirmation, the observed increase in plasma apoA-I (Figure
21A) associated with the increase in the apoA-I mRNA expression in the liver (Figure
21B) is in favour of the generation of new HDL particles in the circulation.
[0474]          In addition, due to the efficient HDL turnover mediated by P2Y 1 3r and
their strong capacity to efflux cholesterol from macrophages, the nascent HDL particles
could efficiently promote regression of the atherosclerotic plaques.
[0475]          To evaluate this hypothesis, the size of HDL particles in the treated
animals were analyzed using Lipoprint* technique. The HDL content of the treated
animals showed a very consistent pattern with a specific decrease in large HDL and
increase of the "intermediate" size HDL particles as compare to control animals (Figures
21 C and D). These intermediate HDL particles are considered as more potent particles
for the removal of cholesterol from atherosclerotic plaques by promoting efflux of
cholesterol from the macrophages presents in the lesion (Khera, A. V. et al. Cholesterol
efflux capacity, high-density lipoprotein function, and atherosclerosis. NEngl JMed 364,
127-135 (2011); deGoma, E. M., deGoma, R. L. & Rader, D. J. Beyond high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels evaluating high-density lipoprotein function as influenced
by novel therapeutic approaches. JAm Coll Cardiol51, 2199-2211 (2008)). Finally, the
measurement of cholesterol efflux in [3H]-cholesterol loaded J774 macrophages using
either the plasma (Figure 21 E) or apoB-particles-depleted plasma (Figure 21 F) from the
treated animals showed a dose-dependent efflux of cholesterol after treatment with the
P2Y 13r agonist, indicating that plasma HDL from treated animals are more powerful to
efflux cholesterol from macrophages (Khera, A. V. et al. Cholesterol efflux capacity,
high-density lipoprotein function, and atherosclerosis. NEngl JMed 364, 127-135
(2011)).
[0476]           In conclusion, it was demonstrated for the first time in vivo that P2Y13
receptors are key partners in the HDL metabolism, i.e., in the reverse cholesterol
transport process and in their final major physiological function, i.e., atherosclerosis
protection. These data support a mechanism in which the stimulation of the HDL uptake

or endocytosis by the liver via P2Yl3r pathway promotes cholesterol catabolism by the
liver and secretion in the bile. It is likely that the uptake of large HDL particles by the
liver also stimulates de novo synthesis of nascent HDL particles and hence improves the
efflux capacity of the serum. In another words, it was demonstrated in vivo that positive
direct intervention on the functionality of the HDL, instead of acting only on the level of
HDL, could have dramatic impact on the atherosclerotic pathology. These data also
support that P2Yl3r agonists, such as Compound Ila and the other compounds of the
invention, are highly useful as pharmacological therapeutics for the treatment of
atherosclerotic disease or its complications.
