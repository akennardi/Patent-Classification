 Tenofovir DF is also present as an active ingredient in VIREAD@ (tenofovir DF) tablets,
 TRUVADA@ (emtricitabine and tenofovir DF) tablets, and ATRIPLA@ (efavirenz,
emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF) tablets.
          A combination of rilpivirine HCl, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF is currently being
investigated in clinical studies for the treatment of HIV (for example TMC278-TiDP6-C209: A
Clinical Trial in Treatment Naive HIV-1 Patients Comparing TMC278 to Efavirenz in
Combination With Tenofovir + Emtricitabine at www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT00540449?term=TMC278&rank=10. In the current clinical studies this combination is
administered as two tablets: one tablet containing rilpivirine HCLI, and the second tablet being the
commercial product TRUVADA@ (emtricitabine 200 mg / tenofovir DF 300 mg).
         A fixed-dose combination product containing rilpivirine HCl, emtricitabine, and
tenofovir DF in a solid oral dosage form would be desirable. Such a fixed-dose combination
would provide patient dosing convenience for once daily administration. Clinical studies have
demonstrated high levels of compliance and treatment satisfaction, with simple once-daily highly
active antiretroviral therapies (HAART), resulting in durable suppression of HIV-1 RNA.
         International patent application publication number WO 2005/021001 discusses a co-wet
granulation process for preparing a single tablet that comprises rilpivirine HCl, emtricitabine,
and tenofovir DF. Unfortunately chemical stability of tenofovir DF is affected in the presence
of rilpivirine HCl. Thus, the formulation provided by the co-wet granulation process discussed in
WO 2005/021001 is not ideal for human clinical use.
         There is currently a need for a fixed-dose combination product containing rilpivirine
HCl, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF. Ideally, the fixed-dose combination product will provide
                                             2

     WO 2012/068535                                                            PCT/US2011/061515
  suitable chemical stability for the active ingredients and will be of an acceptable size as a unit
  dose form. Additionally, it would be beneficial for the fixed-dose form to produce human
  plasma concentrations of each of the three agents that are equivalent to the plasma
  concentrations produced by the administration of the individual agents.
                                        Summary of the Invention
           Applicant has discovered a single multilayer formulation of rilpivirine HCL,
  emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF that provides suitable chemical stability for the active
  ingredients as well as plasma concentrations of the three agents that are equivalent to the plasma
  concentrations produced by the administration of Emtriva (emtricitibine 200 mg) capsules,
  Viread (tenofovir DF 300 mg) tablets, and a third tablet containing rilpivirine HCl that is
  currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Additionally, the single multilayer formulations
  identified by Applicant provide a similar drug exposure, as measured by the plasma
 concentration area under the curve (AUC), when dosed with and without food as compared to
 the dosing of the individual components with food. Dosing the individual components without
 food showed a decrease in rilpivirine exposure (AUC) by 21% compared to dosing the
 individual components with food. Having a restriction of dosing with food only can complicate
 the dosing regimen and compromise patient dosing compliance.
          Accordingly, in one embodiment the invention provides a tablet comprising a first layer
 and a second layer wherein; a) the first layer comprises rilpivirine HCl; b) the second layer
 comprises tenofovir DF; and c) the tablet further comprises emtricitabine.
          In one embodiment the invention provides a method for treating HIV infection in a
 human comprising administering to the human a tablet of the invention, wherein rilpivirine AUC
 achieved following administration to the human when fed is no more than about 25% greater
than rilpivirine AUC achieved when administered to the human when fasted.
          In one embodiment the invention provides a method for treating HIV infection in a
human comprising administering to the human a tablet of the invention, wherein rilpivirine
Cmax achieved following administration to the human when fed is no more than about 25%
greater than rilpivirine Cmax achieved when administered to the human when fasted.
         In one embodiment the invention provides a tablet of the invention for use in the
prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of an HIV infection, wherein rilpivirine AUC achieved
following administration to the human when fed is no more than about 25% greater than
rilpivirine AUC achieved when administered to the human when fasted.

agents, coloring agents and preserving agents. Furthermore, these terms include the values
mentioned herein as well as values in accord with ordinary practice.
         The tablets of the invention can also comprise a film coating that covers a portion or all
of the tablet. Film coatings are known in the art and can be composed of hydrophilic polymer
materials, but are not limited to, polysaccharide materials, such as hydroxypropylmethyl
cellulose (HPMC), methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose
(HPC), poly(vinylalcohol-co-ethylene glycol) and other water soluble polymers. Though the
water soluble material included in the film coating of the present invention may include a single
polymer material, it may also be formed using a mixture of more than one polymer. In one
embodiment of the invention, the film coating comprises Opadry II Purple 33G100000, which is
available from Colorcon.
         The tablets of the invention may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may
be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and
formulations generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.,
Easton, PA), which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Such methods
include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient(s) with the carrier which
constitutes one or more accessory ingredients.
         A tablet can be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory
ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the
active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a
binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active agent or dispersing agent. Molded
tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active
ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated, for
example with a polymeric film coating that can optionally comprise a compound of formula I.

Comparative Example 1.               Preparation and Stability Evaluation of Co-wet Granulation
Formulation of FTC, RPV, and TDF
          A single co-wet granulation process was used to formulate FTC, RPV, and TDF, based
on the formulation composition of TRUVADA @ (emtricitibine 200 mg / tenofovir DF 300 mg)
and the RPV Phase 3 clinical formulation. Because a co-wet granulation process has the benefit
of ease of manufacturing it is frequently the first-choice approach to develop FDC products. The
low dose of RPV and the use of excipients common in VIREAD@ (tenofovir DF), TRUVADA
@ (emtricitibine 200 mg / tenofovir DF 300 mg), and EMTRIVA@ (emtricitibine) made
FTC/RPV/TDF amenable to a single-layer wet granulation process. One challenge was to
maintain the stability of TDF in the presence of a surfactant.
          The compositions and processing parameters of the co-wet granulation formulations
evaluated are summarized in Table CE 1.1 and CE1.2, respectively. Wet granulation was carried
out in the presence and absence of non-ionic surfactants (poloxamer 188 and polysorbate 20).

          The uncoated tablets were packaged with 3 g of silica gel desiccant and stored in 50'C
and 40'C/75% RH stability chambers to stress the tablet samples and accelerate the degradation
rate to give an indication of longer term stability of the tablets under ambient conditions
(25'C/60% RH). Preformulation studies have shown that TDF undergoes hydrolysis in an
aqueous solution and to a smaller degree in the solid state after exposure to humidity and heat.
The degradation products are mono-POC PMPA, isopropanol, carbon dioxide, and
formaldehyde. The rate and extent of degradation of TDF in the co-wet granulation formulations
was significantly higher than in commercial TRUVADA @ (emtricitabine 200 mg / tenofovir DF
300 mg) tablets. The total TDF-related impurities and degradation products increased to more

 than 4% after 2 weeks at 50"C. Various attempts to improve the chemical stability of TDF in the
 co-wet granulation formulations by removing surfactant or by increasing the concentrations of
 microcrystalline cellulose and pregelatinized starch failed to improve formulation stability.
 These results demonstrate that a co-wet granulation process is not ideal for human clinical use.
 The stability data at 50'C are summarized in Figure 7. All formulations show a much greater
 degradation rate of TDF than in TRUVADA @ (emtricitabine 200 mg / tenofovir DF 300 mg)
tablets.
          As illustrated below in Example 6 representative tablets of the invention overcome the
problem of reduced TDF stability present in the co-wet formulation above.
Comparative Example 2.               Preparation of Formulation 1
          Formulation 1 was manufactured by blending FTC, RPV, and TDF together with
excipients then dry granulating them together using a dry granulation process, which employs a
roller compactor and mill. The granules were blended with extragranular excipients and
compressed into tablet cores, which were then film-coated. The composition parameters for the
co-dry granulation formulation (Formulation 1) are summarized in Table CE2.1

Comparative Example 3.                   Preparation of Formulation 2

rilpivirine HCI was wet granulated by a fluid-bed granulation process and emtricitabine and
tenofovir DF were co-granulated in a high shear wet granulation process. This formulation was
designed to use the intragranular rilpivirine HCI formulation and fluid-bed granulation process
used to prepare the RPV tablet that is now being evaluated in Phase 3 clinical trials. The
emtricitabine/tenofovir DF powder blend was produced using the process and the intragranular
composition used in the manufacture of TRUVADA (@(emtricitibine 200 mg / tenofovir DF 300

  60 minutes. Composite samples of 10 tablets were dissolved and diluted to final concentrations
  of approximately 0.08 mg/mL RPV, 0.64 mg/mL FTC, and 0.96 mg/mL TDF with a 4:3:3 pH 3
  phosphate buffer:acetonitrile:methanol solution. The strength and degradation product content of
  FTC, RPV, and TDF were determined by HPLC using area normalization and external reference
  standards at a wavelength of 262 nm. The stability data for 30 count tablets stored at 40'C/75%
 RH in induction sealed bottles containing 3 g silica gel desiccant are summarized in Figure 8.
          In Comparative Example 5 below the bioavailabilities of Formulation 1 and Formulation
 2 from Comparative Examples 2 and 3 were assessed. Formulations 1 and 2 both failed to
 demonstrate bioequivalence for rilpivirine with significantly higher area under the curve (AUC)
 and Cmax levels than those obtained with the rilpivirine tablet that is now being evaluated in
 clinical trials. Accordingly, the human plasma concentration of rilpivirine produced by
 Formulation 1 and by Formulation 2 is not equivalent to the plasma concentration of rilpivirine
 produced in the current clinical trials. A representative tablet of the invention did demonstrate
 the beneficial property of providing a plasma concentration of rilpivirine that is equivalent to the
 plasma level produced in the current clinical trials (See Example 5 below).
 Comparative Example 5.          Bioavailability of Formulation 1 and Formulation 2
         A clinical study was conducted to assess the bioavailability and bioequivalence of
 Formulations 1 and 2 relative to co-administration of the individual components, with all
 treatments administered in the fed state. Formulations 1 and 2 both failed to demonstrate
bioequivalence for rilpivirine with significantly higher area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax
 levels than those obtained with the rilpivirine tablet that is now being evaluated in Phase 3
clinical trials. In contrast, both emtricitabine and tenofovir AUC and Cmax levels from
Formulations 1 and 2 were bioequivalent to the commercial formulations of EMTRIVA@
(Emtracitabine) and VIREAD@ (tenofovir DF), respectively. The significantly higher exposure
levels of rilpivirine observed from Formulations 1 and 2 in the bioequivalence study may be due
to the direct physicochemical interactions between rilpivirine HCl and either emtricitabine or
tenofovir DF. These results suggest that the formulation and the manufacturing process required
significant modifications to achieve the desired rilpivirine exposures.

Example 1. Synthesis of a Representative Bilayer Tablet of the Invention
        In one embodiment of the invention the manufacturing procedure can be broken down
into multiple segments: fluid-bed granulation and drying of rilpivirine HCl, high shear wet
granulation of emtricitabine and tenofovir DF, milling and blending of each granulation, bilayer
tableting, film-coating of the bulk tablets, and packaging. The stepwise procedure is detailed
below. To accommodate the equipment capacities, the in-process product may be granulated and
dried in multiple portions, which are then combined prior to the final milling and blending steps.
 As illustrated in Figure 4, a representative tablet of the invention can be prepared as follows.
Fluid-Bed Granulationof Rilpivirine HCl
1)      Weigh rilpivirine HCl and the excipients (lactose monohydrate and croscarmellose
        sodium). Correct the weight of rilpivirine HCl based on the drug content factor, with a
        concomitant reduction in the weight of lactose monohydrate.
2)      Weigh purified water, polysorbate 20, and povidone. Mix in 2 steps in a stainless steel
        vessel to form the granulation binder fluid. First, add povidone, then add polysorbate 20
        and mix until fully dissolved.

Example 4.       Preparation of Representative Tablets of the Invention
        Bilayer formulations were investigated where one layer contained rilpivirine HCl
(hereafter designated as the rilpivirine layer) and the other layer contained emtricitabine and
tenofovir DF. This approach was employed to minimize any potential physicochemical
interactions between rilpivirine HCl and emtricitabine and tenofovir DF. The bilayer formulation
approach involved two separate granulation processes in which rilpivirine HCl was wet
granulated using a fluid-bed granulation process and emtricitabine and tenofovir DF were co
granulated using a high shear wet granulation process. The two granulations were physically
separated by compressing the two blends into a bilayer tablet (Formulations 3 and 4). The
quantitative compositions for Formulations 3 and 4 are listed in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2
respectively. While Formulations 3 and 4 utilized the same manufacturing process, the
formulation composition of the rilpivirine HCl granulation in each of the formulations differed
in the relative proportion of the excipients used.

 addition, the rilpivirine HCJ was separated from emtricitabine and tenofovir DF. This was
accomplished through a bilayer compression process to produce the tablets. The
emtricitabine/tenofovir DF powder blend was produced by the same manufacturing process and
using the same intragranular composition for TRUVADA @ (emtricitibine 200 mg / tenofovir
DF 300 mg). The weight disparity between rilpivirine and emtricitabine/tenofovir DF layers
required dilution of the rilpivirine HCI granulation to ensure a robust tablet manufacturing
process. The layer weights in Formulations 3 and 4 were accommodated by adjusting the
concentrations of the excipients in the rilpivirine layer with microcrystalline cellulose, lactose
monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate.
Example 5.        Bioavailability of Formulations 3 and 4
        This study evaluated the bioequivalence of Formulation 3 from Example 4 to
coadministration of the three individual dosage forms (FTC+RPV+TDF, Reference)
        A randomized, single-dose, open-label, Phase 1 study in healthy adults under fed
conditions. Serial blood samples were obtained over 192 hours following oral administration of
each treatment and PK parameters calculated. Formulation bioequivalence was assessed by 90%
confidence intervals (CI) for the ratio of geometric least square means (GMR) for Cmax, AUCiast
and AUCsf for each drug of the Test versus Reference treatment.
Results: 36 subjects enrolled and 34 completed the study. All treatments were generally well
tolerated; most adverse events seen were mild in severity. The arithmetic mean and the
geometric mean ratio (GMR), along with the 90% confidence interval, of the PK parameters are
presented below.

        Formulation 3 was found to produce human plasma concentrations of each of the three
agents that were equivalent to the plasma concentrations produced by the administration of the
individual agents. Formulation 4 from Example 4 did not produce human plasma concentrations
of each of the three agents that were equivalent to the plasma concentrations produced by the
administration of the individual agents.
        Formulation 3 and Formulation 4 differ in the weight of extragranular excipients and in
the amount of croscarmellose sodium present. The bioequivalent formulation (Formulation 3)
has significantly higher (38%) amounts of extragranular excipients (microcrystalline cellulose
and lactose monohydrate) and croscarmellose sodium in the rilpivirine layer than Formulation 4.
Laboratory data showed that the intrinsic dissolution rate of rilpivirine was increased in the
presence of emtricitabine and/or tenofovir DF suggesting an increased solubility could contribute

 to a higher rilpivirine bioavailability when co-formulated with emtricitabine and tenofovir DF.
 It may be postulated that the higher amounts of diluents in the rilpivirine layer of Formulation 3
 that was bioequivalent to the rilpivirine single agent reference tablet could have served to lessen
 the extent of contact and interactions between rilpivirine and emtricitabine and/or tenofovir DF
 and achieve bioequivalence.
          In addition, the higher amount of croscarmellose sodium, a superdisintegrant, leads to
 faster layer disintegration and separation of the rilpivirine layer from the emtricitabine/tenofovir
 DF layer minimizing any potential interactions between rilpivirine with emtricitabine and/or
tenofovir DF. The concentration of croscarmellose sodium, a basifying excipient, in the
rilpivirine layer also had an unexpected effect on the rilpivirine dissolution rate. Higher
concentrations of this superdisintegrant, unexpectedly decreased the dissolution rate as shown in
Figure 9. This is possibly due to the basifying nature of this excipient.
Example 6.        Stability of Components of Formulation 3 .
         Identity and strengths of the APIs and degradation products were determined using an
HPLC method, which employed a 4.6 x 250-mm C-12 column (4-pm particle size) for
chromatographic separation by reversed-phase chromatography using a mobile phase consisting
of ammon2ium acetate buffer and acetonitrile with gradient elution over approximately
60 minutes. Composite samples of 10 tablets were dissolved and diluted to final concentrations
of approximately 0.08 mg/mL RPV, 0.64 mg/mL FTC, and 0.96 mg/mL TDF with a 4:3:3 pH 3
phosphate buffer:acetonitrile:methanol solution. The strength and degradation product content of
FTC, RPV, and TDF were determined by HPLC using area normalization and external reference
standards at a wavelength of 262 nm. The stability data for 30 count tablets stored at 40*C/75%
RH in induction sealed bottles containing 3 g silica gel desiccant are summarized in the table

  Example 8.      Food Effect
          Formulation 3 was evaluated in a comparative bioavailability study to assess the effect of
  food on the exposure of rilpivirine HCl when dosed in the reference group as three individual
 tablets containing emtricitabine, rilpivirine HCI, and tenofovir DF.
 The "fed" state or "fed conditions" refers to administering the study drugs within 5 minutes of
 completing a standardized meal (breakfast). Subjects were restricted from food consumption for
 approximately 4 hours after dosing. A meal (standardized lunch) was provided to subjects after
 the 4-hour postdose blood draw. All meals and/or snacks were standardized for all subjects and
 were to be similar in calorie and fat content and taken at approximately the same time each day.
 The standardized breakfast on dosing days contained approximately 400 calories (kcal) and
 approximately 13 g of fat.
 The "fasted" state refers to administering the study drugs in the absence of food. Subjects were
 fasted overnight, administered the study drugs, and then restricted from food consumption for
 approximately 4 hours after dosing. A meal (standardized lunch) was provided to subjects after
 the 4-hour postdose blood draw.
 A comparison of the mean values of the pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below along
 with the mean values of the Reference group under fed conditions. The AUC values for
 Formulation 3 under the fasted state are identical to the Reference group under fed conditions.
 The Reference group under the fasted state shows a 26% reduction in the AUC values as
compared to the fed conditions.
