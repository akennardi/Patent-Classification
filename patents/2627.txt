15 Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller having components that enable the
   evaluation of game outcomes by the game controller to be
20 controlled so that the game controller carries out the
   evaluation in different ways depending on whether an
   evaluation change condition is met.
   General construction of gaming system
25
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a standalone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
30
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
35 game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
                                            8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                              - 9
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
 5 operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
10 envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
   the gaming system may operate in standalone gaming machine
15 mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending
   on the game being played, operating conditions, and so on.
   Other variations will be apparent to persons skilled in
   the art.
20 Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
25 the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
30 Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
35 enable a player to input game play instructions            (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
                                             8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                               - 10
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
 5 display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
10 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
15 stored in memory   and generating outputs  (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
20 integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array  (FPGA).
   A gaming system in the form of a standalone gaming machine
   10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine 10
25 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
30 game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
35 card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
                                             8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                              - 11
   value of the ticker.  A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
 5 device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
10 stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module that is accessed in response
   to insertion of the player tracking device.
15 A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
20 beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a
   liquid crystal display.  The display 14 may be any other
25 suitable video display unit, such as an OLED display or
   the visible portion of an electromechanical device.                    The
   top box 26 may also include a display, which may be of the
   same type as the display 14, or of a different type.
30 Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
35 having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
                                             8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                               - 12
   communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
 5 memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
10 communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
15 devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.

   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
25 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
30 screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
35 the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
                                              8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                               - 13
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
 5 communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information,  accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
10 controller, central controller, server or database.                    In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
15 communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                The RAM
20 103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
25 integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
30 gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
35 alternative embodiment.   The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
                                             8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                              - 14
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5 are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
 5 simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
10 One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
15 and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
20 202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
25 and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.      A loyalty
30 program server 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
35 provides only the player interface.  With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
                                            8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                               - 15
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.   In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
 5 that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
10 incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
15 licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.    An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
20 The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
25 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.    For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
30 separate server may be provided.    For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.   Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
35 provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.

                              - 16
   Further detail of gaming system
   The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify
 5 a wager which will be evaluated for this play of the game
   and initiates a play of the game. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that a player's wager can be varied
   from game to game dependent on player selections.
10 In an embodiment, the player may select a number of reels
   to play. Games of this type are marketed under the trade
   name "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd
   and are also known as "ways" to win games. The selection
   of the reel means that each displayed symbol of the reel
15 can be substituted for a symbol at one or more designated
   display positions. In other words, all symbols displayed
   at symbol display positions corresponding to a selected
   reel can be used to form symbol combinations with symbols
   displayed at a designated,  symbol display positions of the
20 other reels. For example, if there are five reels and
   three symbol display positions for each reel such that the
   symbol display positions comprise three rows of five
   symbol display positions, the symbols displayed in the
   centre row are used for non-selected reels. As a result,
25 the total number of ways to win is determined by
   multiplying the number of active display positions of each
   reels, the active display positions being all display
   positions of each selected reel and the designated display
   position of the non-selected reels. As a result for five
30 reels and fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to
   win.
   Embodiments of the present invention relate to the player
   placing a wager which entitles the player to two separate
35 evaluations the symbols selected by the game controller of
   the gaming system. In an embodiment of the invention, the
   player can select a number of reels to play but is only
                                             8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                              - 17
   entitled to evaluation change conditions being met upon
   selecting to play all reels. In another embodiment, there
   may not be an option to select other than to play all the
   reels. In another embodiment, the player is able to make
 5 selections as to how many evaluations the player wishes to
   have conducted and the number of symbols selected for
   display may be dependent on the player's selection.
   In the embodiment described below, the display positions
10 of the symbol display are arranged in a rectangular matrix
   comprising a plurality of columns and a plurality of rows.
   For example, there could be more symbols in some columns
   than others, such as 6-8-6-8-6 arrangement of display
   positions corresponding to respective ones of five reels.
15
   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
   shown implementing a number of modules based on program
   code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that various of the modules could be
20 implemented in some other way, for example by a dedicated
   circuit.
   These modules include the outcome generator 622 which
   operates in response to the player's operation of game
25 play mechanism 56 to place a wager and initiate a play of
   the game and generates a game outcome which will then be
   evaluated by outcome evaluator 623. In this example
   embodiment, the embodiment is described on the basis that
   each wager entitles the player to two evaluations of
30 selected symbols, which is, in effect, an entitlement to
   the concurrent conduct of plays of first and second games.
   It is also described on the basis that the player has
   selected all reels to play. As discussed above, there may
   be variants on such an embodiment including that more than
35 two games are played concurrently by the player.
   In order to form the game outcome, symbol selector 622A
                                            8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                              - 18
   selects symbols from a set of symbols specified by symbol
   data 641 using random number generator 621. The selected
   symbols are advised to the display controller 624 which
   causes them to be displayed on display 54 at a set of
 5 display positions. In one example, shown in Figure 8,
   there are thirty display positions divided into first
   subset 830 and second subset 840. From Figure 8, it will
   be appreciated that the symbols are displayed in five
   columns 801,802,803,804,805.   Each of these columns
10 801,802,803,804,805 corresponds to a respective on of a
   plurality of reel strips 641 stored in memory 64. The reel
   strips 641 specify a sequence of symbols for each reel.
   It will also be apparent from Figure 8 that the symbols
15 are displayed in a plurality of rows
   821,822,823,824,825,826 and that three rows 821,822,823
   correspond to the first subset and three rows 824,825,826
   correspond to the second subset. It will also be apparent
   that each column has a first part (i.e. the part
20 corresponding to rows 821,822,823) corresponding to the
   first subset and a second part (i.e. the part
   corresponding to rows 824,825,826) corresponding to the
   second subset.
25 One example of selecting symbols is for the symbol
   selector 622A to select a stopping position in the
   sequence of the respective reel strip using a value
   obtained from random number generator (RNG) 621. It is
   known to use a probability table stored in memory 64 to
30 vary the odds of a particular stop position being
   selected. Other techniques can be used to control the odds
   of particular outcomes occurring to thereby control the
   return to player of the game.
35 After the symbols are selected, they are evaluated by
   outcome evaluator 623.  Evaluator controller 624 controls
   which evaluation will be conducted.   This enables
                                             8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                              - 19
   different game evaluations to be conducted dependent on
   whether an evaluation condition is met. In one example,
   the evaluation controller 64 has an evaluation change
   condition determiner 624A which determines whether the
 5 evaluation should be changed from a first mode of game
   evaluation where the two subsets 630, 640 are evaluated
   independently to one of a possible number of alternative
   evaluations in accordance with a second mode of
   evaluation.  In the second mode of evaluation, at least
10 part of the second subset of symbols is used in
   conjunction with the first subset of symbols and part of
   the second subset of symbols is evaluated in conjunction
   with part of the first subset as will be described in
   further detail below.  Thus, an advantage of this
15 embodiment of the invention is to provide a gaming system
   that has the ability to implement multiple modes of
   evaluation.
   In one example, the evaluation change condition determiner
20 624A conducts a random trial using RNG 621 to determine,
   independently, for each column of the symbol display
   whether the evaluation change condition is met in respect
   of the respective column.
25 In the first mode of evaluation, the first game evaluation
   is evaluated by evaluating symbols displayed at the first
   subset of symbol display positions 830 and a second game
   evaluation is performed by evaluating the symbols
   displayed at the second subset of symbol display
30 positions.
   In the second mode of evaluation, assuming that an
   evaluation change condition is met in respect of one of
   the columns, the evaluation controller 624 controls the
35 outcome evaluator 623 to perform the first game evaluation
   by evaluating symbols displayed at the first subset of
   symbol display positions in conjunction with the symbols
                                            8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                               - 20
   displayed in the second part of the column in respect of
   which the evaluation change condition is met.          That is,
   the evaluation incorporates the part of the column that
   normally belongs to the second subset of symbol display
 5 positions  (or viewed another way to the second game).                     At
   the same time, the outcome evaluator 623 conducts the
   second game evaluation by evaluating symbols displayed in
   the second subset symbol display positions in conjunction
   with the symbols displayed in the first part of the column
10 in respect of which the evaluation change condition is
   met.
   As indicated above, in certain embodiments, the evaluation
   change condition can be met in respect of multiple
15 columns.  Where an evaluation change condition is met in
   respect of a plurality of columns, the second mode of
   evaluation involves conducting the first game evaluation
   by evaluating symbols displayed at the first subset of
   symbol display positions in conjunction with the symbols
20 displayed in the respective second parts of each column in
   respect of which the evaluation change condition is met.
   Similarly, the second game evaluation is performed by
   evaluating symbols displayed at the second subset of
   symbol display positions in conjunction with the symbols
25 displayed in the respective first part of each column in
   respect of which the evaluation change condition is met.
   The selection of the relevant evaluations 642, is as
   described above, controlled by the evaluation controller
   624.  In the embodiments, each of the evaluations involves
30 determining whether there are any winning outcomes defined
   in pay table 643 amongst the combinations derivable from
   the ways to win.
   After the evaluations are complete, at least one meter,
35 typically the win meter of meters 644 is updated to
   reflect the evaluations.
                                             8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                              - 21
   Referring to Figure 7, there is shown a method 700 of the
   invention.  The method involves the game controller 60
   selecting 710 symbols and displaying 720 the selected
   symbols in first and second subsets of display positions.
 5 At step 730, it is determined whether an evaluation change
   condition is met.  If the evaluation change condition is
   not met, the game controller controls the gaming system so
   that evaluation proceeds under a first mode where a first
   evaluation is conducted 740A based on the first subset of
10 display positions only and the second evaluation 750A is
   conducted based on the second subset only.      If an
   evaluation change condition is met, the method proceeds
   under a second mode of evaluation which involves
   conducting a first evaluation based on a first subset and
15 parts of the second subset in respect of which the
   evaluation change condition has been met.     In the above
   embodiment, this is the use of the other part of the
   column in respect of which the change condition is met.
   The method also involves the game controller conducting
20 750B the second evaluation based on the second subset of
   display position and parts of the first subset in respect
   of which an evaluation change condition is met.             At the
   end of the first and second evaluations, the method
   involves updating760 a meter based on the evaluations.
25
   The symbol evaluation change condition may be the
   occurrence of trigger event. In certain embodiments, the
   trigger event may be, for example, a symbol combination
   occurring in the game, occurrence of a specific symbol in
30 the game, or be based on a random evaluation, etc.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
35 electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
   executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
                                            8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                               - 22
   description certain steps are described as being carried
   out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
   sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
 5 implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
   may need to compute several values and compare those
   values.
10
   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
15  (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
   a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Further different parts of the program code can
   be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
20 appreciate that program code provides a series of
   instructions executable by the processor.
   Examples
25 Figure 8A shows two reel power games with a 5x3 matrix
   stacked on top of each other as follows and all symbols
   pay left to right (also not restricted to this).
   There are 5 barriers displayed in Figure 8A to indicate
30 that an evaluation change condition has not been met.
   First barrier 811 is between first game 830 and second
   game 840 in first reel 801.    Second barrier 812 is in
   second reel 802. Third barrier 813 is in third reel 803.
   Fourth barrier 814 is in fourth reel 804.       Fifth barrier
35 815 is in fifth reel 805.
   Whether an evaluation change condition has been met in the
                                              8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                              - 23
   game in respect of one or more columns is represented in
   Figures 8A and 8B by whether there is a barrier between
   the first game and the second game. Figure 8A illustrated
   the case where no barriers have been broken and both games
 5 830,840 have 243 ways to win. Figure 8A also illustrates
   that in this case neither of the games have any wins.
   If however, if an event had occurred that satisfied the
   evaluation change condition  (as determined by the
10 evaluation change condition determiner 624A) and had
   resulted in second barrier 812 being broken, then all of
   second reel 802 will be shared with both games. Then the
   display controller 626 of game controller 60 controls the
   display look as shown in Figure 8B. That is, the first
15 part of the second column will now additionally be used in
   the evaluation of the second game and the second part of
   the second column will now additionally be used in the
   evaluation of the first game. As a result both games
   830,840 have 486 ways to win. Thus, another effect of an
20 embodiment of the invention is to provide a gaming system
   where the numbers of way to win in a particular play of
   the game vary in dependence on a condition being met in
   respect of the play of the game  (as opposed to a player
   selection of a wager).
25
   Put another way, all the symbols in second reel 802                  (i.e.
   P1, P1, P1, 10, J and J) can be used for both first game
   830 and second game 840. In this example, the first game
   830 still pays nothing, but the second game now has 4 PICl
30 x 36 paid.
   In other examples, more than one barrier may be broken at
   a time. In other examples, there may only be barriers in
   certain of the reels or the player may only be entitled to
35 satisfy the evaluation change condition in respect of
   certain of the reels and hence break the barriers. For
   example, a first wager amount may entitle the player to
                                             8042306_1 (GHMatters) P100198.AU.1 20/03/18

                              - 24
   break a first number of barriers and a second wager amount
   may entitle the player to break a second number of
   barriers.
 5 It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
