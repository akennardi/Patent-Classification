                                        ABSTRACT
The progressive olive de-stoner operates a rotating drum driving eight cam followers
working in tandem to remove the stone from the olive fruit using four blades 8 which
meet the de-stoning mechanism sleeve during the destoning cycle. The feeding
mechanism feeds the fruit into the positioning mechanism and rotates the feeding
mechanism automatically until such time the tubes are empty. The positioning
mechanism uses a pair of contra-rotating discs which are synchronised through gearing
to continuously pass olives into the de-stoning mechanism for stone removal. The
stoning mechanism correctly orientates the olive as it passes between the rotating disks
for de-stoning and fruit removal. The progressive olive de-stoner can be disassembled
by hand for cleaning, maintenance or enhancement, and is designed to process up to
53kg of olives per hour targeting the needs of family and small olive producers to
provide a lower cost alternative to other commercially available de-stoning machines.

                      PROGRESSIVE OLIVE DE-STONER
The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method
of performing it known to me:

                                                1
                            PROGRESSIVE OLIVE DE-STONER
The Progressive Olive De-stoner is a machine for automating the process of olive fruit
stone removal for small olive producers. While several commercial products are
available to perform this task, the size and price of these devices makes them cost
prohibitive. This demonstrates a need for a compact, cost effective mechanical olive
de-stoner aimed at the small producer market.
To improve the flavour and aid in preservation, olives are typically fermented in a brine
solution, this process, known as natural fermentation can take up between five to nine
months depending on conditions. By removing the stone from the olive, natural
fermentation can occur within 10 to 18 days as the brine solution can directly penetrate
the olive flesh. This means the product can be sent to market more rapidly and be
'value added' by filling the olive with a variety of other produce such as anchovies or
blue cheese.
The cost to mechanically pit olives is prohibitive for small producers as the smallest
machines (nominal 460kg olives per hour) available today cost between $8,000 to
$15,000 USD to purchase. The alternative, is to pit the olive by hand, but this can be an
arduous, repetitive and time-consuming task, with 20kg of olives nominally taking one
person between 3 and 5 hours to pit. The Progressive Olive De-stoner is designed to
process up to a nominal 53kg of olives per hour.
This information demonstrates a market need for a small competitively priced
mechanised olive de-stoner to increase productivity of small olive producers both
domestically and abroad.
The Progressive Olive De-stoner in accordance with this invention comprises of a
unique rotational drum mechanism driving four punches which remove the stones from
the fruit. The de-stoned fruit then falls into a container, whilst the stones are captured
and diverted away from the de-stoning mechanism. The fruit is positioned within an
operational mechanism to ensure the stones are punched from the crown to the base
(or the reverse) of the fruit thereby maximising the retained pulp with in the olive.

                                                 2
Fruit is fed into the drum mechanism either by a hopper or individual feed tubes.
The Progressive Olive De-stoner will be constructed of both food grade plastic and 316
stainless steel and has been designed to separate easily for cleaning and maintenance.
The design also delivers the versatility of changing internal components to process
other sizes and types of stone fruit.
The invention may be better understood with reference to the illustrations to the
embodiments of the invention which:
Figure 1: The feeding mechanism is driven by a stepper motor 1 with sensors 2 to
ensure proper orientation. One sensor is employed at the top of the loading chute 3 to
determine when the feeding tube 4 needs to be rotated.
The logic is as follows; if the loading chute is not full, rotate to the next feeding tube, if
loading chute is still not full after one rotation all feeding tubes are registered as empty.
The machine will then finish the remaining olives and shutdown.
Figure 2: The rotating drum 5 design employs eight cam followers 6 working in tandem
to remove the stone from the olive fruit. The cam profiles 7 are cut into the cylinder
which remains stationary while the followers rotate around them, this generates
translational motion in the followers which is used to remove the stone. The followers
consist of the de-stoning blade 8 and a sleeve 9 which intersect at the top of their
respective displacements. The drive gear 10 is located at the base of the rotation drum
5. This arrangement is favoured over single sided actions where reactionary forces
may damage or deform the fruit.
Figures 3 and 4: The positioning mechanism of the design features a pair of contra
rotating discs 11,12 which are synchronised through gearing 13 to continuously pass
olives into the de-stoning mechanism for stone removal.
A guide rail 14 and flexible insert 15 are employed to ensure the correct orientation of
the olive as it passes between the rotating disks, once contact has been made with the
de-stoning blade, the olive is held in place until it is released at the end of the cycle and
removed from the de-stoning disk via the extractor 16. As the mechanism is gravity fed
and the feeding disk in constant motion, the maximum rotational speed of the system
must be constrained. This is to ensure that there is sufficient time for the olive to enter

                                             3
the feeding disk before it passes the loading chute 17 and the removed stones to be
diverted away from the de-stoning mechanism 18.
