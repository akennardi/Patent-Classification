                                            Technical Field
[0001]         This disclosure relates to a respirator device, in particular a respirator device
including a receiver having an elastomeric sleeve configured to deform around a nozzle element.
[0001A]          Incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety, is PCT/US2014/064970

                                              Background
[00021         Respiratory protection devices commonly include a mask body and one or more
filter cartridges that are attached to the mask body. The mask body is worn on a person's face,
over the nose and mouth, and may include portions that cover the head, neck, or other body parts
in some cases. Clean air is made available to a wearer after passing through filter media
disposed in the filter cartridge. In negative pressure respiratory protection devices, air is drawn
through a filter cartridge by a negative pressure generated by a wearer during inhalation. In
powered air devices, a fan or other powered unit may assist in delivering air to a user. Air from
the external environment passes through the filter medium and enters an interior space of the
mask body where it may be inhaled by the wearer.
[0003]         Various techniques have been used to attach filter cartridges or elements to a
respirator. Filter cartridges are commonly connected to an inlet port of a mask body via a
threaded engagement, bayonet engagement, or other engagement, for example. In the case of
dual cartridge respiratory protection devices, in which two cartridges are provided to filter air for
a wearer, the filter cartridges are often connected to air inlets located proximate each cheek
portion of the mask, away from a central portion of the mask, such that the cartridges extend
outward at sides of the wearer's head. Inhalation check valves are commonly provided for each
air inlet, such that air may be delivered from the filter cartridge into the breathing zone through
the air inlet away from a central portion, and proximate each cheek portion of the mask body for
example.

an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common
general knowledge in Australia or any other jurisdiction or that this prior art could reasonably be

                                         Detailed Description
[0015]        The present disclosure provides a respirator device that includes a body including a
receiver and a rigid nozzle element. The receiver includes an elastomeric sleeve defining a
                                                 - 2a -

    WO 2015/073414                                                           PCT/US2014/064970
channel. When the nozzle element is inserted into the channel of the elastomeric sleeve, the
elastomeric sleeve deforms around an outer surface of the nozzle element to form a seal around
the nozzle. A filter cartridge, for example, may thus be easily coupled to the body while
providing a robust seal that prevents ingress of unwanted contaminants and debris.
[00161         Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an exemplary respirator device 100 including a
disengaged filter cartridge 120. Exemplary respirator device 100 may be a half mask respirator
that may be worn by a user to cover the nose and mouth and define an interior air space.
Respirator device 100 includes a body 110, such as a mask body, and one or more filter
cartridges 120 located on opposed sides of body 110. Body 110 includes one or more receivers
140, for example on opposed sides of body 110, configured to receive a portion of filter cartridge
120. Body 110 and filter cartridges 120 may be fluidically coupled such that receivers 140
cooperate with filter cartridges 120 to form an airflow channel between filter cartridges 120 and
body 110. In other exemplary embodiments, body 110 may be a housing or component of a
powered air respirator device, such as a powered air purifying respirator, or a head mounted
respirator device body, and/or receiver may be fluidically coupled with a hose or other air
delivery component.
[00171         Body 110 can include one or more rigid portions 111 and an elastomeric face
contacting portion 112. An exhalation valve 113 may be positioned on body 110 to allow
exhaled air to be purged from an interior air space. Respirator device 100 may also include a
harness assembly (not shown) that is able to support body 110 on a user's head.
[0018]          Filter cartridge 120 may be secured to body 110 and/or receiver 140 by one or
more latches, threads, connectors, or other suitable complementary features known in the art. In
an exemplary embodiment, respirator device 100 includes a cantilever latch 150 that secures
filter cartridge 120 and/or nozzle element 130 to receiver 140. In the embodiment of Figs. 1
through 5, cantilever latch 150 is integral to filter cartridge 120 and is substantially parallel or
co-extending with a nozzle element 130. Receiver 140 or body 110 include an opening 114
and/or mating surface 115 that cooperates with cantilever latch 150 to provide a secure
mechanical connection between body 110 and filter cartridge 120.
[0019]         Cantilever latch 150 includes one or more features to facilitate engagement with
body 110. In an exemplary embodiment, cantilever latch 150 includes an anchoring protrusion
151 and a push button 152 located along a length, or in some embodiments a distal end, of
cantilever latch 150. Anchoring protrusion 151 may be configured to cooperate with mating
surface 115 to assist in securing filter cartridge 120 to body 110. Push button 152 is configured
to detach filter cartridge 120 from body 110. A user can apply force or pressure to push button
                                                   -3-

    WO 2015/073414                                                           PCT/US2014/064970
152 to deflect cantilever latch 150 and detach anchoring protrusion 151 from mating surface 115.
Filter cartridge 120 may then be disengaged or removed from receiver 140.
[0020]         Fig. 2 shows an exemplary filter cartridge 120. Filter cartridge 120 filters ambient
air, for example, before it passes into an interior air space between body 110 and the face of a
user. In an exemplary embodiment, filter cartridge 120 includes a body portion 124 having first
and second major surfaces 121, 122 and a sidewall 123 extending at least partially between first
and second major surfaces 121, 122. One or more of first and second major surfaces 121, 122,
and/or sidewall 123 are fluid permeable to allow air to enter filter cartridge 120. In some
exemplary embodiments, filter cartridge 120 may comprise primarily filter media without an
outer housing or surrounded partially by a housing.
[0021]         Nozzle element 130 extends from a body portion 124 of filter cartridge 120. In an
exemplary embodiment, nozzle element 130 is integral to body portion 124 and extends from
sidewall 123. In some exemplary embodiments, nozzle element 130 is a separate component
that may be releasably or permanently joined to body portion 124. In various exemplary
embodiments, nozzle element 130 may extend from first or second major surfaces 121, 122.
[0022]         In an exemplary embodiment, nozzle element 130 includes a leading end 131, a
base end 132, an outer surface 133 and an inner surface 134 opposite outer surface 133. Inner
surface 134 defines an airflow channel 135. At any particular location between base end 132
and leading end 131, outer surface 133 has a cross-sectional area (A) bounded by a perimeter
(P). In some exemplary embodiments, the shape of nozzle element 130 does not vary between
base end 132 and leading end 131 such that perimeter (P) and cross-sectional area (A) are
substantially uniform over a length of nozzle element 130. Alternatively, the shape of nozzle
element 130 may vary such that, for example, leading end 131 exhibits a smaller perimeter (P)
and/or cross-sectional area (A) as compared to a location nearer base end 132. A nozzle element
130 having a slightly smaller leading end 131 may facilitate insertion of nozzle element into
receiver 140, as described herein.
[0023]         Figs. 3 and 4 show an exemplary receiver 140 including a rigid outer portion 141
and an elastomeric sleeve 170. Receiver 140 is configured to engage with filter cartridge 120
such that nozzle element 130 is able to slide into a channel 147 defined by rigid outer portion
141 and elastomeric sleeve 170. In an exemplary embodiment, rigid outer portion 141 may
provide primary structural support and stability between body 110 and filter cartridge 120 and
elastomeric sleeve 170 provides a seal around nozzle element 130 to prevent ingress of unwanted
contaminants or debris from an external environment.

    WO 2015/073414                                                           PCT/US2014/064970
[00241        Elastomeric sleeve 170 includes a first end portion 171, a second end portion 172,
an outer surface 173 and an inner surface 174 in part defining channel 147, and a longitudinal
length (1) (Fig. 5) in the direction of channel 147 between first end portion 171 and second end
portion 172 . At any particular location along length (1), inner surface 174 defines a cross
sectional area (a) of channel 147 and outer surface 173 defines an outer perimeter (p). In some
exemplary embodiments, the shape of elastomeric sleeve 170 does not vary over length (1) such
that perimeter (p) and/or cross-sectional area (a) are substantially uniform at any particular
location. Alternatively, the shape of elastomeric sleeve 170 may vary over length (1) such that,
for example, first end portion exhibits a smaller perimeter (p) and/or cross-sectional area (a) as
compared to a location nearer second end portion 172. In an exemplary embodiment, nozzle
element 130 is relatively larger than elastomeric sleeve 170 such that an interference occurs
when nozzle element 130 is inserted into elastomeric sleeve 170. An elastomeric sleeve 170
having a slightly smaller leading end 131, for example, may facilitate sealing between inner
surface 174 and nozzle element 130, as described further herein.
[00251        Elastomeric sleeve 170 includes at least a portion that is floating or otherwise not in
direct contact with a rigid component that constrains outward elastic deformation or expansion.
For example, at least a portion of outer surface 173 is not in direct contact with a rigid
component that constrains outward elastic deformation or expansion. In an exemplary
embodiment, first end portion 171 is a floating end and is not engaged with a rigid component of
body 110. Elastomeric sleeve 170 further includes an intermediate portion 177 that is not backed
by a rigid component that could constrain outward elastic deformation or expansion. An
elastomeric sleeve including at least a portion not backed by a rigid component allows
elastomeric sleeve to flex and/or articulate. Elastomeric sleeve 170 may thus track or follow
movement of nozzle element 130 such that a robust seal may be maintained despite possible
relative motion between body 110 and filter cartridge 120.
[0026]        In an exemplary embodiment, elastomeric sleeve 170 includes sections of varying
wall thickness and/or having a contoured shape such that elastomeric sleeve 170 includes one or
more of a rib 175. Rib 175 may be located at a position of inner surface 174 configured to
contact outer surface 133 of nozzle element 130. Rib 175 may facilitate continuous contact with
outer surface 133 to provide a desired seal. In an exemplary embodiment, the greatest
interference between nozzle element 130 and elastomeric sleeve 170 may be concentrated at the
location of rib 175. Providing a limited area of interference may reduce the force a user must
exert to engage filter cartridge 120 with body 110 while ensuring a consistent seal.
                                                  -5-

    WO 2015/073414                                                           PCT/US2014/064970
[00271        Fig. 5 shows exemplary nozzle element 130 engaged with receiver 140 such that
nozzle element 130 is positioned in a channel defined by receiver 140. Elastomeric sleeve 170 is
able to conform to outer surface 133 of nozzle element 130 when filter cartridge 120 is inserted
into receiver 140. In an exemplary embodiment, insertion of a relatively larger nozzle element
130 into a relatively smaller elastomeric sleeve 170 causes elastomeric sleeve 170 to deform,
such as by expanding for example, around outer surface 133 of nozzle element 130. In an
exemplary embodiment, elastomeric sleeve expands such that perimeter (p) of outer surface 173
(Fig. 4) and/or cross-sectional area (a) defined by inner surface 174 are larger when nozzle
element 130 is positioned in elastomeric sleeve 170 as compared to when nozzle element 130 is
not positioned in elastomeric sleeve 170.
[0028]        Elastic deformation or expansion of elastomeric sleeve 170 around nozzle element
130 results in a restoring force acting to restore elastomeric sleeve to its neutral state. Such a
force causes elastomeric sleeve 170 to clamp around outer surface 133 of nozzle element 130
and promote continuous contact between elastomeric sleeve 170 and outer surface 133.
[0029]        In an exemplary embodiment, elastic deformation or expansion of elastomeric
sleeve 170 in a configuration in which at least a portion of elastomeric sleeve 170 is out of
contact with a rigid component of body 110 results in a tension around elastomeric sleeve 170,
as opposed to compression that may occur if elastomeric sleeve were compressed between
nozzle element 130 and a rigid component of body 110, for example. In an exemplary
embodiment, elastomeric sleeve 170 exhibits a hoop tension when nozzle element 130 is
engaged with receiver 140. In some exemplary embodiments, elastomeric sleeve 170 can be
described as having a portion in tension in a direction (z) perpendicular to both an airflow axis
(x) and radial thickness (y) of elastomeric sleeve 170.
[0030]        Elastomeric sleeve 170 is sealingly engaged, directly or indirectly, with a feature of
receiver 140 when filter cartridge 120 is engaged with body 110. In an exemplary embodiment,
elastomeric sleeve includes a sealing surface 176 that contacts an internal surface or flange 144
of receiver 140. Alternatively or in addition, one or more connectors 145 may sealingly join
receiver 140 and elastomeric sleeve. In an exemplary embodiment, sealing surface 176 and
connector 145 are positioned adjacent flange 144 such that sealing engagement is promoted by
insertion of nozzle element 130 into channel 147. In an exemplary embodiment, elastomeric
sleeve 170 and/or connector 145 are permanently joined to body 110. In other exemplary
embodiments, elastomeric sleeve 170 and/or connector 145 may be removed and replaced.
[0031]        Elastomeric sleeve 170 may be made of any suitable material that may repeatedly
elastically deform around a filter cartridge. In an exemplary embodiment, elastomeric sleeve
                                                  -6-

    WO 2015/073414                                                           PCT/US2014/064970
170 is made from a thermoset silicone material such as ELASTOSIL 3003 / 60A available from
Wacker Chemical Corp. of Adrian, MI. Other suitable materials include thermoplastic
vulcanates (TPV), thermoplastic elastomers (TPE), moldable rubbers, urethanes, moldable
elastomers, combinations thereof, and other suitable materials as known in the art.
[0032]         Elastomeric sleeve has a length sufficient to allow a consistent seal around nozzle
element 130 while allowing for adequate dimensional tolerance and relative motion between
filter cartridge 120 and body 110. In an exemplary embodiment, elastomeric sleeve 170 has a
length (1) in a longitudinal direction of channel 147 that is significantly greater than a wall
thickness (t) of elastomeric sleeve 170. In various exemplary embodiments, elastomeric sleeve
170 has a length (1) between 6 mm and 14 mm, 8 mm and 12 mm, or of about 10 mm, and wall
thickness (t) is between 0.5 mm and 2 mm, 0.75 mm and 1.5 mm, or of about 1.0 mm. In some
exemplary embodiments, wall thickness (t) is substantially uniform over length (1) and in other
exemplary embodiments wall thickness (t) varies over length (1).
[00331         The shape, positioning, and configuration of nozzle element 130 and receiver 140
may be selected to allow filter cartridge 120 to reside close to the face or head of a wearer and to
exhibit little or no motion relative to body 110. In an exemplary embodiment, outer surface 133
of nozzle element 130 and rigid outer portion of receiver 140 may exhibit a non-circular shape
that prevents rotation between the components. In various embodiments, nozzle element 130
exhibits an elongated oval shape, elliptical shape, irregular shape, circular shape or other suitable
shape. An elongated oval shape, for example prevents rotation and facilitates expansion of
elastomeric sleeve 170 around nozzle element 130 such that a continuous seal is provided.
Nozzle element 130 extends a sufficient distance into receiver 140. Complementary shapes of
nozzle element 130 and receiver 140 provide a stable connection and prevent inadvertent
disengagement. Sufficient engagement between nozzle element 130 and receiver 140 minimizes
relative motion and provides a perception of a robust connection between filter cartridge 120 and
body 110.
[0034]         Filter cartridge 120 and receiver 140 may provide additional features to minimize
relative movement between filter cartridge 120 and receiver 140 when engaged. Filter cartridge
120 and receiver 140 may include one or more alignment features, such as protrusions, channels,
or other suitable alignment features as known in the art that cooperate to align nozzle element
130 and receiver 140. In an exemplary embodiment, a first alignment feature 138 in the form of
a protrusion and a second alignment feature 148 in the form of a channel, slot, or groove, for
example, cooperate during engagement of nozzle element 130 and receiver 140. First and

second alignment features 138, 139 may assist in aligning nozzle element 130 and receiver 140
during insertion, and securing the components to prevent relative motion when engaged.
[00351        Nozzle element 130 may include one or more ribs 137 extending outwardly from
outer surface 133. In an exemplary embodiment, ribs 137 may be dimensioned to cooperate with
rigid outer portion 141 of receiver 140 to provide a close fit between nozzle element and receiver
140. Ribs 137 may facilitate secure mechanical engagement between nozzle element 130 and
receiver 140 without an interference fit over an extended area and thus may limit force exerted
by a user when engaging nozzle element 130 to body 110.
[0036]        Fig. 6 shows a partial cross-sectional view of another exemplary respiratory device
600. Exemplary respiratory device 600 includes features similar to the features of respirator
device 100 described above, and having an elastomeric sleeve 670 including a first end 671 that
engages a component of body 610.
[00371        In an exemplary embodiment, elastomeric sleeve 670 includes a first end portion
671, a second end portion 672, an outer surface 673 and an inner surface 674 in part defining
channel 647. A first end portion 671 engages a component of body 110. In an exemplary
embodiment, outer surface 673 contacts, directly or indirectly, one or more interior walls, for
example, that divide a first chamber 616 from a second chamber 617 within the interior space
defined by body 610.
[0038]        Elastomeric sleeve 670 includes at least a portion that is floating or otherwise not in
direct contact with a rigid component that constrains outward elastic deformation or expansion.
In an exemplary embodiment, elastomeric sleeve 670 includes an intermediate portion 677 that is
not backed by a rigid component that could constrain outward elastic deformation or expansion.
A space 678 is present adjacent outer surface 673 proximate intermediate portion 677. An
elastomeric sleeve 670 including at least a portion not backed by a rigid component allows
elastomeric sleeve to flex and/or articulate. Elastomeric sleeve 670 may thus track or follow
movement of nozzle element 630 such that a robust seal may be maintained despite possible
relative motion between body 610 and filter cartridge 620.
[00391        Elastomeric sleeve 670 is able to conform to outer surface 633 of nozzle element
630 when filter cartridge 620 is inserted into receiver 640. In an exemplary embodiment,
insertion of a relatively larger nozzle element 630 into a relatively smaller elastomeric sleeve
670 causes elastomeric sleeve 670 to elastically deform or expand around outer surface 633 of
nozzle element 630. In an exemplary embodiment, elastomeric sleeve expands such that a
perimeter (p) of outer surface 673 at intermediate portion 670 and/or cross-sectional area (a)

    WO 2015/073414                                                            PCT/US2014/064970
defined by inner surface 674 are larger when nozzle element 130 is positioned in elastomeric
sleeve 670 as compared to when nozzle element 630 is not positioned in elastomeric sleeve 670.
[0040]        Elastic deformation or expansion of elastomeric sleeve 670 around nozzle element
630 results in a restoring force acting to restore elastomeric sleeve to its neutral state. Such a
force causes elastomeric sleeve 670 to clamp around outer surface 633 of nozzle element 630
and promote continuous contact between elastomeric sleeve 670 and outer surface 633.
[0041]        In an exemplary embodiment, expansion of elastomeric sleeve 670 with at least a
portion of elastomeric sleeve 670 out of contact with a rigid component of body 610 results in a
tension around elastomeric sleeve 670, as opposed to compression that may occur if elastomeric
sleeve were compressed between nozzle element 630 and a rigid component of body 610, for
example. In an exemplary embodiment, elastomeric sleeve 670 exhibits a hoop tension when
nozzle element 630 is engaged with receiver 640. In some exemplary embodiments, elastomeric
sleeve 670 can be described as having a portion in tension in a direction (z) perpendicular to both
an airflow axis (x) and radial thickness (y) of elastomeric sleeve 670.
[0042]        A respirator device having an elastomeric sleeve as disclosed herein provides
several features and advantages. An elastomeric sleeve including at least a portion that is
floating or otherwise not in direct contact with a rigid component that constrains outward
expansion provides significant advantages in creating a seat between a nozzle element and body
of a respiratory protection device. Elastomeric sleeve may flex and articulate and thus maintain
sealing contact with a nozzle element even if the nozzle element moves or articulates relative to
the receiver. Further, an elastomeric sleeve as disclosed herein provides an adequate seal while
minimizing insertion force required by a user. A filter cartridge may be easily inserted into a
receiver to create a secure connection without rotation. The force exerted by a user during
insertion to cause elastomeric sleeve to expand around a nozzle element may be minimal as
compared to a force required if a seal were formed by compressing a sealing element against a
rigid backing component, for example.
