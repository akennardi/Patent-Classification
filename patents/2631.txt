   TECHNICAL FIELD
   [0001]          Embodiments of the present invention relate to gas delivery device for use in a
   gas delivery system for administering therapy gas and methods of administering therapy gas.
 5 BACKGROUND
   [0002]           Certain medical treatments include the use of gases that are inhaled by the
   patient.   Gas delivery devices are often utilized by hospitals to deliver the necessary gas to
   patients in need. It is important when administering gas therapy to these patients to verify the
   correct type of gas and the correct concentration are being used. It is also important to verify
10 dosage information and administration.
   [0003]          Known gas delivery devices may include a computerized system for tracking
   patient information, including information regarding the type of gas therapy, concentration of
   gas to be administered and dosage information for a particular patient.             However, these
   computerized systems often do not communicate with other components of gas delivery
15 devices, for example, the valve that controls the flow of the gas to the computerized system
   and/or ventilator for administration to the patient. In addition, in known systems, the amount
   of gas utilized by a single patient is often difficult or impossible to discern, leading to possible
   overbilling for usage.
   [0004]          There is a need for a gas delivery device that integrates a computerized system
20 to ensure that patient information contained within the computerized system matches the gas
   that is to be delivered by the gas delivery device. There is also a need for such an integrated
   device that does not rely on repeated manual set-ups or connections and which can also track
   individual patient usage accurately and simply.
   SUMMARY
25 [00051          Aspects of the present invention pertain to a gas delivery device that may be
   utilized with a gas delivery system and methods for administering therapy gas to a patient.
   One or more embodiments of the gas delivery devices described herein may include a valve
   and a circuit with a valve memory in communication with a valve processor and a valve
   transceiver.    One or more embodiments of the gas delivery systems described herein
30 incorporate the gas delivery devices described herein with a control module including a control

                                                     2
   processing unit (CPU) in communication with a CPU memory and CPU transceiver. As will
   be described herein, the valve transceiver and the CPU transceiver may be in communication
   such that information or data from the valve memory and the CPU memory may be
   communicated to one another. The information communicated between the valve memory and
 5 the CPU memory may be utilized for selecting a therapy for delivery to a patient and
   controlling delivery of the selected therapy to the patient. The gas delivery devices and systems
   described herein may be utilized with medical devices such as ventilators and the like to
   delivery gas to a patient.
   [00061          A first aspect of the present invention pertains to a gas delivery device. In one
10 or more embodiments, the gas delivery device administers therapy gas from a gas source under
   the control of a control module. In one variant, the gas delivery device may include a valve
   attachable to the gas source and a circuit. The valve may include an inlet and an outlet in fluid
   communication and a valve actuator to open and close the valve to allow the gas to flow
   through the valve to a control module. The circuit of one or more embodiments includes a
15 memory, a processor and a transceiver in communication with the memory to send wireless
   optical line-of-sight signals to communicate information stored or retained within the memory
   to the control module that controls gas delivery to a subject.        In one or more alternative
   embodiments, the signals to communicate information stored or retained within the memory to
   the control module that controls gas delivery to a subject may be communicated via a wire.
20 Examples of such wired signals may incorporate or utilize an optical cable, wired pair and/or
   coaxial cable. The circuit may include a memory to store gas data, which may include one or
   more of gas identification, gas expiration date and gas concentration.       The transceiver may
   communicate to send the gas data to the control module via wireless optical line-of-sight
   signals.
25 [00071          In one or more embodiments, the valve may include a data input in
   communication with said memory, to permit a user to enter the gas data into the memory.
   The gas data may be provided in a bar code that may be disposed on the gas source. In such
   embodiments, the gas data may be entered into the data input of the valve for storage in the
   memory by a user-operated scanning device in communication with the data input.
30 Specifically, the user may scan the bar code to communicate the gas data stored therein to the
   valve memory via the data input.

                                                    3
   [00081          In one or more embodiments, the valve may include a power source. In such
   embodiments, the power source may include a battery or other portable power source. In one
   or more embodiments, the valve transceiver may periodically send the wireless optical line-of
   sight signals to the control module, wherein the signals are interrupted by a duration of time at
 5 which no signal is sent. In one or more specific embodiments, the duration of time at which no
   signal is sent comprises about 10 seconds.
   [0009]          A second aspect of the present invention pertains to a gas delivery device, as
   described herein, and a control module in fluid communication with the outlet of the valve of
   the gas delivery device and with a gas delivery mechanism, such as a ventilator. In one or
10 more embodiments, the control module may include a CPU transceiver to receive line-of-sight
   signals from the transceiver and a CPU in communication with the CPU transceiver. The CPU
   carries out the instructions of a computer program or algorithm. As used herein the phrase
   "wireless optical line-of-sight signal" includes infrared signal and other signals that require a
   transmitter and receiver or two transceivers to be in aligned such that the signal may be
15 transmitted in a straight line. The CPU may include a CPU memory that stores the gas data
   that is communicated by the valve transceiver of the gas delivery device to the CPU
   transceiver.
   [0010]          In one or more embodiments, the gas delivery system may incorporate a valve
   with a timer including a calendar timer and an event timer for determining or marking the date
20 and time that the valve is opened and closed and the duration of time the valve is opened.. In
   such embodiments, the valve memory stores the date and time of opening and closing of the
   valve and the duration of time that the valve is open and the valve transceiver communicates
   the date and time of opening and closing of the valve to the CPU transceiver for storage in the
   CPU memory.
25 [00111          In one or more variants, the gas delivery system may incorporate a control
   module that further includes an input means to enter patient information into the CPU memory.
   The control module may also have a real time clock built into the CPU module such that the
   control module knows what the current time and date is and can compare that to the expiration
   date stored in the gas delivery device. If the expiration date is passed the current date then the
30 control module can cause an alarm and not deliver drug to the patient. When the term "patient
   information" is used, it is meant to include both patient information entered by the user and
   information that is set during manufacturing, such as the gas identification and the gas

                                                      4
   concentration that the control module is setup to deliver. The control module may also include
   a display. In one or more embodiments, the display incorporates an input means for entering
   patient information into the CPU memory.          In one or more embodiments, the CPU of the
   control module compares the patient information entered into the CPU memory via the input
 5 means and the gas data from the transceiver. The CPU or control module may include
   comprises an alarm that is triggered when the patient information entered into the CPU
   memory and the gas data from the transceiver do not match or conflict. As used herein the
   phrase "do not match," includes the phrase "are not identical," "are not substantially identical,"
   "do conflict" and/or "do substantially conflict." The CPU determines whether the patient
10 information and additional data, or other data set matches by performing a matching algorithm
   which includes criteria for establishing whether one set of data (i.e. patient information) and
   another set of data match. The algorithm may be configured to determine a match where every
   parameter of the data sets match or selected parameters of the data sets match. The algorithm
   may be configured to include a margin of error. For example, where the patient information
15 require a gas concentration of 800 ppm, and the additional data includes a gas concentration of
   805 ppm, the algorithm may be configured to include a margin of error of ± 5ppm such it
   determines that the patient information and the additional data match. It will be understood
   that determining whether the patient information and additional data match will vary
   depending on the circumstances, such as variables in measuring gas concentration due to
20 temperature and pressure considerations.
   [0012]          A third aspect of the present invention pertains to a control module memory
   comprising instructions that cause a control module processor to receive gas data from a valve
   via a wireless optical line-of-sight signal. The valve may be connected to a gas source and
   may include a memory for storing the gas data. The control module memory may include
25 instructions that cause the control module processor to compare the gas data with user-inputted
   patient information. The user-inputted patient information may be stored within the control
   module memory. Gas data may be selected from one or more of gas identification, gas
   expiration date and gas concentration.        In one or more embodiments, the control module
   memory may include instructions to cause the control module processor to coordinate delivery
30 of therapy to the patient with a medical device, such as a ventilator and the like for delivering
   gas to a patient, via the wireless optical line-of-sight signal. The control module memory may
   also include instructions to cause the control module processor to select a therapy for delivery

                                                    5
   to a patient based on the received patient information and control delivery of the selected
   therapy to the patient.
   [0013]          In one or more embodiments, the memory may include instructions to cause the
   processor to detect the presence of more than one valve and whether more than one valve is
 5 open at the same time. In accordance with one or more specific embodiments, the memory
   includes instructions to cause the processor to receive a first valve status selected from a first
   open position and a first closed position from a first valve via a first wireless optical line-of
   sight signal with the first valve connected to a first gas source, receive a second valve status
   selected from a second open position and a second closed position from a second valve via a
10 second wireless optical line-of-sight signal with the second valve connected to a second gas
   source, compare the first valve status and the second valve status, and emit an alarm if the first
   valve status comprises the first open position and the second valve status comprises the second
   open position. In one or more alternative embodiments, the first valve status and the second
   valve status may be communicated to the processor via a single wireless optical line-of-sight
15 signal, instead of separate wireless optical line-of-sight        signals. In a more specific
   embodiment, the memory of one or more embodiments may include instructions to cause the
   processor to terminate delivery of therapy if the first valve status comprises the first open
   position and the second valve status comprises the second open position.
   [0014]          In one or more embodiments, the memory may include instructions to cause the
20 processor to emit an alarm when a desired dose has been delivered through a valve. In such
   embodiments, the processor may include a memory to store the desired dose or dosage
   information.     In such embodiments, the memory may include instructions to cause the
   processor to receive gas delivery information or information regarding the amount of gas
   delivered and compare the gas delivery information to the dosage information and emit an
25 alarm when the gas delivery information and the dosage information match. As used herein,
   the term "dosage information" may be expressed in units of parts per million (ppm), milligrams
   of the drug per kilograms of the patient (mg/kg), millimeters per breath, and other units known
   for measuring and administering a dose. In one or more embodiments, the dosage information
   may include various dosage regimes which may include administering a standard or constant
30 concentration of gas to the patient, administering a gas using a pulsed method. Such pulsing
   methods includes a method of administering a therapy gas to a patient during an inspiratory

                                                     6
   cycle of the patient, where the gas is administered over a single breath or over a plurality of
   breaths and is delivery independent of the respiratory pattern of the patient.
   [0015]          A fourth aspect of the present invention pertains to a method for administering a
   therapy gas to a patient.     In one or more embodiments, the method includes establishing
 5 communication between the patient and a gas delivery device via a transceiver, wherein the gas
   delivery device comprises a first memory including gas data, comparing the gas data with
   patient information stored within a second memory. The second memory may be included
   within a control module in communication with the gas delivery device. After comparing the
   gas data and the patient information, the method may further include coordinating delivery of
10 therapy to a patient with the gas delivery device via a wireless optical line-of-sight signal,
   selecting a therapy for delivery to the patient based on the comparison of the gas data and the
   patient information and controlling delivery of the selected therapy to the patient. In one or
   more specific embodiments, the method may include entering the gas data into the first
   memory of the gas delivery device and/or entering the patient information into the second
15 memory. In embodiments in which the method includes entering the patient information into
   the second memory, the control module may include input means by which patient information
   may be entered into the second memory. In one or more variants, the method includes ceasing
   delivery of the selected therapy to the patient based on the comparison of the gas data and the
   patient information. The method may include emitting an alert based on the comparison of the
20 gas data and the patient information.

   [0033]           Figure 3 illustrates a disassembled view of the valve assembly 100 and
   illustrates an actuator 114 is disposed on the valve 107 and is rotatable around the valve 107
20 for opening and closing the valve 107. The actuator 114 includes a cap 112 mounted thereto.
   As shown in Figure 3, the circuit 150 may include a data input 108 disposed on the actuator
   114. The data input 108 may be disposed at other locations on the valve 107. In one or more
   variants, the data input may include a port such as a USB port, a receiver for receiving
   electronic signals from a transmitted or other known input means known in the art for entering
25 information or data into a memory.
   [0034]           Figure 4 illustrates a block diagram of the circuit 150. The circuit 150 shown in
   Figure 4 includes a valve processor 122, a valve memory 134, a reset 128, a valve transceiver
   120 and a power source 130. The circuit 150 may also include support circuits a timer 124, a
   sensor 126 and/or other sensors. Referring to Figure 3, the circuit 150 is supported within the
30 valve assembly 100, with the physical components of the circuit 150 specifically disposed
   between actuator 114 and the cap 112. As shown in Figure 3, the valve display 132 and the
   valve transceiver 120 are disposed adjacent to the cap 112, such that the valve display 132 is

                                                    9
   visible through a window 113.        The sensor 126 and the valve processor 122 are disposed
   beneath the valve display 132 and the valve transceiver 120, within the actuator 114.
   [00351          The valve processor 122 may be one of any form of computer processor that can
   be used in an industrial setting for controlling various actions and sub-processors. The valve
 5 memory 134, or computer-readable medium, may be one or more of readily available memory
   such as electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM),              random access
   memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), floppy disk, hard disk, or any other form of digital
   storage, local or remote, and is typically coupled to the valve processor 122. The support
   circuits may be coupled to the valve processor 122 for supporting the circuit 150 in a
10 conventional manner. These circuits include cache, power supplies, clock circuits, input/output
   circuitry, subsystems, and the like.
   [0036]          In the embodiment shown, the valve memory 134 communicates with a data
   input 108 disposed on the side of the actuator 114. The data input 108 shown in Figures 3-4 is
   used to transfer data from the valve memory 134 to other devices or to input data into the valve
15 memory 134. For example, gas data, which includes information regarding the gas contained
   within the gas source, may be entered into the valve memory 134 via the data input 108. In one
   or more alternative embodiments, the gas data may be programmed or directly entered into the
   valve memory 134 by the gas supplier. In one or more embodiments, the gas data may be
   provided in the form of a bar code 610 that is disposed on a label 600 that is affixed on a to the
20 side of the gas source, as shown in Figure 5. The bar code 610 may be disposed directly on the
   gas source. An external scanning device in communication with the electronic data input 108
   may be provided and may be used to scan the bar code 610 and convey the information from
   the bar code 610 to the valve memory 134. Gas data may include information regarding the
   gas composition (e.g., NO, 02, NO 2, CO, etc.), concentration, expiration date, batch and lot
25 number, date of manufacturing and other information. Gas data may be configured to include
   one or more types of information. The valve processor 122 may include instructions to convey
   all or a pre-determined portion of the gas data via the valve transceiver 120 to another
   transceiver.
   [00371          In embodiments that utilize a timer 124, the timer 124 may include two sub
30 timers, one of which is a calendar timer and the other of which is an event timer. The reset 128
   may be located inside the actuator 114 and may be depressed to reset the event timer. The cap
    112 also includes a window 113 that allows the user to see the valve display 132 disposed

                                                    10
   within the cap 112 that displays information regarding whether the actuator 114 is opened or
   closed and the duration the valve 107 was opened or closed. In one or more embodiments, the
   valve display 132 may alternate flashing of two different numbers, a first number may be
   accumulated open time, and the second number may be the time at which the valve 107 was
 5 opened for the current event. The time at which the valve 107 was opened for a current event
   may be preceded by other indicators.
   [00381          The sensor 126 disposed within the actuator 114 may include a proximity
   switch model MK20-B-100-W manufactured by Meder Inc. The sensor 126 utilized in one or
   more embodiments may cooperate with a magnet (not shown) to sense whether the actuator
10  114 is turned on or turned off. Such sensors are described in U.S. Patent No. 7,114,510, which
   is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
   [00391          For example, the sensor 126 and a corresponding magnet (not shown) may be
   disposed on a stationary portion of the valve 107.     When the actuator 114 is rotated to the
   closed position, the sensor 126 is adjacent to the magnet that is in a fixed position on the valve
15  107. When the sensor 126 is adjacent to the magnet, it sends no signal to the valve processor
    122, thereby indicating that the actuator 114 is in the "closed" position or has a valve status
   that includes an open position or a closed position. When the actuator 114 is rotated to open the
   valve 107, the sensor 126 senses that it has been moved away from the magnet and sends a
   signal to the valve processor 122, indicating an "open" position. The valve processor 122
20 instructs the valve memory 134 to record the event of opening the valve 107 and to record the
   time and date of the event as indicated by the calendar timer.          The valve processor 122
   instructs the valve memory 134 to continue checking the position of the valve 107 as long as
   the valve 107 is open. When the valve 107 is closed, the valve processor 122 uses the logged
   open and close times to calculate the amount of time the valve 107 was open and instructs the
25 valve memory 134 to record that duration and the accumulated open time duration. Thus, every
   time the valve 107 is opened, the time and date of the event is recorded, the closing time and
   date is recorded, the duration of time during which the valve 107 is open is calculated and
   recorded, and the accumulated open time is calculated and recorded.
   [0040]          In one or more embodiments in which the power source 130 includes a battery,
30 the valve transceiver 120 may be configured to communicate with the CPU transceiver 220 to
   preserve the life of the battery. In this embodiment the valve transceiver 120 is only turned on
   to receive a signal from the Control Module CPU transceiver 220 for 20msec every second.

                                                     11
   The control module CPU transceiver 220 sends out a short transmit signal continuously and if
   the valve transceiver 120 is present it responds in the 20msec interval. This conserves battery
   power as the valve transceiver 120 is only powered on for 20 msec every second. When the
   valve transceiver 120 responds it includes in its signal information regarding whether the
 5 communication from the control module CPU transceiver 220 was early or late within this
   20msec window. This ensures that once communications                 has been established     it is
   synchronized with the 20msec window that the valve transceiver 120 is powered on and able to
   receive communications. For example, as shown in Figure 6, the valve transceiver 120 sends a
   wireless optical line-of-sight signal during a pre-determined interval in response to a signal
10 from the control module CPU transceiver 220. The wireless optical line-of-sight signals sent
   by the valve transceiver 120 are a series of on off cycles where the transmitter is either
   transmitting light or is not and these correspond to digital binary signals. The mechanism by
   which the valve transceiver sends a wireless optical line-of-sight signal may be construed as a
   series of digital on off signals that correspond to data being transmitted. Once communications
15 has been established between the control module CPU transceiver 220 and the valve
   transceiver 120, the interval between communication signals may be in the range from about
   20 seconds to about 5 seconds. In one or more specific embodiments, the interval or duration
   between transceiver signals may be about 10 seconds.
   [0041]           As will be described in more detail below, the control module 200 includes a
20 CPU 210 which is connected to a CPU transceiver 220 which can send and receive wireless
   optical line-of-sight signals.    The CPU transceiver 220 sends out a signal and waits for a
   response from the valve transceiver 120 when communication or more specifically, line-of
   sight communication is established between the CPU transceiver 220 and the valve transceiver
    120.   If no response is sent by the valve transceiver 120, the CPU transceiver 220 sends
25 another signal after a period of time.      This configuration preserves battery life because the
   valve transceiver 120 does not continuously send a signal unless requested to by the CPU 210.
   This is important as the gas delivery device and gas source spends most of its time in shipping
   and storage prior to being placed on the gas delivery system, if it was transmitting all this time
   trying to establish communications with the control module it would be consuming the battery
30 life significantly.
   [0042]           The valve processor 122 may include link maintenance instructions to
   determine whether the interval should be increased or decreased. As shown in Figure 6, when

                                                    12
   a valid link is established between the valve transceiver 120 and CPU transceiver 121, the
   valve processor 122 executes the link maintenance instructions to increase the interval or
   decrease the interval.
   [0043]           As shown more clearly in Figure 1, valve assembly 100 and gas source 50 is in
 5 communication with a control module 200, which is in communication with a gas delivery
   mechanism. The gas delivery mechanism shown in Figure 1 includes a ventilator 400 with
   associated breathing circuit 410. The control module 200 may include a CPU 210and a CPU
   transceiver 220 in communication with the circuit 150 via the valve transceiver 120.        The
   control module 200 also includes a CPU memory 212 in communication with the CPU
10 transceiver 220 to store patient information, information or data received from the valve
   transceiver 120 and other information. The control module 200 may also include support
   circuits. The CPU 210 may be one of any form of computer processor that can be used in an
   industrial setting for controlling various actions and sub-processors. The CPU memory 212, or
   computer-readable medium, may be one or more of readily available memory such as random
15 access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), floppy disk, hard disk, or any other form of
   digital storage, local or remote, and is typically coupled to the CPU 210. The support circuits
   may be coupled to the CPU 210 for supporting the control module 200 in a conventional
   manner. These circuits include cache, power supplies, clock circuits, input/output circuitry,
   subsystems, and the like. The CPU 210 may also include a speaker 214 for emitting alarms.
20 Alternatively, alarms may also be displayed visually on a display. As shown in Figure 1, the
   control module 200 may also include a regulator 110 and, optionally, pressure gauges and flow
   meters for determining and/or controlling the gas flow from the gas source 50.
   [0044]           In one or more embodiments, the CPU transceiver 220 is disposed on a cover
   portion 225 (shown more clearly in Figure 7), that is part of a cart 500 (show more clearly in
25 Figure 7) onto which the control module 200 is disposed.        The cover portion 225 in one or
   more embodiments is in communication with the control module 200.               Communication
   between the cover portion 225 and the control module 200 may be established wirelessly or via
   a cable. As will be discussed in greater detail below, the valve assembly 100, including the
   valve 107, the circuit 150 and a gas source 50 attached to the valve 107, are placed on the cart
30 500 in proximity and in a light-of-sight path with the CPU transceiver 220. When properly
   configured such that communication is established between the valve transceiver 120 and the
   CPU transceiver 220, the CPU transceiver 220 is positioned directly above the valve

                                                      13
   transceiver 120, as shown more clearly in Figure 9. In one or more alternative embodiments,
   the CPU transceiver 220 may be disposed on the CPU 210.
   [0045]          The CPU 210 may be in communication with a plurality of gas sensors 230 for
   determining the concentration of a sample of gas drawn via a sample line 232 and a sample
 5 line inlet 280 (shown more clearly in Figure 1) disposed on the control module 200. As will be
   discussed in greater detail, the sample line 232 draws a sample of gas from a breathing circuit
   410 of a ventilator 400 when the ventilator is in fluid communication with the control module
   200 and gas is being delivered to the ventilator. The CPU 210 may also be in communication
   with a sample flow sensor 234 for sensing the flow of the sample drawn via sample line 232, a
10 pump 236 for drawing the sample via the sample line 232 to the flow sensor 234 and zero
   valve 238 controlling the flow of the sample via the sample line 232 to the sample pump 236,
   sample flow sensor 234 and the plurality of CPU sensors. The sample line 232 may include a
   water trap 233 for collecting any water or liquid from the sample.
   [0046]          The control module 200 may also include a delivery module 260 for regulating
15 the flow of gas from the gas source 50 to the ventilator 400.      The delivery module 260 may
   include a pressure switch 262 for determining a gas supply pressure is present, a pressure shut
   off valve 264, a proportional valve 266 and a delivery flow sensor 268. The delivery module
   260 may also include a backup on/off switch 269. The detailed method of how the delivery
   module delivers the gas to the ventilator circuit is described in US Patent No. 5,558,083 which
20 is incorporated here by reference in its entirety.
   [00471          The ventilator 400 shown in Figure 1 is in fluid communication with the control
   module 200 via an injector tubing 440 and in electrical communication via an injector module
   cable 450.     The control module 200 and more specifically, the CPU 210, is in fluid
   communication with the ventilator 400 via the sample line 232.          The ventilator 400 may
25 include a breathing circuit 410 with an inspiratory limb 412 and an expiratory limb 414 in fluid
   communication with the ventilator 400.             The inspiratory limb 412 may be in fluid
   communication with a humidifier 420, which is in fluid communication with the ventilator 400
   via an injector module 430.       The inspiratory limb 412 carries gas to the patient and the
   expiratory limb 414 carries gas exhaled by the patient to the ventilator 400.       The injector
30 module 430 shown in Figure 1 is in fluid communication with the gas source 50 via the
   injector tubing 440 and in electronic communication with the delivery module 260 via the
   injector module cable 450 such that the delivery module 260 can detect and regulate the flow

                                                    14
   of gas from the gas source 50 to the ventilator 400. Specifically, the injector module 430 is in
   fluid communication with the gas source 50 via an injector tubing 440, which is in fluid
   communication with one or more of the pressure switch 262, pressure shut-off valve 246,
   proportional valve 266, flow sensor 268 and the backup switch 269 of the delivery module
 5 260.    The injector module 430 may also be in electronic communication with the delivery
   module 260 via the injector module cable 450. The inspiratory limb 412 of the ventilator 400
   may include a sample tee 416 for facilitating fluid communication between the inspiratory limb
   412 of the breathing circuit and the sample line 232.
   [0048]          As discussed above, the control module 200 may be disposed or attached on a
10 cart 500, as shown in Figures 7-9 to facilitate movement of the gas source 50 and the gas
   delivery device to a patient in need of gas therapy. The gas source 50 and the valve assembly
    100 attached thereto may be placed on the cart 500 in proximity to the control module 200.
   More specifically, as shown in Figure 7, the gas source 50 is placed on the cart 500 such that
   the valve transceiver 120 is in proximity of the CPU transceiver 220 and a line-of-sight path is
15 established between the valve transceiver 120 and the CPU transceiver 220.                In this
   configuration, the CPU 210 detects the presence of the circuit 150 and thus the gas source 50
   via the CPU transceiver 220.
   [0049]          As shown in Figures 7-9, the gas delivery device may include more than one
   valve, with each valve being attached to a single gas source.        In such embodiments which
20 utilize a second gas source 60 with a second valve assembly 101, the second valve assembly
    101 is positioned in proximity and in a light-of-sight path with a second CPU transceiver as the
   gas source 60 is loaded onto the cart.           The second CPU transceiver 222 establishes
   communication with the second valve assembly 101 and thus detects the presence of a second
   gas source 60. In the embodiment shown in Figures 7-9, the second CPU transceiver 222 may
25 also be disposed on the cover portion 225 of a cart. In one or more alternative embodiments,
   the second CPU transceiver 222 may be disposed on the CPU 210.
   [0050]          As shown in Figure 8, the cart 500 may include an optional small bin 510, a
   mount 512 for supporting the control module 200 on the cart 500, at least one a holding bracket
   520, at least one mounting strap 530, an auxiliary bracket 540, for holding an auxiliary gas
30 source, a plurality of casters 550 and a caster lock lever 560 disposed on each of the plurality
   of casters 550. The cart 500 may include a mount 570 for mounting the control module 200 on
   to the cart.

                                                   15
   [0051]          An exemplary control module 200 is shown in Figures 10-12 includes a display
   270 for providing visual indication to the user the components of the gas being delivered from
   the gas source 50 to the ventilator 400 (e.g., NO, 02, NO 2 ), the concentration of each
   component and whether communication has been established with one or more gas sources.
 5 Other information may also be displayed to the user. In addition, visual alarms may also be
   displayed on the display 270.       The control module 200 may also include a main power
   indicator 272 indicating whether the control module is connected to a power source, such as an
   AC/DC power source and/or a battery. The control module 200 may also include a control
   wheel 274 allowing the user to navigate through various displays or information displayed on
10 the display. An injection module tubing outlet 276 may be disposed on the control module for
   providing fluid communication between the delivery module 260 and the injector module 430.
   An injection module cable port 278 may also be provided on the control module to provide
   electronic communication between the delivery module 260 and the injector module 430. The
   control module 200 shown in Figures 10-12 also includes the sample line inlet 280 in fluid
15 communication with the sample line 232 and the inspiratory limb 412 of the ventilator 400. In
   the embodiment shown in Figures 10-12, the water trap 233 is disposed on the control module,
   adjacent to the sample line inlet 280.
   [0052]          Figure 11 illustrates a back view of the control module 200 and shows a
   plurality of inlets.  In the embodiment shown, two gas inlets 282, 284 for connecting the
20 control module 200 to the gas source 50 are provided and one auxiliary inlet 286 for
   connecting the control module 200 to an auxiliary gas source, which may include oxygen or
   other gas. A power port 288 is also provided on the back of the control module to connect the
   control module to an AC/DC power source.
   [0053]          The control module 200 may also include an input means 290 for allowing the
25 user to enter patient information, for example the identity of the patient, the type and
   concentration of the gas and dose of the gas to be administered to the patient, the patient's
   disease or condition to be treated by the gas or reason for treatment, gestational age of the
   patient and patient weight.    The input means 290 shown in Figure 12 includes a keyboard
   integrated with the display. In one or more alternative embodiments, the input means may
30 include a USB port or other port for the connection of an external keyboard or other input
   mechanism known in the art. The information entered via the input means 290 is stored within
   the CPU memory 212.

                                                    16
   [00541          The control module 200 and the valve assembly 100 may be utilized in the gas
   delivery system 10 to improve patient safety.       Specifically, the safety benefits of the gas
   delivery system described herein include detecting a non-confirming drug or gas source, an
   expired drug or gas, incorrect gas type, incorrect gas concentration and the like. In addition,
 5 embodiments of the gas delivery system described herein also improve efficiency of gas
   therapy.
   [0055]          Figure 13 is a block diagram showing the sequence of how gas delivery device,
   including the valve assembly 100, may be provided and its use within the gas delivery system
    10, according to one or more embodiments. As shown in Figure 13, the gas delivery device 10
10 is prepared for use by providing a gas source 50 in the form of a gas cylinder or other container
   for holding a gas and filling the gas source 50 with a gas (700) and attaching a valve assembly
    100 as described herein, to assemble the gas delivery device 10 (710).      These steps may be
   performed by a gas supplier or manufacturer. The gas data regarding the gas filled within the
   gas source 50 is entered into the valve memory 134 as described herein (720). The gas data
15 may be entered into the valve memory 134 by the gas supplier or manufacturer that provides
   the gas source 50 and assembles the gas delivery device 10. Alternatively, the hospital or other
   medical facility may enter the gas data into the valve memory 134 after the gas delivery device
   has been transported to the hospital or medical facility (730). The gas delivery device 10 is
   positioned on a cart 500 (740) and communication between the CPU transceiver 220 and the
20 valve transceiver 120 is established (750). The gas data stored within the valve memory 134 is
   conveyed to the control module 200 (760) via the wireless optical line-of-sight communication
   between valve transceiver 120 and the CPU transceiver 220.       The CPU 210 compares the gas
   data to patient information entered into the CPU memory 212 (770). The patient information
   may be entered into the CPU memory after the gas data is entered into the CPU memory 212.
25 The patient information may be entered into the CPU memory before the gas delivery device
    10 is positioned in the cart or before communication between the CPU transceiver 220 and the
   valve transceiver is established.       In one or more alternative embodiments, the patient
   information may be entered into the CPU memory 212 before the gas delivery device 10 is
   prepared or transported to the hospital or facility. The CPU 210 then compares whether the
30 gas data and the patient information match (780). If the gas data and the patient information
   match, then gas is administered to the patient (790), for example through a ventilator or other
   gas delivery mechanism. If the gas data and the patient information do not match, then an

                                                     17
   alarm is emitted (800). As described otherwise herein, the alarm may be audible and emitted
   through the speaker 214 and/or may be visual and displayed on the display 270.
   [0056]          The gas delivery system described herein simplifies set-up procedures by
   utilizing wireless line-of-sight signals to establish communication. The user does not need to
 5 ensure all the cables are correct connected and can freely load new gas sources onto a cart
   without disconnecting cables linking the control module 200 and the valve assembly 100 or
   circuit 150.   This reduces set-up time and any time spent correcting errors that may have
   occurred during the set-up process. The control module 200 and the circuit 150 are further
   designed to automatically send and detect information to establish delivery of a correct gas
10 having the correct concentration and that is not expired. In one or more specific embodiments,
   such automated actions prevent the use of the gas delivery system by preventing gas flow to a
   patient, without user intervention.
   [00571          In one or more embodiments,           after communication between the valve
   transceiver 120 and the CPU transceiver 220 is established, the valve processor 122 includes
15 instructions to convey the gas data stored in the valve memory 134 via the valve transceiver
    120 to the CPU transceiver 220.      The CPU 210 includes instructions to store the gas data
   received from the CPU transceiver 220 in the CPU memory. The CPU 210 also includes an
   algorithm that compares the gas data with patient information that is entered into the CPU
   memory 212. If the gas data and the patient information do not match, the CPU 210 includes
20 instructions to emit an alarm, which may be audible, visual or both, alerting the user that the
   gas contained within the gas source is different from the gas to be administered to the patient.
   For example, as illustrated in Figure 12, if the gas data includes gas expiration date, the CPU
   memory 212 includes information regarding the current date and the CPU 210 compares the
   gas expiration date with the current date. If the gas expiration date is earlier than the current
25 date, the CPU 210 emits an alarm. The alarm may be emitted through one or both the speaker
   214 and display 270. In one or more embodiments, the CPU 210 may include instructions that
   the delivery module 260 cease or prevent delivery of the gas. In one or more embodiments, the
   CPU 210 includes instructions to turn the backup on/off switch 269 off if the delivery module
   260 commences or continues delivery of the gas. The detection of an expired gas by the CPU
30 210 may be stored within the CPU memory 212.
   [0058]          If the gas data includes gas concentration information or data, the CPU memory
   212 includes information regarding the desired concentration of gas to be administered to the

                                                   18
   patient. The control module 200 may be configured to alert the user that the gas contained
   within a gas source has incorrect concentration or a concentration that does not match the
   desired gas concentration. For example, a user may enter a concentration of 800 ppm into the
   CPU memory 212 and this concentration is compared to the gas concentration conveyed from
 5 the valve memory 134 to the CPU memory 212. As illustrated in Figure 12, the CPU 210
   includes instructions to compare the gas concentration of the gas with the concentration
   entered by the user. If the gas concentration does not match the concentration entered by the
   user, the CPU 210 emits an alarm, which may be audible and/or visual. In one or more
   embodiments, the CPU 210 may include instructions that the delivery module 260 cease or
10 prevent delivery of the gas. In one or more embodiments, the CPU 210 includes instructions to
   turn the backup on/off switch 269 off if the delivery module 260 commences or continues
   delivery of the gas. The detection of a gas with incorrect concentration may be stored within
   the CPU memory 212.
   [0059]          In one or more embodiments, the control module 200 may be configured to
15 detect more than one valve and to detect whether more than one valve is turned on. This
   configuration eliminates waste because it alerts a user that both valves are turned on and thus
   unnecessary gas is being delivered to via the delivery module 260.          In addition, such a
   configuration improves safety because it avoids the issues related to having two regulators
   pressurized at the same time and connected to the delivery module 260.          In one or more
20 embodiments, the cover portion 225 of the control module 200 may include a second CPU
   transceiver 222 and the CPU 210 may include instructions for the second CPU transceiver 222
   to detect wireless optical line-of-sight signals from a second valve assembly 101, and more
   specifically, a second valve transceiver 121. The CPU 210 may also include instructions that
   once a second valve assembly 101 is detected by the CPU transceiver 222, whether both valve
25 assemblies 100, 101 are opened or have a valve status that includes an open position. In
   operation, a first valve assembly 100 includes a circuit with a valve processor with instructions
   to covey an open or closed position via the first valve transceiver 120. The circuit of the
   second valve assembly similarly includes a valve processor with instructions to convey an
   open or closed position via a second valve transceiver 121. The first CPU transceiver 220 and
30 the second CPU transceiver 222 detect the valve statuses for each respective valve assembly
   from the first valve transceiver 120 and the second valve transceiver 121 via the wireless
   optical line-of-sight signals sent by both transceivers.     The CPU 210 instructs the CPU

                                                   19
   transceivers 220, 222 to collect the valve statuses for both valve assemblies 100, 101 and the
   memory to store the valve statuses. The CPU 210 then compares the valve status information
   from the first valve assembly 100 and the second valve assembly 101 and, if the valve statuses
   both comprise an open position, the CPU 210 emits an alarm. The alarm may be audible and/or
 5 visual. In one or more embodiments, the CPU 210 may include instructions that the delivery
   module 260 cease or prevent further delivery of gas through either the first valve assembly or
   the second valve assembly. In one or more embodiments, the CPU 210 includes instructions to
   turn the backup on/off switch 269 off if the delivery module 260 commences or continues
   delivery of gas. The detection that more than one valve assembly had a valve that was turned
10 on or had a valve status including an open position may be stored within the CPU memory.
   [00601          In one or more embodiments, the control module 200 may be configured to alert
   a user when the desired dose has been delivered. In such embodiments, the patient information
   entered into the CPU memory 212 may include dosage information or the dose to be delivered
   to a patient.     The valve processor 122 may include instructions to convey gas usage
15 information from the valve memory 134, including the amount of gas delivered, to the CPU
   memory 212 via the valve transceiver 120. Alternatively, the valve processor 122 may include
   instructions to covey the duration of time the valve 170 has been turned on or has a valve status
   including an open position to the CPU memory 212 via the valve transceiver 120. The CPU
   210 may include instructions to compare the dosage information entered by the user and stored
20 within the CPU memory 212 with the gas usage information. The CPU 210 may include
   instructions to emit an alarm when the dosage information and the gas usage information
   match. The CPU 210 may include instructions to emit the same or different alarm to alert the
   user to turn off the valve or, more specifically, the actuator 114 when the dose has been
   delivered.   In one or more embodiments, the CPU 210 may include instructions that the
25 delivery module 260 cease or prevent further delivery of gas. In one or more embodiments, the
   CPU 210 includes instructions to turn the backup on/off switch 269 off if the delivery module
   260 commences or continues delivery of gas.
   [00611          In addition, the control module 200 may be configured to alert the user that a
   detected valve is and remains closed and no gas is being delivered to the patient.          This
30 configuration expedites treatment time and increases efficiency for the hospital.        In such
   embodiments, the valve processor 122 may include instructions for the valve transceiver 120 to
   convey the valve status to the CPU 210 via a wireless optical line-of-sight signal. The CPU

                                                   20
   210 includes instructions to collect the valve status information and emit an alert if the dosage
   information is set or other input has been entered into the CPU memory 212 to commence
   treatment and the valve status includes a closed position.
   [0062]          The control module 200 may be configured to alert the user that no valve
 5 assembly or gas source has been detected.        In such embodiments, the CPU 210 includes
   instructions to detect the presence of a wireless optical line-of-sight signal from another
   transceiver, for example, the valve transceiver 120. The CPU 210 may include instructions to
   emit an alarm if the dosage information or other input to commence delivery of the gas has
   been entered into the CPU memory 212 and no signal from another transceiver has been
10 detected.    Similarly, the control module 200 may be configured to emit an alarm if
   communication between one or both of the CPU transceiver(s) 220, 222 and one or both of the
   valve transceivers 120, 121 has been lost during gas delivery. In such embodiments, the CPU
   210 may include instructions to continuously detect the presence of a signal from another
   transceiver and emit an alarm if the dosage information or other input to commence delivery of
15 the gas has been entered into the CPU memory 212 and no signal from another transceiver has
   been detected.
   [0063]          The CPU 210 may include instructions to alert a user when sensors in the
   control module 200 must be calibrated to ensure accurate delivery of gas to a patient. In
   addition, the CPU 210 may include instructions to correlate gas usage information from the
20 circuit 150 of the valve assembly 100 to the patient information entered into the CPU memory
   212. The CPU 210 may also have instructions to store the correlated gas usage information
   and the patient information in the CPU memory 212.           The valve processor 122 may also
   include instructions detect patient information from the CPU memory 212. Specifically, the
   valve processor 122 may include instructions to collect patient information via the valve
25 transceiver 120 from the CPU transceiver 220 and store the collected patient information in the
   valve memory 134. In such embodiments in which information from the CPU 210 is collected
   and stored in the valve memory 134, the CPU 210 may include instructions that the patient
   information and/or correlated patient information and gas usage information be conveyed from
   the CPU memory 212 via the CPU transceiver 220 to the valve transceiver 120. The valve
30 processor 122 may also include instructions to correlate gas usage information with the
   collected patient information and store the correlated gas usage information and collected
   patient information in the valve memory 134.        Alternatively, the valve processor 122 may

                                                    21
   include instructions to collect the correlated patient information and gas usage information
   from the CPU 210. The correlated information may be utilized to bill the user according to
   patient. In addition, the correlated information may be utilized as patient demographic data,
   which can assist hospitals or other facilities to generate budget reports, determine usage per
 5 department, determine usage per patient diagnosis and link usage of multiple gas sources to
   individual patients.
   [0064]          A second aspect of the present invention pertains to a method for administering
   a therapy gas to a patient. The method includes providing a gas in a gas source.       The gas
   source may be prepared by a supplier to contain a gas having a predetermined composition,
10 concentration and expiration date. The method may include providing a valve assembly 100
   attached to a gas source 50 to dispense the gas contained within the gas source 50 to a patient.
   The method may include entering gas data, which may include gas composition, gas
   concentration and gas expiration date, into the valve memory 134.             In one or more
   embodiments, the supplier may enter the gas data directly into the valve memory 134.          In
15 another variant, the gas data is provided in the form of a bar code disposed on the gas source.
   In such embodiments, the method includes providing a scanner in communication with the data
   input 108, scanning the bar code to collect the gas data information and conveying the gas data
   to the valve memory 134 via the data input 108. These steps may be repeated for a second gas
   source. The gas source(s), with the valve assembly mounted thereon may be transported to a
20 hospital or other facility for administration to a patient. The gas source(s) are then mounted
   onto the cart 500 and secured by the holding bracket 520 and mounting strap 530. The method
   includes establishing communication between the valve transceivers disposed on each valve
   and the CPU transceivers 220, 222. Establishing communication may include positioning the
   valve assembly 100 in a line-of-sight path with at least one of the CPU transceivers 220, 222.
25 As otherwise described herein, communication may be established by instructing the valve
   transceivers to send a wireless optical line-of-sight signal to the CPU transceivers 220, 222.
   The method may include instructing the valve transceiver 120 to send a wireless optical line
   of-sight signal at pre-determined intervals, as otherwise described herein.
   [0065]          The method may include entering patient information into the CPU memory
30 212. This step may be performed before or after the gas source(s) are mounted onto the cart.
   The method may specifically include entering patient information such as dosage information
   into the valve memory 134.       The method includes coordinating delivery of the gas to the

                                                    22
   patient by collecting gas data from the valve memory 134 and comparing the gas data with the
   patient information according to an algorithm and determining if the gas data and patient
   information match, according to the algorithm. Coordinating delivery of the gas may include
   turning on the actuator 114 of the valve 107 such that gas can flow from the inlet 104 to the
 5 outlet 106. After the dose has been delivered, the method may include correlating the gas
   usage information and the patient information. The method may also include recording the
   patient information, gas usage information and/or the correlated patient information and gas
   usage information in the CPU memory 212 and/or the valve memory 134.             In one or more
   variants, the method may include utilizing the patient information, gas usage information
10 and/or correlated patient information and gas usage information to generate invoices
   identifying the use of the gas by individual patients.
