   Detailed Description
10
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller arranged to implement a game
   where a player can select one or more windows that define
   subsets of symbol display positions at which symbols will
15 be selected. Symbols are selected for all display
   positions. The symbols within player selected windows are
   evaluated to determine if the player has one or more
   winning outcome.
20 General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
25 the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
30 and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
35 such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
                                              80211 10_1 (GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                              - 8
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
 5
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
10 gaming server are selectively modifiable.  For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
15 skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
20 60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
25 outcomes.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
30 and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions          (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58. The player
   interface may also comprise one or more input devices to
35 allow a player to interact with the player interface. The
   input devices may comprise a touch screen display or one
                                              80211 10_1 (GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                               - 9
   or more buttons or both.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
 5 that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
10 to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
15 provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory   and generating outputs  (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
20 general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
   integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array  (FPGA).
25 A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
30 houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
35 mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
                                                80211 10_1 (GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                               - 10
   card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
 5 shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.    The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
10 reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
15 the player marketing module.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.        Further
20 artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
25 The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
30 electromechanical device.    The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
   type. The display 14 may be a touch screen display that is
   arranged to receive user inputs or commands via the touch
35 screen display.
                                                80211 10_1(GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
 5 The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
10 gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
15 The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
20 peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.          Persons
25 skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
30 controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
35 included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
                                                80211 10_1 (GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                               - 12
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
 5 instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
10 buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
15 The network card may, for example, send status
   information,  accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                    In
20 embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.

   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.               The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
30 execution by the processor 102 and related data.               The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
35 the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
                                               80211 10_1 (GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                              - 13
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
 5 provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
10 Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the

   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
15 simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
20 One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
25 and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
30 202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
35 and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the

   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
10 the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
15 could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
20 and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
25 example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.

   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.  For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
 5 separate server may be provided.  For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
10 provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Further detail of gaming system
15
   Referring to Figure 8, the processor 62 of game controller
   60 is shown implementing a number of modules based on
   program code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled
   in the art will appreciate that one or more of the modules
20 could be implemented in some other way, for example by a
   dedicated circuit. The gaming system of Figure 8 is
   arranged such that the player operates the game play
   mechanism 56 of player interface 50 to specify a wager for
   a play of the game. In the embodiment, the player places a
25 wager in a number of stages including selecting and
   positioning one or more windows over selectable symbol
   display positions 600 as shown in Figure 6 and specifying
   a win entitlement to be applied to each window.
30 That is, the display 56 comprises a plurality of
   selectable symbol display positions 600. The symbol
   display positions 600 can comprise a n x m grid of symbol
   display positions. The n x m grid can be any sized grid.
   In the example of Figure 6, there are 70 display positions
35 shown in an array formed by 10 columns and 7 rows of
   symbol display positions.
                                              80211 10_1(GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                              - 16
   The player can select one or more windows that define a
   subset of the symbol display positions provided the
   player's selection complies with game rule 841. The player
 5 can select a window through placing a wager. In one
   embodiment, to form the wager, the player initially
   indicates how many windows they wish to place over the
   symbol display positions. The window or windows are then
   displayed on the display 56 and the player operates one or
10 more input devices to position the windows relative to the
   symbol display positions. For example, a window may be
   displayed as a touchable window on a touch screen display
   and the player may drag the object to a desired position
   relative to the symbol display positions. In another
15 embodiment, the player could operate arrow buttons to
   position the windows.  The player interface 50 allows the
   player to select which window to move when there are
   plural windows, for example by providing a button that
   allows a player to cycle through individual windows.
20
   In some embodiments, in addition to specifying the window
   to apply, the player may also select a win entitlement to
   be evaluated in respect of the window. In other
   embodiments, the win entitlement may be fixed. In some
25 embodiments, the gaming system may allow different win
   entitlements to be selected and applied to different
   windows. In other embodiments, the same win entitlement
   may apply to all windows.
30 It will be appreciated, that as the player makes choices,
   a wager will be built, typically in a number of credits
   and displayed to the player. The player may adjust their
   selection of windows and/or win entitlement in order to
   adjust the wager.
35
   In other embodiments, a player may decide on a wager
                                              80211 10_1(GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                              - 17
   amount which affects what selections of windows and win
   entitlements are available.
   The win entitlement may be selected from those known in
 5 the art.  Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that
   a player's win entitlement may vary from game to game
   dependent on player selections. In one example, a player's
   win entitlement may be based on how many lines they play
   in each game - e.g. a minimum of one line up to the
10 maximum number of lines allowed by the game (noting that
   not all permutations of win lines may be available for
   selection) and how much they wager per line.         Such win
   lines are typically formed by a combination of symbol
   display positions, one from each reel, the symbol display
15 positions being located relative to one another such that
   they form a line.
   In many games, the player's win entitlement is not
   strictly limited to the lines they have selected, for
20 example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
   player's selection of pay lines and are an inherent part
   of the win entitlement.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in other
25 embodiments, the player may obtain a win entitlement by
   selecting a number of "reels" to play and an amount to
   wager per reel. Such games are marketed under the trade
   name "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty
   Ltd. The selection of the reel means that each displayed
30 symbol of the reel can be substituted for a symbol at one
   or more designated display positions. In other words, all
   symbols displayed at symbol display positions
   corresponding to a selected reel  (or column) can be used
   to form symbol combinations with symbols displayed at a
35 designated, symbol display positions of the other reels.
   For example, if in a window, there are fifteen symbol
                                               80211 10_1 (GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                              - 18
   display positions, arranged in a five by three grid, the
   symbols displayed in the centre row are used for non
   selected reels/columns. As a result, the total number of
   ways to win is determined by multiplying the number of
 5 active display positions of each column, the active
   display positions being all display positions of each
   selected column and the designated display position of the
   non-selected columns. As a result for five columns and
   fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to win.
10
   Once a player has chosen to apply a win entitlement and
   window selection in one play of the game, the player may
   choose to apply the same wager (and hence selections) in a
   following play of the game. For example, by pressing a
15 "play again" button.
   Once the player initiates a play of the game, the game
   controller 60 generates a game outcome which will then be
   evaluated by outcome evaluator 823. The first part of
20 forming the game outcome is for a symbol selector 822 to
   select symbols from a set of symbols specified by reel
   data 843 using random number generator 821. The selected
   symbols are advised to the display controller 825 which
   causes them to be displayed on display 54 at the set of
25 display positions 60.
   One example of selecting symbols is for the symbol
   selector 822 to select symbols for display from a
   plurality of symbol sets corresponding to respective ones
30 of a plurality of spinning reels 843 specifying a sequence
   of symbols for each reel. In the embodiment, individual
   reels are associated with each display position, and the
   symbol selector selects a stopping position for each of
   the reels. In the example of Figure 6, there would be 70
35 different reels.
                                              80211 10_1(GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                              - 19
   In another embodiment, reels may be associated with a row
   or column such that the symbol selector 822 can select all
   of the symbols for a row or column by selecting a stopping
   position in the sequence such that the displayed symbols
 5 are determined from the symbol at the stopping position
   and those symbols that neighbour it. It is known to use a
   probability table stored in memory 64 to vary the odds of
   a particular stop position being selected. Other
   techniques can be used to control the odds of particular
10 outcomes occurring to thereby control the return to player
   of the game.
   As shown in relation to Figures 7a-7f, the player can
   select a plurality of windows 700, 701, 702, 703. In this
15 respect, the selected windows define which symbol
   positions will be evaluated. The game controller has a
   window applier which applies the player selected windows
   844 stored in memory by causing display of the windows on
   display 54 and controlling the outcome evaluator 824                    to
20 evaluate game outcomes based on pay table 842 and the
   player's win entitlement. Any awards are added to the win
   meter of meters 845.
   The number of windows that can be selected may be
25 dependent on several criteria. The main criterion for the
   number of windows selected is dependent on the amount of
   credits the player wagers or spends. For example a player
   can buy more for windows for more credits. The amount of
   windows that can be selected or bought may also be limited
30 by the available symbol display positions within the
   display area 600. The game controller 60 is arranged to
   control the amount of windows a player can select based on
   game rules 841
35 Figure 7a shows a window 700 that has been selected by a
   player. The window shown in figure 7 is a 3 x 5 window
                                              80211 10_1(GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                              - 20
   Display 56 is also arranged to display the amount of money
   wagered or bet by the user. In figure 7a the screen shows
   the player has bet 25 to purchase the window 700.
 5 The player can buy and select multiple windows within the
   display area. The player selects additional windows by
   wagering more credits, i.e. buying more windows. Figures
   7b to 7d show that the player can incrementally add
   windows such that a window is added in each of Figures 7b
10 7d such that figure 7d shows that the player has selected
   four windows 700, 701, 702 and 703.
   The player can move the position of a selected window 700,
   701, 702, 703 around the display area. The window can be
15 moved to define a different subset of symbol display
   positions. Figure 7e shows window 700 being moved to a new
   position 700A. The player can also change the size of a
   selected window to define a different sub set of symbol
   display positions. In one form the player can move the
20 window and change the size of the window 700, 701, 702,
   703 by drag drop and re-sizing operations performed on a
   touch screen of the display. The controller 101 is
   arranged to receive the player inputs via the touch screen
   and process the player commands. The game controller is
25 arranged to move a selected window within the display area
   600 based on the drag drop operations performed on the
   touch screen.
   In one example the player can change the size of the
30 selected window by touching and dragging the corner of the
   selected window. Figure 7e shows window 701     (from Figures
   7b-d)  has been moved and re-sized the size as window 701A
   i.e. it has been made smaller as compared to figure 7b and
   window 700 has been moved and made larger to form window
35 700A.  In this respect, it will also be appreciated that
   windows 700A, 701A could have been formed by the player
                                               80211 10_1 (GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                              - 21
   initially, rather than by re-sizing an existing window,
   The one or more selected windows 700, 701, 702, 703 can be
   positioned adjacent or spaced from or intersecting with or
 5 wholly within the other one or more selected windows 700,
   701, 702, 703. In one example one window can be positioned
   adjacent another selected window, e.g. windows 702,703 in
   Figure 7d. In another example a selected window may be
   positioned in a position that is spaced apart from another
10 selected window, e.g. windows 701 and 702 in Figure 7c. In
   a further example a selected window may be positioned in a
   manner such that a portion of one selected window
   intersects with a portion of another selected window, e.g.
   windows 700 and 701 in figures 7b, 7c and 7d. In another
15 example a selected window 701B can be positioned inside
   another selected window 700B as shown in figure 7f.
   The size and the allowable position of the windows can be
   controlled by a set of rules defined and implemented by
20 the controller. The controller can restrict the size and
   position of the windows depending on the available symbol
   display positions and depending on the game rules 841. For
   example, the size of the window may be required to be
   smaller than the size of the set of symbol display
25 positions or there may be a defined maximum size to the
   window.
   The outcome evaluator 824 of game controller evaluates the
   selected symbols within a selected window and determines a
30 game outcome based on the win entitlement. As indicated
   above, in one example, the win entitlement is based on a
   selected number of win lines of an available number of win
   lines to be used in evaluation of the game outcome, each
   win line extending through a plurality of symbol display
35 positions
                                              80211 10_1(GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                               - 22
   In one example the player can play games such as a reel
   power game or a 25 line game or a 3 reel game or 6 reel
   game in different windows. In some embodiments, the type
   of win entitlement may depend on window size. The game
 5 controller 60 controls the type of game that can be played
   by determining the size of the window based on game rules.
   Further in some embodiments different pay tables may apply
   depending on the size of the window and/or the type of win
   entitlement specified by the player. For example,
10 different awards may apply to reel power games relative to
   win line based games.
   The game controller can be programmed so as to display
   special features or hot spots at certain positions on the
15 grid. For example these special features may be
   multipliers or wilds to provide additional excitement into
   the game. Another example is that a feature like a "reel
   shuffle" may be implemented such that symbols within a
   window are re-arranged if a condition is met. Such a
20 feature may be implemented separately for each window,
   e.g. if windows overlap.
   Game outcomes within one or more window, may provide
   additional game play, such as a feature game. Persons
25 skilled in the art will appreciate that a feature game
   involves some additional element of game play which
   usually only occurs when a trigger condition is met. Types
   of feature games include:  those where a series of free
   game events are awarded such as free games or re-spins
30  (where some reels are held while others are re-spun);
   games where the symbols on the reel are changed; and
   "second screen" games where game play is totally different
   to the base game, for example where the player makes
   selections in a "pick a box type" game.
35
   The trigger event may be, a symbol combination in the
                                               80211 10_1(GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                               - 23
   game, occurrence of a specific symbol in the game,
   purchased, be caused by another connected system, based on
   turnover, based on a random evaluation, etc.
 5 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that there may
   be more than one game round in a play of the gaming system
   such as is the case when a series of free spins is
   awarded. In this respect, a game round involves at least
   one of the reels being "spun" -  e.g. new symbols of the
lo reels are selected for display at the display positions
   and the reel is either physically or virtually spun to a
   stop.   The outcome of a game round may be no win, a win
    (for example from a winning combination of symbols),                  a
   contribution towards a win accrued over a plurality of
15 game rounds, a trigger condition occurring etc. As
   indicated above, a winning outcome will result in some
   form of award being made such as an award of credits based
   on the pay table 843. Such an award may never actually be
   physically received by a player. For example, many gaming
20 systems provide a player with a double or nothing gamble
   feature, where the player can double or forfeit their
   credits before commencing another play of the game or
   cashing out. Further, as credits are fungible, once
   credits have been added to the credit meter it is not
25 possible to distinguish between credits which exist
   because the player has input cash or the like and credits
   resulting from an award.
   Figure 9 shows an embodiment of a method of gaming 900. A
30 plurality of selectable symbol display positions, are
   presented 901 to a player on the display. At step 902, the
   method comprises receiving a selection of one or more
   windows to be placed relative to the selectable symbol
   display position to define a subset of the symbol display
35 positions, based on player instructions. The player can
   purchase one or more windows via the player interface.
                                               80211 10_1 (GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                              - 24
   At step 903 the player can move the position of any one or
   more windows. The player can move the position of the
   windows, for example, by interacting with the touch screen
 5 of the player interface 50. In one embodiment the player
   can move the windows by drag and drop operations performed
   on the touch screen.
   At step 904 the player can optionally manipulate the size
10 of any one or more of the selected windows. In one
   embodiment the player can change the size of the windows
   by interacting with the touch screen inputting commands by
   gestures on the screen, for example touching one or more
   corners of a particular selected window and dragging the
15 corners in a direction to increase the size of the window
   or reduce the size of the window or change the shape of
   the window. The window can be manipulated to any size or
   shape within limits on the size and shape of the window
   controlled by the game controller 60. The limits are
20 dependent on the number of available selectable symbol
   display positions within the display area or on other
   parameters defined within the controller, e.g. a minimum
   or maximum window size, a maximum or minimum number of
   columns etc.
25
   It should be understood a player can select multiple
   windows as shown in figures 7a to 7f. The selected windows
   can be positioned adjacent to each other, spaced apart
   from each other, partially intersecting one another or
30 wholly within one another. Examples of this are shown in
   figures 7a to 7f.
   At step 905 the player can specify the win entitlement for
   each window. For example the player may play a reel power
35 game in one window and play a 25 line game in another
   window. The type of games that can be played within a
                                              80211 10_1(GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                              - 25
   particular selected window may depend on the size of the
   window. Step 906 comprises selection of one or more
   symbols for display at all symbol display positions by
   symbol selector 822.
 5
   At step 907 the method involves evaluating the symbols
   within a selected window determining a game outcome based
   on a win entitlement. The win entitlement may be different
   for each type of game being played, each game outcome
10 being evaluated based on an individual win entitlement.
   If an award criterion is satisfied the player is provided
   with an award. The player may be awarded credits or
   additional game play. As explained earlier the game may
15 incorporate one or more feature games that can be
   triggered as a result of the play of the game. If the game
   controller determines that a feature should be should be
   awarded the feature game is carried out. If plural feature
   games are awarded, these may be conducted separately in
20 different display areas on the display 54 or one after the
   other.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
25 that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
   executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
   description certain steps are described as being carried
30 out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
   sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
35 such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
   may need to compute several values and compare those
                                              80211 10_1 (GHMatters) P87038.AU.3 8/03/18

                               - 26
   values.
   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
 5 ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
    (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
   a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Further different parts of the program code can
10 be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art will
   appreciate that program code provides a series of
   instructions executable by the processor.
15 It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
20 further embodiments.
   It is to be understood that, if any prior art is referred
   to herein, such reference does not constitute an admission
   that the prior art forms a part of the common general
25 knowledge in the art in any country.
