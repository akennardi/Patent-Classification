     RELATED APPLICATION
 5           This application claims priority to, and the benefit of, co-pending United
     States Provisional Application No. 61/658,696, filed June 12, 2012, for all subject
     matter common to both applications. The disclosure of said provisional application is
     hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
10   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
             The present invention relates to single-rolled or double-rolled implants, and
     deployment devices suitable for use therewith. More particularly, the present
     invention provides a rolled implant and optionally a deployment device with one or
15   more interior chambers adapted to releasably receive the implant in the rolled (e.g.,
     single-rolled or double-rolled) configuration.
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
20           In open and laparoscopic hernia repair, mesh prostheses are utilized to provide
    reinforcement and support at the hernia defect. Such mesh prostheses or other sheet
     like prostheses (e.g., films, surgical fabrics, and the like) are inserted through a small
     incision cut into the skin and abdominal wall. Generally, such mesh prostheses are
    flat sheets (e.g., of woven or knitted surgical fabric) that are trimmed to fit the
25  anatomy of the defect site as needed prior to being rolled up and inserted through the

 WO 2013/188209                                                                 PCT/US2013/044508
                                                  -2
    incision. Once inserted, the mesh prosthesis is unfolded and affixed to the defect site
    using sutures or tacks.
            However, manipulating sheet-like prostheses during laparoscopic procedures
 5  presents numerous challenges to a surgeon. For example, trocars, when used, only
    provide a limited range of motion and require the user to utilize small instruments and
    graspers to manipulate, unroll, and position the mesh or prosthesis. Moreover, in
    many instances, the mechanical and physical properties of the sheet-like prostheses
    change once exposed to bodily conditions and environments (e.g., bodily
10  temperatures, body fluids, etc.). In particular, when exposed to moisture, such sheet
    like prostheses can hydrate and become less stiff, making them more prone to rupture
    or tearing during handling. Furthermore, some of the materials may have a layer of
    self-adhering material designed to adhere to moist tissue surfaces, which can further
    complicate a user's ability to handle and place the prosthesis during surgery and
15  implantation.
            Furthermore, in abdominal and pelvic laparoscopic procedures in particular,
    the insertion, placement, and application of such prostheses prove extremely
    challenging to surgeons. In particular, the aforementioned concerns are magnified by
20  the fact that extremely thin prostheses (e.g., films) are used. As such, rupture or tear
    during handling is a large risk in such procedures as currently performed by doctors,
    SUMMARY
25          Accordingly, there is a need in the art for flexible implants suitable for being
    deployed with greater ease of handling. Furthermore, there is a need in the art for a
    deployment device that enables the convenient delivery, deployment, and placement
    of flexible implants (e.g., meshes, films, patches, fabrics, etc.) during surgical
    procedures such as hernia repair. The present invention is directed toward solutions
30  to address these and other needs, in addition to having other desirable characteristics
    that will be appreciated by one of skill in the art upon reading the present
    specification.

    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
            An illustrative embodiment of the present invention relates to a deployment
    device for a flexible implant. The deployment device can include a housing and one
25  or two chambers (e.g., cylindrical in shape), which are each open at an end of the
    housing and adapted to receive a rolled flexible implant or a rolled portion of a
    flexible implant. In embodiments of the deployment device having two chambers, the
    flexible implant is rolled into a double-rolled configuration and placed in the two
    chambers of the housing in such a way that an exposed portion of the flexible implant
30  is disposed external to the housing between two rolled portions disposed within the
    two chambers. In this way, the exposed portion of the flexible implant can be easily
    placed by a user (e.g., a surgeon) onto a target site prior to removing the remaining

 WO 2013/188209                                                                  PCT/US2013/044508
                                                    -8
    rolled portions of the flexible implant from the deployment device. In embodiments
    having a single chamber, the flexible implant can optionally include a tab and can
    have a length that is greater than a length of the chamber. The flexible implant can be
    rolled and inserted into the chamber of the housing in such a way that the tab extends
 5  out through an open end of the chamber and beyond the housing. The tab can be
    gripped for removal of the flexible implant from the deployment device and can be
    used for unrolling the flexible implant once removed from the housing of the
    deployment device.
10           In accordance with another illustrative embodiment of the present invention, a
    flexible implant is provided that is adapted to be easily and conveniently deployed
    and placed against a target site. The flexible implant can include a flexible base sheet
    having a body portion and a tab extending from the body portion. A flexible
    separable layer can be removably disposed on the body portion in such a way that the
15  flexible separable layer is contiguous with (e.g., in contact with) the flexible base
    sheet. The flexible separable layer can take the form of a mesh, a film, or a
    combination thereof. The flexible implant can be rolled into a single-rolled or double
    rolled configuration, with the flexible separable layer disposed on outward facing
    surface(s) of the resulting roll(s). The flexible implant can be placed against a target
20  site such that the outward facing surface(s) of the roll(s), on which the flexible
    separable layer is disposed, are in contact with the target site. The flexible implant
    can be unrolled in such a way that spreads the flexible separable layer out against the
    target site. The flexible sheet base can be adapted in such a way that upon
    subsequently releasing the flexible implant (e.g., upon letting go of the flexible
25  implant), the flexible sheet base independently assumes a rolled configuration (e.g.,
    returns to the same rolled configuration in which it was earlier disposed). In contrast
    to this re-rolling of the flexible sheet base, the flexible separable layer can be adapted
    to remain disposed against the target site (e.g., in a substantially planar configuration
    or another configuration in which the flexible separable layer does not form one or
30  more revolutions). Accordingly, in such illustrative embodiments, the re-rolling of
    the flexible sheet base is unmatched by the flexible separable layer, thereby causing
    the flexible sheet base to separate from the mesh film upon release thereof,

                                                    -9
     subsequent to unrolling the flexible implant with the flexible separable layer against
     the target site.
              FIGS. 1 through 12, wherein like parts are designated by like reference
  5  numerals throughout, illustrate example embodiments of a deployment device for use
     with a flexible implant according to the present invention. Although the present
     invention will be described with reference to the example embodiments illustrated in
     the figures, it should be understood that many alternative forms can embody the
     present invention. One of skill in the art will additionally appreciate different ways to
10   alter the parameters of the embodiments disclosed, such as the size, shape, or type of
     elements or materials, in a manner still in keeping with the spirit and scope of the
     present invention.
              FIG. 1 depicts a perspective view of a deployment device 10 according to an
 15  example embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2 further depicts the deployment
     device 10 from a cross-sectional view. The deployment device 10 includes an
     elongate housing 12 having a first end 18 and a second end 20. Formed in the
     housing 12 are a first chamber 14 and a second chamber 16. The first and second
     chambers 14, 16 are separated by a partition 22 (e.g., a divider wall) extending
20   between the first and second ends 18, 20 of the housing 12. In the example
     embodiment of FIG. 1, the first and second chambers 14, 16 are disposed alongside
     one another in a generally parallel manner. The first and second chambers 14, 16 can
     have substantially the same dimensions (e.g., length, width, height, diameter, etc.).
     The first and second chambers 14, 16 can be generally cylindrical in shape, as
25   illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 1, or can have any other suitable
     shape(s). In illustrative embodiments, the first and second chambers 14, 16 are
     mirror-images of one another. In alternative embodiments, the first and second
     chambers 14, 16 have shapes that are congruent with one another, geometrically
     similar to one another, or different from one another. Upon reading the present
30   specification, one of skill in the art will appreciate a wide variety of ways to alter the
     shapes, dimensions, layouts of the first and second chambers 14, 16. All such
     alternatives and modifications are contemplated within the scope of the present

 WO 2013/188209                                                                 PCT/US2013/044508

    invention. Any suitable shapes, dimensions, and layouts can be used to implement the
    present invention.
             In accordance with illustrative embodiments of the present invention, both the
 5  first and second chambers 14, 16 extend to and are open at one of the first and second
    ends 18, 20 of the housing 12. In this way, access into the first and second chambers
    14, 16 is provided through at least one of the first and second ends 18, 20. In the
    example embodiment of FIG. 1, the first and second chambers 14, 16 extend to and
    are open at both the first and second ends 18, 20 of the housing 12, such that access
10  into the first and second chambers 14, 16 is provided at both the first end 18 and the
    second end 20 of the housing 12.
             In addition to the first and second chambers 14, 16 both being open at the first
    and/or second ends 18, 20 of the housing 12, the first and second chambers 14, 16
15  each can be open along and accessible through an outer side of the housing 12. For
    example, in the example embodiment of FIG. 1, the housing 12 includes a first
    elongate opening 27 extending along a length of the first chamber 14 and disposed at
    an outer side of the first chamber 14 (i.e., a side that is generally opposite an inner
    side of the first chamber 14 abutting the partition 22). Furthermore, the first elongate
20  opening 27 extends to the first end 18. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the inner wall of the
    first chamber 14 has a cross-sectional shape generally resembling a 'C'. Accordingly,
    when viewing the cross-section, the first elongate opening 27 is a space that separates
    the two points or tips of the C-shaped inner wall of the first chamber 14. Similarly,
    the second chamber 16 can be open along an outer side thereof. For example, in the
25  example embodiment of FIG. 1, the housing 12 includes a second elongate opening
    28 extending along a length of the second chamber 16 on an outer side of the second
    chamber 16 (i.e., a side that is opposite an inner side of the second chamber 16
    abutting the partition 22). As illustrated in FIG. 2, the inner wall of the second
    chamber 16 has a cross-sectional shape generally resembling a 'C'. Accordingly,
30  when viewing a cross-section of the deployment device 10, the second elongate
    opening 28 provides a space that separates the two points or tips of the C-shaped inner
    wall.

             In addition to the partition 22, the inner walls of first and second chambers 14,
    16 are defined by upper extensions 24 and lower extensions 26. In the example
    embodiment of FIG. 1 in which the first and second chambers 14, 16 are generally
 5  cylindrical in shape, the upper and lower extensions 24, 26 are generally arch-shaped.
    In this way, the upper extensions 24, partition 22, and lower extensions 26
    collectively form the generally C-shaped cross-section of each of the first and second
    chambers 14, 16, as depicted in FIG. 2.
10           It should be appreciated that the example cross-sectional shapes of the first
    and second chambers 14, 16 depicted in the figures (e.g., the "C"shapes) are provided
    herein only for purposes of illustration and clarity. These examples in no way limit
    the present invention. Upon reading the present specification, one of skill in the art
    will appreciate a variety of alternative shapes the first and second chambers 14, 16
15  can assume. All such alternatives and modifications are contemplated within the
    scope of the present invention. In general, the first and second chambers 14, 16 can
    be provided with any suitable shape (e.g., cross-sectional shape).
             FIG. 3 depicts a perspective view of a flexible implant 30 adapted for use with
20  the deployment device 10, in accordance with an example embodiment of the present
    invention. The flexible implant 30 can include a flexible sheet base 32 having a body
    portion 34 and at least one tab 36 extending from the body portion 34. Each tab 36
    can have a width that is less than a full width 38 of the flexible sheet base 32, as
    illustrated in FIG. 3. Furthermore, in the example embodiment of FIG. 3, the flexible
25  sheet base 32 includes two such tabs 36 extending from opposite ends of the body
    portion 34. The body portion 34 can occupy a majority of the flexible sheet base 32,
    and the tab(s) 36 can extend from the body portion 34 at a center of the width 38 of
    the flexible sheet base 32. Alternatively, the tab(s) 36 can extend from the body
    portion 34 at other positions along the width 38 of the flexible sheet base 32.
30
             The flexible sheet base 32 can be any suitable material, including
    polyethylene-based materials. For example, in illustrative embodiments, the flexible

 WO 2013/188209                                                                 PCT/US2013/044508
                                                 -12
    sheet base 32 is formed of polyethylene materials (e.g., spun-bound polyethylene). It
    should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the illustrative example
    materials provided herein. Upon reading the present specification, one of skill in the
    art will appreciate a wide variety of other suitable materials that can be utilized. All
 5  such alternatives and modifications are contemplated within the scope of the present
    invention.
             The flexible implant 30 further can include a flexible separable layer 40
    removably disposed on the flexible sheet base 32 (e.g., disposed on and contiguous
10  with a surface of the flexible sheet base 32). For example, the flexible separable layer
    40 can be a hernia repair mesh, an anti-adhesion barrier film, any other film or mesh,
    or equivalently any other suitable sheet-like prosthesis or bioabsorbable and/or
    biodegradable material. Optionally, the flexible separable layer 40 can adhere with
    the surface of the flexible sheet base 32 on which the flexible separable layer 40 is
15  disposed. For example, in accordance with some embodiments of the present
    invention, a tie layer of adhesive material is included between the flexible sheet base
    32 and the 'flexible separable layer 40 to provide adhesion between the flexible sheet
    base 32 and the flexible separable layer 40. Such a tie layer of adhesive material can
    be provided by disposing the adhesive material on the flexible sheet base 32 and
20  subsequently placing the flexible separable layer 40 on the adhesive material. In
    accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, adhesion between the
    flexible sheet base 32 and the flexible separable layer 40 itself can be established by
    adhesive materials or layers included in the flexible separable layer 40. For example,
    the flexible separable layer 40 can include a coating, an adhesive layer, or other
25  adhesive features adapted to bond with the flexible sheet base 32 once placed in
    contact with a surface of the flexible sheet base 32. In one illustrative embodiment,
    the flexible separable layer 40 includes a mesh with a side that is coated with an
    omega-3 fatty acid based material which, when laid on the flexible sheet base 32,
    creates a suitable adhesion from surface tension developed between itself and the
30  flexible sheet base 32. In some embodiments, the flexible sheet base 32 includes a
     low-density polyethylene coating which can improve the surface tension developed
     between itself and the flexible separable layer 40 and thereby improve the adhesion

 WO 2013/188209                                                                PCT/US2013/044508
                                                  -13
    therebetween. In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, some
    adhesion between the flexible sheet base 32 or the flexible separable layer 40 is
    produced or enhanced by pressing together the flexible sheet base 32 and the flexible
    separable layer 40. Alternatively, the adhesion could result from application of heat,
 5  or as a part of a cooling from a curing process of the flexible separable layer 40 while
    in contact with the flexible sheet base 32. Upon reading the present specification, one
    of skill in the art will appreciate yet other ways to provide suitable adhesion between
    the flexible sheet base 23 and the flexible separable layer 40 in a manner enabling the
    flexible separable layer 40 to be removably disposed on the flexible sheet base 32.
10  All such alternatives and modifications are contemplated within the scope of the
    present invention.
             In all such embodiments where the flexible separable layer 40 adheres to the
    flexible sheet base 32, the flexible separable layer 40 can be removable from the
15  flexible sheet base 32 (e.g., by breaking the adhesive bonds) in a manner that does not
    result in partial or complete destruction of the flexible separable layer 40. As such,
    the separable layer is separable, detachable, and/or removable, as such terms are
    utilized herein.
20           In general, the flexible separable layer 40 can occupy the same area or less
    area as the flexible sheet base 32. The flexible separable layer 40 generally can be
    removably disposed onto only the body portion 34 of the flexible sheet base 32, or can
    be removably disposed onto the body portion 34 and some/all of the tab(s) 36. In the
    example embodiment of FIG. 3, the flexible separable layer 40 is removably disposed
25  onto the body portion 34 of the flexible sheet base 32 and not on either of the two tabs
    36. Additionally, in the example embodiment of FIG. 3, the flexible separable layer
    40 occupies less area than the body portion 34 of the flexible sheet base 32.
             The flexible implant 30 is adapted to be releasably received by and removably
30  disposed within the first and second chambers 14, 16 of the deployment device 10 in a
    double-rolled configuration (i.e., forming two rolls of material), as depicted in FIG. 4.
    The double-rolled configuration can be produced by gripping the two sides of the

 WO 2013/188209                                                                 PCT/US2013/044508
                                                  -14
    flexible implant 30 at the ends of the width 38 and rotating each side inward toward
    the center of the width 38. In illustrative embodiments, this forms the double-rolled
    configuration with a first rolled portion 44, a second rolled portion 46, and a third
    portion 48 extending between the first and second rolled portions 44, 46. The first
 5  and second rolled portions 44, 46 can disposed on the same surface of the flexible
    implant 30 as illustrated, such that their cross-sections collectively resemble a 'B'
    shaped scroll (e.g., a binocular shape) more closely than an 'S'-shaped scroll. In the
    example embodiment of FIG. 4, the third portion 48 extends along a full length of the
    flexible implant 30 in the double-rolled configuration. Furthermore, as illustrated in
10  FIG. 4, when the flexible implant 30 is removably disposed in the first and second
    chambers 14, 16, the first rolled portion 44 is disposed in (e.g., fully occupies) the
    first chamber 14, the second rolled portion 46 is disposed in (e.g., fully occupies) the
    second chamber 16, and the third portion 48 between the first and second rolled
    portions 44, 46 is disposed external to the housing 12 of the deployment device 10
15  and held in place against (i.e., contiguous and in contact with) the lower extensions 26
    of the housing 12. In illustrative embodiments, the flexible implant 30 is rolled to
    form two rolls such that the flexible separable layer 40 is disposed on outward-facing
    surfaces of the two rolls. Accordingly, in such illustrative embodiments, the flexible
    separable layer 40 is disposed on an outward facing surface of the third portion 48
20  when the flexible implant 30 is loaded into the deployment device 10. In this way, the
    flexible separable layer 40 is exposed on the third portion 48 and disposed external to
    the housing 12.
             In illustrative embodiments of the present invention, the first and second rolled
25  portions 44, 46 are formed of equal amounts of the flexible implant 30 and make the
    same number of revolutions (e.g., turns), such that the third portion 48 therebetween
    is a central portion of the flexible implant 30 which includes at least a portion of the
    tab(s) 36. This is shown in the example embodiment of FIG. 4. In alternative
    embodiments, the tab(s) 36 can be displaced away from the center of the width 38 and
30  the first and second rolled portions 44, 46 can be formed of different amounts of the
    flexible implant 30, such that the third portion 48 includes a non-central portion of the
    flexible implant 30 at which at least a portion of the tab(s) 36 are disposed. For

 WO 2013/188209                                                                  PCT/US2013/044508
                                                  -15
    illustrative embodiments of the deployment device 10 in which the flexible sheet base
    32 includes at least one tab 36, the double-rolled configuration is formed such that the
    third portion 48 is a portion of the flexible implant that includes at least a portion of
    the tab 36.
 5
             In illustrative embodiments of the deployment device 10 in which the flexible
    sheet base 32 includes at least one tab 36, the tab 36 is sized such that neither side at
    either end of the width of the tab 36 makes a full revolution (i.e., 360 degrees) when
    the flexible implant 30 is disposed in the housing 12 in the double-rolled
10  configuration. For example, as depicted in the embodiment of FIG. 4, the sides at
    each end of the width of the tabs 36 each make about a 180 degree revolution. In this
    way, each tab 36 avoids doubling over itself in a manner that would produce surface
    contact between two portions of the tab 36 when the flexible implant 30 is in the
    double-rolled configuration. The present invention can provide that each tab 36 form
15  less than a full revolution. In particular, after the deployment device 10 is positioned
    at the target area, the tab 36 can be grasped on its top and bottom ends by a user (e.g.,
    using graspers to hold the flexible implant 30 in place) without impeding or
    preventing the unrolling of the flexible implant 30. Stated differently, certain
    illustrative embodiments of the present invention are based on a recognition that if the
20  tab 36 included more than a single revolution, then grasping multiple revolutions of
    the tab 36 would result in multiple revolutions of the entire flexible implant 30 being
    held together, thereby making it impossible to fully unroll the flexible implant 30.
    Thus, in accordance with certain further aspects of the present invention, the tab 36
    optionally can be sized such that the tab 36 is not doubled-over (e.g., is not
25  overlapping itself at portions designed or intended to be grasped) when the flexible
    implant 30 is rolled and loaded into the deployment device 10. As yet a further
    benefit, providing no more than a single revolution of the tab 36 when the flexible
    implant 30 is loaded in the deployment device 10 in a rolled configuration can enable
    the flexible implant 30 to achieve a smaller outer diameter when in the rolled
30  configuration, thereby permitting the flexible implant 30 to be used and adapted with
    smaller cannulas, for example. Furthermore, such a feature of the tab 36 having no
    more than a full revolution when the flexible implant 30 is in a rolled configuration

 WO 2013/188209                                                                   PCT/US2013/044508

    and loaded in the deployment device 10 provides one less mechanism or feature with
    a potential to fail during use (e.g., due to misuse by a user, etc.).
             In accordance with illustrative embodiments of the present invention, the
 5  flexible implant 30 in the double-rolled configuration longitudinally spans more
    distance than the longer of the first and second chambers 14, 16. More specifically, in
    illustrative embodiments, a longitudinal dimension of the first rolled portion 44 along
    its central axis 51 is greater than a longitudinal dimension of the first chamber 14 that
    is generally parallel to the central axis of the first rolled portion 44 when disposed
10  therein. Furthermore, in such illustrative embodiments, a longitudinal dimension of
    the second rolled portion 46 along its central axis 53 is greater than a longitudinal
    dimension of the second chamber 16 that is generally parallel to the central axis of the
    second rolled portion 46 when disposed therein. In the example embodiment of FIG.
    4, the flexible implant 30 when disposed in the housing 12 in the double-rolled
15  configuration has a length 50 that is greater than a length 52 of the first and second
    chambers 14, 16. Accordingly, each tab 36 extends out the first end 18 of the housing
    12 or the second end 20 of the housing 12, as depicted in the example embodiment of
    FIG. 4. This allows the tab(s) 36 to be gripped easily by a user (e.g., a surgeon) for
    facilitating removal of the flexible implant 30 from the housing 12 of the deployment
20  device 10, as described in greater detail herein.
             FIG. 5 depicts an example embodiment of a method for using the deployment
    device 10. The flexible implant 30 can be rolled into the double-rolled configuration
    (by rolling each of the sides of the flexible implant 30 inward), and the flexible
25  implant 30 can be inserted into the deployment device 10 in the double-rolled
    configuration (step 102), as depicted in FIG. 4. The loaded deployment device 10
    can be positioned at a target site (step 104), e.g., a site of a hernia or other anatomical
    defect. For example, the loaded deployment device 10 can be advanced through one
    or more trocars to the target site, as would be appreciated by one of skill in the art
30  upon reading the present specification. In embodiments having both the first and
    second chambers 14, 16, step 104 of positioning the loaded deployment device at the
    target site can include placing the exposed third portion 48 of the flexible separable

 WO 2013/188209                                                                 PCT/US2013/044508
                                                  -17
    layer 40 on the target site. In particular, the exposed third portion 48 can lowered
    from above toward the anatomical defect until the exposed portion of the flexible
    separable layer 40 is in contact with the defect site. For example, if the target site is a
    site of an abdominal hernia, a user can position the loaded deployment device in such
 5  a way that the exposed third portion 48 of the flexible separable layer 40 is pressed
    against the torn abdominal wall. In this way, the deployment device 10 can be used to
    carefully place the exposed third portion 48 of the flexible separable layer 40 while
    the deployment device 10 is still loaded with the flexible implant 30 (i.e., prior to
    removing the first and second rolled portions 44, 46 from the first and second
10  chambers 14, 16).
             Once suitably positioned at the target site, the flexible implant 30 can be
    removed from the deployment device 10 (step 106). For example, step 106 can be
    performed by a user manipulating one or more graspers to hold the tab 36 in place
15  while gripping and pulling on the housing 12 away from the flexible implant 30 to
    retract the deployment device 10 and thereby remove the flexible implant 30 from the
    deployment device 10. Upon the flexible implant 30 being removed from the
    deployment device 10 (e.g., by holding the tab 36 in place and retracting the
    deployment device 10), the now-fully exposed flexible implant 30 can be unrolled
20  (step 108). For example, step 108 can include a user manipulating one or more
    graspers to unroll each of the first and second rolled portions 44, 46. In illustrative
    embodiments, the strength of the coupling or adhesion between the flexible sheet base
    32 and the flexible separable layer 40 is sufficiently low that the act of rolling and
    unrolling the flexible implant 30 causes the flexible sheet base 32 and the flexible
25  separable layer 40 to unfurl and/or re-furl separately and partially separate (e.g., at the
    edges) upon the flexible implant 30 being unrolled in step 108. Once unrolled (and/or
    while unrolling), the flexible sheet base 32 and the flexible separable layer 40 can be
    separated (step 110). For example, step 108 can be performed by a user gripping the
    tab 36 and pulling (e.g., peeling) the flexible sheet base 32 off the flexible separable
30   layer 40. Notably, in step 1 10, the flexible separable layer may be partially
    positioned, e.g., if the exposed third portion 48 of the flexible separable layer 40 were
    placed into an operational position on the target site in step 104. Once separated from

                                                  -1 8
    the flexible sheet base 32, the flexible separable layer 40 can be fully placed against
    or on the target site, as would be appreciated by one of skill in the art upon reading
    the present specification. However, in illustrative embodiments of the present
    invention, the flexible separable layer 40 is completely applied by the time the
 5  flexible sheet base 32 is separated from the flexible separable layer 40 in step 110.
    The flexible sheet base 32 can be removed from the target site using a removal device.
    For example, FIG. 9 depicts one suitable removal device 60, according to an example
    embodiment of the present invention.
10           The flexible sheet base 32 can be formed of a material that exhibits a tendency
    (e.g., a slight tendency) to remain in the rolled configuration after being unrolled in
    step 108. In such embodiments, the act of unrolling the flexible implant 30 in step
     108 and subsequently letting go of the flexible implant 30 (and thereby releasing the
    holding force or rolling force imposed on the flexible implant 30 when unrolling in
15  step 108) can cause a portion of the flexible sheet base 32 to re-furl and re-assume a
    rolled or partially rolled configuration. In illustrative embodiments, this re-furling or
    re-rolling of the flexible sheet base 32 is unmatched by the flexible separable layer 40.
    Rather, in illustrative embodiments, the flexible separable layer 40 (upon release of
    the holding force or rolling force applied to the flexible implant 30 in step 108)
20   instead can remain adhered to the target site, e.g., as previously applied thereto.
     Accordingly, in such embodiments and illustrative implementations, the flexible sheet
     base 32 experiences more rerolling than the flexible separable layer 40, thereby
     causing the flexible sheet base 32 to partially or completely separate from the flexible
     separable layer 40 during such re-rolling motion.
25
              In some embodiments, the deployment device 10 includes only a single
     chamber formed therein. For example, FIG. 6 depicts the deployment device 10
     including only the first chamber 14, in accordance with an example embodiment of
     the present invention. In the example embodiment of FIG. 6, the first chamber 14
30   extends to and is open at the first end 18 of the housing 12. In this embodiment, the
     first chamber 14 does not extend to and is not open at the second end 20 of the
     housing 12. Rather, the first chamber 14 terminates at a wall 54. On the side of the

    wall 54 opposite the side at which the first chamber 14 is disposed, the housing 12
    includes a grip extension 56. The grip extension 56 can include one or more
    substantially flat surfaces 58 suitable for being gripped by one or more graspers or
    other positioning devices when positioning the deployment device 10 to a target site.

             As with the example embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 2, the deployment device 10
    of FIG. 6 includes the first elongate opening 27 disposed in an outer side of the
    housing 12 and providing side access into the first chamber 14. Furthermore, as with
    the example embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 2, the first elongate opening 27 extends to
10  the first end 18. In some alternative embodiments of the deployment device 10
    wherein a single chamber is formed in the housing 12, there is no elongate opening
    disposed in an outer side of the housing 12. In such alternative embodiments, the
    inner wall of the first chamber 14 has a cross-section that is generally circular in
    shape. As illustrated, the deployment device 10 of the example embodiment of FIG.
15  6 does not include the partition 22.
             FIG. 7 depicts the flexible implant 30 adapted for use with the deployment
    device 10 of FIG. 6. In particular, the body portion 34 of the flexible sheet base 32
    (upon which the flexible separable layer 40 is removably disposed) includes the tabs
20  36. Unlike the flexible implant 30 of FIG. 3, the tabs 36 are disposed at an end of the
    width 38 of the flexible implant 30. Although two tabs 36 are included in the
    example embodiment of FIG. 7, it should be appreciated that more or less tabs 36
    alternatively can be included (e.g., just a single tab disposed at an end of the width 38
    of the flexible implant 30). The flexible implant 30 of FIG. 7 can be rolled into a
25  single-rolled configuration and loaded into the deployment device. For example,
    FIG. 8 depicts the deployment device 10 having only the first chamber 14 with the
    flexible implant 30 of FIG. 7 loaded therein in such a single-rolled configuration. As
    shown, the flexible implant 30 is disposed in the first chamber 14 in a single-rolled
    configuration (i.e., forming only a single roll of material). In the example
30  embodiment of FIG. 8, the flexible sheet base 32 includes only a single tab 36 which
    extends out the first end 18 of the housing 12, and which preferably forms less than a

     the flexible implant 30 spans more distance longitudinally when disposed in the first
     chamber 14 in the rolled configuration than does the first chamber 14. Stated
     differently, the length 50 of the flexible implant 30 in the single-rolled configuration
     is greater than a length of the first chamber 14. More specifically, a longitudinal
  5  dimension of the flexible implant 30 in the single-rolled configuration along its
     central axis is greater than a longitudinal dimension of the first chamber 14 that is
     generally parallel to the central axis of the first rolled portion 44 when disposed
     therein. In the example embodiment of FIG. 8, there is no elongate exposed portion
     (e.g., such as the third portion 48 of the deployment device 10 of FIG. 4) of the
 10  flexible separable layer 40 which is disposed external to the housing 12, other than
     any optional portion of the flexible separable layer 40 removably disposed on the tab
     36. In some embodiments, a portion of the flexible sheet base 32 (e.g., a portion of
     the flexible sheet base 32 disposed at an end of the width 38 of the flexible sheet base
     32) extends out through the first elongate opening 27. In such embodiments, the
15   flexible separable layer 40 can be disposed on the exposed portion of the flexible
     sheet base 32 or can be only on portions of the flexible sheet base 32 that do not
     extend out the first elongate opening 27. Such a portion of the flexible sheet base 32
     extending out of the housing 12 through the first elongate opening 27 can be useful in
     providing an additional area that can be gripped by a user (e.g., surgeon) when
20   manipulating the flexible implant 30 at a target site (e.g., in a patient).
              The deployment device 10 of the example embodiment of FIG. 6 can be used
     and operated in substantially the same manner described previously herein with
     reference to FIG. 5. In particular, the flexible implant 30 can be inserted into the
25   deployment device 10 in the single-rolled configuration (step 102). The loaded
     deployment device 10 then can be positioned at a target site (step 104), e.g., by
     passing the loaded deployment device 10 through one or more trocars. Once
     positioned at the target site, the flexible implant 30 can be removed from the
     deployment device 10 (step 106), e.g., by holding the tab 36 in place and retracting
30   the deployment device 10 to remove and fully expose the flexible implant 30 in the
     single-rolled configuration. The fully exposed flexible implant 30 can be unrolled
     (step 108). Subsequent to or during unrolling of the flexible implant 30, the flexible

    sheet base 32 and the flexible separable layer 40 can be separated from one another
    (step 110). Once separated from the flexible sheet base 32, the flexible separable
    layer 40 can be placed against or on the target site, as would be appreciated by one of
    skill in the art upon reading the present specification. The flexible sheet base 32 can
 5  be removed from the target site (e.g., removed from the patient), using the removal
    device 60 of FIG. 9.
             As should be understood by those of skill in the art upon study of the present
    disclosure, the flexible implant 30 can be packaged and sold preloaded in the
10  deployment device 10 and can be used as a reloadable cartridge as part of a larger
    manipulating device. Rolled up inside the deployment device 10, the flexible implant
    30 is easily inserted to a target site (e.g., within a patient), whereas on its own such a
    flexible implant 30 would typically fold and buckle in an undesired manner.
    Furthermore, once positioned at the target site (e.g., inside the patient), the flexible
15  implant 30 can be placed on the target site as the rolls are unrolled in small sections,
    while the remainder of the flexible implant 30 remains unexposed and rolled up in the
    flexible sheet base 32. This provides a user with greater visibility of the work space
    (e.g., surgical field) and allows for more accurate placement of the flexible separable
    layer 40. In addition, during insertion, unplaced portions of the flexible separable
20  layer 40 remain protected from bodily fluids and mechanical disruption inside of the
    roll(s) of the flexible implant 30. 'These forms of protection can be of great
    importance when handling such flexible separable layers 40 (or other such sheet-like
    materials) which can be delicate, can have self-adhering layers, and/or can be loaded
    with therapeutic agents.
25
             Additionally, in certain illustrative embodiments of the deployment device 10
    having both the first and second chambers 14, 16, the deployment device 10 and
    flexible implant 30 can be adapted such that a portion of the flexible separable layer
    40 is exposed and disposed external to the housing 12. This allows a user (e.g., a
30  surgeon) to place a portion of the flexible separable layer 40 at the target site before
    removing and exposing a remainder of the flexible separable layer 40 from the first
    and second chamber 14, 16. Beneficially, fixing an initial portion of the flexible

 WO 2013/188209                                                                 PCT/US2013/044508
                                                  -22
    separable layer 40 in this manner can allow a surgeon to achieve greater accuracy
    when placing the flexible separable layer 40 at the target site and easier manipulation
    of the flexible separable layer 40. As generally described previously herein, many
    such flexible separable layers 40 tend to fold or buckle, which can produce undesired
 5  self-adhering. Accordingly, placing (e.g., and optionally affixing) an initial exposed
    portion of the flexible separable layer 40 disposed an outward-facing surface of the
    third portion 48 of the flexible implant 30 onto a target site prior to exposing and
    placing a remainder of the flexible separable layer 40 can be useful in preventing the
    flexible separable layer 40 from bending or folding over (e.g., and adhering to itself).
10  In embodiments of the deployment device 10 including only the first chamber 14, the
    tab 36 on the flexible sheet base 32 extending external to the housing 12 provides a
    user with an easy mechanism for gripping and manipulating the flexible implant 30
    (e.g., holding the flexible implant 30 in place, removing the flexible implant 30 from
    the deployment device 10, unrolling the flexible implant 30, etc.).
15
             Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention can provide users with
    greater handling capabilities and easier deployment of such flexible separable layers
    40 (or any other sheet-like material), for example during laparoscopic repair and/or
    other medical or surgical applications. Furthermore, the flexible sheet base 32 (on
20  which the flexible separable layer 40 is removably disposed, e.g., during insertion of
    the flexible separable layer 40 into the body and when initially removed from the
    deployment device 10 at the target site) can provide additional protection to the target
    site, e.g., by providing an additional barrier between the target site and the graspers
    used in deployment. For example, in medical applications, this can reduce the
25  likelihood of the graspers inadvertently tearing or otherwise damaging internal body
    organs when deploying and applying the flexible separable layer 40 to the surface of
    internal body organs. Furthermore, for example, the flexible sheet base 32 can have
    mechanical integrity as well as tear and puncture resistant, which additionally can
    protect the flexible separable layer 40 from destructive forces. For example, by
30  providing a tab 36 that can be grasped during removal of the flexible implant 30 from
    the deployment device 10, it is possible to avoid placing additional surface tension on
    the flexible separable layer 40, thereby assisting in preserving the integrity of the

  WO 2013/188209                                                                   PCT/US2013/044508
                                                   -23
     flexible separable layer 40 (e.g., which can be more susceptible to rips, tears, or other
     structural damage).
              Furthermore, once removed from the deployment device 10 at the target site,
  5  the flexible implant 30 can be placed on the target site as appropriate by unrolling the
     flexible implant 30 in such a way that the roll(s) of the flexible implant 30 formed by
     the rolled configuration are rolled out onto the target site (with the flexible separable
     layer 40 facing the target site and the flexible sheet base 32 facing away from the
     target site). In this way, the flexible separable layer 40 optionally can be rolled out
 10  and placed on the target site in a single, simultaneous step. Beneficially, when
     applied and implemented for medical and/or surgical applications, optionally
     combining these steps can enable a surgeon to achieve shorter surgery times.
     Furthermore, the simultaneous act of unrolling the flexible implant 30 can include
     pressing the flexible implant 30 into (e.g., and smoothing it out onto) the target site in
 15  such a way that the flexible separable layer 40 comes into contact with (e.g., and
     adheres with) the target site. In some instances and implementations, this act of
     pressing the flexible implant 30 into the target site and smoothing it across the target
     site can be achieved by a user using a grasper and pressing (e.g., with sweeping
     motions) on the side of the flexible implant 30 on which the flexible sheet base 32 is
20   disposed. Stated differently, the flexible implant can be, e.g., lowered onto the target
     site with the flexible separable layer 40 "face down" against the target site. The
     graspers then can be used to unroll the flexible implant 30 and press against flexible
     sheet base 32, which is "face up" on the target site, thereby smoothing the surface of
     the flexible separable layer 40 against the target site and ensuring proper physical
25   contact (e.g., and hence also adhesion/bonding) between the target site and the
     flexible separable layer 40 prior to removing the flexible sheet base 32 from the
     flexible separable layer 40. Thus, in this way, the flexible separable layer 40
     beneficially can be placed on the target site (e.g., in step 108) without the user ever
     physically touching the flexible separable layer 40 with the graspers. The graspers
30   thus can apply a smoothing force against the target site, and can be used to urge the
     flexible separable layer 40 into contact with the target site (e.g., the tissue) in a
     manner that neither damages the flexible separable layer 40 nor compromises

 WO 2013/188209                                                                  PCT/US2013/044508
                                                   -24
    adequate placement/physical contact of the flexible separable layer 40 against the
    target site. Accordingly, in such illustrative usages, when the flexible sheet base 32 is
    separated from the flexible separable layer 40 in step 110, the flexible separable layer
    40 has already been applied to the target site.
 5
            Furthermore, once removed from the flexible sheet base 32, the flexible
    separable layer 40 optionally can independently assume a contoured three
    dimensional shape adapted to provide greater treatment/reinforcement at the target
    site and/or adapted to better adhere to the target site. Accordingly, in illustrative
10  embodiments, the flexible separable layer 40 is rolled into the rolled configuration in
    a manner that does not compromise the ability of the flexible separable layer 40 to
    unroll and assume a predetermined three-dimensional shape. Upon reading the
    present specification, one of skill in the art will appreciate yet further benefits and
    advantages not explicitly described herein.
15
            In general, any suitable flexible separable layer 40 can be utilized, For
    example, any suitable uncoated mesh, or coated mesh (e.g., having a tissue-adherent
    coating) may be used. As further examples, any suitable hernia repair mesh, any
    suitable anti-adhesion barrier film, any other suitable film or mesh, or equivalently
20  any other suitable sheet-like prosthesis or bioabsorbable and/or biodegradable
    material may be utilized with embodiments of the present invention. Upon reading
    the present specification, one of skill in the art will appreciate a wide variety of
    additional flexible separable layers 40 that can be utilized. All such alternatives and
    modifications to the embodiments described herein are contemplated within the scope
25  of the present invention. The present invention is not limited to any specific
    examples, which are provided herein for purposes of clarity and illustration.
            In accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the
    deployment device 10 can include just a single chamber that is closed at both of its
30  ends. For example, FIGS. 1OA and 1OB depict perspective views of the deployment
    device 10 including only the first chamber 14, in accordance with an example
    embodiment of the present invention. In the example embodiment of FIGS. 1OA and

 WO 2013/188209                                                                PCT/US2013/044508
                                                  -25
    LOB, each of the first chamber 14 and the housing 12 are generally cylindrical in
    shape, with the first elongate opening 27 extending between the first and second ends
    18, 20 of the housing 12 and along at least a portionof a length of the first chamber
    14. As depicted, the housing 12 is closed at both the first and second ends 18, 20. In
 5  particular, in the example embodiment of FIGS. 10A and 10B, an end cap 64 is
    disposed at (e.g., removably coupled to, formed integral with, etc.) the housing 12 at
    the first end 18. Accordingly, in the example embodiment of FIGS. 10A and 1OB,
    access into the first chamber 14 is provided exclusively by the first elongate opening
    27. In embodiments where the end cap 64 is removable from and re-attachable to the
10  housing 12 in an operational manner (e.g., not requiring destructive forces), removing
    the end cap 64 from the housing 12 can open the first end 18 of the housing 12 and
    thereby provide access into the first chamber 14, for example, for enabling the
    flexible implant 30 to be inserted therein in a single-rolled configuration.
15           As illustrated in the example embodiment of FIGS. 1OA and 10B, the flexible
    implant 30 can be disposed in the first chamber 14. The flexible implant 30 of FIGS.
    10A and 1OB does not include any such tab 36 as described and depicted previously
    herein with reference to FIGS. 1 through 9. As illustrated in FIGS. 1OA and 1OB, a
    segment of the body portion 34 of the flexible sheet base 32 (specifically, a segment
20  that is disposed at an end of the width 38 of the flexible sheet base 32) extends out
    through the first elongate opening 27 and beyond the housing 12 in an amount capable
    (e.g., and suitable) of being gripped by a user, for example using one or more
    graspers. However, in alternative embodiments of the present invention, the flexible
    sheet base 32 includes one or more tabs 36 (e.g., occupying less than the full width 38
25  of the flexible sheet base 32) extending out through the first elongate opening 27 and
    beyond the housing 12 in an amount capable (e.g., and suitable) of being gripped by a
    user, for example using one or more graspers. When implemented for embodiments
    in which the housing 12 is closed at its first and second ends 18, 20, tab(s) 36 can be
    disposed at end(s) of the width 38 of the flexible sheet base 32 (as depicted in the
30  example embodiment of FIG. 7), or can be disposed elsewhere along the width 38 of
    the flexible sheet base 32.

 WO 2013/188209                                                                 PCT/US2013/044508

             In accordance with some example embodiments of the present invention, the
    flexible implant 30 is provided in absence of the deployment device 10. For example,
    FIG. 11A depict the flexible prosthesis in an unrolled, substantially flat configuration,
    in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention, As illustrated,
 5  the flexible implant 30 includes the flexible sheet base 32 having the body portion 34
    and at least one tab 36. In the example embodiment of FIG. 11A, tab 36 extends
    from an end of the width 38 of the flexible sheet base 32 and occupies less than the
    full width 38 of the body portion 34. Stated differently, the tab 36 has a width that is
    less than the width 38 of the flexible sheet base 32. Removably disposed on at least
10  the body portion 34 is the flexible separable layer 40. The flexible separable layer 40
    includes a first major surface (hidden from view in FIGS. 11A and 11B) and a second
    major surface 68 opposite the first major surface. The first major surface is
    contiguous with (in contact with) the flexible sheet base 32. As described previously
    herein, the flexible separable layer 40 can be any suitable flexible separable layer 40,
15  including, as non-limiting examples, a hernia repair mesh, an anti-adhesion barrier
    film, any other film or mesh, or equivalently any other suitable sheet-like prosthesis
    or sheet-like bioabsorbable and/or biodegradable material. As depicted in FIG. 11B,
    the flexible implant 30 can be rolled into a single-rolled configuration.
20           In accordance with illustrative embodiments (e.g., including the example
    embodiment of FIG. 11B), when in the single-rolled configuration, a portion 66 of the
    flexible implant 30 at an end of the width 38 of the flexible sheet base 32 is unrolled
    or less tightly rolled than a remainder of the flexible implant 30. The unrolled or less
    tightly rolled portion 66 at the end of the width 38 of the flexible sheet base 32 can
25  include at least a portion of the tab 36. The unrolled or less-tightly rolled portion 66
    can be adapted to extend out an elongate opening of a deployment device (e.g., the
    first elongate opening 27 of the deployment device 10 of FIG. 6).
             The flexible sheet base 32 can be formed of a material that exhibits a tendency
30  (e.g., a slight tendency) to remain in the rolled configuration after being unrolled. In
    such embodiments, the act of unrolling the flexible implant 30 and subsequently
    releasing the flexible implant 30 (e.g., letting go of the flexible implant 30) can cause

 WO 2013/188209                                                                   PCT/US2013/044508
                                                    -27
    a portion of the flexible sheet base 32 to re-furl and re-assume a rolled or partially
    rolled configuration. In illustrative embodiments, this re-furling or re-rolling of the
    flexible sheet base 32 is unmatched by the flexible separable layer 40 when the
    second major surface 68 of the flexible separable layer 40 is placed against (e.g., and
 5  applied to) a target site, such as an abdominal wall of a human. In illustrative
    embodiments, the flexible separable layer 40 (upon release of the flexible implant 30)
    remains adhered to the target site, e.g., in substantially the same shape and
    configuration as placed thereagainst. Accordingly, in such embodiments, the
    unmatched re-rolling of flexible sheet base 32 causes the flexible sheet base 32 to
10  partially or completely separate from the flexible separable layer 40 during such re
    rolling motion. Stated differently, the flexible implant 30 is adapted in such a way
    that the adhesive force between the target site (e.g., an abdominal wall of a human)
    and the flexible separable layer 40 is greater than the adhesive force between the
    flexible sheet base 32 and the flexible separable layer 40, such that the re-rolling of
15  the flexible sheet base 32 after unrolling the flexible separable layer 40 onto the target
    site causes separation of the flexible sheet base 32 and the flexible separable layer 40.
    For example, FIG. 12 depicts the configuration of the flexible sheet base 32 and the
    flexible separable layer 40 relative to one another, as would be experienced during
    such re-rolling of the flexible sheet base 32 after applying the flexible separable layer
20  40 to a target site (e.g., an abdominal wall of a human). For clarity and purposes of
    illustration, the target site is not depicted in FIG. 12.
             In some alternative embodiments, the flexible implant 30 is disposed in a
    double-rolled configuration rather than a single-rolled configuration. In such
25  embodiments, the double-rolled configuration can be produced by rolling each end of
    the width 38 of the flexible sheet base 32 with the flexible separable layer 40
    removably disposed thereon inward toward a center of the width 38, to produce two
    substantially parallel rolls of the flexible implant 30 (e.g., as substantially depicted
    herein and described previously with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4). The double-rolled
30  configuration of the flexible implant 30 can be produced in such a way that the
    flexible separable layer 40 is disposed on an outward-facing surface of the two rolls,
