        Example methods and systems to indicate the status of door operations are disclosed.
An example door system includes a door panel having a leading edge to be moved in a travel
direction between an open position and a closed position relative to the doorframe. The door
panel to block the passageway when the leading edge is at the closed position. The door
panel to unblock the passageway when the leading edge is at the open position. The example
door system also includes a series of lights distributed along the travel direction proximate
the doorframe. The example door system further includes a controller to switch the lights
between a first state and a second state to provide a visual effect of movement corresponding
to the operating status of the door system.

       DOOR SYSTEMS TO INDICATE THE STATUS OF DOOR OPERATIONS
                                        Field of the Disclosure
[0001]      The present disclosure relates generally to doors and more specifically to methods
and systems to indicate the status of door operations.
                                             Background
[0002]     A variety of power-operated doors have movable door panels for selectively
blocking and unblocking a passageway through a doorway. Door panels come in various
designs and operate in different ways. Examples of some door panels include a rollup panel
(e.g., pliable or flexible sheet), a rigid panel, a flexible panel, a pliable panel, a vertically
translating panel, a horizontally translating panel, a panel that translates and tilts, a swinging
panel, a segmented articulated panel, a panel with multiple folding segments, a multilayer
thermally insulated panel, and various combinations thereof.
[0003]      Some power-operated doors have audio or visual signaling systems that indicate
various conditions pertaining to the door or nearby area. Examples of such systems are
disclosed in US patent 4,821,024; US published patent application 2013/009785 Al; and US
published patent application 2008/0022596 Al; all of which are specifically incorporated by
reference herein.

                                      Detailed Description
[0024]     Example methods and apparatus disclosed herein provide visual signals on,
alongside, or otherwise proximate to a movable door panel. Some such example methods and
apparatus include lights that provide a visual effect of movement (e.g., via animation
                                                -2-

techniques) coinciding with a travel direction of a door panel's leading edge. In some
examples, lights are placed on a door's control box. In some examples, a battery or super
capacitor is disposed on a door panel to provide portable electrical power to a series of lights
installed along the door panel's movable leading edge. In some examples, the lights provide
various signals indicating a door is about to open due to impending completion of a work-in
process behind the door. In some examples, a portion of the door is made of a
thermochromic material and/or changes color in response to the temperature of the door.
[0025]     FIGS. 1 - 20 show various example door systems which provide visual signals
indicating the operating status of the door and/or conditions on the other side of the door.
Example visual signals include (1) sequentially activated variable state lights to generate a
visual effect of movement along a doorframe and/or on a control box, (2) lights disposed on
and moving with the leading edge of a door panel, (3) a light projected on a door panel,
and/or (4) a thermochromic area on a doorframe or on a moving door panel. Example
operating statuses of the door include the door opening, the door closing, the door being
about to open, and/or the door being about to close. Example conditions on the other side of
the door include temperature, humidity, the presence of a person or object, and impending
completion of a manufacturing process on the other side of the door.
[0026]     FIGS. 1 - 4 show an example door system 10 having a series of lights 12 (plurality
of lights) that are controlled to provide a visual effect of movement that indicates movement
of a door panel 14 and/or indicates impending movement of the door panel 14. That is, while
individual lights in the series of lights 12 in the illustrated example are at fixed locations, the
controlled activation/deactivation of individual (e.g., successive) ones of the series of lights
12 gives the appearance of a light signal moving along the series of lights 12. The term,
"door panel" represents any structure that is moveable to selectively block and unblock a
passageway (e.g., a doorway or other access opening). Example door panels include a rollup
panel (e.g., pliable or flexible sheet), a rigid panel, a flexible panel, a pliable panel, a
vertically translating panel, a horizontally translating panel, a panel that translates and tilts, a
swinging panel, a segmented articulated panel, a panel with multiple folding segments, a
multilayer thermally insulated panel, and various combinations thereof.
[0027]     The term, "light" refers to any one or more elements providing illumination or one
or more surfaces. Examples of a light include a single illuminating element (e.g., an LED,
light bulb, etc.), a single illuminating element of a single color, a single illuminating element
functional to provide selectively different colors, multiple discrete illuminating elements,
multiple illuminating elements of a single color, multiple illuminating elements of different
                                                  -3-

colors, one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs), a rope light comprising a series of LEDs,
one or more incandescent bulbs, and a target surface illuminated by a projector (or other light
source) through air or through light-passing material (e.g., fiber optics).
[0028]      In the particular example shown in FIGS. 1 - 4, the door system 10 comprises a
doorframe 16 proximate a passageway 18, the door panel 14 (rollup style in the illustrated
example), and the series of lights 12 distributed along the doorframe 16. To open and close
the door system 10, a drive unit 20 rotates a take-up drum 22 that draws the door panel 14 up
or pays it out to selectively move a leading edge 24 of the panel 14 in a travel direction 26
between an open position (FIG. 4) and a closed position (FIG. 1). The doorframe 16 helps
guide the lateral edges of the panel 14 as the door system 10 opens and closes. Some
examples of the door panel 14 include a seal along its leading edge 24.
[0029]     In some examples, a controller 28 and/or a sensor 30 controls the operation of the
door system 10. For instance, in some examples, the controller 28 includes a manually
operated open button 32 and a close button 34 that initiate the conveyance of an output signal
36 to drive unit 20 for opening and closing the door system 10. The term, "controller" refers
to any device for directing, determining, commanding, regulating or otherwise controlling the
door's operation.
[0030]     In addition or alternatively, in some examples, the sensor 30 triggers the opening or
closing of the door system 10 depending on whether the sensor 30 detects the presence or
movement of a body near the door system 10. In some examples, the sensor 30 is part of the
controller 28. The term, "sensor" refers to any device for providing a trigger or feedback
signal in response to detecting the presence or movement of a body (e.g., a person, vehicle,
obstacle, etc.). Sensors detecting presence or movement operate under various known
principles, examples of which include active infrared, passive infrared, ultrasonic, radar,
microwave, laser, electromagnetic induction, pressure pad, ultra-IR LED, time-of-flight pulse
ranging technology, photoelectric eye, thermal, video camera, video analytics, and various
combinations thereof.
[0031]     In some examples, the controller 28 also controls the lights 12 in such a way as to
provide a visual indication of the door's operation. The visual indication can warn those in
the vicinity of the door system 10 that the door panel 14 is opening, about to open, closing or
about to close. In some examples, each discrete light of the series of lights 12 is individually
switchable selectively to a first state and a second state. Examples of first and second states
of any given light 12 include on and off, energized and de-energized, red and green, color-I
and color-2, bright and dim, steady and flashing, etc.
                                                -4-

[0032]     The lights 12, in some examples, are switched in a certain pattern such that lights
12 provide a visual effect of movement in the travel direction 26 of the leading edge 24 of the
door panel 14. For instance, in some examples, individual ones of the lights 12 change
between their first and second states in substantial synchrony with the traveling movement of
the leading edge 24 of the door panel 14. With such a synchronous control scheme, a light
signal generated by the lights 12 appears to travel at substantially the same velocity (e.g.,
within 10% of the actual velocity) as the leading edge 24 of the door panel 14 and/or appears
to travel at substantially the same elevation (e.g., within one foot of the actual elevation) of
the leading edge 24.
[0033]     More specifically, in the illustrated example, when the door panel 14 is moving or
is about to move, the lights 12 above the leading edge 24 are energized and the lights 12
below the leading edge 24 are de-energized. In other words, a given light 12' adjacent to the
leading edge 24 changes state as the leading edge 24 passes the position of the light 12'.
Consequently, all the lights 12 are turned on when the door system 10 is fully closed, as
shown in the illustrated example of FIG. 1. When the door system 10 is about one-third
open, as shown in the illustrated example of FIG. 2, the upper two-thirds of the lights 12 are
energized, and the lower third are de-energized. When the door system 10 is about two-thirds
open, as shown in the illustrated example of FIG. 3, the upper third of the lights 12 are
energized while the lower two-thirds are de-energized. When the door system 10 is fully
open, as shown in the illustrated example of FIG. 4, all or nearly all of the lights 12 are de
energized. In other examples, all or nearly all of the lights 12 are energized when the door
system 10 is fully open while the lights 12 are de-energized when the door system 10 is fully
closed.
[0034]     Some examples of door system 10 include additional or alternative control
schemes. In some examples, the lights 12 are controlled to provide a visual effect of
movement having a greater or slower speed as that of the leading edge 24 but with the same
travel direction (e.g., up and down, left and right, or some other two directions of movement).
This provides the benefit of not having to coordinate the travel speed indicated by the visual
effect of movement generated by the lights 12 with the actual movement of the door panel 14.
In some examples, the visual effect of movement has a speed that varies to represent different
conditions (e.g., actual door movement vs. impending door movement). In some examples,
when the door panel 14 is moving or is about to move, the lights 12 above the leading edge
24 are one color and the lights 12 below the leading edge 24 are a different color. This
                                                 -5-

creates a visual effect of movement while maintaining the full length of the series of lights 12
lit to help illuminate the passageway 18.
[0035]      In some examples, the lights 12 provide selectively a first signal and a second
signal that are distinguishable from each other by virtue of some characteristic such as
different colors, flashing vs. continuous, different flashing frequencies, different flashing
patterns, and different brightness. The distinguishable characteristic can be used for
indicating different operating conditions, such as actual door movement and impending door
movement.
[0036]      Referring to FIGS. 5 - 8, as an addition or alternative to the lights 12 distributed
along the doorframe 16, a door system 38 has a plurality of lights 40 borne by an enclosure
42 of a controller 44. Similar to the lights 12 of FIGS. 1 - 4, the lights 40 are individually
switchable between first and second states in a pattern that provides a visual effect of
movement related to the operation of the door system 38. When the lights 40 are distributed
in a circular layout, as shown in the illustrated example of FIGS. 5 - 8, the visual effect of
movement is rotational. In examples where the lights 40 are distributed in a linear layout on
the enclosure 42, the visual effect of movement is linear. Similar to the lights 12 of FIGS. 1
4, the lights 40 can be controlled in various ways, examples of which include visually
representing clockwise rotational movement, visually representing counterclockwise
rotational movement, visually representing horizontal movement, visually representing
vertical movement, varying an apparent speed of the visually represented movement,
selectively flashing a some or all of the lights simultaneously, individual discrete lights
selectively energized and de-energized, individual discrete lights selectively switched
between different colors, different signals indicating door movement or impending door
movement, and various combinations thereof.
[0037]      In some examples, an appreciable length of the doorframe 16 is made of a light
transmitting material (e.g., a clear material, a translucent material, and combinations thereof).
In such examples, one or more lights 15 project one or more light beams through the
doorframe 16 itself. In some examples, a single light 15 at an upper or lowered end of the
doorframe 16 projects a light beam vertically through the doorframe 16 to illuminate all or at
least much of the doorframe's length.
[0038]      FIGS. 9 and 10 show an example door system 45 that includes at least one light 46
installed along the leading edge 24 of the door panel 14. In the illustrated example, the
light(s) 46 not only highlights the panel's impact-vulnerable leading edge 24 but, in some
examples, also provides various visual signals that indicate the operating status of the door
                                                -6-

system 45. To avoid the difficulty and expense of having to run electrical power from an
external stationary power source to the light(s) 46 on the moving panel 14, in some examples,
the door system 45 includes a power storage unit 48 (e.g., battery, capacitor, super-capacitor,
etc.) mounted to the panel 14 so that both the power storage unit 48 and the light(s) 46
generally travel together.
[0039]     To prolong the power storage life of the power storage unit 48, the door system 45
includes means for minimizing power consumption. In some examples, the means for
reducing power consumption involves the door panel 14 carrying a door movement sensor 50
and a light activation circuit 52. Upon sensing door panel movement, the sensor 50 sends a
trigger signal 54 to the light activation circuit 52. In response to the trigger signal 54, the
light activation circuit 52 switches from a reduced-power sleep mode to an active mode. In
the active mode, the circuit 52 activates the light(s) 46 to illuminate the leading edge 24 of
the door panel 14. So, in some examples, the light(s) 46 are normally off but turn on when
the panel 14 is moving to open or close the door system 45.
[0040]     In some examples, the door movement sensor 50 is an extremely low power
component and, in some examples, it is the only fully active electrical component on the
panel 14 when the door system 45 is not in use (e.g., not being opened or closed). Although
the light activation circuit 52 in the active mode consumes more power than the sensor 50,
the light activation circuit 52 is only in its active mode when needed to activate the light(s)
46. Examples of electrical circuits switchable between active modes and low power sleep
modes are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples of the door movement
sensor 50 include an accelerometer and a micro-electromechanical machine pressure
transducer (MEMS).
[0041]     Examples of the light(s) 46 include a single illuminating element (e.g., an LED,
light bulb, etc.), a single illuminating element of a single color, a single illuminating element
functional to provide selectively different colors, multiple discrete illuminating elements,
multiple illuminating elements of a single color, multiple illuminating elements of different
colors, one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs), a rope light comprising a series of LEDs,
one or more incandescent bulbs, and one or more devices employing principles of fiber
optics.
[0042]     To avoid problems caused by intermittent or false trigger signals 54 from the sensor
50, some examples of the door system 45 further include a door operation sensor 56, which is
schematically illustrated to represent any device that can confirm the movement or position
of the door panel 14. To conserve power, some examples of the door operation sensor 56 are
                                                  -7-

inactive until the light activation circuit 52 or the door movement sensor 50 triggers it to
operate. When operating and confirming that the door panel 14 is either actually moving or
is neither fully open nor fully closed, the door operation sensor 56 commands the light
activation circuit 52 to keep the light(s) 46 energized regardless of any trigger signal 54 or
lack of signal 54 from the door movement sensor 50. In some examples, the door operation
sensor 56 is a motion sensor (e.g., passive infrared, laser, optical, ultrasonic, etc.) that detects
relative motion between the sensor 56 and a floor 58, or detects relative motion between the
sensor 56 and some other convenient target surface (e.g., ceiling, the doorframe 16, an
overhead surface 60 of the door system 45, etc.).
[0043]     In some examples, the door operation sensor 56 is directed laterally to detect one or
more reflectors 62 attached to the doorframe 16. Upon detecting one of the reflectors 62, the
sensor 56 can determine that the panel 14 is either fully open or closed. That information in
combination with a lack of the trigger signal 54 would strongly indicate that door panel 14 is
not moving, and thus, the light(s) 46 can be turned off. If the reflectors 62 are not in view of
the sensor 56 in the illustrated example, that would indicate the door panel 14 is moving or
has paused between the door panel's fully open and fully closed positions, and thus, the
light(s) 46 should be energized.
[0044]     In addition or alternatively, to confirm actual door panel movement, some examples
of the door system 45 include a wireless transmitter 64 associated with the controller 28 or
the drive unit 20. A wireless communication link 66 connects the transmitter 64 in wireless
communication with a wireless receiver 68 associated with the light activation circuit 52.
The communication link 66 conveys information from the drive unit 20 and/or from the
controller 28, wherein the information indicates whether the door panel 14 is moving, fully
closed, fully open or at some partially open position. To conserve energy, the light activation
circuit 52 and the wireless receiver 68 remain generally inactive until the trigger signal 54
from the door movement sensor 50 switches the light activation circuit 52 from its sleep
mode to its active mode. That is, in some examples, the light activation circuit 52 and the
wireless receiver 68 disregard wireless signals transmitted via the communication link 66
when the light activation circuit 52 is in the sleep mode. In some examples, once the light
activation circuit 52 is switched to the active mode (based on the trigger signal 54), the
wireless signal from the transmitter 64 maintains the light activation circuit 52 in the active
mode (e.g., until the trigger signal 54 and the wireless signal indicate the door panel is no
longer moving).
                                                 -8-

[0045]     In some examples, a charging system 70 periodically (or aperiodically) recharges
the power storage unit 48 automatically when the door panel 14 is fully closed, fully open or
at some other charging position. When the leading edge 24 of the door panel 14 is at the
charging position, as shown in the illustrated example of FIG. 10, the charging system 70
conveys a charging power 72 from an external power source 74 to recharge the power storage
unit 48. When the leading edge 24 of the door panel 14 is not at the charging position, the
leading edge 24 may be within a range of self-powered positions 76, as shown in the
illustrated example of FIG. 9. When the leading edge 24 is within the range of self-powered
positions 76 (i.e., not in the charging position), the charging system 70 inhibits the charging
power 72 from reaching the power storage unit 48. In such examples, the stored charge in the
power storage unit 48 is what powers the light(s) 46 as the door opens and closes.
[0046]     The charging system 70 is schematically illustrated to represent any separable
electrical coupling between the power storage unit 48 and the external power source 74.
Examples of the charging system 70 include an inductive coupling, a mating electrical plug
and receptacle, and an electrically conductive brush with an associated electrical contact
surface.
[0047]     In some examples, the charging system 70 is an inductive coupling that, when the
door system 45 is closed, recharges a super-capacitor form of the power storage unit 48.
Super-capacitors charge relatively quickly, which is an important feature with doors that are
operated frequently. Some batteries take longer to charge but can store more energy, so
rechargeable batteries can work well with doors that have extended periods of use and
extended periods of non-use. For instance, a battery form of power storage unit 48 might be
useful for doors that are extremely busy during the day but are left closed for most of the
night, whereby the battery can be recharged with enough power during the night to meet all
of the power needs for the next day.
[0048]     Some examples of door system 45 include an ambient light sensor 55. In response
to input from the light sensor 55, the light activation circuit 52 adjusts the power to the
light(s) 46. To conserve power and prolong the life of the power storage unit 48, the light
activation circuit 52 delivers less power to the light(s) 46 during low ambient light conditions
and delivers more power during high ambient light conditions.
[0049]     FIGS. 11 - 16 show an example door system 78 for separating a personnel area 80
from a work area 82. In the illustrated example, a machine tool 84 is shown performing a
work-in-process in the work area 82 such as machining a part 86 or performing some other
process (e.g., assembling, mixing, painting, heating, forming, cleaning, welding, sorting,
                                                -9-

etc.). A machine tool operator 88 is shown in the personnel area 80, and a closed door panel
14 shields the operator 88 from the work as it is being performed between a start time and a
completion time of the work-in-process. Upon completion of the work, a controller 90
commands the drive unit 20 to move a leading edge 24 of the door panel 14 from a closed
position 92 to an open position 94 to unblock a passageway 96 (FIG. 16) between the work
area 82 and the personnel area 80.
[0050]     In some examples, the controller 90 is a door controller 98 for the door panel 14 of
the door system 78 and is separate from a machine controller 102 of the machine tool 84.
The term, "door controller" refers to a device dedicated to the operation of a door and not to
any machine being shielded by the door. The term, "machine controller" refers to a device
primarily meant for commanding the operation of a process other than just opening or closing
a door. In some examples, the controller 90 is a combination of both the door controller 98
and the machine controller 102.
[0051]     In some examples, the controller 90 commands the door system 78 to emit a first
signal 100 from one or more signal generators (e.g., an audio speaker, a light source, etc.) that
notifies the operator 88 when the door system 78 will be opening soon due to the work-in
process nearing completion or the work-in-process being within a predetermined period prior
to completion. This provides the operator 88 with some time to prepare for the next job or
least prepare for attending to the current one prior to the door system 78 opening. In some
examples, when the work-in-process is completed, the controller 90 commands the door
system 78 to open automatically in response to a job-complete feedback 104 from the
machine controller 102 to the door controller 98.
[0052]     In some examples, the first signal 100 occurs closer to the process's completion
time than to its start time. Examples of the first signal 100 include an audible signal and/or a
visual signal. Referring to FIG. 14, more specific examples of the first signal 100 include
one or more lights (similar to the lights 12 of FIG. 1) distributed along the doorframe 16 of
the door system 78, the controller 90 emitting a light (first signal 100a), a leading edge 24 of
the door panel 14 emitting a light (first signal 100b), the controller 90 projecting (e.g., via a
light projector or other light source) onto the door panel 14 a light or image (first signal
100c), and the controller 90 emitting (e.g., via a speaker) a sound (first signal 100d). In some
examples, the first signal 100c is a projected image of a clock or countdown timer that
indicates the amount of time before the door system 78 will begin opening and/or the amount
of time before the work-in-process will be completed. Additionally, or alternatively, in some
                                                - 10 -

examples, the first signals 100a, 100b may be adapted to indicate the time associated with
such a clock or countdown timer.
[0053]     In addition or alternatively, in some examples, the door system 78 emits a second
signal 105 that indicates the door panel 14 is actually moving, as shown in FIG. 16.
Examples of the second signal 105 include an audible signal and/or a visual signal. An
audible version of the second signal 105 can be at any convenient location. Example
locations of visual versions of the second signal 105 include on the controller 90, on the door
panel 14, on the doorframe 16, etc. Referring to FIG. 16, specific examples of the second
signal 105 include one or more lights (similar to the lights 12 of FIG. 1) distributed along the
doorframe 16, the controller 90 emitting a light (second signal 105a), the leading edge 24
emitting a light (second signal 105b), and the controller 90 emitting a sound (second signal
105c). In some examples, the first signal 100 and the second signal 105 are distinguishable
from each other by virtue of some characteristic such as different colors, flashing vs.
continuous, audible vs. visual, different flashing frequencies, different flashing patterns,
different locations (e.g., on doorframe 16 and on leading edge 24), and different levels of
brightness.
[0054]     One example operation of the door system 78 is as shown in FIGS. 11 - 16
sequentially. FIG. 11 shows the door system 78 closed with the work-in-process about to
begin. FIG. 12 shows the work-in-process having already started. FIG. 13 shows further
progress of the work-in-process. FIG. 14 shows the emitting of the first signal 100 (e.g., at
least one of the first signals 100a, 100b, 100c, 100d) as an indication that the work-in-process
is nearly complete. FIG. 15 shows the work-in-process at completion. FIG. 16 shows the
emitting of the second signal 105 (e.g., at least one of the second signals 105a, 105b, 105c) as
an indication that the door system 78 is opening at the end of the work-in-process cycle.
[0055]     FIGS. 17, 18 and 19 show an example door system 106, wherein at least a portion
108 of the door panel 14 and/or at least a portion 109 of the doorframe 16 changes color in
response to a change in a thermodynamic condition existing proximate the door system 106.
Examples of such thermodynamic conditions include a temperature of a first area 110
adjacent a first side of the door panel 14, a temperature of a second area 112 adjacent a
second side of the door panel 14, a temperature of the doorframe 16, a temperature of the
door panel 14, a humidity of the first area 110, and a humidity of the second area 112. In
some examples, the first area 110 is a refrigerated room for storing perishable goods 114, and
the door panel 14 is thermally insulated.
                                                - 11 -

[0056]     In some examples, the portion 108 and/or the portion 109 is thermochromic and
thereby changes color in response to its temperature. In other examples, the controller 28
receives a feedback signal 116 from a thermodynamic sensor 118 (e.g., temperature sensor,
humidity sensor, barometric pressure sensor, etc.). Based on the feedback signal 116, the
controller 28 projects light 120 of different colors to represent the changing thermodynamic
conditions measured by the sensor 118. In some examples, the light 120 is projected onto the
portion 108 and/or the portion 109 to change their color without the portions 108, 109 having
to be of a thermochromic material.
[0057]     FIG. 20 shows an example door system 122 having a matrix display 124 having a
two-dimensional array of lights 126 that is communicatively coupled to the controller 44. In
some examples, the lights 126 are different colors to render icons, symbols, and/or
animations on the matrix display 124 having one or more colors based on input from the
controller 44. In some examples, the shapes of the icons and/or symbols are such that a brief
glance at the matrix display 124 quickly indicates to an observer the operational status of the
door system 122. For example, a down arrow (as shown) may indicate the door panel 14 is
closing (or about to close) whereas an up arrow may indicate the door panel 14 is opening (or
about to open). Further, in some examples, different colors of the icons and/or symbols, the
use of flashing and/or animation indicates the importance of the icon and/or symbol. For
example, a yellow down arrow may signify the door panel 14 is about to close (e.g.,
preannounces the closing) while a red down arrow may signify the door panel 14 is actually
closing. A green square may indicate the door panel 14 is opening and waiting for further
input while a green timer (e.g., a clock or an hourglass icon) may indicate the door is open
but on a timer. In some such examples, the clock or hourglass is animated to indicate how
much time remains before the door is to close. In some examples, a red octagon may indicate
the door panel 14 is closed but is about to open (e.g., preannounces the opening). In some
examples, a prohibition symbol (e.g., a circle with a slash through it) may indicate the
interlock is disabled while an inverted triangle may serve as a warning of cross traffic. In
some examples, the matrix display 124 may render an exclamation point to indicate a
maintenance alert. In some examples, a large X on the matrix display 124 may indicate the
door system 122 has faulted. Other icons and/or symbols may alternatively be used to
represent other operational states and/or any of the operational states mentioned above.
Further, any of the icons and/or symbols described above may be in any color capable to be
rendered by the matrix display 124. In some examples, if the matrix display 124 loses
communication with the controller 44, the matrix display 124 will generate a fault icon.
                                               - 12 -

[0058]     In some examples, the matrix display 124 is used in conjunction with the lights 12
on the doorframe 16, the lights 40 on the enclosure 42 of the controller 44, and/or any of the
other example door systems described herein. In other examples, the matrix display 124 is
used instead of the other example door systems described herein. In some examples, the
matrix display 124 is positioned above the passageway 18 of the door. Additionally or
alternatively, in some examples, the matrix display 124 is positioned to the side of the
passageway 18. In some examples, the matrix display 124 is incorporated into the enclosure
of the controller 44. The matrix display 124 may be of any suitable size to enable an
observer to easily identify the icons or symbols rendered thereon after a brief glance. In
some examples, the matrix display 124 is approximately 8x8 inches with 32x32 lights 126.
[0059]     Although certain example methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture have
been described herein, the scope of the coverage of this patent is not limited thereto. On the
contrary, this patent covers all methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture fairly falling
within the scope of the appended claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.
