                 SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR COLLECTING AND
                                VIEWING PATIENT DATA
                                       BACKGROUND
 [0001]      Implementations of the present disclosure are directed to displaying patient
data and/or information on mobile devices.
 [0002]      While physicians and other health care providers currently utilize a large
number of products and systems that benefit from advances in wireless communication
technology, there are still significant limitations to the information that can be
transmitted, received, and displayed over these devices in a practical and efficient
manner. There are many limitations that are intrinsic to mobile devices, especially those
constraints related to speed, performance, memory, and display size. In addition, because
of the critical nature of medical data, it is important that the technology work reliably and
efficiently over potentially low speed, low bandwidth, and sometimes intermittent
wireless connections.
                                          SUMMARY
 [0003]      Implementations of the present disclosure are generally directed to methods
including actions of receiving, by a tablet computing device, one or more signals
reflective of patient data associated with one or more patients, the tablet computing
device being provided in a patient monitoring system that monitors physiological
characteristics of a patient of the one or more patients, at least a first sub-set of the patient
data being associated with the patient and being provided from one or more sensors that
are responsive to the physiological characteristics of the patient, processing the patient
data to generate one or more graphical representations reflective of the patient data, and
displaying the one or more graphical representations on a touchscreen display of the
tablet computing device.
 [0004]      In some implementations, the one or more sensors are in direct
communication with the tablet computing device within the patient monitoring system.
 [0005]      In some implementations, direct communication includes at least one of wired
communication and wireless communication.
                                                I

 WO 2013/158497                                                           PCT/US2013/036404
 [0006]      In some implementations, a second sub-set of the patient data is provided
from an information system associated with a facility within which the one or more
patients are treated.
 [0007]      In some implementations, a third sub-set of the patient data is provided from a
data management system (DMS).
 [0008]      In some implementations, the one or more graphical representations include
waveforms based on the first sub-set of patient data.
 [0009]      In some implementations, the one or more graphical representations comprise
waveforms associated with physiological characteristics of a plurality of patients of the
one or more patients.
 [0010]      In some implementations, actions further include determining that the tablet
computing device is docked in a docking station of the patient monitoring system, and in
response, executing the tablet computing device in a single application mode. In some
examples, when operating in the single application mode, the tablet computing device is
only able to execute a patient monitoring application for receiving the one or more
signals, processing the patient data and generating the one or more graphical
representations. In some examples, actions further include, in response to determining
that the tablet computing device is docked in the docking station, disabling functionality
of one or more buttons of the tablet computing device. In some examples, the one or
more buttons include a home button and a sleep/wake button. In some examples, actions
further include receiving user input including authentication data, determining that the
user input corresponds to an authenticated user, and in response, exiting the single
application mode such that the tablet computing device is able to execute a plurality of
computer program applications.
 [0011]      Other aspects of the present disclosure provide systems including one or more
processors, and a computer-readable medium coupled to the one or more processors
having instructions stored thereon which, when executed by the one or more processors,
cause the one or more processors to perform one or more of the methods provided herein.
 [0012]      It is appreciated that methods in accordance with the present disclosure can
include any combination of the aspects and features described herein. That is to say that
methods in accordance with the present disclosure are not limited to the combinations of
                                               2

                               DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 [0020]     The present disclosure provides a healthcare provider with secure, remote
access to patient data. For purposes of the instant description, and by way of non
limiting example, implementations of the present disclosure will be described in the
context of patient data corresponding to maternity patients (e.g., obstetric (OB) patient).
Implementations of the present disclosure are applicable to any variety of patients and
corresponding patient data.
 [0021]     Referring now to FIG. 1, an example system architecture 10 is illustrated, and
includes a remote device 12, connectivity interface(s) 14, a network 16, a first facility
system 18, and a second facility system 20. As discussed in further detail herein, data is
transferred from each of the first and second facility systems 18, 20 through the network
16 and connectivity interface(s) 14 for presentation, or display on the remote device 12.
                                               3

  WO 2013/158497                                                           PCT/US2013/036404
Further, data can be transferred from the remote device 12 through the connectivity
interface(s) 14 and network 16 to each of the first and second facility systems 18, 20.
Although a single remote device 12 is illustrated, it is contemplated that one or more
remote devices 12 can communicate with each of the first and second facility systems 18,
20 through the network 16 and connectivity interface(s) 14. Similarly, although two
facility systems are illustrated, the present disclosure can be implemented with one or
more facility systems.
 [0022]      The remote device 12 can include any number of example devices. Such
example devices include, but are not limited to, a mobile phone, a smartphone, a personal
digital assistant (PDA), a laptop, a tablet personal computer (PC), a desktop PC, and/or
combinations thereof. The remote device 12 includes a display 22, a processor 24,
memory 26, an input interface 28, and a communication interface 30. The processor 24
can process instructions for execution of implementations of the present disclosure. The
instructions can include, but are not limited to, instructions stored in the memory 26 to
display graphical information on the display 22. Example displays include, but are not
limited to, a thin-film-transistor (TFT) liquid crystal display (LCD), or an organic light
emitting diode (OLED) display.
 [0023]      The memory 26 stores information within the remote device 12. In some
implementations, the memory 26 can include a volatile memory unit or units, and/or a
non-volatile memory unit or units. In other implementations, removable memory can be
provided, and can include, but is not limited to, a memory card. Example memory cards
can include, but are not limited to, a secure digital (SD) memory card, a mini-SD memory
card, a USB stick, and the like.
 [0024]      The input interface 28 can include, but is not limited to, a keyboard, a
touchscreen, a mouse, a trackball, a microphone, a touchpad, and/or combinations
thereof In some implementations, an audio codec (not shown) can be provided, which
receives audible input from a user or other source through a microphone, and converts the
audible input to usable digital information. The audio codec can generate audible sound,
such as through a speaker that is provided with the remote device 12. Such sound may
include, but is not limited to, sound from voice telephone calls, recorded sound (e.g.,
                                                4

  WO 2013/158497                                                            PCT/US2013/036404
voice messages, music files, etc.), and sound generated by applications operating on the
remote device 12.
 [0025]       The remote device 12 may communicate wirelessly through the
communication interface(s) 14, which can include digital signal processing circuitry. The
communication interface(s) 14 may provide communications under various modes or
protocols including, but not limited to, GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS or MMS messaging,
CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, and/or GPRS. Such communication may
occur, for example, through a radio-frequency transceiver (not shown). Further, the
remote device can be capable of short-range communication using features including, but
not limited to, Bluetooth and/or WiFi transceivers (not shown).
 [0026]       The remote device 12 communicates with the network 16 through the
connectivity interface(s) 14. The connectivity interface(s) 14 can include, but is not
limited to, a satellite receiver, cellular network, a Bluetooth system, a Wi-Fi system (e.g.,
802.x), a cable modem, a DSL/dial-up interface, and/or a private branch exchange (PBX)
system. Each of these connectivity interfaces 14 enables data to be transmitted to/from
the network 16. The network 16 can be provided as a local area network (LAN), a wide
area network (WAN), a wireless LAN (WLAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a
personal area network (PAN), the Internet, and/or combinations thereof
 [0027]       In the example systems of FIGs. 1 and 2, the first facility system 18 includes a
plurality of facilities 40, and the second facility system 20 includes a facility 40. It is
contemplated that each facility system 18, 20 can include one or more facilities, and is
not limited to the example arrangement described herein. In the case of multiple
facilities, the facilities can be remotely located from one another, and/or can be located at
a common location, or site (e.g., separate departments in a common building). Each
facility system 18, 20 can be provided as a medical care system, for example, which
medical care system can include one or more hospitals, hospital systems, clinics,
physician offices, and the like.
 [0028]       Each facility 40 includes an associated information system 42, computer
interface(s) 44, and patient monitoring device(s) 46. Example information systems can
include, but are not limited to, a clinical information system (CIS), and/or a hospital
information system (HIS). Each information system 42 can be provided as a server, and
                                                5

  WO 2013/158497                                                            PCT/US2013/036404
supports the acquisition, storage, modification, and distribution of clinical information,
such as patient data, throughout the facility 40 and/or facility system 18, 20. Each
information system 42 can communicate with one or more ancillary information systems
(not shown) that can include, but are not limited to, a pharmacy management system, a
laboratory management system, and/or a radiology management system. Although the
example system architecture 10 includes an information system 42 located at each facility
40, it is contemplated that the facilities 40 can communicate with a common information
system 42 that is remotely located from either facility 40, or that is located at one of the
facilities 40 within the facility system 18, 20.
 [0029]      The computer interface 44 can communicate with the information system 42
to enable access to information that is stored within, and managed by the information
system 42. The computer interface 44 can include, but is not limited to, a personal
computer (PC) (e.g., desktop, laptop, or tablet). Although a single computer interface 44
is illustrated in the example architectures described herein, it is contemplated that one or
more computer interfaces 44 can communicate with the information system 42.
Communication between each computer interface 44 and the information system 42 can
be achieved via a direct connection, or remotely through a network (not shown) that can
include, but is not limited to, a LAN, a WAN, a WLAN, and/or the Internet.
 [0030]      Each patient monitoring device 46 monitors physiological characteristics of a
particular patient 50, and generates data signals based thereon. As discussed in further
detail herein, implementations of the present disclosure provide patient monitoring
devices that include a computing device, such as a tablet computing device. The data
signals are communicated to the information system 42, which collects patient data based
thereon, and stores the data to a patient profile that is associated with the particular
patient. Although a single patient monitoring device 46 is illustrated per each patient 50,
it is contemplated that multiple patient monitoring devices 46 can monitor a particular
patient 50. The patient monitoring device(s) 46 can communicate with the information
system 42 via a direct connection, or remotely through a network (not shown) that can
include, but is not limited to, a LAN, a WAN, a WLAN, and/or the Internet.
 [0031]      The patient data is made available for display on the computer device 44. A
healthcare provider (e.g., a nurse and/or physician) can augment the patient data by
                                                6

 WO 2013/158497                                                            PCT/US2013/036404
inputting patient information that is also stored to the information system 44. More
specifically, the healthcare provider can input patient information corresponding to a
particular patient 50, which patient information can be stored to the patient profile. By
way of one non-limiting example, a nurse can input nursing notes, which nursing notes
can be stored to the patient profile in the information system. As used herein, the term
patient information includes any information corresponding to a patient that is input and
stored to the information system 42 through the computer interface 44. Patient
information is discussed in further detail below.
 [0032]      As discussed above, each information system 42 stores patient data that can be
collected from the patient monitoring devices 46, as well as additional patient
information, that can include information that is input by a healthcare provider. The
information system 44 communicates the patient data and/or the additional patient data to
a data management system (DMS) 60. The DMS 60 can be provided as a server, or a
virtual server, that runs server software components, and can include data storage
including, but not limited to, a database and/or flat files. In the example system
architecture of FIG. 1, each facility system 18, 20 includes a corresponding DMS 60. In
such an arrangement, each information system 42 communicates patient data, and/or
additional patient data to the DMS 60. Furthermore, and as discussed in further detail
below, the DMS 60 can communicate ancillary information to the information system 42.
Communication between the DMS 60 and the information system(s) 42 can be achieved
via a direct connection, or remotely through a network (not shown) that can include, but
is not limited to, a LAN, a WAN, a WLAN, and/or the Internet.
 [0033]      A DMS 60 corresponding to a particular facility system can be remotely
located from any of the facilities 40 of the facility system 18, 20, or can be located at a
particular facility 40 of the facility system 18, 20. In the example system architecture of
FIG. 1, the DMS 60 is remotely located from either facility 40 within each of the facility
systems 18, 20. It is contemplated, however, that the DMS 60 can be located at one of
the facilities 40, and remote from the other facility 40.
 [0034]      In the example system architecture of FIG. 2, a common DMS 60' is provided.
The common DMS 60' is common to various facility systems 18, 20, and is not
associated with a particular facility system 18, 20. Each information system 42
                                                7

 WO 2013/158497                                                            PCT/US2013/036404
communicates with the DMS 60' via a direct connection, or remotely through a network
(not shown) that can include, but is not limited to, a LAN, a WAN, a WLAN, and/or the
Internet. In the example arrangement of FIG. 2, the DMS 60' communicates with each of
the information systems 42 through the network 16. The information systems 42
communicate patient data and/or patient information to the DMS 60', and the DMS 60'
can communicate ancillary information to the information system 42, as discussed in
further detail below.
 [0035]     In the example system architecture of FIG. 1, the facility 40, or facility system
18, 20 installs the DMS 60 as a local DMS, and the DMS 60 sits at the local site with
other servers that can include, but are not limited to, the information system 42. In some
implementations, the DMS 60 can be sectioned off, or separated from a logical network
perspective, but still physically exists with the other servers that belong to the respective
facility 40. Server components are installed on the DMS 60, which components can
include, but are not limited to, a database component, a database synchronization
component, a web services component, and/or a structured query language (SQL)
component. An information system interface can also be installed on the DMS 60, and
functions as the interface to the information system 42. By way of non-limiting example,
the information system interface can include OBLink, provided by GE Healthcare. In
some implementations, the DMS 60 can be arranged in a multiple server configuration, in
which one server only hosts web service related components and is logically segregated,
and another server has the remaining necessary server components installed.
 [0036]     The example system architecture of FIG. 2, provides for the remote location
of data collection at the DMS 60'. In such implementations, the DMS 60' can be
provided at a third-party site, remote from any of the facilities 40, or facility systems 18,
20. The third-party functions as a DMS host, and the necessary server components are
installed on the remotely hosted DMS 60'. In some implementations, a business-to
business (B2B) virtual private network (VPN) can be created between the remotely
hosted DMS 60' and the network of the facility 40 or facility system 18, 20. In this
manner, the facility 40 and/or facility system 18, 20 forgoes the purchase and/or
maintenance of another physical server, or DMS 60. Further, the up-time and the status
of availability of the DMS 60' are easier to manage on the part of a dedicated third-party.
                                                8

 WO 2013/158497                                                            PCT/US2013/036404
The DMS' access to the network can be attended to by the third-party, as opposed to
burdening the facility 40, or the facility systems 18, 20. Further, the third-party can
implement virtual server technologies to leverage multiple DMS installations on a single
physical server. In such implementations, a plurality of virtual servers are logically
partitioned in a single physical server, and each virtual server has the capability of
running its own operating system and server components, and can be independently
booted.
 [0037]     The DMS 60, 60' synchronizes and transfers data between the remote device
12, or multiple remote devices 12, and the information system 42, or multiple information
systems 42. More specifically, the DMS 60, 60' processes and prepares the patient data
and/or patient information for transfer to and presentation on the remote device 12, or
multiple remote devices 12, from the information system 42. The DMS 60, 60' also
processes and prepares ancillary information for transfer to and storage in the information
system 42 from the remote device 12, or multiple remote devices 12 for potential
presentation at a corresponding computer device 44. Example DMSs can include, but are
not limited to, the AirStrip Server provided by AirStrip Technologies, LLC, which
AirStrip Server includes AirStrip Server Components installed therein.
 [0038]     Referring now to FIG. 3 an example system architecture 10" is illustrated,
and includes a facility system 40, a network 16, and a DMS 60'. As discussed in further
detail herein, the facility system 40 includes one or more patient monitoring devices 46',
an information system 42, and a computer interface 44.
 [0039]     Although a single patient monitoring device 46' is illustrated in the example
architecture 10", it is contemplated that one or more patient monitoring device(s) 46' can
be integrated in the system architecture. In some examples, patient monitoring device(s)
46' can be located within the facility system 40. In some examples, patient monitoring
device(s) 46' can be located within and/or outside of the facility system 40. For example,
a patient monitoring device 46' can be located at a patient's home (e.g., for in-home
care). Communication between the patient monitoring device 46', the information system
42 and/or the DMS 60' can be achieved via a direct connection, and/or remotely through
one or more networks (e.g., the network 16) that can include, but is not limited to, a
LAN, a WAN, a WLAN, and/or the Internet.

 [0040]     In accordance with implementations of the present disclosure, the patient
monitoring device 46' can include a tablet computing device 46a and one or more data
collection systems 46b. In some examples, the tablet computing device 46a can execute
one or more computer program applications to display patient data waveforms (patient
waveforms) based on data received from the one or more data collection systems 46b. In
some examples, the data collection systems 46b include one or more peripheral devices
(e.g., sensors) that are responsive to physiological characteristics of a patient (e.g., the
patient 50). Example peripheral devices can include, but are not limited, a blood pressure
monitoring device, a heart rate monitoring device, a fetal heart rate monitoring device, a
contraction monitoring device, an electrocardiograms (ECG) device, and/or any other
appropriate device that is responsive the physiological characteristics of a patient and that
generates data signals based thereon.
 [0041]     FIG. 4 depicts an example sub-architecture that indicates example
communication paths between various components (e.g., provided in FIG. 3). In the
depicted example, a tablet computing device 46a (operating as a patient monitoring
device) communicates with one or more of a DMS 60, 60', an information system 42
(identified as a vendor data collection system) and one or more peripheral devices 46b. In
some implementations, the tablet computing device 46a communicates with the DMS 60,
60' and/or the information system 42 over one or more networks (e.g., the network 16).
In some examples, the tablet computing device 46a communicates with the one or more
peripheral devices 46b over one or more networks (e.g., the network 16), directly (e.g., a
wired connection) and/or wirelessly (e.g., Bluetooth@ connection). In some examples,
one or more of the peripheral devices 46b can communicate with the information system
42 over one or more networks (e.g., the network 16). In some examples, communication
with the information system 42 can occur through a gateway 41. In this manner, devices
communicating with the information system 41 can be authenticated prior to data transfer
between the information system 42 and the devices.
 [0042]     In some implementations, the tablet computing device 46a receives patient
data from the one or more peripheral devices 46b. In some examples, the tablet
computing device 46a processes the patient data and displays graphical representations of
the patient data. Example graphical representations can include patient waveforms,

 WO 2013/158497                                                            PCT/US2013/036404
textual data, alarms and/or indicators. In some examples, the tablet computing device 46a
provides the patient data received from the one or peripheral devices to one or more of
the DMS 60, 60' and the information system 42. In some examples, the tablet computing
device 46a provides the patient data to the information system 42 and the information
system 42 provides the patient data to the DMS 60, 60' (as discussed above). In some
implementations, one or more of the peripheral devices 46b provides the patient data to
the information system 42 and the information system 42 can provide the patient data to
the tablet computing device 46a and/or the DMS 60, 60'. In some examples, the DMS
provides data (e.g., ancillary data) to the tablet computing device 46a and/or the
information system 42.
 [0043]      In some implementations, each tablet computing device 46a receives
physiological data of a particular patient 50 and monitors the physiological characteristics
of the particular patient. In some implementations, each tablet computing device 46a
receives physiological data of multiple particular patients 50 and monitors the
physiological characteristics of the multiple patients. In this manner, for example, a
healthcare provider can review patient data for any one of multiple patients from any
location. For example, the tablet computing device 46a can be located within a room of a
first patient and can be receiving patient data associated with the first patient from one or
more peripheral devices 46b. A healthcare provider can access the tablet computing
device 46a in the room of the first patient to retrieve and display patient data associated
with a second patient (e.g., retrieve the patient data associated with the second patient
from the information system 42).
 [0044]      In some implementations, the tablet computing device 46a executes one or
more computer programs to provide a variety of services. Example services can include
information display, charting, querying, retrieving and displaying electronic medical
records (EMRs), reviewing and interacting with historical waveforms, image generation
and/or teleconferencing (e.g. from caregiver to caregiver and/or caregiver to patient).
 [0045]      In some implementations, the tablet computing device 46a includes a
touchscreen display that enables user interaction with the tablet computing device 46a.
For example, a user (e.g., a healthcare provider) can interact with the touchscreen display
to request the display of patient data, waveforms, digital images, digital video, EMRs and
                                                11

 WO 2013/158497                                                               PCT/US2013/036404
the like. In some examples, and as discussed in further detail below with regard to FIGs.
9A-9J, the user can perform historical scrolling of patient waveform data using the
touchscreen display. The historical scrolling of patient waveform data can be
bidirectional, enabling the user to scroll through older or more recent medical data and
chart data at specified intervals.
 [0046]      In some implementations, the tablet computing device 46a can include a
camera and software that enables acquisition of digital images and/or digital video. In
some examples, the tablet computing device 46a can include a microphone for capturing
audio (e.g., dictated notes). In this manner, a healthcare provider can use the tablet
computing device 46a to generate digital images, digital video and/or digital audio
associated with the patient (e.g., images tracking wound care). One or more electronic
files including the digital image, digital video and/or digital audio can be provided to one
or more of the information system 42 and the DMS 60, 60'. In some examples, the
electronic files can be appended to, or otherwise become part of an EMR associated with
the patient. In some examples, a tele- and/or video-conference can be established between
a user of the tablet computing device 46a and a user of another, remote computing
device. For example, a first healthcare provider (e.g., a nurse) can use the tablet
computing device 46a and a second healthcare provider (e.g., a doctor) can use a remote
device (e.g., the remote device 12, discussed above). A tele- and/or video-conference can
be established between the first healthcare provider and the second healthcare provider
using the tablet computing device 46a and the remote device.
 [0047]      In some implementations, the digital imaging, digital videoing and/or
conferencing (tele/video) functionality can be provided by a patient monitoring
application executed on the tablet computing device 46a. In this manner, for example,
resultant data (e.g., digital image files, digital video files, digital audio files) can be
automatically associated with one or more patients, can be appended to respective EMRs
associated with the one or more patients, and/or can be automatically transferred to one
or more of the information system 42 and the DMS 60, 60'.
 [0048]      In some implementations, if a physiological parameter exceeds a
predetermined range (e.g. blood pressure increases or decreases significantly, a cardiac
event occurs and/or oxygen saturation drops), a visual and/or audible alarm can be
                                                 12

 WO 2013/158497                                                            PCT/US2013/036404
activated. In some examples, the tablet computing device 46a can generate the visual
and/or audible alarm. In some implementations, the tablet computing device 46a can be
used to dismiss the alarm.
 [0049]      In some implementations, the tablet computing device 46a can be configured
to operate in a single application mode. In the single application mode, the tablet
computing device 46a executes a single application (e.g., a patient monitoring
application) and prevents execution of other applications. For example, the tablet
computing device 46a can be executing a patient monitoring application as part of a
patient monitoring device 46' for a particular patient. With the tablet computing device
46a executing in the single application, the patient and/or visitors visiting the patient are
prevented from accessing the tablet computing device 46a to execute other applications
on the tablet computing device. In this manner, the tablet computing device 46a is set to
display only the medical data acquired from the patient, or multiple patients.
 [0050]      In some implementations, functionality of the tablet computing device 46a can
be locked out. For example, functionality that would normally execute in response to user
input (e.g., user contact with the touchscreen display, user contact with one or more
buttons) can be prevented from execution in response to user input. In some examples,
one or more application program interfaces (APIs) associated with input devices (e.g., the
touchscreen, buttons (home button, sleep/wake button) can be accessed to instruct
prevent functionality from executing in response to user input. In this manner, the tablet
computing device 46a can execute as instructed (e.g., as a patient monitor) without
interruption.
 [0051]      In some implementations, the single application mode and/or the functionality
lockout can be overridden. For example, an authorized user can provide credentials (e.g.,
username and password) to override the single application mode and/or the functionality
lockout.
 [0052]      FIG. 5 illustrates an example monitoring system 500 (e.g., patient monitoring
device 46'). In some implementations, the monitoring system 500 includes the tablet
computing device 46a and a docking station 502. For example, the tablet computing
device 46a can be securely docked with the docking station 502. In some example, the
docking station 502 is mounted on a mobile stand, allowing facile displacement. In the
                                              13

 WO 2013/158497                                                            PCT/US2013/036404
depicted example, the tablet computing device 46a is displaying fictitious patient data
associated with a fictitious patient, the patient data reflecting physiological data
associated with cardiovascular characteristics of the fictitious patient. It is appreciated,
however, that other physiological data can also be retrieved, monitored and displayed by
the tablet computing device 46a.
 [0053]      FIG. 6A and 6B provide a detailed representation of an example docking
station 600. In some implementations, as seen in FIG. 6B, the docking station 600 can
include multiple ports for wired connection with peripheral devices (e.g., the peripheral
devices 46b). In some examples, the ports are compatible with standard medical devices
to acquire physiological data (e.g. ECG signals, blood pressure waveforms, heart rate,
etc.). As depicted in FIG. 6B, the tablet computing device 46a can be docked with the
docking station 600. In the depicted example, the tablet computing device 46a slides into
a slot that is arranged to receive the tablet computing device 46a. In some examples, the
tablet computing device 46a can be locked into the docking station 600 to prevent
removal of the tablet computing device 46a. For example, a locking mechanism can be
provided and can require a key or other unlocking means (e.g., code) to release the tablet
computing device 46a from the docking station 600.
 [0054]      In some examples, the tablet computing device 46a can be in electrical
communication with the docking station 46a. In some examples, the docking station 600
receives electrical signals from the peripheral devices and can provide the signals to the
tablet computing device in real-time. In some examples, electrical communication
between the tablet computing device and the docking station can be achieved via wired
communication and/or wireless communication (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth @). In some
implementations, the docking station 600 can be plugged into an electrical source (e.g.,
an outlet) and can charge the battery of the tablet computing device 46a. In some
implementations, as illustrated by FIG. 6B, the docking station 600 can be tilted at
different angles, enabling the user to choose the most convenient angle for viewing
and/or interacting with the tablet computing device 46a (monitor).
 [0055]      In some implementations, communication between the tablet computing
device 46a and the docking station 600 can trigger operation of the tablet computing
device 46a in the single application mode. In some examples, in response to the tablet
                                                14

computing device 46a being docked into the docking station 600, the single application
mode can be automatically triggered. In some examples, in response to the tablet
computing device 46a establishing communication with the docking station 600, the
single application mode can be automatically triggered.
