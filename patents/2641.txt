   Detailed Description
                                            9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                                 - 12
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller having components that enable the
   implementation of a game where the player can select
 5 between a different game options which affect the
   formation of a set of symbols used to generate a game
   outcome. Depending on the selected option a different
   numbers of symbol positions on the reels are activated to
   be populated with mystery symbols, that is a symbol
10 selected at random from a mystery symbol set. In an
   embodiment, game play options correspond to an
   incrementing number of reels having activated symbol
   positions.  In   an embodiment,  the same mystery symbol is
   selected at   random for each reel.   In another embodiment,                       a
15 mystery symbol is    separately randomly selected for each
   reel. Once a set of symbols has been formed, a game
   outcome is generated and valuated. Awards are made for
   winning combinations.
20 In an embodiment, a feature game comprising a plurality of
   free games may be activated. In the free games the same
   mystery symbol is selected at random for each reel. When
   the mystery symbol appears on one or more designated
   reels, occurrences of the mystery symbol on the designated
25 reels are changed into a wild symbol before being
   evaluated.
   General construction of gaming system
30 The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
35 In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
                                                9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                              - 13
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
 5 gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
lo and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
15 wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.     For example,
   the gaming system may operate in standalone gaming machine
   mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending
20 on the game being played, operating conditions, and so on.
   Other variations will be apparent to persons skilled in
   the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
25 core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
30 input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
35 embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
                                             9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                               - 14
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions          (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
 5 The game controller 60 is in data communication with the

   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
10 program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:            a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
15 or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory   and generating outputs  (for example on
20 the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
   integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
25 array  (FPGA).
   A gaming system in the form of a standalone gaming machine
   10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine 10
   includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
30 displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
35 mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
                                             9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

   card.  Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
 5 value of the ticker.  A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
10 other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
15 credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
20 information or images relating to the game.        Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.

   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of liquid
   crystal display unit. Alternatively, the display 14 may be
   a plasma screen or any other suitable video display unit.
   The top box 26 may also include a display which may be of
30 the same type as the display 14, or of a different type.

   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
                                             9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                               - 16
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
 5 volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
10 including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
15 own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.          Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
20 random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
25 screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
30 may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
35 instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
                                              9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                               - 17
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.

   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
10 to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                   In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
15 module - i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
20 an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.              The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.              The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
25 some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
30
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.

   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
 5 operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
10 or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
15 The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
20 In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
25 collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
30 game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.     A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
35 most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.  With this embodiment,
                                            9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                              - 19
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
 5 display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
10 client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
15 administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
20 network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
25 for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
30 plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
35 could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
                                             9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

   The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to select
   one of a plurality of game options, each of which has a
   different effect on the formation of a set of symbols used
   to generate a game outcome. In an embodiment, there is a
10 button for each for each option. In the examples given in
   connection with the embodiments below, there are five
   options corresponding to the number of reels used in the
   game. However, in other embodiments, the number of game
   options could vary, for example with the number of reels.
15 The number of game options need not match the number of
   reels. For example, in an embodiment where there are five
   reels, there may be a sixth game option which results in
   the use of a base set of symbols with no mystery symbols
   being selected. In other embodiments there may be fewer
20 game options than the number of reels.  In the
   embodiments, the game options correspond to a selected
   mystery symbol being placed at different numbers of
   designated symbol positions. In the embodiments, each game
   option has an associated cost in credits. The cost in
25 credits is larger for those options where a larger number
   of mystery symbols are used. In some embodiments, the
   player is also able to operate the game play mechanism 56
   to select a number of credits to wager on the game option.
   The selected number of credits acts as a multiplier to the
30 cost in credits as well as to the amount paid from the pay
   table.
   In an embodiment, irrespective of the game play option
   selected by the player, the game outcome is evaluated in
35 the same way to determine whether the selected symbols of
   the game outcome correspond to a winning outcome. In one
   embodiment, each displayed symbol of each reel can be used
                                            9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                               - 21
   to form symbol combinations with symbols displayed at a
   designated with each displayed symbol of each of the other
   reels with one symbol display position of each reel being
   used in any combination. For example, if there are five
 5 reels and three symbol display positions for each reel
   such that the symbol display positions comprise three
   rows, the total number of ways to win is determined by
   multiplying the number of symbol display positions of each
   reels. As a result for five reels and fifteen display
10 positions there are 243 ways to win. For five reels and
   four symbol display positions per reel there are 1024 ways
   to win.
   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
15 shown implementing a number of modules based on program
   code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that various of the modules could be
   implemented in some other way, for example by a dedicated
   circuit.
20
   In the embodiment, there are five subsets of designated
   symbols corresponding to respective ones of the five
   reels.  Accordingly, the player's game play options are to
   select a number of reels to "activate" to have a mystery
25 symbol placed on the reel -   that is to select the subsets
   of designated symbols of the respective reels be
   populated.   An example of part of the display 808 of the
   gaming machine shown in Figure 8 from which is can be seen
   that there are five symbols 801,802,803,804,805 are either
30 lit up or greyed out in order to indicate the number of
   reels that are active and for which a mystery symbol will
   be selected.   In the example shown in Figure 8, the player
   has selected five reels.
35 Referring to Figure 9, there is shown a table 900 which
   indicates an example of the activation patterns of an
   embodiment.   In the example, of Figure 9, the subsets of
                                              9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                               - 22
   designated symbols are located at contiguous positions on
   the reels and are displayed with a gold background when
   active. Accordingly, they are referred to in the game as
   "gold stacks". A first column 901, shows the number of
 5 gold stacks played.   This defines the number of reels on
   which the subsets of designated symbols will be active.
   In a typical embodiment, there will be three to five
   symbols in a stack.   In an embodiment, the number of
   symbols in a stack corresponds to the number of symbols in
10 each column.  In other embodiments, the designated symbols
   could be distributed differently, for example, spread out
   amongst the reels.
   Column 902 shows the credit cost corresponding to the
15 number of gold stacks played.    It will be seen that the
   credit cost increases with the number of stacks played.
   Column 903 shows the position of the interface in response
   to the selection of a number of gold stacks.          That is,
20 what would be displayed in the area of display 808 shown
   in Figure 8 depending on the player's selection.                It will
   be observed that when a player selects a single stack, a
   single light 911 is illuminated then when a player selects
   an additional stack  (two stacks) light 912 is shown as
25 illuminated in gold in addition to light 911.           Selection
   of each of the additional option results in the lighting
   of and additional light 913, 914 and 915 such that when
   playing five stacks, five lights 911-915are lit.
30 Columns 904 to 908 show the status of each of the reels
   depending on the player's selection in these columns, the
   word "active" indicates that the stack is active whereas
   the symbol "X" indicates that a stack is inactive.                  It
   will be apparent from the table 900 of Figure 9 that the
35 stacks are activated from right to left.     This is because
   in the embodiment the winning combinations are evaluated
   from left to right.   Accordingly, stacks located towards
                                              9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                               - 23
   the left most column are more likely to deliver winning
   combinations in the game.
   Referring now again to Figure 6, memory 64 stores reel
 5 data 641 which defines a number of reels, in this
   embodiment five reels.   The reels are defined by a number
   of symbol positions.   Symbols are allocated to the
   respective symbol positions in advance with the exception
   of certain symbol positions which are allocated
10 dynamically.   These are the designated symbol positions
   641A. In the embodiment, there is a stack of designated
   symbol positions on each of the reels and different
   numbers of the stacks of designated symbol positions (i.e.
   a group of contiguous symbol positions) are populated
15 depending on the game play option selected by the player
   and received by the game controller 60.    In the
   embodiment, four of the reels have default symbols which
   will be displayed at the designated symbol positions if
   they are not activated.   In an embodiment, the default
20 symbols are symbols which have a relatively low value in
   the pay table.   In this respect, in one example, the
   symbols on the reels may include picture symbols and (for
   example five different picture symbols themed to the
   game), and royal symbols.    In one example, the picture
25 symbols correspond to winning combinations having a
   relatively high value in the pay table and the royal
   symbols have a relatively low value in the pay table 645.
   The default symbols that are displayed on inactive reels
   are a stack of royal symbols.    In an embodiment, a
30 background colour is applied to each of the default
   symbols in the stack which is different to the normal
   colour of those royal symbols in order to enable a player
   to identify an inactive stack, that is, in order to
   identify those symbols which would have been replaced by a
35 mystery symbol if the player had selected to activate the
   designated symbol positions 641A on the respective reel.
                                              9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                               - 24
   It will be apparent from the above embodiment, that in the
   example shown in Figure 9, there is no need for there to
   be default symbols on the fifth reel because these symbols
   will be populated with a mystery symbol on each play of
 5 the game.   In other embodiments, there may be a further
   play option where no mystery symbols are activated, in
   which case, default symbols could also be placed on the
   fifth reel.
10 Referring to Figure 6, the memory 64 also stores the
   identity of the mystery symbols 642.   In an embodiment,
   the mystery symbols are the same as the picture symbols,
   PIC 1 to PIC 5 used in the reel data so that selection of
   a specific mystery symbol will increase the probability of
15 winning combinations incorporating the selected mystery
   symbol occurring on the reels.   Mystery symbols may also
   have associated weightings to control the probability of a
   specific one of the mystery symbols being selected.                   For
   example, by making it less probable that the highest
20 paying one of the picture symbols is selected.
   When the symbol set former 624 receives the selected game
   option, mystery symbol selector 624A uses random number
   generator 621 to generate a value and compares this to
25 ranges of values assigned to the respective mystery
   symbols 642 to determine which mystery symbol should be
   selected based on the return value from the random number
   generator.   The selected mystery symbol is then placed in
   relevant subsets of designated symbol positions to form a
30 current symbol set 643.
   The outcome generator 622 operates after the symbol set
   has been formed.   The outcome generator 622 generates a
   game outcome which will then be evaluated by outcome
35 evaluator 623. Generating the game outcome involves symbol
   selector 622A selecting symbols from the current set of
   symbols 643 using random number generator 621. The
                                             9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                               - 25
   selected symbols are advised to the display controller 625
   which causes them to be displayed on display 54 at a set
   of display positions.
 5 One example of selecting symbols is for the symbol
   selector 622A to select a stopping position for each of
   the reels at random. That is, for each of the reels, the
   symbol selector uses RNG 621 to select which position of
   the respective reel  (and hence the symbol at that
10 position) will be displayed at a defined position in the
   column of symbol display positions associated with the
   respective one of the plurality of spinning reels. For
   example, by selecting which symbol will appear at the
   bottom symbol display position. The sequence of symbols
15 for each reel controls the other symbols displayed for
   that reel, so that a subset of contiguous symbols from
   each reel are displayed. In one example, four symbols of
   each of five reels may be displayed such that symbols are
   displayed at twenty display positions on display 54. It is
20 known to use a probability table stored in memory 64 to
   vary the odds of a particular stop position being
   selected. Other techniques can be used to control the odds
   of particular outcomes occurring to thereby control the
   return to player of the game.
25
   In an embodiment, the current symbol set is only used in
   the base game and a new symbol set is formed if a feature
   game is triggered.  In the embodiments, the feature game
   is a series of free game events, in the form of a
30 plurality of free games and a new symbol set is selected
   for each free game.   Depending on the embodiment, the
   trigger event may be a symbol combination in the game,
   occurrence of a specific symbol in the game, based on a
   random evaluation, etc.
35
   In the embodiments, a winning combination will result in
   some form of award being made such as an award of credits.
                                             9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                                - 26
    Thus, if winning a winning combination occurs, the win
    meter of meters 646 is updated. Such an award may never
    actually be physically received by a player. For example,
    many gaming systems provide a player with a double or
  5 nothing gamble feature, where the player can double or
    forfeit their credits before commencing another play of
    the game or cashing. Starting another play of the game
    will cause the credits to be transferred to the credit
    meter of meters 646. Further, as credits are fungible,
10  once credits have been added to the credit meter it is not
    possible to distinguish between credits which exist
    because the player has input cash or the like and credits
    resulting from an award.
15  In an embodiment, outcome evaluator 623 includes a trigger
    monitor 623A.  In the embodiment, upon the selected
    symbols displayed at symbol display positions in the game
    outcome including a defined trigger or triggers 644,
    trigger monitor 623A triggers a series of free games.
20
    In one example, the number of free games may depend on
    which of a plurality of trigger events occurs. For
    example, the number of free games may be based on a number
    of scatter symbols.
25
    In another example, the player may be able to select the
    number of free games that will be conducted from a set of
    possibilities.  The set of possible numbers of free games
    may each have an associated different multiplier.                For
30  example, a large number of free games may be associated
    with a relatively small multiplier being applied to
    winning outcomes achieved during the free games and
    successively smaller numbers of free games may be
    associated with successively higher multipliers.               In this
35  way, the player's selection affects the volatility of
    their free games.   That is, the larger number of games
    with a lower multiplier will tend to deliver a relatively
                                              9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                               - 27
   large number of small wins whereas a small number of free
   games will deliver fewer wins but of potentially higher
   value.
 5 In the embodiment, once the outcome evaluator triggers a
   series of free games, the number of free games is
   conducted by the game controller until the count of free
   games reaches zero.   In the embodiment, for each free
   game, a further mystery symbol is selected by the mystery
10 symbol selector 624A from mystery symbol data 642 in the
   same way as described above.    The symbol set former 624
   uses the selected mystery symbol to form the current
   symbol set 643 which is used by symbol selector 622A of
   outcome generator 622 to generate a game outcome that will
15 be evaluated by the outcome evaluator 623 to determine
   whether it includes an winning combinations based on pay
   table 645.   If winning combinations are included, the win
   meter of meters 646 is updated.     At the conclusion of the
   free games, the wins are transferred to the credit meter
20  (assuming that they are not gambled).
   In an embodiment, the outcome generator includes a mystery
   symbol modifier 622B, which modifies the appearance and
   function of the mystery symbol should it appear at certain
25 positions on the display.
   Referring to Figure 11, during the free games, all symbols
   displayed at symbol display positions on reels 2, 3 and 4
    (as numbered from left to right) are the same as the
30 mystery symbol for the specific feature game become
   feature WILD symbols.   In this respect, in Figure 11 the
   first to fifth reels 1101 to 1105 each have four symbol
   display positions.   It will be appreciated that the middle
   or third reel 1103 has a stack of four symbols which
35 correspond to mystery symbols    (in this example a lotus
   symbol).  There are also two mystery symbols in column
   1104, one mystery symbol at the bottom of column 1102 and
                                               9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                               - 28
   a further mystery symbol 1111 at the bottom of column
   1105.  As shown in Figure 11B, each of the mystery symbols
   on reels 2 to 4 are transformed into a different symbol by
   mystery symbol modifier 622B, in this example a feature
 5 WILD symbol 1120.   Symbol 1111 is not transformed because
   it is not in the second, third or fourth reel.           It will be
   appreciated that while in this embodiment, the mystery
   symbol modifier 622B changes the symbol to feature WILD
   symbol 11120, in other embodiments, the mystery symbol
10 modifier 622B may change the function of the symbols so
   they behave as a WILD.
   Figure 10 shows an alternative embodiment where the
   mystery symbol is selected independently for each active
15 reel.  Key 190 shows the correspondence between each
   reel's stack 1050 and the mystery symbol 1060 selected for
   that stack. For example, it shows that a fan symbol 1061
   has been selected for the fifth reel.    Key 190 also shows
   the correspondence between symbols 1062 to 1065 which are
20 located respectively on the fourth, third, second, and
   first reels.  It will also be appreciated that there is a
   visual difference presented on the reels between symbols
   which are selected as mystery symbols and those which are
   normal picture symbols.   For example, compare the gold
25 background of fan symbol of 1061 and the grey background
   of fan symbol 1071.
   Referring to Figure 7, there is shown a flow chart 700 of
   a method of an embodiment.    The method involves receiving
30 a selection of a play option 705, forming a symbol set
   based on the selected option 710 and generating a game
   outcome 715.  The method involves determining 720 whether
   there is a winning combination and if there is, making 725
   an award.  The method also involves determining 730
35 whether a trigger condition has been met.      Upon a trigger
   condition being met, the method involves selecting 735 a
   new mystery symbol and generating 740 a further outcome.
                                              9760170_1 (GHMatters) P98416.AU.2 14/12/17

                               - 29
   The method then involves determining whether to modify 745
   the displayed symbol based on whether the mystery symbol
   satisfies the modification criteria.   For example, has the
   mystery symbol been placed on reels two to four as
 5 described above.   If there is to be a modification, the
   method involves modifying 747 the symbols before
   determining 750 whether there is a winning combination
   and any award is then made 755 otherwise the game ends
   760.

   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
15 executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
   description certain steps are described as being carried
   out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
20 sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
   may need to compute several values and compare those
25 values.
   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
30 medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
    (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
   a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Further different parts of the program code can
   be executed by different devices, for example in a client
35 server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
   appreciate that program code provides a series of
   instructions executable by the processor.
