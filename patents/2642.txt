[TECHNICAL FIELD]
[0002]     The present invention relates to an electrophotographic image forming apparatus, a
developing apparatus used in the electrophotographic image forming apparatus, and a
coupling member used in the electrophotographic image forming apparatus.
[0003]    Examples of the electrophotographic image forming apparatus include an
electrophotographic copying machine, an electrophotographic printer (a laser beam printer, an
LED printer, etc.), and the like.
[0004]     The developing apparatus (developing device) is mounted to a main assembly of the
electrophotographic image forming apparatus and develops an electrostatic latent image
formed on an electrophotographic photosensitive member.
[0005]     The developing device includes a developing device of a fixed type used in a state
in which it is mounted and
20238976 1

                                  2
fixed to a main assembly of the electrophotographic image
forming apparatus and a developing device of a developing
cartridge type in which a user can mount it to the main assembly
and can demount it from the main assembly.
[00061     With respect to the developing device of the fixed
type, maintenance  is performed by a service person.     On the
other hand, with respect to the developing device of the
developing cartridge type, maintenance    is performed by the user
by replacing a developing cartridge with another one.
[BACKGROUND ART]
[0007]     In a conventional electrophotographic image forming
apparatus, the following constitution is known when an
electrostatic latent image formed on a drum-shaped
electrophotographic photosensitive member     (hereinafter referred
to as a "photosensitive drum")   is developed.
[00081     In a Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application     (JP-A)
2003-202727, a gear   (gear 42Y) is provided to a developing
device and is engaged with a gear provided to a main assembly of
the image forming apparatus.    Then, a rotating force of a motor
provided to the main assembly is transmitted to a developing
roller through the gear provided to the main assembly and the
gear provided to the main assembly.     In this way, a method of
rotating the developing roller is    known.
[0009]  Further, a color electrophotographic image forming
apparatus in which a developing rotary rotatable in state     in
which a plurality of developing devices is mounted to the
developing rotary is provided to a main assembly of the
apparatus  (JP-A Hei 11-015265).    In this apparatus, the
following cartridge for transmitting a rotating force from the
apparatus main assembly to the developing devices is     known.

                                   3
Specifically, a main assembly-side coupling (coupling 71)
provided to the apparatus main assembly and a developing
device-side coupling   (coupling gear 65) of developing devices
(developing devices 6Y, 6M, 6C) mounted to a developing rotary
(multi-color developing device 6) are connected, whereby a
rotating force is transmitted from the apparatus main assembly
to the developing devices.     When the main assembly-side coupling
and the developing device-side coupling are connected, the main
assembly-side coupling is once retracted into the apparatus      (by
spring 74) so as not to hinder movement of the developing
rotary.  Then, the developing rotary is moved, so that a
predetermined developing device is moved in a direction in which
the main assembly-side coupling is provided.     Thereafter, the
retracted main assembly-side coupling is moved toward the
developing device-side coupling by using a moving mechanism such
as a solenoid and the like    (solenoid 75, arm 76).   In this
manner, both of the couplings are connected to each other.
Then, a rotating force of a motor provided to the main assembly
is transmitted to a developing roller through the main
assembly-side coupling and the developing device-side coupling.
As a result, the developing roller is rotated.      Such a method is
known.
[0010]        However, in the conventional cartridge described
in JP-A 2003-202727, a driving connection portion between the
main assembly and the developing device constitutes an engaging
portion for a gear   (gear 35)  and a gear (gear 42Y).   For this
reason, it is difficult to prevent rotation non-uniformity of
the developing roller.
[0011]      In the conventional cartridge described in JP-A Hei
11-015265, as described above, the main assembly-side coupling
(coupling 71)  is once retracted into the apparatus so as not to
hinder the movement of the developing device.     Further, during

                                 4
the transmission of the rotating force, it is necessary to move
the retracted main assembly-side coupling toward the developing
device-side coupling.   Thus, it is necessary to provide a
mechanism for moving the main assembly-side coupling toward the
developing device-side to the apparatus main assembly.    Further,
for image formation, a time required for movement of the main
assembly-side coupling must be considered.

20 cartridge of the type   in which a user can mount and demount
   the developing cartridge with respect to an apparatus main
   assembly.   However, the present invention is also applicable
   to a developing device which is used in a state in which it is
   mounted and fixed to the main assembly.
25 [0112]         Further, the present invention is    specifically
   applicable to a single coupling member     (e.g., those shown in
   Figures 6(a),  14(a3), 28(c),   30 and 77(b)),  a developing
   10156073 1                                               905731D2

   device    (developing cartridge)    (e.g., those shown in Figures 2,
   57   and 60),  and an electrophotographic image forming apparatus
    (e.g., those shown in Figures 5 and 75).
   [Embodiment    1]
 5  (1)   Brief description of developing cartridge      (developing
   device)
   [0113]        First, with reference to Figures 1 to 4, a
   developing cartridge B as a developing device to which an
   embodiment of the present invention is       applied  (hereinafter
10 simply referred to as a "cartridge") will be described.
   Figure 1 is a sectional view of the cartridge B.         Figures 2
   and 3 are perspective views of the cartridge B.         Figure 4 is a
   sectional view of a color electrophotographic image        forming
   apparatus main assembly A       (hereinafter referred to as an
15 "apparatus main assembly").
   [0114]            This  cartridge B can be mounted to and demounted
   from a rotary C provided to the apparatus main assembly A by a
   user.
   [0115]            Referring to Figures 1 to 3,   the cartridge B
20 includes a developing roller 110.        The developing roller is
   rotated by receiving a rotating force from the apparatus main
   assembly A through a coupling mechanism described later during
   a developing function.       In a developer accommodating frame
   114,   a developer t of a predetermined color is accommodated.
25 This developer is      fed to a developer chamber 113a in a
   predetermined amount by rotation of a stirring member 116.
   The fed developer is supplied to a surface of the developing
   roller by rotation of a sponge-like developer supplying roller
   115   in the developer chamber 113a.      This developer is   formed
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                   - 22
   in a thin layer by being supplied with electric charges by
   triboelectric charge between a thin plate-like developing
   blade   112 and the developing roller 110.   The developer formed
   in the thin layer on the developing roller 110     is fed to a
 5 developing position by rotation.     By applying a predetermined
   developing bias to the developing roller 110,     an electrostatic
   latent image formed on an electrophotographic photosensitive
   member   (hereinafter referred to as a "photosensitive drum")
   107  is developed.    That is, the electrostatic latent image is
10 developed by the developing roller 110.
   [0116]          Further, developer which does not   contribute to
   the development of the electrostatic latent image, i.e.,
   residual developer removing on the surface of the developing
   roller 110 is   removed by the developer supplying roller 115.
15 At the same time,    a fresh developer is supplied to the surface
   of the developing roller 110 by the developer supplying roller
   115.    In this manner, a developing operation is   successively
   performed.
   [0117]          The  cartridge B includes a developing unit 119.
20 The developing unit 119 includes a developing device frame 113
   and the developer accommodating frame 114.      The developing
   unit 119 further includes the developing roller 110,      the
   developing blade    112, the developer supplying roller 115,    the
   developer chamber 113a, the developer accommodating frame 14,
25 and the stirring member 116.
   [0118]          The developing roller 110 is  rotatable about an
   axial line Li.
   [0119]          Here,  the developing cartridge B  is mounted by
   the user to a developing cartridge accommodating portion 130A
30 provided to a rotation selecting mechanism     (developing rotary)
   10156073  1                                              905731D2

                                    - 23
   C of the apparatus main assembly A.      At this time, as
   described later, a driving shaft of the apparatus main
   assembly A and a coupling member as a rotating driving force
   transmitting part of the cartridge B are connected to each
 5 other in interrelation with such an operation that the
   cartridge B    is positioned at a predetermined position
    (opposing portion to the photosensitive drum) by the
   developing rotary     (rotation selecting mechanism) C.    Thus,   the
   developing roller 110 and the like are rotated by receiving a
10 driving force from the apparatus main assembly A.
    (2)   Description of electrophotographic image forming
   apparatus
    [0120]       With respect to Figure 4, a color
   electrophotographic image forming apparatus using the
15 developing cartridge B described will be described.        In the
   following, description will be made by taking a color laser
   beam printer as an example of the color electrophotographic
   image forming apparatus.
    [0121]          As shown in Figure 4, a plurality of cartridges
20 B   (B1, B2, B3, B4)   accommodating developers  (toners) different
   in color is mounted to the rotary C.      The mounting and
   demounting of the cartridge B with respect to the rotary C are
   performed by the user.      By rotating the rotary C,  a cartridge
   B accommodating a developer of a predetermined color is
25 disposed opposite to the photosensitive drum 107.       Then, an
   electrostatic latent image     formed on the photosensitive drum
   107   is developed.    The developed image is transferred onto a
   recording material S.      This developing and transferring
   operation is performed for each of the colors.       As a result, a
30 color image    is obtained.   Hereinbelow, specific description
   will be made.     The recording material S is   a material on which
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                   -  24
   an image can be formed and include, e.g.,      paper, an OHP sheet,
   and the like.
   [0122]          Referring to Figure 4, the photosensitive drum
   107  is  irradiated with light based on image information from
 5 an optical means   101.   By this irradiation, an electrostatic
   latent image is formed on the photosensitive drum 107.        The
   electrostatic latent image    is developed with a developer by
   the developing roller 110.     The developer image formed on the
   photosensitive drum 107    is transferred onto an intermediary
10 transfer member.
   [0123]          Next, the developer image transferred onto an
   intermediary transfer belt 104a as the intermediary transfer
   member is transferred onto the recording material S by a
   second transfer means.     Then, the recording material S onto
15 which the developer image is     transferred is  conveyed to a
   fixing means 105   including a pressing roller 105a and a
   heating roller 105b.     The developer image transferred onto the
   recording material S is    fixed on the recording material S.
   After the fixation, the recording material S is discharged on
20 a tray 106.
   [0124]          An image forming step will be described more
   specifically.
   [0125]          In synchronism with rotation of the intermediary
   transfer belt 104a, the photosensitive drum 107      is rotated
25 counterclockwisely    (Figure 4).    Then, a surface of the
   photosensitive drum 107    is electrically charged uniformly by a
   charging roller 108.     The surface of the photosensitive drum
   107  is  irradiated with light depending on image information,
   e.g.,   about a yellow image by the optical    (exposure) means
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                   - 25
   101.   Thus, a yellow electrostatic latent image is formed on
   the photosensitive drum 107.
   [0126]          The exposure means 101   is constituted as
   follows.    The exposure means 101   irradiates the photosensitive
 5 drum 107 with high on the basis of the image information read
   from an external device    (not shown).   As a result, the
   electrostatic latent image    is formed on the photosensitive
   drum 107.    The exposure means 101   includes a laser diode, a
   polygon mirror, a scanner motor, an imaging lens, and a
10 reflection mirror.
   [0127]          From the unshown external device, an image
   signal   is sent.  By this operation, the laser diode emits
   light depending on the image signal and the polygon mirror is
   irradiated with the light    (as image light).   The polygon
15 mirror is rotated at a high speed by the scanner motor to
   reflect the image light, so that the surface of the
   photosensitive drum 107   is  selectively exposed to the image
   light through the imaging lens and the reflection mirror.          As
   a result, the electrostatic latent image depending on the
20 image information is formed on the photosensitive drum 107.
   [0128]          Simultaneously with this electrostatic latent
   image formation, the rotary C is     rotated, whereby a yellow
   cartridge B1   is moved to a developing position.     Then, a
   predetermined developing bias is     applied to the developing
25 roller 110.    As a result, a yellow developer is deposited on
   the electrostatic latent image,     so that the electrostatic
   latent image is developed with the yellow developer.
   Thereafter, a bias voltage of an opposite polarity to that of
   the developer is applied to a pressing roller      (a primary
30 transfer roller) 104j   for the intermediary transfer belt 104a,
   so that the yellow developer image on the photosensitive drum
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                   - 26
   107  is primary-transferred onto the intermediary transfer belt
   104a.
   [0129]          As described above, after the primary transfer
   of the yellow developer image is     completed, the rotary C is
 5 rotated.    As a result, a subsequent cartridge B2 is moved to
   be located at a position opposite to the photosensitive drum
   107.    The above-described process is performed with respect to
   a magenta cartridge B2,    a cyan cartridge B3, and a black
   cartridge B4.     In this way, by repeating the process for each
10 of magenta, cyan,    and black, four color developer images are
   superposed on the intermediary transfer belt 104a.
   [0130]          Incidentally, the yellow cartridge B1
   accommodates the yellow developer and forms the yellow
   developer image.     The magenta cartridge B2  accommodates a
15 magenta developer and forms a magenta developer image.       The
   cyan cartridge B3    accommodates a cyan developer and forms a
   cyan developer image.     The black cartridge B4 accommodates a
   black developer and forms a black developer image.
   [0131]          During the image formation described above, a
20 secondary transfer roller 104b is     in a noncontact state with
   the intermediary transfer belt     104a.  A cleaning charging
   roller 104f is also in a noncontact state with the
   intermediary transfer belt 104a.
   [0132]          After the four color developer images are formed
25 on the intermediary transfer belt 104a, the secondary transfer
   roller 104b is pressed against the intermediary transfer belt
   104a   (Figure 4).   In synchronism with the press contact of the
   secondary transfer roller 104b, the recording material S
   waiting at a position in the neighborhood of a registration
30 roller pair 103e is sent to a nip between the transfer belt
   10156073 1                                               905731D2

                                  - 27
   104a and the transfer roller 104b.     At the same time, a
   recording material S is   fed from a cassette 103a by a feeding
   roller 103b and a conveying roller pair 103c as a feeding
    (conveying) means 103.
 5 [0133]          Immediately before the registration roller pair
   103e,  a sensor 99 is disposed.    The sensor 99 detects a
   leading end of the recording material S and stops the rotation
   of the registration roller pair 103e, thus placing the
   recording material S in a standby state at a predetermined
10 position.
   [0134]          To the transfer roller 104b, a bias voltage of
   an opposite polarity to that of the developer is    applied, so
   that the developer images on the transfer belt 104a are
   simultaneously secondary-transferred onto the conveyed
15 recording material S.
   [0135]          The recording material S onto which the
   developer images are transferred and conveyed to the fixing
   means   105 through a conveying belt unit 103f.   By the fixing
   means   105, fixation of the developer images is performed.      The
20 recording material S subjected to the fixation is discharged
   on a discharging tray 106 disposed at an upper portion of the
   apparatus main assembly by a discharging roller pair 103g.        In
   this way, formation of an image o the recording material S is
   completed.
25 [0136]          After completion of the secondary transfer, the
   charging roller 104f is pressed against the transfer belt
   104a, so that the surface of the belt 104a and the developer
   remaining on the surface of the belt 104a are supplied with
   the predetermined bias voltage.     As a result, a residual
30 electric charge is   removed.
   10156073 1                                              905731D2

                                   - 28
    [0137]         The  residual developer subjected to the charge
   removal is electrostatically re-transferred from the belt 104a
   onto the photosensitive drum 107     through a primary transfer
   nip.    As a result, the surface of the belt 104a is cleaned.
 5 The residual developer re-transferred onto the photosensitive
   drum 107   after the secondary transfer is removed by a cleaning
   blade   117a contacting the photosensitive drum 107.      The
   removed developer is collected din a residual developer box
   107d through a conveying passage      (not shown).
10  [0138]          Incidentally, an accommodating portion 130a is a
   chamber in which the above-descried cartridge B is
   accommodated and is provided to the rotary C at a plurality of
   positions.    The rotary C is  rotated in one direction in a
   state in which the cartridge B is mounted in the chamber.           As
15 a result, a coupling member    (described later) of the cartridge
   B  is connected to a driving shaft 180 provided to the
   apparatus main assembly A and disconnected from the driving
   shaft   180.  The cartridge B  (developing roller 110)    is moved
   in a direction substantially perpendicular to an axial line L3
20 direction of the driving shaft     180 depending on the movement
   of the rotary C in one direction.
    (3)   Constitution of developing roller
    [0139]       Next, with reference to Figures 5(a) and 5(b),       a
   constitution of the developing roller 110 will be described.
25 Figure 5(a) is a perspective view of the developing roller 110
   as seen from a receiving side of a driving force from the main
   assembly A to the developing roller 110       (hereinafter simply
   referred to as a "driving side").       Figure 5(b) is a
   perspective view of the developing roller 110 as seen from a
30 side opposite from the driving side with respect to the axial
   10156073 1                                                 905731D2

   direction of the developing roller 110       (hereinafter referred
   to as a "non-driving side").
   [0140]          The developing roller 110 includes a developing
   shaft   153 and a rubber portion 110a.     The developing shaft 153
 5 is  formed of an electroconductive material such as iron or the
   like in an elongated shaft    shape and is covered with the
   rubber portion 110a at a portion except for both end portions
   with respect to the axial direction.       The developing shaft 153
   is  rotatably supported by the developing device frame 113
10 through bearings    (not shown) at both end engaging portions
   153dl  and 153d2.    Further, a cartridge 150 described later is
   positioned at an end portion 153b on the driving side.         The
   cartridge 150   is engaged with a rotating force transmitting
   pin 155 described later to transmit a driving force.         The
15 rubber portion 110    coaxially covers the developing shaft      153.
   The rubber portion 110    carries the developer and develops      the
   electrostatic latent image by application of a bias to the
   developing shaft   153.
   [0141]          Nip width regulating members 136 and 137 are
20 members for regulating a nip width of the developing roller
   110 with respect to the photosensitive drum 107       at a constant
   value.
   [0142]          The unshown bearings are disposed at the both
   end portions 153dl    and 153d2 of the developing roller 110      so
25 as to support rotatably the developing roller 110 on the
   developing device frame 113     (Figure 1).
   [0143]          A developing gear    (not shown) is disposed at the
   driving-side end portion 153dl of the developing roller 110
   and fixed to the developing shaft 153.        The unshown developing
30 gear transmits the rotating force received from the apparatus
   10156073 1                                                 905731D2

                                     - 30
   main assembly A to the developing roller 110 to other rotating
   members    (e.g., the developer supplying roller 115, the
   stirring member, and the like) of the developing cartridge B.
   [0144]            Next, the driving-side end portion of the
 5 developing shaft     153 at which the cartridge 150     is movably
    (pivotably, swingably) mounted will be described more
   specifically.      The end portion 153b has a spherical shape so
   that the axial line L2 of the cartridge 150         (described later)
   can be inclined smoothly.       In the neighborhood of an end of
10 the developing shaft      153, the driving force transmitting pin
   155  for receiving the rotating force       from the cartridge    150 is
   disposed in a direction crossing the axial        line Li  of the
   developing shaft     153.
   [0145]            The pin 155 as the rotating force transmitting
15 portion is formed of metal and fixed to the developing shaft
   153 by a method such as press fitting, bonding, or the like.
   The fixing position may be any position at which a driving
   force   (rotating force)    can be transmitted, i.e.,    a direction
   crossing the axial line Li      of the developing shaft     (developing
20 roller).     It  is desirable that the pin 155 passes through a
   spherical center P2      (Figure 10b)   of the end portion 153b of
   the developing shaft      153.  This   is because a transmission
   diameter of the rotating force is        always kept at a constant
   level even in the case where the axial line Li         of the
25 developing shaft     153 and the axial line L2 of the cartridge
   150  are somewhat deviated from each other.        For this reason,
   it is possible to realize stable rotating force transmission.
   The rotating force transmitting point may be provided at any
   positions.      However, in order to transmit a driving torque
30  (rotating force) with reliability and improve an assembly
   property, a single pin 155      is employed in this embodiment.
   The pin 155     is passed through the center P2    of the end
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                    -  31
   spherical surface 153b.     As  a result, the pin 155    (155al and
   155a2)   is disposed so as to be projected at positions
   180-degree opposite from each other at a peripheral        surface of
   the driving shaft.     That is,   the rotating force is transmitted
 5 a two points.     In this embodiment, the pin 155    is fixed at the
   end portion side within 5 mm from the end of the drum shaft
   153.    However, the present invention is not limited thereto.
   [0146]           Incidentally, a main assembly-side developing
   electric contact    (not shown) is disposed in the apparatus main
10 assembly A so as to contact a non-driving-side end portion
   153c of the electroconductive developing shaft       153.    An
   electric contact    (not shown) of the developing cartridge and
   the main assembly-side developing electric contact are brought
   into contact with each other.        In this way, a high-voltage
15 bias is   supplied from the apparatus main assembly A to the
   developing roller 110.
    (4)   Description of rotating driving force transmitting part
    (coupling, coupling member)
   [0147]        An embodiment of the coupling     (coupling member)
20 which is   a rotating driving force transmitting part as a
   principal constituent-element of the present invention will be
   described with reference to Figures 6(a) to 6(f).         Figure 6(a)
   is   a perspective view of the coupling as seen from the
   apparatus main assembly side and Figure 6(b) is       a perspective
25 view of the coupling as seen from the photosensitive drum
   side.    Figure 6(c)  is a view of the coupling as seen from a
   direction perpendicular to a direction of a coupling rotating
   axis L2.    Figure 6(d) is a side view of the coupling as seen
   from the apparatus main assembly side and Figure 6(e)         is a
30 view of the coupling as seen from the photosensitive drum
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                      - 32
   side.   Figure 6(f)     is a sectional view of the coupling taken
   along S3    -  S3  line shown in Figure 6(d).
   [0148]             The developing cartridge B is detachably mounted
   to the cartridge accommodating portion 130a in the rotary C
 5 provided in the apparatus main assembly A.           This mounting is
   performed by the user.        The rotary C is rotationally driven
   and stopped at a position at which the cartridge B reaches a
   predetermined position       (developing position at which the
   cartridge B     is located opposite to the photosensitive drum
10 107).   By this operation, the coupling         (coupling member) 150
   is engaged with a driving shaft         180 provided to the apparatus
   main assembly A.       Further, the rotary C is     rotated in one
   direction to move the cartridge B from the predetermined
   position     (developing position).      That is,  the cartridge B is
15 retracted from the predetermined position.           As a result, the
   coupling 150      is moved apart from the driving shaft     180.    The
   coupling 150      receives the rotating force from a motor 64
    (Figure 17)    provided to the apparatus main assembly A in a
   state of engagement with the driving shaft 180.           The  coupling
20 150  transmits the rotating force to the developing roller 110.
   As  a result, the developing roller 110        is rotated by the
   rotating force received from the apparatus main assembly A.
   [0149]             As described above, the driving shaft      180 has a
   pin 182    (rotating force applying portion) and is       rotated by
25 the motor 64.
   [0150]             A material for the coupling 150 is     a resin
   material such as polyacetal, polycarbonate, or the like.             In
   order to enhance rigidity of the coupling 150,          it is  also
   possible to enhance the rigidity by incorporating glass fiber
30 or the like into the resin material depending on a load
   torque.     Further, it is    also possible to employ a metal
   10156073 1                                                    905731D2

                                     - 33
   material.     Thus, the material for the coupling 150 may be
   appropriately selectable.       However, the resin-made coupling
   can be easily processed, so that the respective cartridges in
   this embodiment are formed of the resin material.
 5 [0151]           The  coupling 150 mainly comprises three
   portions.
   [0152]           The  first portion is engageable with the drive
   shaft   180  (which will be described hereinafter)      as shown in
   Figure 6(c),    and it is   a driven portion 150a for receiving the
10 rotational force     from the rotational   force transmitting pin
   182 which is    a rotational force applying portion       (main
   assembly side rotational force transmitting portion) provided
   on the drive shaft 180.       In addition, the second portion is
   engageable with the pin 155 provided to the developing device
15 shaft   153, and it is a driving portion 150b for transmitting
   the rotational force to the developing roller 110.           In
   addition, the third portion is an intermediate portion 150c
   for connecting the driven portion 150a and the driving portion
   150b with each other      (Figure 8  (c) and  (f)).
20 [0153]           As  shown in Figure 6(f)    the driven portion 150a
   is provided with a drive shaft insertion opening portion 150m
   which expands toward the rotation axis L2.          The driving
   portion 150b has a developing device shaft insertion opening
   portion 1501.
25 [0154]           The  opening 150m is defined by a conical driving
   shaft receiving surface 150f which expands toward the drive
   shaft   180  (Figures 9 to 13)   side.   The receiving surface 150f
   constitutes a recess 150z as shown in Figure 6         (f).    The
   recess 150z    includes the opening 150m at a position opposite
   10156073 1                                                    905731D2

                                        -  34
   from the developing roller 110 with respect to the direction
   of the axis L2.
   [0155]            By this,     regardless of rotation phase of the
   developing roller 110        in the cartridge B,     the coupling 150     can
 5 move   (pivot) among a pre-engagement angular position            (Figure
   22(a)),   a rotational force transmitting angular position
    (Figure 22(d)),      and a disengaging angular position        (Figures
   25(a)   (d))   relative to the axis L3 of the drive shaft 180
   without being prevented by the free end portion 182a of the
10 drive shaft     180.    The details thereof will be described
   hereinafter.
   [0156]            A plurality of projections        (the engaging
   portions) 150d       (150dl  -  150d4)   are provided at equal intervals
   on a circumference about the axis L2 on an end surface of the
15 recess 150z.      Between the adjacent projections         150d, entrance
   portions 150k      (150k1,   150k2,   150k3,  150k4)  are provided.     An
   interval between the adjacent projections            150dl  - 150d4 is
   larger than the outer diameter of the pin 182,             so that the
   rotational force transmitting pins provided to the drive shaft
20 180  (rotational force applying portions)          182 are received. The
   pins are the rotational force applying portions. The              recesses
   between the adjacent projections           are the entrance portions
   150k1-150k4.      When the rotational force is        transmitted to the
   coupling 150     from the drive shaft 180,       the pins 182 are
25 received by any of the entrance portions 150k1-150k4.               In
   addition, in Figure 6         (d), the rotational    force reception
   surfaces     (rotational force receiving portions) 150e          (150el
   150e4)   are provided in the upstream with respect to the
   clockwise direction        (Xl) of each projection 150d. The
30 receiving surface 150el-150e4 is extended in the direction
   crossing with the rotational direction of the coupling 150.
   More particularly, the projection 150dl has            a receiving
   10156073 1                                                       905731D2

                                  - 35
   surface 150el,   the projection 150d2 has a receiving surface
   150e2,  the projection  150d3 has a receiving surface 150e3,
   and, a projection 150d4 has   a receiving surface 150e4.      In the
   state where the drive shaft 180 rotates, the pin 182al,       182a2
 5 contacts to any of the receiving surfaces 150e.      By doing so,
   the receiving surface 150e contacted by the pin 182al,      182a2
   is pushed by the pin 182.    By this, the coupling 150    rotates
   about the axis L2.
   [0157]          In order to stabilize the transmission torque
10 transmitted to the coupling 150 as much as possible, it is
   desirable to dispose the rotational force receiving surfaces
   150e  on a phantom circle (the same circumference) that has     a
   center 0 on the axis L2(Figure 6(d)).     By this,  the rotational
   force transmission radius is    constant and the torque
15 transmitted to the coupling 150    is stabilized.   In addition,
   as for the projections   150d, it is preferable that the
   position of the coupling 150    is stabilized by the balance of
   the forces which the coupling 150    receives.   For that reason,
   in this embodiment, the receiving surfaces 150e     are disposed
20 at the diametrically opposed positions    (180 degrees).    More
   particularly, in this embodiment, the receiving surface 150el
   and the receiving surface 150e3 are diametrically opposed
   relative to each other, and the receiving surface 150e2 and
   the surface 150e4   are diametrically opposed relative to each
25 other.    By this arrangement, the forces which the coupling 150
   receives constitute a force couple.     Therefore, the coupling
   150  can continue rotary motion only by receiving the force
   couple.    For this reason, the coupling 150   can rotate without
   the necessity of being specified in the position of the
30 rotation axis L2 thereof.    In addition, as for the number
   thereof, as long as the pins 182    of the drive shaft  180   (the
   rotational force applying portion) can enter the entrance
   portions 150k(150k1-150k2),   it is possible to select suitably.
   10156073 1                                               905731D2

                                     - 36
   In this embodiment, as shown in Figure 6, the four receiving
   surfaces are provided.       This embodiment is not   limited to this
   example.     For example,   the receiving surfaces 150e
    (projections 150d1-150d4) do not need to be disposed on the
 5 same circumference      (the phantom circle Cl   and Figure 6(d)).
   Or, it is not necessary to dispose at the diametrically
   opposed positions.       However, the effects described above can
   be provided by disposing the receiving surfaces 150e         as
   described above.
10 [0158]            Here,  in this embodiment, the diameter of the
   pin is approximately 2 mm, and a circumferential length of the
   entrance portion 150k is approximately 8 mm.         The
   circumferential length of the entrance portion 150k is an
   interval between adjacent projections       150d  (on the phantom
15 circle).     The dimensions are not    limiting to the present
   invention.
   [0159]            Similarly to the opening 150m, a developing
   device shaft insertion opening portion 1501 has        a conical
   rotational force receiving surface 150i       of an as an expanded
20 part which expands toward the developing device shaft 153.
   The receiving surface 150i constitutes a recess 150q, as shown
   in Figure 6     (f).
   [0160]            By this,  irrespective of the rotation phase of
   the developing roller 110 in the cartridge B,        the coupling 150
25 can move(pivot, swing) among a rotational        force transmitting
   angular position, a pre-engagement angular position, and a
   disengaging angular position to the axis Li without being
   prevented by the free end portion of the developing device
   shaft   153.   The recess 150q is constituted in the illustrated
30 example by a conical receiving surface 150i which it has
   centering on the axis L2.       The standby openings 150g    1 or
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                    - 37
   150g2   ("opening") are provided in the receiving surface 150i
    (Figure 6(b)).    As for the coupling 150,   the pins 155  can be
   inserted into the inside of this opening 150g      1 or 150g2 so
   that it may be mounted to the developing device shaft 153.
 5 And, the size of the openings 150g     1 or 150g2 is  larger than
   the outer diameter of the pin 155.      By doing so,  irrespective
   of the rotation phase of the developing roller 110 in the
   cartridge B,    the coupling 150 is movable(pivotable, swingable)
   among the rotational force transmitting angular position and
10 the pre-engagement angular position      (or disengaging angular
   position) as will be described hereinafter without being
   prevented by the pin 155.
   [0161]        More particularly, the projection 150d is provided
   adjacent to the free end of the recess 150z. And, the
15 projections    (projection portions) 150d project in the
   intersection direction crossing with the rotational direction
   in which the coupling 150 rotates, and are provided with the
   intervals along the rotational direction. And, in the state
   where the cartridge B     is mounted to the rotary C,  the
20 receiving surfaces 150e engage to or abutted to the pin 182,
   and are pushed by the pin 182 receiving the force from the
   rotating drive shaft.
   [0162]           By this,  the receiving surfaces 150e receive the
   rotational force    from the drive shaft 180.   In addition, the
25 receiving surfaces 150e     are disposed in equidistant from the
   axis L2,   and constitute a pair interposing the axis L2 they
   are constituted by the surface in the intersection direction
   in the projections 150d. In addition, the entrance portions
    (recesses) 150k are provided along the rotational direction,
30 and they are depressed in the direction of the axis L2.
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                    - 38
   [0163]           The entrance portion 150k is     formed as a space
   between the adjacent projections       150d.   In the state where the
   cartridge B   is mounted to the rotary C in the case where the
   drive axis stops     its rotation, the pin 182 enters the entrance
 5 portion 150k when the coupling engages with the drive shaft
   180.  And, the pin 182 of the rotating drive shaft 180 pushes
   the receiving surface 150e. Or,       in the case where the drive
   shaft   180 has  already rotated when the coupling engages with
   the drive shaft    180,  the pin 182 enters the entrance portion
10 150k and pushes the receiving portion 150e.
   [0164]           By this,  the coupling 150 rotates.
   [0165]           The  rotational force receiving surface
    (rotational force receiving member       (portion)) 150e may be
   disposed inside of the driving shaft receiving surface 150f.
15 Or, the receiving surface 150e may be provided in the portion
   outwardly projected from the receiving surface 150f with
   respect to the direction of the axis L2.         When the receiving
   surface 150e    is disposed inside of the receiving surface 150f,
   the entrance portion 150k is disposed inside of the receiving
20 surface 150f
   [0166]           More particularly, the entrance portion 150k is
   the recess provided between the projections 150d in the inside
   of the arc part of the receiving surface 150f. In addition,
   when the receiving surface 150e is disposed at the position
25 which outwardly projects, the entrance portion 150k is the
   recess positioned between the projections        150d.  Here,  the
   recess may be a through hole extended in the direction of the
   axis L2,   or it may be closed at one end thereof.       More
   particularly, the recess is provided by the space region
30 provided between the projection       150d.   And, what is necessary
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                    - 39
   is  just to be able to enter the pin 182 into the region in the
   state where the cartridge B is mounted to the rotary C.
   [0167]         These structures of the standing-by portion
   apply similarly to the embodiments as will be described
 5 hereinafter.
   [0168]         In Figure 6    (e),  the rotational force
   transmission surfaces    (the rotational   force transmitting
   portions) 150h and   (150h 1 or 150h2)    are provided in the
   upstream, with respect to the counterclockwise direction        (X2),
10 of the opening 150g   1 or 150g2.     And, the rotational  force is
   transmitted to the developing roller 110 from the coupling 150
   by the convection sections 150h 1 or 150h2 contacting to the
   pins 155al,  155a2.   More particularly, the transmitting
   surfaces 150h 1 or 150h2 push the side surface of the pin 155.
15 By this, the coupling 150 rotates with the center thereof
   aligned with the axis L2.      The transmitting surface 150hl    or
   150h2  is extended in the direction crossing with the
   rotational direction of the coupling 150.
   [0169]         Similarly to the projection     150d, it is
20 desirable to dispose the transmitting surfaces 150hl       or 150h2
   diametrically opposed relative to each other on the same
   circumference.
   [0170]         At the time of manufacturing the drum coupling
   member 150 with an injection molding, the intermediate portion
25 150c may become thin.     This  is because the coupling is
   manufactured so that the driving force receiving portion 150a,
   the driving portion 150b and the intermediate portion 150c
   have a substantially uniform thickness.       When the rigidity of
   the intermediate portion 150c is      insufficient, therefore,   it
30 is possible to make the intermediate portion 150c thick so
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                     -  40
   that driven portion 150a, the driving portion 150b, and the
   intermediate portion 150c have the substantially equivalent
   thickness.
    (6) shape of supporting member
 5  [0171]       The description will be made, referring to Figure
   7,  about a supporting member       (mounting member) 157.   Figure 7
    (a) is a perspective view, as seen from a drive shaft side,
   and Figure 7    (b) is a perspective view, as seen from the
   developing roller      side.
10  [0172]          The supporting member 157 has     functions of
   holding the coupling 150 and positioning the cartridge B          in
   the rotary C.     Further, it has the function of supporting the
   coupling 150    so that the rotational force can be transmitted
   to the developing roller 110.
15  [0173]          More particularly, the supporting member 157
   mounts the cartridge     150 to the cartridge    150.
    [0174]    As   shown in Figure 7 the supporting member includes
   a guide 140L2 during mounting and demounting of the cartridge
   B with respect to an accommodating portion 130a provided to
20 the rotary C and a cylinder 140L1        for positioning the
   cartridge B   in the accommodating portion 130a.       And, the
   coupling 150 described above is disposed in an inner space
   157b of a cylinder portion 157c provided coaxially with the
   developing roller     (not shown).     At an inner peripheral surface
25 157i constituting the space 157b, ribs 157el and 157e2 for
   retaining the coupling 150      in the cartridge B are provided.
   The ribs 157el    and 157e2  are provided opposite to each other
   with respect to a movement direction X4 of the cartridge B
    (rotational direction of the rotary C).       The supporting member
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                   - 41
   157  is provided with positioning portions 157dl and 157d2 for
   fixing it to the developing device frame      113 and provided with
   holes   157gl or 157g2 which penetrate the fixing screw.
    (6) Supporting constitution of coupling with respect to
 5 cartridge frame
   [0175]        Referring to Figure 8 -   Figure 13,  the description
   will be made as to the supporting constitution(mounting
   constitution) of the developing roller 110      and the coupling
   150 with respect to the developing device frame (cartridge
10 frame)113.     Figure 8 is an enlarged view, as seen from the
   driving side, of the major part around the developing roller
   of the cartridge.     Figure 9 is a sectional view taken along
   S4-S4 of Figure 8.     Figure 10 is  a sectional view, taken along
   a developing axis Li,    which illustrate the state before
15 mounting of the coupling and supporting member.        Figure 11 is
   a sectional view which illustrates a state after the mounting.
   Figure 12 is    a sectional view when the axis L2 of the coupling
   is  substantially coaxially aligned with the axis Li       of the
   developing roller.     Figure 13 is  a sectional view which
20 illustrates a state after rotating the coupling through 90
   degrees from the state of Figure 12.      Figure 14   is a
   perspective view which illustrates the combined state of the
   developing roller shaft and the coupling.       Figure 14(bl)-(b5)
   are perspective views, and Figure 15(al)-(a5) are views as
25 seen from the axis Li    direction.
   [0176]           As shown in Figure 14 the coupling 150      is
   mounted so that the axis L2 thereof can incline in any
   direction relative to the axis Li     of the developing roller
   shaft   153  (developing roller).
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                        -  42
   [0177]            In Figure 14     (al) and Figure 14      (b1),  the axis
   L2 of the coupling 150        is co-axial with the axis Li        of the
   developing roller 153.         The  state when the coupling 150 is
   inclined upward from this state            is illustrated in Figure 14
 5  (a2) and Figure 14      (b2).   As   shown in these figures, when the
   axis L2 is inclined toward the opening 150g             side, the pin
   moves within the opening 150g when these members are
   relatively viewed on the basis of the coupling.               As a result,
   the coupling 150      is inclined about an axis AX         (Figure 12    (a2))
10 perpendicular to the opening 150a.
   [0178]            In Figure 14     (b3),    the state where the coupling
   150   is  inclined rightward is       shown.    As shown in this Figure,
   when the axis L2      inclines in the orthogonality direction of
   the opening 150g, the pin rotates within the opening 150g when
15 these members are relatively viewed on the basis of the
   coupling.      The axis of rotation is the axis AY          (Figure 14(a3))
   of the transmission pin 155.
   [0179]            The  states where the coupling 150         is inclined
   downward and leftward are shown in Figures 14(a4)               and  (b4) and
20 Figures 14     (a5) and   (b5),   respectively.     The coupling 150
   inclined about each of the axes AX and AY.
   [0180]            In the directions different from the inclining
   direction described in the foregoing, for example, at an
   intermediate position in the inclination direction in Figures
25 14   (a2)  and 14   (a3),  and at each of intermediate positions in
   the inclination directions in Figures 14             (a3) and 14    (a4)  and
   Figure 14     (a5) and 14    (a2),  the inclination is made by
   combining the rotations in the directions of the rotational
   axes AX and AY.       Thus,   the axis L2 can be pivoted in any
30 direction relative to the axis Li.             At this time, the pin 155
   is provided to the developing roller shaft 153.
   10156073 1                                                         905731D2

                                   - 43
   [0181]     More particularly, the pin 155 projects from a
   peripheral surface of the developing roller shaft 153.       The
   coupling 150 disposed opposite to the pin 155 is provided with
   the opening 150g. A size of the opening 150g     is  set so that
 5 the pin does not   interfere with the pin when the axis L2
   inclined relative to the axis Li.
   [0182]          More particularly, the transmitting surface
    (rotational force transmitting portion) 150h is movable
   relative to the pin    (rotational force receiving portion)
10 155(figure  14).   The pin 155 has   the transmitting surface 150
   in the movable condition.     And, the transmitting surface 150h
   and the pin 155 are engaged to each other in the rotational
   direction of the coupling 150.      Further, the gap is provided
   between the transmitting surface 150h and the pin 155.        By
15 this, the coupling 150    is movable  (pivotable, swingable)    in
   all directions substantially relative to the axis Li.
   [0183]          It has been mentioned that the axis L2 is
   slantable or inclinable in any direction relative to the axis
   Li.   However, the axis L2 does not necessarily need to be
20 linearly slantable to the predetermined angle in the full
   range of 360-degree direction in the coupling 150.       For
   example, the opening 150g can be selected to be slightly wider
   in the circumferential direction.      By doing so,  the time of
   the axis L2  inclining relative to the axis Li,     even if it is
25 the case where it cannot incline to the predetermined angle
   linearly, the coupling 150 can rotate to a slight degree
   around the axis L2.     Therefore, it can be inclined to the
   predetermined angle.     In other words,  the amount of the play
   in the rotational direction of the opening 150g      is selected
30 properly if necessary.
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                  -  44
   [0184]         In this manner, the coupling 150 is revolvable
   or swingable over the full-circumference substantially
   relative to the axis Li of the developing roller 110.       More
   particularly, the coupling 150 is pivotable over the full
 5 circumference thereof substantially relative to the drum shaft
   153.
   [0185]         Furthermore, as will be understood from the
   foregoing explanation, the coupling 150 is capable of whirling
   in and substantially over the circumferential direction of the
10 drum shaft 153.   Here, the whirling motion is not a motion
   with which the coupling itself rotates about the axis L2, but
   the inclined axis L2 rotates about the axis Li of the
   developing roller although the whirling here does not preclude
   the rotation of the coupling per se about the axis L2 of the
15 coupling 150.
   [0186]         It has been mentioned that the axis L2 is
   slantable or inclinable in any direction relative to the axis
   Li.   However, the axis L2 does not necessarily need to be
   linearly slantable to the predetermined angle in the full
20 range of 360-degree direction in the coupling 150.      For
   example and the opening 150g can be selected to be slightly
   wider in the circumferential direction.     By doing so, the time
   of the axis L2 inclining relative to the axis Li,    even if it
   is the case where it cannot incline to the<> predetermined
25 angle linearly and the coupling 150     can rotate to a slight
   degree around the axis L2.    Therefore, it can be inclined to
   the predetermined angle.   In    other words, the amount of the
   play in the rotational direction of the opening 150g is
   selected properly if necessary, in     this manner and the
30 coupling 150 is revolvable or swingable over the full
   circumference substantially relative to drum shaft     (rotational
   force receiving member) 153.     More particularly and the
   10156073 1                                               905731D2

                                 - 45
   coupling 150  is pivotable over the full-circumference thereof
   substantially relative to the drum shaft   153, furthermore and
   as will be understood from the foregoing explanation, the
   coupling 150 is capable of whirling in    and substantially over
 5 the circumferential direction of the drum shaft 153.     Here and
   the whirling motion is not a motion with which the coupling
   itself rotates about the axis 12   and but the inclined axis L2
   rotates about the axis Li  of the photosensitive drum and
   although the whirling here does not preclude the rotation of
10 the coupling per se about the axis L2 of the coupling 150.
   [0187]        In addition, the range movable in all directions
   substantially is the range in which when the user mounts the
   cartridge B to the apparatus main assembly A,   the coupling can
   move to the rotational  force transmitting angular position
15 irrespective of the phase of the drive shaft having the
   rotational force applying portion.    In addition, it is the
   range in which, in disengaging the coupling from the drive
   shaft, the coupling can move to the disengaging angular
   position irrespective of the stop angle phase of the drive
20 shaft.
   [0188]        In addition, the coupling is provided with a gap
   between the rotational  force transmitting portion   (rotational
   force transmitting surface 150h, for example),   and the
   rotational force transmitting portion and the rotational     force
25 receiving portion  (pin 155, for example) to engage,   so that
   it is pivotable in all directions substantially relative to
   the axis Li.  In this manner, the coupling is mounted to the
   end of the cartridge B.   For this reason, the coupling is    the
   movable substantially in all directions relative to the axis
30 Li.
   10156073 1                                             905731D2

                                    - 46
   [0189]          This  structure is   similar in the embodiments of
   the coupling as will be described hereinafter.
   [0190]          The  assemblying processes will be described.
   [0191]          After mounting the developing roller 110
 5 rotatably to the developing device frame      113, the pin 155   is
   mounted to the development shaft 153.       Thereafter, the
   development gear 145 is     assembled to the development shaft
   153.
   [0192]          Thereafter, as shown in Figure 10,    the coupling
10 150  and the supporting member 157     are inserted in the
   direction X3.    First, the driving portion 150b is inserted
   toward the direction X3 downstream, while maintaining the axis
   L2 of the coupling 150     in parallel with X3.   At this time, the
   phase of the pin 155 of the development shaft      153 and the
15 phase of the opening 150g of the coupling 150 are matched with
   each other, and the pin 155     is made inserted into the openings
   150gl  or 150g2.    And, the free end portion 153b of the
   development shaft 153     is abutted to the receiving surface 150i
   the coupling 150.     The  free end portion 153b of the
20 development shaft 153     is the spherical surface and the
   receiving surface 150i     the coupling 150 is  a conic surface.
   Therefore, the driving portion 150b side of the coupling 150
   is positioned to the center      (the center of the spherical
   surface) of the free end portion 153b of the development shaft
25 153.   As will be described hereinafter, when the coupling 150
   rotates by the transmission of the driving force       (rotational
   force)   from the apparatus main assembly A,    the pin 155
   positioned in the opening 150g will be contacted to the
   rotational force transmission surfaces       150h 1 or 150h2 and
30  (Figure 6b).   By this,   the rotational  force can be
   transmitted.    Thereafter, one 157w of the end of surfaces of
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                   -  47
   the supporting member 157 is     inserted downstream with respect
   to the direction X3.    By this, a part of coupling 150       is
   received in the space portion 157b of the supporting member
   157.   And, the supporting member 157      is fixed in the
 5 developing frame   113, thus,  an integral developing cartridge B
   is established.
   [0193]          The dimensions of the various portions of the
   coupling 150 will be described.       As shown in Figure 10     (c), a
   maximum outer diameter of the driven portion 150a of the
10 coupling 150   is @D2, a maximum outer diameter of the driving
   portion 150b is @D1, and a small diameter of the opening 150g
   is @D3.    In addition, a maximum outer diameter of the pin 155
   is @D5,   and an inner diameter of the retention rib      157e of the
   supporting member 157   is @D4.     Here, the maximum outer
15 diameter is the outer diameter of a maximum rotation locus
   about the rotational axis Li     of the developing roller 110.
   The maximum outer diameters @D1,      and @D3 relating to the
   coupling 150   are the outer diameter of maximum rotation locus
   about the axis L2.    At this time, since @D5 < @D3 is
20 satisfied, the coupling 150    can be assembled to the
   predetermined position by the straight mounting operation in
   the direction X3 therefore,    the assembling property is high.
   The diameter of the inner surface @D4       of the retention rib
   157e of the bearing member 157 is      larger than @D2 of the
25 coupling 150,   and smaller than @D1     (@D2 < @D4 < @D1) .   By
   this, just the step attached to the direction X3 straight is
   sufficient to assemble the supporting member 157       to the
   predetermined position.    For this reason, the assembling
   property can be improved    (the state after the assembly is
30 shown in Figure 11).
   [0194]          As shown in Figure 11,     the retention rib 157e of
   the supporting member 157 is disposed closely to a flange
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                    -  48
   portion 150j    of the coupling 150    in the direction of the axis
   Li.   More specifically, in the direction of the axis Li,         the
   distance from an end surface 150jl       of the flange portion 150j
   to the axis of the pin 155     is ni.    In addition, the distance
 5 from an end surface 157el     of the rib 157e to the other end
   surface 157j2    of the flange portion 150j    is n2.   The distance
   n2 < distance nl     is satisfied.
   [0195]           In addition, with respect to the direction
   perpendicular to the axis Li,      the flange portion 150j    and the
10 ribs 157el,    157e2  are disposed so that they are overlapped
   relative to each other.      More specifically, the distance n4
    (amount of the overlapping) from the inner surface 157e3 of
   the rib 157e to the outer surface 150j3 of the flange portion
   150j  is  the overlap amount n4 with respect to the
15 orthogonality direction of the axis Li.
   [0196]           By such settings, the pin 155     is prevented from
   disengaging from the opening 150g.        That is,  the movement of
   the coupling 150     is limited by the bearing member 157.      Thus,
   the coupling 150 does not disengage from the cartridge.           The
20 prevention of disengagement can be accomplished without
   additional parts.      The dimensions described above are
   desirable from the standpoint of reduction of manufacturing
   and assemblying costs.      However, the present invention is not
   limited to these dimensions.
25 [0197]           As described above Figure 9, 11 and 12,      the
   receiving surface 150i which is the recess 150q of the
   coupling 150    is in contact with the free end surface 153b of
   the development shaft     153 which is the projection.     Therefore,
   the coupling 150     is swung along the free end portion     (the
30 spherical surface) 153b about the center P2        of the free end
   portion    (the spherical surface) 153b in other words,      the axis
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                   - 49
   L2 is movable substantially in all directions irrespective of
   the phase of the drum shaft 153.     The  axis L2 of the coupling
   150  is movable   (pivotable, revolvable, movable) in all
   directions substantially.     As will be described hereinafter,
 5 in order that the coupling 150 may engage with the drive shaft
   180,   the axis L2  is inclined toward the downstream with
   respect to the rotating direction of the rotary C relative to
   the axis Li,   just before the engagement.     In other words,    as
   shown in Figure     17, the axis L2 inclines so that the driven
10 portion 150a    of the coupling 150   positions at the downstream
   side with respect to the rotational direction        X4 of the
   rotary.
   [0198]          The  still more detailed description will be
   made.
15 [0199]          As  shown in Figure 12,  a distance n3 between a
   maximum outer diameter part and supporting member 157        of the
   driving portion 150b the coupling 150     is selected so that a
   slight gap is provided between them.      By this, the coupling
   150  is pivotable.
20 [0200]          As  shown in Figure 7, the ribs 157el and 157e2
   are semi-circular ribs extending in parallel with the axis Li.
   The ribs 157el   and 157e2  are perpendicular to the rotational
   direction X4.
   [0201]          In addition, a distance n2    (Figure 11)   in the
25 direction of the axis Li    from the rib 157e to the flange
   portion 150j   is shorter than a distance nl from the center of
   the pin 155 to the driving portion 150b side edge.        By this,
   the pin 155 does not disengage from the openings 150gl        and
   150gl.
   10156073 1                                                 905731D2

                                   - 50
    [0202]     Therefore, as shown in Figure     9, the driven
   portion 150a is greatly pivotable in the direction X4 relative
   to the axis L2 the coupling 150.      In other words, the driving
   portion 150b is greatly pivotable toward the side not provided
 5 with the rib 150e    (perpendicular to the sheet of the drawing).
   Figure 9 illustrates the state after the axis L2 is       inclined.
   In addition, the coupling 150 can also be movable to the state
   substantially parallel to the axis Li     as shown In Figure 12
   from the state of the inclined axis L2 as shown in Figure 9.
10 In this manner, the ribs 157el and 157e2 are disposed.         By
   doing so,   the axis L2 of the coupling 150 can be made
   pivotable relative to the axis Li,     and in addition, the
   developing frame and 13 can be prevented from disengaging from
   the coupling 150.     Both of the effects can be provided.
15  [0203]         The  coupling 150 has a play   (the distance n2)    in
   the direction of the axis Li     relative to the development shaft
   153.    Therefore, the receiving surface 150i     (the conic
   surface) may not always contact snuggly the drum shaft free
   end portion 153b    (the spherical surface).    In other words, the
20 center of the pivoting may deviate from the center of
   curvature P2   of the spherical surface.    However, even in such
   a case,   the axis L2 is  rotatable or pivotable relative to the
   axis Li.    For this reason, the purpose of this embodiment can
   be accomplished.
25  [0204]         In addition, maximum possible inclination angle
   a   (Figure 9) between the axis Li   and the axis L2 is   limited to
   one half of the taper angle     (al, Figure 6(f))   between the axis
   L2 and the receiving surface 150i.      The apex angle of the
   conical shape of the receiving surface 150i      the coupling 150
30 can be properly selected.     By doing so,  the inclination angle
   a4   of the coupling 150  are set to the optimal value.       The
   shape of the columnar portion 153a of the development shaft
   10156073 1                                                 905731D2

                                    -  51
   153 may be simply cylindrical.        By this, the manufacturing
   cost can be saved.
   [0205]           The width of the opening 150g     in the standby
   state is   selected so that the pin 155 may not interfere when
 5 the axis L2    inclines, as described hereinbefore.
   [0206]           The  locus of the flange portion 150j when the
   driven portion 150a side inclines in the direction X5 is
   illustrated by the region Ti      in Figure 13.    As shown in the
   Figure, even if the coupling 150       inclines, the interference
10 with the pin 155 does not occur, and therefore,        the flange
   portion 150j    can be provided over the full-circumference of
   the coupling 150     (Figure 6(b)).    In other words, the shaft
   receiving surface 150i has conical shape, and therefore, when
   the coupling 150     inclines, the pin 155 does not enter in the
15 region Ti.    For this reason, the cutting away range of the
   coupling 150    is minimized.   Therefore, the rigidity of the
   coupling 150    can be assured.
    (7)  Description of constitution of rotary       (moving member,
   rotation selecting mechanism) of apparatus main assembly
20 [0207]        Next, with reference to Figures 15 to 21,      a
   constitution of the rotary C as the moving member will be
   described.    Figures 15   and 16 are perspective views of the
   rotary C in a state in which the developing cartridge B is not
   mounted.    Figure 17A is   a perspective view showing a state in
25 which a single developing cartridge B is mounted to the rotary
   C.   Figures 18 to 21 are side views showing the rotary C,         the
   photosensitive drum 107,     a driving train, and the developing
   cartridge B.
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                      - 52
    [0208]           In the axial   line Li  direction, rotary flanges
   50L and 50R are provided at both end portions.          Outside the
   rotary flanges 50L and 50R in the axial line Li direction,
   rotary side plates 54L and 54R are provided, respectively.
 5 The rotary flanges      50L and 50R and a central shaft 51     thereof
   are rotatably supported by the side plates        54L and 54R located
   outermostly in the axial line Li direction.
    [0209]           At opposing surfaces 50Lb and 50Rb of the pair
   of flanges 50L and 50R, groove-like main assembly guides
10 130L1,    130L2,  130L3,  130L4,  130R1,  130R2, 130R3,  and 130R4
   used during mounting and demounting of the cartridge B with
   respect to the rotary C      (accommodating portion 130A) are
   provided.     Along these main assembly guides provided to the
   apparatus main assembly A,       cartridge-side guides 140R1,     140R2,
15 140L1,    and 140L2   (Figures 2 and 3) of the cartridge B are
   inserted.     That is,   the cartridge B is mountable to and
   demountable from the rotary C.         The cartridge B is detachably
   mounted to the rotary C by the user.
    [0210]           More specifically, at one end of the cartridge B
20  (Bi) with respect to a longitudinal direction of the cartridge
   B   (Bi),  the guides 140R1   and 140R2 are provided.     Further, at
   the other longitudinal end of the cartridge B         (Bi), the guides
   140L1   and 140L2   are provided.     The user holds the cartridge B
   and inserts the guides 140R1 and 140R2 into the guide 130R1
25 provided to the rotary C.        Similarly, the user inserts the
   guides 140L1     and 140L2  into the guide 130L1 provided to the
   rotary C.     In this way, the cartridge B is detachably mounted
   to the accommodating portion 130A provided to the rotary C by
   the user.     That is,   the cartridge B is guided by the
30 above-described guides and is mounted to and demounted from
   the accommodating portion 130A with respect to a direction
   crossing the longitudinal direction of the cartridge B
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                    - 53
    (developing roller 110).     The cartridge B  is mounted in a
   direction in which the longitudinal direction intersects a
   rotational direction X4 of the rotary C.       Therefore, the
   cartridge B    (coupling) provided at one longitudinal end of the
 5 cartridge B   is moved in a direction substantially
   perpendicular to the driving shaft 180 by rotation of the
   rotary C.    The cartridge B mounted to the rotary C is     liable
   to rotate about arcuate guides      140R1 and 140L1 when a rotating
   force is   transmitted from the apparatus main assembly A to the
10 cartridge B.     However, elongated guides 140R2 and 140L2
   contact inner surfaces of grooves of the guides 130R1 and 130
   Li,  so that the cartridge B is positional with respect to the
   rotary C.    That is,  the cartridge B is detachably accommodated
   in the accommodating portion 130A.
15 [0211]           Similarly, the cartridge B   (B2) is guided by the
   guides 130R2    and 130L2 provided to the rotary C and detachably
   mounted to the accommodating portion 130A.       The cartridge B
    (B3) is guided by the guides 130R3 and 130L3 provided to the
   rotary C and detachably mounted to the accommodating portion
20 130A.   The cartridge B    (B4) is guided by the guides 130R4 and
   130L4 provided to the rotary C and detachably mounted to the
   accommodating portion 130A.
   [0212]           That is, the cartridge B is detachably
   accommodated by the user in the accommodating portion 130A
25 provided to the rotary C.
   [0213]           Figure 17 shows a state in which the developing
   cartridge B   is mounted in the apparatus main assembly 4
    (rotary C).
   [0214]           Each of the developing cartridges B is
30 positioned with respect to the rotary C and is rotated by
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                   -  54
   rotation of the rotary C.     At this time, the developing
   cartridge B   is fixed to the rotary C by an urging spring, a
   lock, or the like    (not shown) so that a position of the
   developing cartridge B is not deviated by the rotation of the
 5 rotary C.
    [0215]         To the other rotary side plate 54L, a driving
   mechanism for rotating the developing roller        (not shown) is
   provided.    That is,  a developing device driving gear 181
   engages with a pinion 65 fixed to a motor shaft of the motor
10 64.    When the motor starts rotation, a rotating force is
   transmitted to the gear 181.      The driving shaft 180 coaxially
   disposed with the gear 181    starts rotation.     As  a result, the
   rotating force of the driving shaft       180 is transmitted to the
   developing roller 110 and the like through the coupling 150.
15 Incidentally, in this embodiment, the driving shaft        180 has
   started rotation before the engagement of the coupling 150.
   However, timing of the start of rotation of the driving shaft
   180   can be appropriately selectable.
    [0216]         The  cartridge B rotates together with the pair
20 of rotary flanges    50L and 50R.    That is,  the rotary C stops
   its rotation when it is    rotated a predetermined angle.       As   a
   result, the cartridge B is positioned at a position
    (developing position) opposite to the photosensitive drum 107
   provided to the apparatus main assembly A.        The  coupling 150
25 engages with the driving shaft      180 substantially
   simultaneously with the positioning and stop of the cartridge
   B.   That is,  a recess 1502 covers an end of an end portion
   180b of the driving shaft    180.
    [0217]         The driving shaft     180 has the substantially same
30 constitution as the above-described developing shaft.          That
   is,   the driving shaft  180 includes a spherical end portion
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                    - 55
   180b and a pin 182 penetrating an almost center of a principal
   portion 180a of its cylindrical shape.       By this pin 182,     a
   rotating force    (driving force) is   transmitted to the cartridge
   B through the coupling 150.
 5  [0218]         To the rotary C,    the four color cartridges B are
   mounted.    Here, pressure application of the cartridges B to
   the photosensitive drum 107     is performed in the following
   manner.
    [0219]         As described above, the flanges 50L and 50R are
10 rotatably supported by the rotary side plates 54L and 54R.
   The rotary side plates    54L and 54R at both ends    are positioned
   and fixed to side plates     (not shown of the apparatus main
   assembly A through a swingable shaft      60 rotatably disposed
   above the rotary side plates 54L and 54R.       In other words, the
15 cartridge B,   the rotary flanges    50, and the rotary side plates
   54  are integrally swung about the swingable shaft      60.    That
   is,   integral swinging movement of the cartridge B and the
   rotary C is performed.     As a result, the cartridge B is
   pressed against or separated from the photosensitive drum 107.
20  [0220]         This pressing and separating operation performed
   by pressing up a rotary stay 66 disposed between the rotary
   side plates   54L and 54R by rotation of a cam     (not shown).
    [0221]         Further, as described with reference to Figure
   15,   the driving shaft  180 is positioned and mounted at a
25 predetermined position of the apparatus main assembly A with
   respect to a radial direction and an axial      substantially.
   Further, the cartridge B is     also positioned at a predetermined
   position of the apparatus main assembly A by stop of the
   rotation of the rotary C.      These positioned driving shaft 180
30 and cartridge B are connected by the coupling 150.        The
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                      - 56
   coupling 150    is swingable    (pivotable, movable) with respect to
   the cartridge B     (frame).   Accordingly, even between the
   driving shaft 180 positioned at the predetermined position and
   the cartridge B positioned at the predetermined position, the
 5 coupling 150    is capable of transmitting the rotating force
   smoothly.    That is,   even when there is   some shaft   (axis)
   deviation between the driving shaft       180 and the cartridge 150,
   the coupling 150 can smoothly transmit the rotating force.
   [0222]           This  is one of remarkable effects of the
10 embodiment of the coupling to which the present invention is
   applied.
    (8)  Switching constitution of developing cartridge
    (developing device)
   [0223]        At each of the outer peripheral     surfaces of the
15 flanges   50L and 50R, a gear 50a is integrally provided as
   shown in Figures 15 to 17.        A pair of idler gears 59L and 59R
   engaged with these gears 50a is disposed at both longitudinal
   end portions.     These idler gears 59L and 59R are connected by
   the swingable shaft     60.   When the flange 50L disposed at one
20 of the longitudinal ends is       rotated, the other flange 50R is
   rotated in phase through the gears 59L and 59R.         By employing
   such a driving constitution, during the rotation of the rotary
   C or the rotation of the developing roller 110,        torsion of
   either one of the flanges 50L and 50R is prevented.
25 [0224]           With the gears 59L and 59R connected to the
   swinging center of the rotary side plates       54L and 54R, i.e.,
   the swingable shaft     60,  a rotary driving gear 65 engages.
   This gear 65 is connected to the motor 61.        To a rotating
   shaft of the motor 61,      an encoder 62  is mounted.   The encoder
30 62 detects an amount of rotation of the motor 61 and controls
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                     - 57
   the number of rotation.       Further, at an outer peripheral
   surface of one flange 50L, a flag 57 projected from the flange
   50L in a radial direction is provided       (Figure 16).   The flange
   50L and the flag 57 are rotated so as to pass through a photo
 5 interruptor 58 fixed to the side plate 58.         By detecting
   blocking of the photo-interruptor with the flag 57,        the rotary
   C is controlled so as to rotate every predetermined angle.
   That is,   after the rotary C rotates a predetermined angle from
   the time when the flag 57 blocks       the photo-interruptor, the
10 first developing cartridge      stops at a position opposite to the
   photosensitive drum 107.       The rotary C is   further rotated a
   predetermined angle in one direction and thereafter the second
   developing cartridge stops at a position opposite to the
   photosensitive drum 107.       By repeating this operation four
15 times in total     (stops of the four color developing
   cartridges),    a color image   is formed.
   [0225]           That is,  the cartridge B is moved in a direction
   perpendicular to the axial      line L3 of the driving shaft     180 by
   the rotate of the rotary C in one direction in a state in
20 which the cartridge B     is mounted to the rotary C.
   [0226]           At an upper surface of the apparatus main
   assembly A,   an opening for mounting and demounting the
   developing cartridge B by the user and an openable/closable
   cover 40   (Figure 4) for covering the opening are provided.
25 Further, a door switch      (not shown) for detecting the
   open/close of the cover 40      is provided.   A  rotation operation
   of the rotary C is     started during electric power on and when
   the cover 40    is closed   (when the door switch is   turned on).

   [0228]          Operations of the rotary C and the cartridge B
   will be described step by step with reference to Figures 18 to
   21.   For ease of description, only one cartridge in the rotary
   is  shown.
 5 [0229]          First, in a state    shown in Figure 18,   the
   cartridge B does not reach a predetermined position        (the
   coupling member 150 is   located at a pre-rotation angular
   position).    When the rotary C   (is revolved in a direction of
   X4,  the flag 57 partially projected from the outer peripheral
10 surface of the rotary flange 50 described above reaches the
   photo-interruptor 58,   so that the rotary C stops at a
   predetermined position    (a state   shown in Figure 19).     At this
   time, the driving shaft 180    and the coupling 150     of the
   cartridge B are connected to each other       (the coupling member
15 150  is  located at a rotating force transmitting angular
   position).    The developing roller 110    is placed in a rotatable
   state.    In this embodiment, the driving shaft     180 has   already
   been rotated in a state in which the coupling 150 starts
   engagement with the driving shaft 180.       For this reason, the
20 developing roller 110   is rotated.     However, in the case where
   the driving shaft 180   is stopped in a state in which the
   coupling 150   is engaged with the driving shaft     180,  the
   coupling 150 waits in the rotatable state.        The engagement
    (connection) of the coupling 150 with the driving shaft         180
25 will be described later in detail.
   [0230]          Then, as described above, the cam      (not shown) is
   actuated to contact the rotary stay 66,      so that the rotary C
   is moved counterclockwisely about the swingable shaft 60.
   That is   the developing roller 110    contacts the photosensitive
30 drum 107 by being moved in an Xl direction       (a state of Figure
   20).    Then, a predetermined image forming operation is
   performed.
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                   - 59
    [0231]         When the image forming operation is completed,
   the rotary C is rotated in a clockwise direction about the
   swingable shaft    60 by a force of a spring     (not shown).    Thus,
   the rotary C is restored to the state shown in Figure 19.
 5 That is,   the developing roller 110 is moved apart from the
   photosensitive drum 107    (the coupling member 150     is  located at
   a disengagement angular position).
    [0232]         Then, the rotary C is rotated about the central
   shaft 51   in the X4 direction so that a subsequent cartridge B
10 can reach the developing position      (a state of Figure 21).        At
   this time, the connection between the driving shaft         180 and
   the coupling 150    is released.   That is,   the coupling 150     is
   disconnected from the driving shaft      180.   The operation at
   this time will be specifically described later.
15  [0233]         The  above-described operations from the
   operation described with reference to Figure 18        to the
   operation described with reference to Figure 21        are repeated
   four times in total for four colors,      so that color image
   formation is effected.

   Disengaging operation, of the coupling.
    [0234]       As has been described in the foregoing, immediately
   before the cartridge B stops at the predetermined position of
   the apparatus main assembly A,     or substantially simultaneously
25 therewith, the coupling 150    is engaged with the drive shaft
   180.    (From Figure 18 to Figure 19).     And, when the cartridge
   B moves from the predetermined position of the apparatus main
   assembly after the rotation during the predetermined period,
   the coupling 150    is disengaged from the drive shaft      180
30  (from Figure 20 to Figure 21).
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                      - 60
   [0235]           Referring to Figure 22-Figure 25,       the
   description will be made with respect to the engaging
   operation, the rotational force transmitting operation and the
   disengaging operation of the coupling.          Figure 22   is  a
 5 longitudinal sectional view illustrating the drive shaft,              the
   coupling, and the development shaft.          Figure 23 is a
   longitudinal sectional view illustrating the phase difference
   among the drive shaft,      the coupling, and the development
   shaft.    Figure 25 is a longitudinal sectional view
10 illustrating the drive shaft, the coupling, and the
   development shaft.
   [0236]           In the process in which the cartridge B moves to
   the developing position by the rotation of the rotary C,              the
   coupling 150    is positioned at the pre-engagement angular
15 position.     More particularly, the axis L2 of the coupling is
   beforehand inclined relative to the axis Li          of the development
   shaft   153 so that the driven portion 150a positions downstream
   of the rotary rotational direction X4.          By this inclination of
   the coupling 150,     a downstream free end position 150Al         of the
20 rotary C with respect to the rotational direction X4            thereof
   is positioned at the development shaft 153          side beyond a drive
   shaft free-end 180b3 with respect to the direction of the axis
   Li.   In addition, an upstream free end position 150A2 with
   respect to the direction X4       is positioned at the pin 182        side
25 beyond the drive shaft free-end 180b3 in the direction of the
   axis Li    (Figure 22  (a),  (b)).    Here, the free end position is
   the position nearest to the drive shaft with respect to the
   direction of the axis L2 of the driven portion 150a of the
   coupling 150    shown in Figure 6     (a) and  (c),  and it is    the
30 remotest position from the axis L2.         In other words,     it is   an
   edge line of the driven portion 150a of the coupling 150,              or
   an edge line of the driven projection 150d depending on the
   rotation phase of the coupling        (150A in Figure 6    (a) and    (c)).
   10156073 1                                                     905731D2

                                     - 61
    [0237]          First, the downstream free end position 150Al
   with respect to the rotary rotational direction         (X4) passes by
   the shaft free-end 180b3.       And, after the coupling 150 passes
   the drive shaft     180,  the receiving surface 150f   or the
 5 projection   150d of conical shape of the coupling 150        contacts
   to the free end portion 180b or the pin 182        of the drive shaft
   180.    And, it inclines in response to the rotation of the
   rotary C so that the axis L2 becomes parallel to the axis Li
    (Figure 22   (c)).   And, finally, the position of the cartridge
10 B  is determined relative to the apparatus main assembly A.
   More particularly, the rotary C stops.         Under the present
   circumstances, the drive shaft       180 and the development shaft
   153   are substantially co-axial with each other.        More
   particularly, the coupling 150 is moved from the pre
15 engagement angular position to the rotational force
   transmitting angular position so as to permit the free end
   position 150Al     thereof to circumvent the drive shaft 180
    (pivoting and swinging).      And, the coupling 150   is inclined
   from the pre-engagement angular position toward the rotational
20 force transmitting angular position where the axis L2 is
   substantially co-axial with the axis Li.         And, the coupling
   150   and the drive shaft 180    are engaged with each other
    (Figure 22   (d)).   More particularly, the recess 150z covers
   the free end portion 180b.       By this, the rotational    force is
25 enabled to be stably transmitted from the drive shaft 180           to
   the coupling 150.      In addition, at this time, the pin 152       is
   in the opening 150g      (Figure 6  (b)), and the pin 182   is in the
   entrance portion 150k.
    [0238]          In this embodiment, when the coupling 150 starts
30 the engagement with the drive shaft       180,  the drive shaft    180
   is  already rotating.      For this reason, the coupling 150 begins
   the rotation immediately.       However, when the drive shaft      180
   is  at rest at the time of the engagement with the drive shaft
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                   - 62
   180   of the coupling 150,  the coupling member 150      stands by
   with the rotatable state, when the pin 182      is present in the
   entrance portion 150k.
   [0239]          As has been described hereinbefore, according to
 5 this embodiment, the coupling 150      is pivotable relative to the
   axis Li.    Therefore, the coupling 150    can be engaged relative
   to the drive shaft 180    correspondingly to the rotation of the
   rotary C by the coupling 150 per se inclining, without
   interfering with the drive shaft 180      (coupling).
10 [0240]          Furthermore, the engaging operation of the
   coupling 150 described above is possible regardless of the
   phase difference between the drive shaft      180 and the coupling
   150.    Referring to Figure 14 and Figure 23,     the description
   will be made as to the phase difference between the coupling
15 and the drive shaft.    Figure 23 illustrates the phases of the
   coupling and the drive shaft.      In Figure 23   (a),   the pin 182
   and the driving shaft receiving surface 150f       of the coupling
   150   oppose relative to each other in the upstream with respect
   to the rotational direction X4 of the rotary.         In Figure 23
20  (b),  the pin 182 and the projection    150d of the coupling 150
   oppose relative to each other.       In Figure 23   (c),  the free end
   portion 180b of the drive shaft and the projection         150d of the
   coupling 150   oppose relative to each other.      In Figure 23      (d),
   the free end portion 180b and the receiving surface 150f of
25 the coupling oppose relative to each other.        As   shown in
   Figure 14,   the coupling 150  is mounted pivotably in all the
   directions relative to the development shaft 153.          For this
   reason, as shown in Figure 23,     the coupling 150     is pivotable
   in the mounting direction X4 irrespective of the phase of the
30 development shaft 153 with respect to the rotational direction
   X4.    In addition, the downstream free end position 150Al         is
   positioned in the developing roller 110 side from the drive
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                    - 63
   shaft free-end 180b3 in the rotational direction not         related
   irrespective of the phase difference between the drive shaft
   180  and the coupling 150.     In addition, the inclination angle
   of the coupling 150 is     set so that the upstream free end
 5 position 150A2 positions in the pin 182 side beyond the drive
   shaft free-end 180b3 in the rotational direction X4.          With
   such a setting, the downstream free end position 150Al         in the
   rotational direction X4 passes by the drive shaft free-end
   180b3 in response to the rotating operation of the rotary C.
10 And, in the case of Figure 23      (a), the driving shaft receiving
   surface 150f    contacts to the pin 182.    In the case of Figure
   23  (b),   the projection 150d contacts to the pin 182.       In the
   case of Figure 23     (c), the projection 150d contacts to the
   free end portion 180b.      In the case of Figure 23   (d),   the
15 receiving surface 150f     contacts to the free end portion 180b.
   In addition, the axis L2 approaches to the position in
   parallel with the axis Li by the contact force       (urging force)
   produced when the rotary C rotates, and they engage with each
   other    (coupling).   For this reason, irrespective of the phase
20 difference between the drive shaft 180      and the coupling 150 or
   between the coupling 150 and the development shaft        153, they
   can engage with each other.
   [0241]           Referring to Figure 24,   the rotational    force
   transmitting operation in the case of the rotation of the
25 developing roller 110 will be described.       The drive shaft 180
   rotates together with the gear      (helical gear) 181 in the
   direction of X8 in the Figure by the rotational       force received
   from the motor 64.      And, the pins 182  integral with the drive
   shaft   180 contact to any of the rotational    force receiving
30 surfaces 150el-150e4 of the coupling 150.       By this, the
   coupling 150    rotates.   The coupling 150 further rotates.       By
   this, the rotational force transmitting surface 150h 1 or
   150h2   of the coupling 150 contacts to the pin 155 integral
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                   - 64
   with the development shaft    153.   Then, the rotational force of
   the drive shaft   180 rotates the developing roller 110     through
   the coupling 150 and the development shaft 153.
   [0242]          In addition, the free end portion 153b of the
 5 development shaft 153   is contacted to the receiving surface
   150i.    The free end portion 180b of the drive shaft    180 is
   contacted to the receiving surface 150f.       By this, the
   coupling 150   is positioned correctly    (Figure 22d).  More
   particularly, the coupling 150 is positioned to the drive
10 shaft   180 by the recess 150z covering the free end portion
   180.   At this time, even if the axis L3 and the axis Li      are
   somewhat non-coaxial with each other, the coupling 150 can
   rotate without applying the large load to the development
   shaft   153 and the drive shaft 180 by the small    inclination of
15 the coupling 150.    For this reason, even if the drive shaft
   180  and the development shaft 153 deviate     from each other by
   slight position deviation of the cartridge B due to the
   rotation of the rotary C,    the coupling 150   can transmit the
   rotational force   smoothly.
20 [0243]          This is one of the remarkable effects according
   to an embodiment of the coupling of the present invention.
   [0244]          Referring to Figure 25,    the description will be
   made about the disengaging operation of the coupling 150        from
   the drive shaft   180 in response to the movement of the
25 cartridge B   from the predetermined position    (developing
   position) by the rotary C rotating in the one direction.
   [0245]          First, the position of each of the pin 182 at
   the time of the cartridge    (B) moving from the predetermined
   position will be described.     After the image formation
30 finishes, as will be apparent from the foregoing description,
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                      - 65
   the pin 182    is positioned at any two of the entering or
   entrance portions 150k1-150k4        (Figure 6).   And, the pin 155 is
   positioned in the opening 150gl        or 150g2.
   [0246]           The description will be made with respect to the
 5 operation of disengaging the coupling 150         from the drive shaft
   180  in interrelation with the operation of switching to the
   next developing cartridge B after the image forming operation
   using the cartridge is      completed.
   [0247]           In the state where the rotation for the
10 development shaft 153 has stopped, the axis L2         is
   substantially co-axial relative to the axis Li         in the coupling
   150  (rotational force transmitting angular position).           And,
   the development shaft      153 moves    in the dismounting direction
   X6 with the cartridge      (B),  and the receiving surface 150f      or
15 the projection 150d in the upstream with respect to the
   rotational direction of the rotary is brought into contact to
   the free end portion 180b of the drive shaft 180          or the pin
   182  (Figure 25a).     And, the axis L2 begins     to incline toward
   the upstream with respect to the rotational direction X4
20  (Figure 25   (b)).   This direction of inclination is the
   opposite from that of the inclination of the coupling 150            at
   the time of the engagement of the coupling 150 with the drive
   shaft   180, with respect to the development axis 153.          It
   moves, while the upstream free end portion 150A2 with respect
25 to the rotational direction X4 is         kept in contact with the
   free end portion 180b by the rotational operation of the
   rotary C.      And, in the axis L2,      the upstream free end portion
   150 A3   inclines to the free end 180b3 of the drive shaft
    (Figure 25   (c)).   And, in this state,     the coupling 150 is
30 passed by the drive shaft       180,  contacting to the free end
   180b3   (Figure 25   (d)).
   10156073 1                                                    905731D2

                                   - 66
   [0248]      Thus, the coupling 150 moves from the rotation of
   for transmitting angular position to the disengagement of
   angular position, so that a part     (upstream free-end portion
   150A2)   of the coupling 150 positioned upstream of the drive
 5 shaft   180 with respect to the rotational direction X4 is
   permitted to circumvent the drive shaft 180.      Therefore, the
   cartridge B moves in accordance with the rotation of the
   rotary C to the position of shown in Figure 21.      In addition,
   before the completion of the one-full rotation of the rotary
10 C,  the coupling 150   (the axis Li)  inclines toward downstream
   with respect to a rotational direction X4 by an unshown means.
   In other words, the coupling 150 moves from the disengagement
   angular position to the pre-engagement angular position.        By
   this, after the rotary C completes its one-full rotation, the
15 coupling 150   is in the state engageable with the drive shaft
   180.
   [0249]          As will be apparent from the foregoing
   description, the angle of the pre-engagement angular position
   the coupling 150 relative to the axis Li     is larger than the
20 angle of the disengaging angular position.      This is because it
   is preferable that the pre-engagement angular position is       set
   beforehand such that during the engagement operation of the
   coupling, the distance between the upstream free-end the
   position 150Al   with respect to the rotational direction X4 and
25 the free-end 180b3 of the drive shaft is relatively longer
    (Figure 22b).   This is done in consideration of the
   dimensional tolerance of the parts.      On the contrary, at the
   time of the coupling disengagement, the axis L2 inclines in
   interrelation with the rotation of the rotary C position.
30 Therefore, the downstream pre-end portion 150A2 of the
   coupling 150 A3 moves along the free end portion 180b3 the
   drive shaft.    In other words, the downstream free-end position
   180A2 with respect to the rotational direction X4 and the free
   10156073 1                                               905731D2

                                  - 67
   end portion 180b3 are substantially aligned with each other in
   a direction of the axis L1(Figure 25     (c)).  In addition, when
   the coupling 150 disengages from the drive shaft 180,        the
   disengagement is possible irrespective of the phase difference
 5 between the coupling 150 and the pin 182.
   [0250]          As shown in Figure 22,  in the rotational force
   transmitting angular position of the coupling 150,       the angle
   relative to the axis Li   of the coupling 150   is  such that    in
   the state where the cartridge    (B) is mounted to the
10 predetermined position of the apparatus main assembly        (A)   (the
   position opposed to the photosensitive drum),      the coupling 150
   receives the transmission of the rotational force from the
   drive shaft   180, and it rotates.
   [0251]      In addition, the pre-engagement angular position of
15 the coupling 150   is the angular position immediately before
   the coupling 150   is brought into engagement with the drive
   shaft   180 in the process of mounting operation to the
   predetermined position in accordance with the rotation of the
   rotary C.
20 [0252]      In addition, the disengaging angular position of the
   coupling 150   is the angular position relative to the axis Li
   of the coupling 150 at the time of the disengagement of the
   cartridge   (B) from the drive shaft 180,   in the process of the
   cartridge B moving from the predetermined position in
25 accordance with the rotation of the rotary C.
   [0253]      In the pre-engagement angular position or the
   disengaging angular position, the angles beta2 and beta3 which
   the axis L2 makes with the axis Li    are larger than the angle
   betal which the axis L2 makes with the axis Li      in the
30 rotational force transmitting angular position.       As  for the
   10156073 1                                                 905731D2

                                    - 68
   angle theta 1, 0 degree is preferable.      However, in this
   embodiment, if the angle betal is     less than about 15 degrees,
   the smooth transmission of the rotational     force is
   accomplished.     This is  also one of the effects of this
 5 embodiment.     As for the angles beta2 and beta3,  the range of
   about 20   -  60 degrees  is preferable.
   [0254]           As has been described hereinbefore, the coupling
   is pivotably mounted to the axis Li.      And, the coupling 150
   inclines in accordance with the rotation of the rotary C
10 without interfering with the drive shaft.
   [0255]           Here, according to the above-described
   embodiment of the present invention, even if the cartridge B
    (developing roller 110)    moves in response to the movement of
   the rotary C in one direction which is     substantially
15 perpendicular to the direction of the axis L3 of the drive
   shaft   180,  the drum coupling member 150 can accomplish the
   coupling    (engagement) and the disengagement relative to the
   drive shaft    180.  This  is because the drum coupling member 150
   according to an embodiment of the present invention can take
20 the rotational force transmitting angular position, the pre
   engagement angular position, and the disengaging angular
   position.
   [0256]           Here, as has been described hereinbefore, the
   rotational force transmitting angular position is the angular
25 position of the drum coupling member 150 for transmitting the
   rotational force    for rotating the developing roller 110 to the
   developing roller 110.
   [0257]           The pre-engagement angular position is   the
   position inclined from the rotational     force transmitting
30 angular position, and which is the angular position of the
   10156073 1                                               905731D2

                                  - 69
   drum coupling member 150 before the drum coupling member 150
   engages with the rotational   force applying portion.
   [0258]          The disengaging angular position is the position
   which is   inclined away from the pre-engagement angular
 5 position from the rotational force transmitting angular
   position and which is the angular position of the drum
   coupling member 150 for the drum coupling member 150       to
   disengage from the drive shaft    180.
   [0259]          In the above described description, at the time
10 of the disengagement, the upstream receiving surface 150f        or
   the upstream projection 150d contacts with the free end
   portion 180b of the drive shaft     180 in interrelation with the
   rotation of the rotary C.    By this, it has been described that
   the axis L2   inclines toward the upstream in the rotational
15 direction X4.    However, in this embodiment, this is not
   inevitable.    For example, a toggle spring    (elastic material)
   is provided adjacent to the rotary fulcrum of the coupling.
   And, the structure is   such that at the time of the coupling
   engagement, the urging force produces toward the downstream in
20 the rotational direction X4   relative to the coupling.       At the
   time of the disengagement of the coupling, corresponding to
   the rotation of the rotary C,    the urging force   is produced
   toward the upstream in the rotational direction X4 to the
   coupling contrarily to the case of the engagement by the
25 function of this toggle spring.      Therefore, at the time of the
   coupling disengagement, the upstream receiving surface 150f         or
   the projection 150d in the rotational direction X4,      and the
   free end portion 180b of the drive shaft     180 are not   contacted
   to each other, and the coupling disengages from the drive
30 shaft.    In other words, as long as the axis L2 of the coupling
   150  inclines in response to the rotation of the rotary C,       any
   means is usable.    In addition, by the time immediately before
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                  - 70
   the coupling 150 engages with the drive shaft     180, the
   coupling is   inclined so that the driven portion 150a of the
   coupling faces toward the downstream in the rotational
   direction X4.    In other words, the coupling is beforehand
 5 placed in the state of the pre-engagement angular position.
   For this purpose, any means in Embodiment 2 et     seqq is usable.
   [0260]          Here, referring to Figure 26,   the description
   will be made about reduction of the time which the image
   formation   (development) requires in the present embodiment.
10 Figure 26 is   a timing chart showing the rotation of the
   developing roller and so on.
   [0261]          Here, with reference to Figure 26,   reduction in
   time required for image formation    (development) in this
   embodiment will be described.     Figure 26 is  a timing chart for
15 illustrating rotation of the developing roller and the like.
   [0262]          In Figure 26, timings of rotation and stop of
   the developing roller from a state in which the developing
   apparatus   (cartridge) is in a home position until the
   developing roller receives an image formation start     signal to
20 effect development for first color     (yellow image formation)
   and development for a second color     (magenta image formation).
   With respect to subsequent developments for third and fourth
   colors   (cyan image formation and black image formation),
   illustration is omitted due   to redundant explanation.
25 [0263]          In this embodiment, as described above, the
   engaging operation between the driving shaft 180     and the
   coupling 150   is completed during the rotation of the rotary C
   or immediately after the stop of the rotation of the rotary C.
   During or immediately after the stop of the rotation of the
30 rotary C,   the engaging operation of the coupling 150 with the
   10156073 1                                               905731D2

                                 - 71
   driving shaft 180 is completed.    Then, the developing roller
   110 is placed in a rotatable state or is rotated.
   [0264]        That is,  in the case where the driving shaft 180
   has already been rotated before the coupling 150 goes into an
 5 engaging operation with the driving shaft 180, the coupling
   150 starts rotation simultaneously with the engagement with
   the driving shaft 180.   Then, the developing roller 110 starts
   rotation.  Further, in the case where the driving shaft 180 is
   stopped, the coupling 150 is stopped without being rotated
10 even when the engagement of the coupling 150 with the driving
   shaft 180 is completed.   When the driving shaft 180 starts
   rotation, the coupling 150 starts rotation.    Then, the
   developing roller 110 starts rotation.
   [0265]        In either case, according to this embodiment, a
15 main assembly-side rotating force transmitting member (e.g.,
   the main assembly-side coupling) is not required to be moved
   forward and back in the axial line direction.
   [0266]        In this embodiment, the driving shaft 180 has
   already been rotated before the coupling 150 goes into the
20 engaging operation with the driving shaft 180.    Accordingly,
   image formation can be started quickly.    Therefore, compared
   with the case where the driving shaft 180 is stopped, the time
   required for image formation can be further reduced.
   [0267]        Further, in this embodiment, in the rotating
25 state of the driving shaft 180, the coupling 150 can be
   disconnected from the driving shaft 180.
   [0268]        Accordingly, in this embodiment, the driving
   shaft 180 may also not be rotated or stopped in order that the
   10156073 1                                             905731D2

                                  -  72
   coupling 150  is engaged with or disengaged from the driving
   shaft.
   [0269]         That is,  according to the coupling 150     in this
   embodiment, the coupling 150    can be engaged with and
 5 disengaged from the driving shaft 180,    irrespective of the
   rotation or stop of the driving shaft 180.      This  is also one
   of the remarkable effects of this embodiment.
   [0270]         Thereafter, steps of rotary    (developing roller)
   contact, yellow image   formation, rotary   (developing roller)
10 separation, and developing roller rotation stop are performed
   in this order.   Simultaneously with the start of rotation of
   the rotary, a disengaging operation of the coupling of the
   cartridge from the driving shaft of the apparatus main
   assembly is performed to prepare for a developing operation
15 for the second color.
   [0271]         That is,  in this embodiment, the engaging and
   disengaging operation of the coupling can be performed in
   interrelation with the rotation of the rotary.       Accordingly,
   it is possible to shorten a necessary time interval between
20 the first color development and the second color development.
   Similarly, time intervals between the second color development
   and the third color development, between the third color
   development and the fourth color development, between the home
   position and the first color development, and between the
25 fourth color development and the home position can also be
   reduced.   Accordingly, a time required for obtaining a color
   image on a sheet can be reduced.     This is also one of the
   remarkable effects of this embodiment.
   [0272]         Referring to Figure 27 and Figure 28,     a modified
30 example of the development shaft will be described.        Figure 27
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                    -  73
   is  a perspective view of members around the development shaft.
   Figure 28   illustrates a characteristic portion in Figure 27.
   [0273]          In the foregoing description, the free end of
   the development shaft    is a spherical surface, and the coupling
 5 is  contacted to the spherical surface thereof.         However, as
   shown in Figure 27    (a) and 28   (a),   the free end 1153b of the
   development shaft 1153 may be planate.          An edge portion 1153c
   of a peripheral surface thereof contacts to the coupling 150
   to rotate the coupling 150.      Even with such a structure, the
10 axis L2 is assuredly pivotable relative to the axis Li.            In
   addition, the processing to the spherical surface is
   unnecessary.    For this reason, the cost can be reduced.
   [0274]          In the foregoing description, another drive
   transmission pin is fixed to the development shaft.           However,
15 as shown in Figure 27    (b) and 28     (b),  it may be separate
   member from the elongated development shaft.          A first
   development shaft 1253A is a member for supporting a rubber
   portion of the developing roller        (unshown).   In addition, a
   second development shaft 1253B is provided co-axially with the
20 first development shaft 1253A, and has         integrally a rib for
   the drive transmissions for engaging with the coupling 150
   1253Bc.    In this case, geometrical latitude is enhanced by an
   integral moldings using injection molding and so on.           For this
   reason, the rib part    1253Bc can be enlarged.       Therefore, the
25 area of the drive transmitting portion 1253Bd can be
   increased.    Even if it is a development shaft made of resin
   material, it can transmit the torque assuredly.          In the
   Figure, when the coupling 150 rotates in the direction of X8,
   the drive transmission surface 150h of the coupling contacts
30 to the drive transmitting portion 1253Bd of the second drive
   shaft.    When the contact area is wide at this time, a stress
   applied on the rib 1253Bc is      small.     Therefore, the liability
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                      - 74
   of the damage of the coupling and so on is mitigable.          In
   addition, the first development shaft may be the simple metal
   shaft, and the second development shaft may be an integrally
   molded product of the resin material.         In this case, the cost
 5 reduction is accomplished.
   [0275]           As shown in Figure 27     (c) and 28 (c), the
   opposite ends 1355al, 1355a2 of the rotational force
   transmitting pin     (rotational force receiving portion) 1355 are
   fixed by press-fitting and so on beforehand into the drive
10 transmission holes 1350g 1 or 1350g2 of the coupling 1350.
   Thereafter, the development shaft 1353 which has the free end
   portion 1353c1,    1353c2 formed into the shape of a slot may be
   inserted.     At this time, it is preferable that, the engaging
   portion 1355b of the pin 1355 relative to the free end portion
15  (unshown) of the development shaft 1353 is formed into a
   spherical shape so that        the coupling 1350 is pivotable.     By
   fixing the pin 1355 in this manner beforehand, it is not
   necessary to increase the size of the standby hole 1350g of
   the coupling 1350 more than needed.         Therefore, the rigidity
20 of the coupling is enhanced.
   [0276]           In addition, in the foregoing description, the
   inclination of the axis of the coupling follows the
   development shaft free-end.        However, as shown in Figures 27
    (d), 27   (e), and 28  (d),   it may follow the contact surface
25 1457a of the bearing member 1457 co-axially with the
   development shaft 1453.        In this case, the free end surface
   1453b of the development shaft 1453 is at the level comparable
   as the end surface of the bearing member.         And, the rotational
   force transmitting pin       (rotational force receiving portion)
30 1453c projected from the free end surface 1453b is inserted
   into the inside of the opening 1450g of the coupling 1450.
   The rotational force is transmitted by this pin 1453c
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                   - 75
   contacting to the rotational force transmitting surface
    (rotational force transmitting portion) 1450h of the coupling.
   In this manner, the contact surface 1457a at the time of the
   inclination of the coupling 1450     is provided on the supporting
 5 member 1457.    By this,  there is no necessity of processing the
   development shaft directly, and the machining cost can be
   reduced.
   [0277]          In addition,  similarly, the spherical surface at
   the free end may be a molded resin part which is      a separate
10 member.    In this case,  the machining cost of the shaft can be
   reduced.    This is because the configuration of the shaft
   processed by cutting and so on can be simplified.       In
   addition, a range of the spherical surface of the shaft free
   end may be narrowed, and the machining cost may be reduced by
15 limiting the range which requires highly precise processing.
   [0278]          Referring to Figure 29,   the description will be
   made about a modified example of the drive shaft.       Figure 29
   is  a perspective view of drive shaft and development driving
   gear.
20 [0279]          Similarly to the development shaft, it is
   possible to form the free end of the drive shaft 1180       into a
   flat surface 1180b    as shown in Figure 29    (a).  By this, the
   configuration of the shaft    is simple,  and the machining cost
   can be reduced.    A pin  (rotational force applying portion) is
25 designated by the reference numeral     1182.
   [0280]        In addition, similarly to the development shaft,
   the drive transmitting portion 1280c1,     1280c2 may be
   integrally molded with the drive shaft 1280      as shown in Figure
   29  (b).   When the drive shaft is   a molded resin part, the
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                   -  76
   drive transmitting portion can be molded as an integral part.
   Therefore, the cost reduction can be accomplished.
   [0281]          As  shown in Figure 29    (c), in order to narrow
   the range of the free end portion 1380b of the drive shaft
 5 1380,  an outer diameter of the shaft      free end 1380c may be
   decreased than the outer diameter of a main part 1380a.           The
   free end portion 1380b requires degree of accuracy, in order
   to determine the position of the coupling        (unshown) as
   described above.     For this reason, the surface which requires
10 high degree of accuracy can be reduced by limiting the
   spherical range only to the contact portion of the coupling.
   By this, the machining cost can be lowered.         In addition, the
   unnecessary free end of the spherical surface may be cut
   similarly.
15 [0282]          In addition,  in the foregoing embodiments,       in
   the direction of the axis Li,     there is no play between the
   developing roller and the apparatus main assembly.         Here,   the
   positioning method of the developing roller will be described
   with respect to the direction of the axis Li        as to, when play
20 exists.    In other words, the coupling 1550      is provided with a
   tapered surface 1550e, 1550h.      As  for the drive shaft, a force
   is produced in a thrust direction by the rotation.         By this,
   the coupling and the developing roller are positioned with
   respect to the direction of the axis Li.        Referring to Figure
25 30  and Figure 31,   this will be described in detail.       Figure 30
   is  a perspective view and a top plan view of the coupling
   alone.    Figure 31  is an exploded perspective view of the drive
   shaft, the development shaft, and the coupling.
   [0283]          As  shown in Figure 30    (b), the rotational force
30 receiving surface 1550e forms an angle alpha 5 relative to the
   axis L2.    When the drive shaft    180 rotates in the Ti
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                  -  77
   direction, the pin 182   and the receiving surface 1550e contact
   to each other.    Then, a component force is    applied in the T2
   direction to the coupling 1550, and the coupling is moved in
   the T2 direction.    In more detail, the coupling 1550 moves
 5 until the driving shaft receiving surface 1550f       (Figure 31a)
   of the coupling 1550 contacts to the free end 180b of the
   drive shaft  180.   By this, the position with respect to the
   direction of the axis L2 of the coupling 1550 is determined.
   In addition, the free end 180b is     a spherical surface, and the
10 driving shaft receiving surface 1550f     of the coupling 1550       is
   a conic surface.    For this reason, in the direction
   perpendicular to the axis L2,    the position of the driven
   portion 1550a of the coupling 1550     relative to the drive shaft
   180  is determined.
15 [0284]         In addition, as shown in Figure 30      (c),   the
   rotational force transmitting surface      (rotational force
   transmitting portion) 1550h forms the angle alpha 6 relative
   to the axis L2.    When the coupling 1550    rotates in the Ti
   direction, the transmitting surface 1550h and the pin 155
20 contact to each other.    Then, a component    force is applied in
   the T2 direction to the pin 155,     and the pin is moved in the
   T2 direction.   And, the development shaft     153 moves until the
   free end 153b of the development shaft 153      contacts to the
   development bearing surface 1550i     (Figure 31b) of the coupling
25 1550.   By this, the position of the development shaft 153
    (developing roller) with respect to the direction of the axis
   L2 is determined.
   [0285]         In addition, the development bearing surface
   1550i  of the coupling 1550  is a conic surface, and the free
30 end 153b of the development shaft 153     is the spherical
   surface.   For this reason, with respect to the direction
   perpendicular to the axis L2,    the position of the driving
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                  -  78
   portion 1550b of the coupling 1550      relative to development
   shaft   153 is determined.
   [0286]          The taper angles alpha 5 and alpha 6 are
   selected so as to be sufficient      for producing the force for
 5 moving the coupling and the developing roller in the thrust
   direction.    And, the angles differ depending on the load.
   However, if other means for determining the position of the
   thrust direction is provided, the taper angles alpha 5 and
   alpha 6 may be small.
10 [0287]          For this reason, as has been described
   hereinbefore, the coupling is provided with the taper for
   producing the retracting force in the direction of the axis
   L2,  and with the conic surface for determining the position in
   the direction perpendicular to the axis L2.       By this, the
15 position in the direction of the axis L2 of the coupling and
   the position in the direction perpendicular to the axis can be
   determined simultaneously.    In addition, further assured
   transmission of the rotational force can be accomplished.
   This will be described.    When the rotational force receiving
20 surface or the rotational force transmitting surface of the
   coupling is not given the taper angle which has been described
   above, the rotational   force transmitting surface or the
   rotational force receiving surface of the coupling inclines
   due to influence and so on of dimensional tolerance,        and the
25 component force is produced in the direction       (opposite
   direction to T2 of Figure 30)    of the axis L2.     By this, the
   contact between the rotational force receiving surface and the
   rotational force transmitting surface of the drive
   transmission pin and the coupling is disturbed.        However, with
30 the above described structure, such the problem is avoidable.
   10156073 1                                                 905731D2

                                  - 79
   [0288]         However, it is not   inevitable that the coupling
   is provided with both such the retracting taper and the
   positioning conic surface.    For example, in place of the taper
   for pulling in the direction of the axis L2,    a part for urging
 5 in the direction of the axis L2 may be added.     From now on, as
   long as there is no particular description, the case where
   both the tapered surface and the conic surface are formed will
   be described.
   [0289]         Referring to Figure 32,   the description will be
10 made about the means for regulating the direction of the
   inclination of the coupling relative to the cartridge for the
   engagement between the coupling, and the drive shaft of the
   apparatus main assembly.    Figure 32 is  a side view
   illustrating a major part of the driving side of the
15 cartridge, and Figure 33 is   a sectional view taken along S7-S7
   of Figure 32.
   [0290]         Here,  in order to regulate the inclining
   direction of the coupling 150 relative to the cartridge B,       the
   supporting member   (mounting member) 1557 is provided with a
20 regulating portion 1557h 1 or 1557h2.     This regulating portion
   1557h 1 or 1557h2 is provided so that it becomes substantially
   parallel to the rotational direction X4 immediately before the
   coupling engages with the drive shaft 180.     In addition, the
   intervals D7  thereof is  slightly larger than outer diameter of
25 the driving portion 150b of the coupling 150 phi D6.      By this,
   the coupling 150  is pivotable in the rotational direction X4.
   In addition, the coupling is pivotable in all the directions
   relative to the development shaft.     For this reason,
   irrespective of the phase of the development shaft, the
30 coupling can be inclined in the regulated direction.
   Therefore, it becomes easy to insert the drive shaft     (unshown)
   into the insertion opening 150m for the drive shaft of the
   10156073 1                                              905731D2

                                      - 80
   coupling 150 much more assuredly.         Therefore, they are more
   assuredly engageable.
   [0291]         In addition, in the foregoing description, the
   angle in the pre-engagement angular position of the coupling
 5 150  relative to the axis Li     is larger than the angle of the
   disengaging angular position        (Figure 22,  Figure 25).     However,
   this is not    inevitable.    Referring to Figure 34,    the
   description will be made.
   [0292]                 Figure 34 is a longitudinal sectional view
10 for illustrating the mounting process of the coupling.             As
   shown in Figure 35,      in the state of    (a) the mounting process
   of the coupling      in the direction of the axis Li,      the
   downstream free end position 1850A1 with respect to the
   rotational direction X4 is closer to the direction of the
15 driving shaft 182      (the rotational force applying portion) than
   the drive shaft free end 180b3.         In the state of   (b),   the free
   end position 1850A1      is contacted to the free end portion 180b.
   At this time, the free end position 1850A1 moves toward the
   development shaft 153 along the downstream free end portion
20 180b of the drive shaft 180 with respect to the rotational
   direction X4     of the rotary.    And, the free end position 1850A1
   passes by the free end portion 180b3 of the drive shaft             180 at
   this position, the coupling 150 takes         the pre-engagement
   angular position      (Figure 34  (c)).   And, finally the engagement
25 between the coupling 1850 and the drive shaft         180 is
   established     ((rotational force transmitting angular position)
   Figure 34    (d)).   When the free end portion 1850A1 passes by
   the free end 180b3,      the free end position 1850A1    is contacted
   to the free end 180b3,      or is positioned in the development
30 shaft   (153) or developing roller side.
   [0293]            An example of this embodiment will be described.
   10156073 1                                                     905731D2

                                       -  81
   [0294]            First, as shown in Figure 5,        the shaft diameter
   of the development shaft 153         is @Z1, the shaft diameter of the
   pin 155   is @Z2, and the length is        Z3.   As  shown in Figure 6
    (d),  (e) and   (f),   the maximum outer diameter of the driven
 5 portion 150a of the coupling 150          is @Z4 the diameter of a
   phantom circle Cl       (Figure 6(d))    which forms the inner ends       of
   the projections       150d 1 or 150d 2 or 150d3,      150d4 is @Z5, and
   the maximum outer diameter of the driving portion 150b is @Z6.
   Referring to Figures 22       and 25, the angle formed between the
10 coupling 150    and the conic drive shaft receiving surface 150f
   is a2,   and the angle formed between the coupling 150            and the
   shaft receiving surface 150i         is al.    A shaft diameter of the
   drive shaft    180 is @Z7,    the shaft diameter of the pin 182         is
   @Z8,  and the length is      Z9).    In addition, the angle relative
15 to the axis Li     in the rotational      force transmitting angular
   position is    B1,   the angle in the pre-engagement angular
   position is    $2,   and the angle in the disengaging angular
   position is    B3.     In this example,
   [0295]      Z1= 8mm;      Z2= 2mm;   Z3= 12mm;   Z4= 15mm;   Z5= 10mm;    Z6=
20 19mm;   Z7= 8mm;   Z8= 2mm;   Z9= 14mm ; al= 70 degrees;       a2= 120
   degrees;   B1=  0 degree;    B2=  35 degrees;    B3=  30 degrees.
   [0296]            It has been confirmed with these settings, the
   devices of this embodiment works satisfactorily.              However,
   these settings do not       limit the present invention.
25 [Embodiment 2]
   [0297]        Referring to Figure 36 -         Figure 38,  the second
   embodiment to which applied the present invention will be
   described.
   10156073 1                                                       905731D2

                                  - 82
   [0298]          In this embodiment, a means   for inclining the
   axis of the coupling relative to the axis of the developing
   roller.
   [0299]          In the description of this embodiment, the same
 5 reference numerals as in Embodiment    1 are assigned to the
   elements having the corresponding functions in this
   embodiment, and the detailed description thereof is omitted
   for simplicity.    This applies also about the other embodiment
   described in the below.
10 [03001          Figure 36 is a perspective view which
   illustrates a coupling locking member     (this is peculiar to the
   present embodiment) pasted on the supporting member.       Figure
   37  is an enlarged perspective view of a major part of the
   driving side of the cartridge.     Figure 38  is a perspective
15 view and a longitudinal sectional view which illustrate an
   engaged state between the drive shaft and the coupling.
   [0301]          As shown in Figure 36, the supporting member
   3157 has   a space 3157b which surrounds a part of coupling.      A
   coupling locking member 3159 as a maintaining member for
20 maintaining the inclination of the coupling 3150 is pasted on
   a cylinder surface 3157i which constitutes the space thereof.
   As will be described hereinafter, this locking member 3159 is
   a member for maintaining temporarily the state where the axis
   L2 inclines relative to the axis Li.      In other words, as shown
25 in Figure 36,   the flange portion 3150j   of the coupling 3150
   contacts to this   locking member 3159.    By this, the axis L2
   maintains the state of inclining toward the downstream with
   respect to the rotational direction     (X4) of the cartridge
   relative to the axis Li.    Therefore, as shown in Figure 46,
30 the locking member 3159 is disposed on the upstream cylinder
   surface 3157i of the bearing member 3157 with respect to the
   10156073 1                                               905731D2

                                     - 83
   rotational direction X4.      As   the material of the locking
   member 3159, the material which has a relatively high
   coefficient of friction, such as the rubber and the elastomer,
   or the elastic materials, such as the sponge and the flat
 5 spring, are suitable.      This  is because, the inclination of the
   axis L2 can be maintained by the frictional force, the elastic
   force, and so on.
   [0302]          Referring to Figure 38,       the engaging operation
    (a part of mounting and dismounting operation of the
10 cartridge) for engaging the coupling 3150 with the drive shaft
   180 will be described.      Figures 38     (al) and (bl) illustrate
   the state immediately before the engagement, and Figure 38
    (a2) and  (b2) illustrate the state of the completion of the
   engagement.
15 [03031          As  shown in Figure 38      (al) and Figure 38   (bl),
   the axis L2 of the coupling 3150 inclines toward the
   downstream   (retracted position) with respect to the rotational
   direction X4   relative to the axis Li       beforehand by the force
   of the locking member 3159      (pre-engagement angular position).
20 By this inclination of the coupling 3150,         by, in the direction
   of the axis Li,    the downstream     (with respect to the mounting
   direction) free end portion 3150A1        is  closer to the cartridge
    (developing roller) side than the drive shaft free end 180b3.
   And, the upstream     (with respect to the mounting direction)
25 free end portion 3150A2 is closer to the pin 182         than the free
   end 180b3 of the drive shaft 180.         In addition, at this time,
   as has been described in the foregoing, the flange portion
   3150j  of the coupling 150 is      contacted to the locking member
   3159.   And, the inclined state of the axis L2 is maintained by
30 the frictional force thereof.
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                     -  84
   [0304]            Thereafter, the cartridge B moves to the
   rotational direction X4.       By this, the free end surface 180b
   or the free end of the pin 182 contacts to the driving shaft
   receiving surface 3150f of the coupling 3150.          And, the axis
 5 L2 approaches to the direction in parallel with the axis Li by
   the contact force      (force revolving the rotary) thereof.       At
   this time, the flange portion 3150j        is departed from the
   locking member 3159, and becomes into the non-contact state.
   [03051         And, finally, the axis Li     and the axis L2 are
10 substantially co-axial with each other.
   [03061           And, the coupling 3150 is    in the waiting   (stand
   by) state for transmitting the rotational        force  (Figure 38
    (a2),   (b2))  (rotational force transmitting angular position).
   [0307]            Similarly to embodiment 1, the rotary C swings
15 about a swing center axis and contacts the developing roller
   110   to the photosensitive drum 107.       And, the rotational    force
   of the motor 64 is      transmitted to the coupling 3150,     the pin
   155,   the development shaft    153, and the developing roller 110
   through the drive shaft 180.        The axis L2  is substantially co
20 axial with the axis Li during the rotation.          For this reason,
   the locking member 3159 is not contacted with the coupling
   3150 and does not     influence on the drive of the coupling 3150.
   [03081            After the image formation finishes, the rotary C
   swings    in the opposite direction and the developing roller 110
25 spaces    from the photosensitive drum 107.      And then,  in order
   to carry out the image formation for the next color, the
   rotary C begins the revolution.         In that case, the coupling
   3150 disengages from the drive shaft        180.   In other words, the
   coupling 3150 is moved to the disengaging angular position
30 from the rotational force transmitting angular position.
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                   - 85
   Since the operation in that case is the same as that of
   Embodiment   1  (Figure 25), the description is omitted for
   simplicity.
   [03091           In addition, by the time the rotary C carries
 5 out one full revolution, the axis L2 of the coupling 3150
   inclines toward the downstream in the rotational direction X4
   by unshown means.     In other words, the coupling 3150 is moved
   from the disengaging angular position to the pre-engagement
   angular position by way of the rotational     force transmitting
10 angular position.     By doing so, the flange portion 3150j
   contacts to the locking member 3159, and the inclined state of
   the coupling is maintained again.
   [0310]           As has been described hereinbefore, the inclined
   state of the axis L2 is maintained by the locking member 3159
15 pasted on the supporting member 3157.      By this,  the engagement
   between the coupling and the drive shaft is established much
   more assuredly.
   [0311]           In the present embodiment, the locking member
   3159 is pasted at the upstreammost side of the inner surface
20 3157i of the supporting member with respect to the rotational
   direction X4.     However, this is not inevitable.    For example,
   what is necessary is the position where the inclined state
   thereof can be maintained when the axis L2 is inclined.
   [0312]           The locking member 3159 has been described as
25 contacting with the flange portion     (Figure 38bl)  3150j   (Figure
   38bl).    However, the contact position may be the driven
   portion 3150a    (Figure 38bl).
   [0313]           In this embodiment, although it has been
   described that the locking member is a separate member, this
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                   - 86
   is not   inevitable.   For example,   it may be molded integrally
   with the supporting member 3157      (2 color molding, for
   example),   and the supporting member 3157 may be directly
   contacted to the coupling 3150 in place of the locking member
 5 3159.   Or, the surface of the coupling may be roughened for
   the increase of the coefficient of friction.
   [0314]           In addition, although it has been described that
   the locking member 3159 is pasted on the development
   supporting member 3157,    it may be anything if it is a member
10 fixed on the cartridge B.
   Embodiment 3:
   [0315]        Referring to Figure 39-Figure 42,     a third
   embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [0316]          The description will be made as to      means for
15 inclining the axis L2 relative to the axis Li.
   [0317]          As  shown in Figure 39    (perspective view),   a
   coupling pressing member peculiar to the present embodiment is
   mounted to the supporting member.       Figure 40 is  a perspective
   view illustrating the coupling pressing member.        Figure 41     is
20 an enlarged perspective view of the major part of the driving
   side of the cartridge.     Figure 42   is a perspective view
   illustrating the engaging operation and a longitudinal
   sectional view of the coupling.
   [0318]          As  shown in Figure 39,    spring supporting
25 portions 4157el,    4157e2 are provided on the inner surface
   4157i of the supporting member     (mounting member) 4157.       In
   addition, the coil parts 4159b, 4159c of        torsion coil springs
    (coupling urging members) 4159 are mounted to the supporting
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                     - 87
   portions 4157el,    4157e2.    And, as shown in Figure 40,     a
   contact portion 4159a of the urging member 4159 contacts to
   the driven portion 4150a side of a flange portion 4150j          of the
   coupling 4150.    The spring 4159 is twisted to produce an
 5 elastic force.    By this, the axis L2 of the coupling 4150 is
   inclined relative to the axis Li        (Figure 41,  pre-engagement
   angular position).     The contact position of the urging member
   4159 to the flange portion 4150j        is set downstream of the
   center of the development shaft        153 with respect to the
10 rotational direction X4.       For this reason, the axis     (L2) is
   inclined relative to the axis       (Li) so that the driven portion
   4150a side is directed to the downstream with respect to the
   rotational direction     (X4).
   [0319]          In the present embodiment, although the torsion
15 coil spring is used as the urging member         (elastic material),
   this is not   inevitable.    The any means which can produce the
   elastic forces, such as for example,        leaf springs, rubber, and
   sponge,   is usable.   However, in order to incline the axis L2,
   a certain amount of stroke is required.         Therefore, a member
20 which can provide the stroke is desirable.
   [0320]          In addition, the spring supporting portions
   4157el,   4157e2 of the supporting member 4157 and the coil
   parts 4159b, 4159c function as the retention rib for the
   coupling described with respect to Embodiment         1  (Figure 9,
25 Figure 12).
   [0321]          Referring to Figure 42,      the engaging operation
    (a part of rotating operation of the rotary) between the
   coupling 4150 and the drive shaft 180 will be described.            (al)
   and  (bi)  in Figure 42 are views immediately before the
30 engagement, and    (a2) and   (b2) in Figure 42    illustrate the
   state where the engagement has completed.          (a3) and  (b3) in
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                    - 88
   Figure 42 are views in the state where the engagement has been
   released, and    (a4) and (b4) in Figure 42 are views in the
   state where the axis L2 inclines toward the downstream with
   respect to the rotational direction X4 again.
 5 [0322]          In the state   (retreating position of the
   coupling 4150)    of Figs. 42  (al) and 42  (bl), the axis L2
   thereof is beforehand inclined toward the downstream with
   respect to the rotational direction X4 relative to the axis Li
    (pre-engagement angular position).     Thus, the coupling 4150 is
10 inclined.    By this, in the direction of the axis Li,     the
   downstream free end position 4150A1 with respect to the
   rotational direction X4 is positioned in the cartridge
    (developing roller) side beyond the drive shaft free-end
   180b3.    In addition, the upstream free end position 4150A2
15 with respect to the rotational direction X4 is positioned
   beyond the pin 182    side from the drive shaft free-end 180b3.
   In other words, as has been described hereinbefore, the flange
   portion 4150j   is pressed by the urging member 4159.      For this
   reason, the axis L2 is    inclined relative to the axis Li by the
20 urging force.
   [0323]          Thereafter, the cartridge B moves in the
   rotational direction X4.      By this, the free end surface 180b
   or the free end of the pin 182 contacts to the driving shaft
   receiving surface 4150f of the coupling 4150.       And, the axis
25 L2 approaches to the angle in parallel with the axis Li by the
   contact force    (force of rotating the rotary).
   [0324]          Simultaneously, the flange portion 4150j     and the
   urging spring 4159 contact with each other.       By this, the
   spring 4159 is twisted to increase the moment.        Finally, the
30 axis Li   and the axis L2 become substantially co-axial with
   each other, and the coupling 4150 is     in the rotation latency
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                       - 89
   state   (Figure 42    (a2),  (b2)).   (rotational force transmitting
   angular position).
   [0325]            Similarly to embodiment 1, the rotational force
   is  transmitted to the coupling 4150,        the pin 155, the
 5 development shaft 153,       and the developing roller 110    through
   the drive shaft      180 from the motor 64.     The urging force of
   the urging member 4159 applies to the coupling 4150 at the
   time of the rotation.       However, if the driving torque of the
   motor 64 has     a sufficient margin, the coupling 4150 will
10 rotate with high precision.
   [0326]            When the rotary further revolves, the coupling
   4150 will separate from the drive shaft 180          as shown in
   Figure 42    (a3) and   (b3).   In other words, the free end
   spherical surface 180b of the drive shaft         180 pushes  the
15 driving shaft receiving surface 4150f of the coupling.            By
   this, the axis L2 inclines toward the opposite direction
    (opposite direction from the rotational direction X4)         with
   respect to the axis Li       (disengaging angular position).      By
   doing so,    the urging member 4159 is further twisted so that
20 the urging force      (elastic force)    further increases.   For this
   reason, after the coupling 4150 disengages from the drive
   shaft   180,  the axis L2 is again inclined in the rotational
   direction X4     relative to the axis Li     by the urging force of
   the urging member 4159       (pre-engagement angular position,
25 Figure42    (a4),   (b4)).  By this, even if the means for
   inclining the axis L2 toward the pre-engagement angular
   position by the time the drive shaft         180 and the coupling 4150
   are again coupled by the revolution of the rotary C with each
   other is not provided particularly, the drive shaft          180 and
30 the coupling 4150 are connectable         (engageable) with each
   other.
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                  - 90
   [0327]         As has been described hereinbefore, the urging
   is effected by the urging member 4159 provided on the
   supporting member 4157.    By this, the axis L2 is   inclined
   relative to the axis Li.    Therefore, the inclined state of the
 5 coupling 4150 is maintained assuredly and the engagement
    (coupling) between the coupling 4150 and the drive shaft      180
   is ensured.
   [0328]         The position of the urging member in the present
   embodiment is not   restrictive.   For example, it may be another
10 position on the supporting member 4157,    or may be a member
   other than such a member.
   [0329]          In addition, the urging direction of the urging
   member 4159 is the same as the direction of the axis Li,       but
   if the axis L2 inclines in the predetermined direction, it may
15 be any direction.
   [0330]          In addition, the energizing position of the
   urging member 4159 is the position of the flange portion
   4150j,  but if the axis L2 inclines toward the predetermined
   direction, it may be any position of the coupling.
20 Embodiment 4:
   [0331]       Referring to Figure 43-Figure 46,   , the fourth
   embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [0332]         The means for inclining the axis L2 with respect
   to the axis Li will be described.
25 [0333]          Figure 43 is an exploded perspective view
   illustrating the state before the assembly of the major
   members of the developing cartridge.     Figure 44 is an enlarged
   10156073 1                                               905731D2

                                    - 91
   side view of the driving side of the cartridge.       Figure 45    is
   a longitudinal sectional view which schematically illustrates
   the structure for the axis L2 to incline.       Figure 46 is the
   drive shaft and a longitudinal sectional view illustrating the
 5 engaging operation between the coupling.
   [0334]          As  shown in Figure 43 and Figure 45,   a coupling
   locking member 5157k is provided on the supporting member
    (mounting member) 5157.     When the supporting member 5157 is
   assembled in the direction of the axis Li,      while a part of a
10 locking surface 5157k1     of an of the locking member 5157k
   contacts with the inclined surface 5150m of the coupling 5150,
   the part engages with the upper surface 5150jl of a flange
   portion 5150j.     At this time, the flange portion 5150j    is
   mounted with play    (angle alpha 49) between locking surface
15 5157k1 and circular column portion      of the development shaft
   153   153a.   Even when the dimensional tolerances of the
   coupling 5150,   the bearing member 5157,   and the development
   shaft   153 vary, the flange portion 5150jl can lock assuredly
   to the locking portion 5157k1 of the bearing member 5157 by
20 providing this play     (angle alpha 49).
   [03351          And, as shown in Figure 45    (a), the axis L2 is
   inclined so that the driven portion 5150a      side faces the
   downstream with respect to the rotational direction X4
   relative to the axis Li.      In addition, since the flange
25 portion 5150j extends over the full-circumference, it can be
   mounted regardless of the phase of the coupling 5150.
   Furthermore, as has been described with respect to Embodiment
   1,  the coupling is pivotable in the rotational direction X4 by
   the regulating portion 5157h 1 or 5157h2.       In addition, in
30 this embodiment, the locking member 5157k is provided at the
   downstreammost position in the rotational direction X4.
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                      - 92
   [03361            As will be described hereinafter,     as shown in
   Figure 45   (b),   in the state of being in engagement with the
   drive shaft   180,   the flange portion 5150j     is released from the
   locking member 5157k.       In addition, the coupling 5150 is       free
 5 from the locking portion 5157k.         In assembling the supporting
   member 5157, when the coupling 5150 is not         able to be retained
   in the inclined state,      the driving portion 5150b of the
   coupling is pushed by tool and so on         (the direction of an
   arrow X14 of Figure 45      (b)).   By this, the coupling 5150 will
10 mount easily     (Figure 45  (a)).
   [0337]            Referring to Figure 46,     , the engaging operation
    (a part of rotary rotating operation) between the coupling
   5150 and the drive shaft 180 will be described.           Figure 46    (a)
   shows a view immediately before the engagement, and           (b) is   a
15 view after a part of coupling 5150 passes the drive shaft 180.
   In addition,     (c) illustrates the state where the inclination
   of the coupling 5150 is      released by the drive shaft      180,  and
    (d) illustrates the engaged state.
   [03381            In the state of Figure 46     (a) and  (b),  the
20 coupling 5150 takes a retreating position, where the axis L2
   thereof is inclined beforehand to the rotational direction X4
   relative to the axis Li      (pre-engagement angular position).
   The downstream free end position 515OAl with respect to the
   rotational direction X4 takes a position closer to the
25 cartridge B    (developing roller) than the drive shaft free-end
   180b3 by the inclination of the coupling 5150.          In addition,
   the upstream free end position 5150A2 with respect to the
   rotational direction X4 is positioned in the pin 182           side from
   the drive shaft free-end 180b3.         At this time, as has been
30 described hereinbefore, the flange portion 5150j          is contacted
   to the locking surface 5157k1 of the locking portion 5157k,
   and, as for the coupling, the inclined state is maintained.
   10156073 1                                                    905731D2

                                  - 93
   [03391          Thereafter, as shown in  (c),   the cartridge B
   moves in the rotational direction X4.     By this,    tapered
   driving shaft receiving surface 5150f of the coupling 5150 or
   driven projection 5150d contacts to the free end portion 180b
 5 of the drive shaft 180,   or the pin 182.    The flange portion
   5150j  separates from the locking surface 5157k1      by the force
   by the contact.    By this, the lock relative to the supporting
   member 5157 of the coupling 5150 is released.        And, in
   response to the rotation of the rotary C,     the coupling is
10 inclined so that the axis L2 becomes parallel to the axis Li.
   After the passage of the flange portion 5150j,       the locking
   member 5157k returns to the previous position by the restoring
   force.    Then, the coupling 5150 becomes free from the locking
   portion 5157k.    And, finally, as shown in    (d),  the axis Li    and
15 the axis L2 become substantially co-axial, and the rotation
   latency state is established    (rotational force transmitting
   angular position).
   [0340]          And, after the image forming operation finishes,
   the next cartridge B reaches the developing position.         For
20 this purpose, the rotary C rotates again.       In that case, the
   coupling 5150 disengages from the drive shaft       180.  In other
   words, the coupling 5150 is moved to the disengaging angular
   position from the rotational force transmitting angular
   position.    Since the detail of the operation in that case is
25 the same as Embodiment 1    (Figure 25), the description is
   omitted for simplicity.
   [0341]          In addition, by the time the rotary C carries
   out one-full revolution, the axis L2 of the coupling 5150
   inclines to the downstream with respect to the rotational
30 direction X4 by an unshown means.     In other words, the
   coupling 5150 is moved from the disengaging angular position
   to the pre-engagement angular position by way of the
   10156073 1                                                 905731D2

                                 - 94
   rotational force transmitting angular position.    By doing so,
   the flange portion 5150j  contacts to the locking member 3157k,
   and the inclined state of the coupling is maintained again.
   [0342]         As has been described hereinbefore, the
 5 inclining direction of the coupling 5150 is  regulated by the
   locking portion 5157k of the supporting member 5157.     By this,
   the inclined state of the coupling 5150 is maintained even
   more assuredly.   And, the engagement between the coupling 5150
   and the drive shaft 180  is established assuredly.
10 Furthermore, at the time of the rotation, the structure that
   the locking portion 5157k does not contact to the coupling
   5150 also contributes to the stabilized transmission of the
   rotational force.
   [0343]         In this embodiment, the locking portion 5157k
15 has  an elastic portion.  However, the locking portion 5157k
   may not have the elastic portion and it may be formed in the
   shape of a rib by which the flange portion of the coupling is
   made to deform.   By this, the similar effects are provided.
   [0344]         In addition, the locking portion 5157k is
20 provided at the downstreammost side with respect to the
   rotational direction X4.   However, the locking portion 5157k
   may be any position if the axis L2 can maintain the state of
   inclining to the predetermined direction.
   [0345]         In this embodiment, the locking portion 5157k is
25 constituted by a part of supporting members.   However, the
   locking portion 5157k may be provided in another position of
   the supporting member, or it may be a member other than the
   supporting member.   In addition, the locking portion may be a
   separate member.
   10156073 1                                             905731D2

                                   - 95
   [0346]          In addition, the present embodiment, and
   Embodiment 2 or Embodiment 3 may be implemented
   simultaneously, and the engagement and the disengaging
   operations of the coupling relative to the drive shaft are
 5 carried out even more assuredly in this case.
   Embodiment 5:
   [0347]       Referring to Figure 47-Figure 51,,     the fifth
   embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [0348]          The means for inclining the axis L2 relative to
10 the axis Li  will be described.
   [0349]          Figure 47  shows a view of supporting member and
   rotary flange of the driving side, as seen in the direction of
   the axis Li.    Figure 48  shows a view of the members of the
   apparatus main assembly, as seen in the direction of the axis
15 Li.   Figure 49 is  the same as Figure 48,   however the locus of
   the coupling is added.     Figure 50  is a sectional view taken
   along lines   S10-Si0, S1l-Sl1,   S12-S12, S13-S13,   S14-S14 in
   Figure 49.
   [0350]          First, referring to Figure 47,   the structure for
20 regulating the inclining direction of the coupling 150 will be
   described.   The supporting member 7157 rotates integrally with
   the rotary C.    The member 7157 is provided with      regulating
   portions 7157h 1 or 7157h2    for permitting the inclination,
   only in said one direction, of the coupling 7150.        A distance
25 D6 between these regulating portions is slightly larger than
   the outer diameter    (unshown) of the driving portion 7150b of
   the coupling 7150 to permit the rotation of the coupling 7150.
   The regulating portions 7157hl and 7157h2 are inclined by
   angle of alpha 7 relative to the rotational direction X4.           By
   10156073 1                                                 905731D2

                                  - 96
   this, the coupling 7150 is pivotable to the alpha7 X5
   direction with respect to the rotational direction X4.
   [0351]          Referring to Figure 48,,  the method for
   inclining the coupling 7150 will be described.     In the present
 5 embodiment, a regulation rib 1630R fixed to the driving side
   180  is provided.   The radius of the surface inside the radial
   direction of the rib   1630R is gradually reduced toward the
   downstream portion 1630Rb from the upstream part 1630Ra, R-2
   with respect to the rotational direction X4.     And, the radius
10 R-1  of this  surface is selected so that it contacts and is
   interfered by the outer periphery 7150cl of the intermediate
   part 7150c of the coupling Figure 45.
   [0352]          When the coupling 7150 contacts with the
   regulation rib 1630R, the coupling 7150 is pushed toward the
15 rotation axis of the rotary C.     At this time, the coupling
   7150 is   regulated by the regulating portions 1557h 1 or 1557h2
   in the movement direction.    For this reason, the coupling 7150
   is  inclined to the X5 direction.
   [03531          An increase of the degree of the interference
20 will also increase the inclination of the coupling 7150.       The
   configuration of the regulation rib    1630R is such that before
   the coupling 7150 engages with the drive shaft    180, the amount
   of interferences is increased until the inclination angle of
   the coupling 7150 becomes the engageable angle.     In the
25 present embodiment, the section from the position 1630Rb to
   the position 1630Rc is   located on the same radius positions
   from the rotation axis of the rotary C.     The radius is
   indicated by R-1.
   [0354]          Figure 49 illustrates the locus until the
30 coupling 7150 engages with the drive shaft 180 along the guide
   10156073 1                                              905731D2

                                  - 97
   1630R with the rotation of the rotary C.       A section taken
   along lines  S10-S10-S14-S14 in Figure 49 is     shown in Figure
   50(a)-(e).
   [03551         The  coupling 7150 enters the region of the
 5 regulation rib 1630R in the direction of X4.       At this time,
   the coupling is faced in the direction of X6 which is       the
   substantially advancing direction, is     faced in the reverse
   direction of X7,   or is faced in the inbetween direction
   thereof.   Here, the case where the coupling 7150 faces the
10 direction of X7 will be described.
   [03561         The  inclining direction X5    (Figure 47)  of the
   coupling 7150 is    angle alpha 7 relative to the rotational
   direction X4.   In view of this, when the coupling 7150
   inclines toward the X7 direction, the driven portion 7150a of
15 the coupling outwardly inclines with respect to the radial
   direction of the rotary C    (Figure 47).   The gap G1 is provided
   between the coupling 7150 and the regulation rib 1630R in the
   place where  it enters the range of the regulation member
   1630R.
20 [0357]         When the rotation of the rotary C advances to
   the Sl-Sl    section, the coupling 7150 and the regulation rib
   1630R contact to each other    (Figure 50b).    The radius of the
   regulation rib 1630R is   reduced gradually.     Therefore, a
   degree of the interference increases with the advancement of
25 the coupling 7150.
   [03581         In the position of the section S12-S12,      the
   regulation rib 1630R pushes up the coupling 7150,      and it is
   co-axial with the development shaft     (Figure 50c).   At this
   time, the motion of the coupling 7150 is regulated by the
30 regulation rib 1630R.    In view of this, the coupling 7150 is
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                   - 98
   pivotable only in the X8 direction      (only in X6 direction in
   the cross-sectional position of S10-S10),      and cannot be
   inclined toward the opposite direction X8 thereto.
   [03591         In the cross-sectional S13-S13 position, the
 5 degree of the interference of the coupling relative to the
   regulation rib 1630R increases.      In view of this, the coupling
   7150 is pushed up by the rib 1630R, and is      forcedly inclined
   in the direction of X9    (X8 direction in the section S12-S12)
    (Figure 50 (d)).  (pre-engagement angular position).
10 [03601         In this  state, the rotary C is rotated until the
   coupling becomes co-axial with the drive shaft      180  (S14-S14
   section position).    By this, the coupling 7150 can be engaged
   with the drive shaft   180 through the operation similar to
   Embodiment  1 (rotational force transmitting angular position).
15 [0361]         Thereafter, after the image     formation finishes,
   the coupling 7150 is disengaged from the drive shaft 180,        so
   that, it is a series of operations are finished       (since the
   disengaging operation is the same as those of the foregoing
   embodiments, the description is omitted for simplicity).         This
20 operation is  repeated for every image formation.
   [03621         In order for the coupling to interfere with the
   regulation rib, the coupling is contacted to it from the
   outside with respect to the radial direction, and inclines the
   coupling thereby.    However, it is   regulated such that the
25 angle alpha 7   (in Figure 47  the X5 direction) of the
   regulating portions 1557h 1 or 1557h2 are line-symmetrical
   with respect the tangential direction      (the X4 direction).     By
   this, the same operation is    carried out when the regulation
   rib 1630R is  contacted from the radial inside.
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                    - 99
   [03631           The cartridge does not need to be provided with
   the mechanism for inclining the coupling by the orientation of
   the coupling 7150 being regulated by the regulation rib       1630R.
   By this, the cost reduction of the cartridge can be
 5 accomplished.
   [0364]           In this embodiment, the coupling may be
   assuredly slid along the rib by applying the force to the
   coupling with the spring and so on.
   [03651           In addition,  it is moved on the guide rib
10 through an intermediate part 7150c of the coupling.       However,
   if the inclination of the coupling is possible, it may move on
   the guide rib through the position other than the intermediate
   part.
   [03661           In addition, the present embodiment, Embodiment
15 2 or Embodiment 3,    or Embodiment 4 may be implemented
   simultaneously, and     in such a case, Engagement and
   disengagement operations of the coupling can be ensured.
   Embodiment   6:
   [0367]        Referring to Figure 51-Figure 52,,   the sixth
20 embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [03681           In this embodiment, the configuration of another
   coupling is employed.
   [03691           Figure 51  is an illustration of the coupling
   which is   the main constituent-elements of the present
25 embodiment.     Figure 52  is a longitudinal sectional view
   illustrating engaged state and state before the engagement
   10156073 1                                               905731D2

                                     - 100
   between drive shaft of the apparatus main assembly and the
   coupling.
   [0370]           First, referring to Figure 51,,    the
   configuration of the coupling per se will be described.
 5 Figure 51    (a) shows a view of the coupling, as seen from the
   apparatus main assembly side, Figure 51       (b) shows a view of
   the coupling, as seen from the developing roller side, and
   Figure 51    (c) is a sectional view taken along S4-S4    in Figure
   51  (a).
10 [0371]           The coupling 8150    is generally cylindrical.     As
   shown in Figure 51     (c) the coupling 8150 has a drive shaft
   insertion opening portion 8150m and a development shaft
   insertion opening portion 8150p for receiving the rotational
   force from the drive shaft of the apparatus main assembly.
15 The opening 8150m is provided with a tapered        driving shaft
   receiving surface 8150f.       On the cylindrical inner surface, a
   plurality of driven projections       8150d (8150d 1 or 8150d 2 or
   8150d3,   8150d4) in the form of ribs are disposed.      In
   addition, in Figure 51     (a),  a rotational force transmitting
20 surface    (rotational force receiving portion) 8150el-e4 is
   provided downstream of the projection 8150d with respect to
   the clockwise direction.       And, the rotational force   (driving
   force)   is transmitted by the contact of the pin 182 of the
   drive shaft    180 to the transmitting surface 8150el-e4 to the
25 coupling 8150.
   [0372]           The opening 8150p is provided with a tapered
   development bearing surface 8150i similarly.        In addition, the
   cylindrical inner surface is provided with the rib-like
   projections    8150g 1 or 8150g2.     In addition, in Figure 50   (b)
30 a transmitting surface     (rotational force transmitting portion)
   8150h 1 or 8150h2 is provided in an upstream position of the
   10156073 1                                                 905731D2

                                     - 101
   development drive standby opening 8150g 1 or 8150g2 with
   respect to clockwise direction.
   [0373]          Referring to Figure 52,        the description will be
   made about the engaging operation of the coupling.
 5 [0374]          Figure 52     (a) is a sectional view illustrating a
   state before engaging with the drive shaft 180 after the
   movements of the development shaft 180          and the coupling 8150
   in the rotational direction X4.         The axis L2 inclines to the
   angle alpha 7 so that a downstream free end position 8150A1
10 with respect to the rotational direction X4 can pass the free
   end portion 180b.       At this time, The upstream 182a and the
   downstream 182b of the pin 182 maintain the engaged state with
   the transmitting surface       (rotational force receiving portion)
   8150h 1 or 8150h2      (Figure 51c) of the coupling 8150.
15 [0375]          Figure 52     (b) illustrates the coupling 150
   having been described with respect to Embodiment 1,           in the
   orientation the same as Figure 52         (a).   As will be understood
   from Figure 52    (b),   the axis L2 of the coupling 150      is
   inclined by the angle alpha 7 similarly to Figure 52            (a).    By
20 this, the engagement between upstream pin 155 and the upstream
   drive transmission surface 8150hl is not established with
   respect to rotational direction X4.           In other words,   there is
   a gap of G7 between the pin 155 and the transmitting surface
   150hl.    On the other hand, in the present embodiment, the
25 coupling 8150 has     the contact portions for the rotational
   force transmission at the two places           as shown in Figure
   52 (a).   For this reason, the orientation of the coupling is
   further stabilized.
   [0376]          As has been described hereinbefore, the coupling
30 has  a cylindrical shape.       By this, even if it is necessary to
   10156073 1                                                     905731D2

                                    - 102
   increase the inclination angle       (pre-engagement angular
   position) of the coupling, the contact portions for the
   rotational force transmission in the two places        are assured.
   Therefore, the inclination operation of the stabilized
 5 coupling can be accomplished.
   [0377]            Since the co-axial rotational force transmission
   between the drive shaft 180     and the development shaft 153       and
   the engagement releasing operation between them are the same
   as that of Embodiment 1, those descriptions are omitted for
10 simplicity.
   [Embodiment    7]
   [0378]        Referring to Figure 53,     the seventh embodiment of
   the present invention will be described.
   [0379]            The present embodiment is different from
15 Embodiment   1 in the configuration of the coupling.        Figure
   53(a) is   a perspective view of a coupling which has a
   generally cylindrical shape, and Figure 53        (b) is a sectional
   view when the coupling mounted to the cartridge engages with a
   drive shaft.
20 [0380]            In Figures 53(a) and 53(b),   the rotational     force
   is  inputted from the main assembly at the righthand side, and
   the developing roller at the lefthand is driven.
   [0381]            An input side edge of the coupling 9150      is
   provided with a plurality of driven projections         (rotational
25 force receiving portions)     9150d.    In this embodiment, they are
   provided at two positions.      Entering portions or entrances
   9150k is provided between the drive receiving projections
   9150d.    The projection 9150d is provided with a rotational
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                  - 103
   force receiving surface    (rotational force receiving portion)
   9150e.    A rotational force transmitting pin     (rotational force
   applying portion) 9182   of the drive shaft    9180 as will be
   described hereinafter contacts to the rotational force
 5 receiving surface 9150e.     By this, a rotational    force is
   transmitted to the coupling 9150.
   [0382]          In order to stabilize the torque transmitted to
   the coupling, a plurality of rotational force receiving
   surfaces 150e   are desirably disposed on the same circumference
10  (on a common circle).   By the disposition in this manner, the
   rotational force transmission radius is constant and the
   torque transmitted is   stabilized.    A  sudden increase of the
   torque can be avoided.     In addition,   from the viewpoint of the
   stabilization of the drive transmission, the receiving
15 surfaces 9150e are desirably provided on the opposed positions
    (180 degrees) diametrically.    In addition, the number of the
   receiving surfaces 9150e may be any if the pin 9182 of the
   drive shaft   9180 can be received by the standing-by portion
   9150k.    In the present embodiment, the number is     two.   The
20 rotational force receiving surfaces 9150e may not be on the
   same circumference, or they may not be disposed diametrically
   opposed positions.
   [03831          In addition, the cylinder surface of the
   coupling 9150   is provided with the standby opening 9150g.         In
25 addition, an opening 9150g is provided with the rotational
   force transmission surface    (rotational force transmitting
   portion) 9150h.    The drive transmission pin     (rotational force
   receiving member) 9155    (Figure 53  (b))  of the development
   shaft   9153 contacts to this rotational force transmission
30 surface 9150h.    By this, the rotational force is     transmitted
   to the developing roller 110    from the main assembly A.
   10156073 1                                                 905731D2

                                 - 104
   [0384]         Similarly to the projection 9150d, the
   rotational force transmission surface 9150h is desirably
   disposed diametrically opposed on the same circumference.
   [03851         The configurations of the development shaft 9153
 5 and the drive shaft 9180 will be described    (Figure 53(b)).     In
   Embodiment 1, the cylindrical end is a spherical surface.        In
   this embodiment, however, a diameter of a spherical free end
   portion 9153b of the end portion is larger than a diameter of
   a main part 9153a.   With this configuration, the left end
10 portion of the coupling 9150 can incline without interference
   with the major part 9150a.   The configuration of the drive
   shaft 9180 is the same as that of the development shaft 9150
   substantially.   In other words, the configuration of the free
   end portion 9180b is the spherical surface, and the diameter
15 thereof is larger than the diameter of the main part 9180a of
   the cylindrical shape portion.    In addition, the pin
    (rotational force applying portion) 9182 which pierces through
   the substantial center of the free end portion 9180b which is
   the spherical surface is provided.    The pin   9182 transmits
20 the rotational force to the transmitting surface or rotational
   force receiving surface 9150e of the coupling 9150.
   [03861         The development shaft 9150 and the spherical
   surface of the drive shaft 9180 are in engagement with the
   inner surface 9150p of the coupling 9150.     By this, the
25 relative position between the development shaft 9150 and the
   coupling 9150 of the drive shaft 9180 is determined.      The
   operation with respect to the mounting and demounting of the
   coupling 9150 relative to the drive shaft 9180 is the same as
   Embodiment 1, and therefore, the description thereof is
30 omitted for simplicity.
   10156073 1                                              905731D2

                                     - 105
   [0387]           As has been described hereinbefore, the coupling
   has  the cylindrical shape, and therefore, the position with
   respect to the direction perpendicular to the direction of the
   axis L2 of the coupling 9150       can be determined if the coupling
 5 is engaged with the shaft.
   [03881        A modified example of the coupling will be
   described further.      In the configuration of the coupling 9250
   shown in Figure 53     (c),  a cylindrical shape and a conical
   shape are put together.       Figure 53   (d) is a sectional view of
10 the coupling of this modified example.         A driven portion 9250a
   of the coupling 9250      (righthand side in the Figure) has a
   cylindrical shape, and an inner surface 9250p thereof engages
   with the spherical surface of the drive shaft        9180.
   Furthermore, it has the abutment surface 9250q and can effect
15 the positioning with respect to the axial direction between
   the coupling 9250    and the drive shaft 180.      The driving
   portion 9250b has    a conical shape     (lefthand side of the
   Figure),   and, similarly to Embodiment 1, the position relative
   to the development shaft 153       is determined by the development
20 shaft receiving surface 9250i.
   [03891           The configuration of the coupling 9350      shown in
   Figure 53    (e) is a combination of a cylindrical shape and a
   conical shape.     Figure 53    (f) is  a sectional view of this
   modified example.     The driven portion 9350a of the coupling
25 9350 has   a cylindrical shape     (righthand side),  and the inner
   surface 9350p thereof engages with the spherical surface of
   the drive shaft    9180.    The positioning in the axial direction
   of the drive shaft 9180      is effected by abutting the spherical
   surface 9180c of the drive shaft 9180        to the edge portion
30 9350q formed between the cylindrical portions having different

   [0391]        Referring to Figure 54    -  Figure 56, the eighth
   embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [0392]            The present embodiment is different from
   Embodiment   1 in the mounting operation relative to the drive
20 shaft of the coupling, and the structure with respect to it.
   Figure 54 is    a perspective view which illustrates a
   configuration of a coupling 10150 of the present embodiment.
   The configuration of the coupling 10150 is         a combination of
   the cylindrical shape and conical shape which have been
25 described in Embodiment 7.      In addition, a tapered surface
   10150r is provided on the free end side of a coupling 10150.
   In addition, the surface of an opposite side of the drive
   receiving projection     10150d with respect to the direction of
   the axis Li    is provided with an urging force receiving surface
30 10150s.
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                 - 107
   [03931         Referring to Figure 55,  the structure of the
   coupling will be described.
   [0394]         An inner surface 10150p and a spherical surface
   10153b of a development shaft 10153 of the coupling 10150 are
 5 in engagement with each other.    An urging member 10634 is
   interposed between an urging force receiving surface 10150s
   described in the foregoing and a bottom surface 10151b of a
   development flange 10151.   By this, the coupling 10150 is
   urged toward the drive shaft 180 when the rotary C is stopped
10 at the predetermined position.    In addition, similarly to the
   foregoing embodiments, a retention rib    (unshown) is provided
   adjacent to the drive shaft 180 on the flange portion 10150j
   with respect to the direction of the axis Li.     By this, the
   disengagement of the coupling 10150 from the cartridge is
15 prevented.   The inner surface 10150p of the coupling 10150 is
   cylindrical.   Therefore, the coupling is mounted to the
   cartridge B so as to be movable in the direction of the axis
   L2.
   [03951         Figure 56 is for illustrating the orientation of
20 the coupling in the case that the coupling engages with the
   drive shaft.   Figure 56 (a) is a sectional view of the
   coupling 150 of Embodiment 1, and Figure 56    (c) is a sectional
   view of a coupling 10150 of the present embodiment.      And,
   Figure 56  (b) is a sectional view before reaching the state of
25 Figure 56  (c) the rotational direction is   shown by X4 and the
   chain line L5 is a line drawn in parallel with the mounting
   direction from the free end of the drive shaft    180.
   [03961         In order for the coupling to engage with the
   drive shaft  180, the downstream free end position 10150Al     with
30 respect to the rotational X4 direction needs to pass the free
   end portion 180b3 of the drive shaft   180.   In the case of
   10156073 1                                              905731D2

                                    - 108
   Embodiment   1, the axis L2 inclines by more than angle a104.
   By this, the coupling moves to the position where the free end
   position 150Al   does not interfere with the free end portion
   180b3   (Figure 56  (a),  pre-engagement angular position).
 5 [0397]          On the other hand, in the coupling 10150 of the
   present embodiment, it in the state where        it does not be in
   engagement with the drive shaft      180,  the coupling 10150 takes
   the position nearest to the drive shaft 180 by a restoring
    (elastic) force of an urging member      (elastic member) 10634.
10 In this state, when it moves in the rotational direction X4,          a
   part of the tapered surface 10150r of the coupling 10150
   contacts the drive shaft      (Figure 56  (b)).   At this time, the
   force is   applied to the tapered surface 10150r in the
   direction X4,   and therefore, the coupling 10150 is retracted
15 in the longitudinal direction Xl       by a component force
   thereof.    And, the free end portion 10153b of the development
   shaft   10153 abuts  to an abutting portion 10150t of the
   coupling 10150.     In addition, the coupling 10150 rotates
   clockwisely about the center P1 of the free end portion 10153b
20  (pre-engagement angular position) of the development shaft.
   By this, the downstream free end position 10150Al        of the
   coupling with respect to the rotational direction X4 passes by
   the free end 180b of the drive shaft       180  (Figure 56  (c)).
   When the drive shaft     180 and the development shaft     10153
25 becomes substantially co-axial, a driving shaft receiving
   surface 10150f   of the coupling 10150 contacts to the free end
   portion 180b by the elastic force of the urging spring 10634.
   By this, the coupling becomes in the rotation latency state
    (Figure 55).   In consideration of an amount of retraction of
30 the coupling 10150,     the degree of inclination of the axis L2
   can be reduced to a106      (Figure 56(c)).
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                     - 109
    [03981        At the time of the rotary resume the rotation in
   said one direction after completion of the image forming
   operation, the free end portion 180b is forced on the conical
   shape driving shaft receiving surface 10150f        of the coupling
 5 10150 by rotation force of the rotary.        The coupling 10150 is
   pivoted by this force, while retracting toward the direction
    (opposite to Xl     direction) of the axis L2 by this.       The
   coupling 10150     is disengaged   (disconnected) from the drive
   shaft   180.
10 Embodiment    9:
    [03991        Referring to Figure 57,    Figure 58,  and Figure 59,,
   embodiment 9 will be described.
    [0400]          The present embodiment is different from
   Embodiment    1 in position   (position of the coupling) for
15 inputting the rotational force, and structure for transmitting
   the rotational force to developing roller and developer supply
   roller from coupling.
    [0401]           Figure 57 is a perspective view of the cartridge
   B.    In addition, Figure 58    is a perspective view illustrating
20 a driving portion of the cartridge B without the side plate.
   Figure 59    (a) is a perspective view of a driving input gear,
   as seen from the driving side.        Figure 59  (b) is  a perspective
   view of a driving input gear, as seen from the non-driving
   side.
25  [0402]          A development gear 145    is provided to the one
   longitudinal end of a developing roller 110.         In addition, a
   developer supply roller gear 146 is provided to the one
   longitudinal end of the developer supply roller 115          (Figure
   1).    Both the gears are fixed on the roller shafts.         By this,
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                   -  110
   the rotational force received by the coupling 150 from the
   apparatus main assembly A is      transmitted to the pin
    (rotational force receiving portion) 155 and the gear 147.         In
   addition, the rotational force received by the gear 147 is
 5 transmitted to the developing roller 110 and the developer
   supply roller 115    through the gear 145    and the gear 146.    The
   rotational force may be transmitted to the developer stirring
   member and so on.     In addition, the member for transmitting
   the rotational force may not be a gear, but may be a toothed
10 belt and so on.    The driving force transmitting members, such
   as the gear or the toothed belt, are usable properly.
    [0403]         Referring to Figure 59,,     the driving input gear
   147 which mounts the coupling 150      swingably will be described.
   A gear shaft 11153 is    fixed by the press-fitting, the bonding,
15 and so on to the inside of the gear.        The end 11153b thereof
   has  a spherical configuration, so that it can incline smoothly
   when the axis L2   inclines.      In this embodiment, although the
   gear shaft   11153 is made of metal, it may be made of resin
   material integral with the gear 147.        In addition, The
20 rotational force transmitting pin       (rotational force receiving
   portion) 155   for receiving the rotational     force from the
   coupling 150   is provided at the free end side of the gear
   shaft   11153, and it is extended in the direction crossing with
   the axis of the gear shaft    11153.
25  [0404]         The pin 155 is made of the metal and is      fixed by
   the press-fitting, the bonding, and so on to the gear shaft
   11153.    If the transmission of the rotational force     is
   possible, the position of the pin 155       is satisfactory
   anywhere.    Preferably, the pin 155 penetrates the spherical
30 surface center of the free end portion 11153b of the gear
   shaft   11153.  This  is because, with such a structure, even
   when the angle of deviation exists between the gear shaft
   10156073 1                                                 905731D2

                                  -  111
   11153 and the axis L2,  the rotational     force transmission
   radius is always constant.    By this, constant transmission of
   the rotational force is  accomplished.      The number of
   rotational force transmission points may be any, and the
 5 person skilled in the art can select it properly.         However, in
   this embodiment, the single pin 155 is employed from the
   viewpoint of assured transmission of driving torque, and
   assembling property.   And, the pin 155 penetrates the center
   of the free end spherical surface 11153b.        By this, the pin
10 155 projects in the diametrically opposite-directions from the
   peripheral surface of the gear shaft      11153.   In other words,
   the rotational force is  transmitted at the two places.          Here,
   in this embodiment, although the pin 155 is metal, it may be a
   product made of resin material integral with the gear shaft
15 11153 and the gear 147.   The gears 145,     146,  and 147   are
   helical gears.
   [0405]         In addition,  since the mounting method of the
   coupling 150  is the same as that of Embodiment 1, the
   description is omitted.
20 [0406]         The gear 147  is provided with a space      147a for
   receiving the coupling 150 partially, so that it does not
   interfere with the gear 147,     when the coupling 150 swings      (the
   movement, pivoting).   The space     147a is provided at the center
   portion of the gear 147.    By this, it is possible to shorten
25 the length of the coupling 150.       Furthermore, as for the
   mounting method of the gear 147,      a hole 147b   (Figure 59   (b))
   is  rotatably supported by the supporting shaft       (unshown) of
   the development bearing 11151      (Figure 58).   In addition, the
   cylindrical portion 147c is   rotatably supported by the inner
30 surface 11157i of the supporting member 11157.
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                  -  112
    [0407]         Since the engagement, drive, and disengagement
   of the coupling by the rotating operation of the rotary C are
   the same as that of Embodiment     1, the description is   omitted.
    [0408]         The means for inclining the axis L2 to the pre
 5 engagement angular position just before the engagement of the
   coupling to the drive shaft may employ a method of any of the
   embodiment 2 -   embodiment 5 described heretofore.
    [0409]         As has been described with respect to the
   present embodiment, it is not necessary to dispose the
10 coupling 150   to the end co-axial with the developing roller
   110.    More particularly, according to the embodiment described
   above, the coupling 150   is provided at the position remote
   from the axis Li   of the developing roller 110 in the direction
   perpendicular to the axis Li     of the developing roller 110.
15 And, in the direction of the rotation axis L2,      the rotational
   force transmitting surface    (rotational force transmitting
   portion, and the cartridge   side rotational    force transmitting
   portion) 150h are provided in the opposite side from the
   rotational force receiving surface      (rotational force receiving
20 portion) 150e.    And, the rotational force received by the
   rotational force transmitting surface 150h is transmitted to
   the developing roller 110 through the transmission pin 155
    (rotational force receiving portion) and the gears 145 and 147
    (driving force transmitting member).      By this, the developing
25 roller 110 is   rotated by the rotational force received from
   the main assembly A by the coupling 150.
    [0410]         According to this embodiment, the latitude of
   the design of the apparatus main assembly A and the cartridge
   B  is improved.   This is because, in the cartridge B,     the
30 position of the coupling can be properly selected irrespective
   of the position of the developing roller 110.
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                   - 113
   [0411]         In addition,    in the apparatus main assembly A,
   the position of the drive shaft     180 can be properly selected
   irrespective of the position of the developing roller 110        in
   the state of the cartridge B mounted to the rotary C.
 5 [0412]         This  is effective in development of commercial
   products.

   to be able to move among said three angular positions
   irrespective of the rotation phase of the developing roller

   and structure similar to those of the member 150m        (Figure
   61(f)).

   [0422]           In addition, the projection          12150d   (12150d1-d4)
   has  the function and structure similar to those of the element
   150d   (Figure 61   (a), (b),   (c),    (d)).

   force transmitting angular position and pre-engagement angular
10 position   (or disengaging angular position) relative to the
   axis Li irrespective of        the rotation phase of the developing
   roller 110    in the cartridge B5.          In the illustrated example,
   the driving portion 12150b has a spherical retaining portion
   12150i concentric with the axis L2.             A fixing hole 12150g

   development shaft end member 12151 which supports the coupling
   12150 will be described.       Figure 62       (a) shows a view ,    as seen
25 from the drive shaft side, and Figure 62             (b) is  a sectional
   view taken along a line       S22-S22     in Figure 62     (a).
   [0427]           The  opening 12151g 1 or 12151g2 shown in Figure
   62  (a) forms a groove extended in a rotational axis direction
   of a development shaft end member 12151.              At the time of
   10156073 1                                                        905731D2

                                    -  116
   mounting the coupling 12150,       the rotational force transmitting
   pin  (rotational force transmitting portion) 12155 enters this
   opening 12151g 1 or 12151g2.
   [0428]          The   transmission pin 12155 moves       inside of the
 5 opening 12151g 1 or 12151g2.        By this, irrespective of the
   rotation phase of the developing roller 110          in the cartridge
   B5,  the coupling 12150    is movable between said three angular
   positions.
   [0429]          In addition,    in Figure 62    (a),  rotational force
10 receiving surfaces     (rotational force receiving portions)
   12151h   (12151h 1 or 12151h2)     are provided in the clockwise
   upstream of the opening 12151g 1 or 12151g2.           A  side of the
   transmission pin 12155 of the coupling 12150 contacts to the
   transmitting surface 12151h.        By this, the rotational force is
15 transmitted to the developing roller 110.           The transmitting
   surfaces 12151hl    -  12151h2 have the surfaces intersected by
   the rotational direction of the end member 12151.            By this,
   the transmitting surface 12151h is pressed to the side of the
   transmission pin 12155,     and rotates about the axis Li        (Figure
20 62b).
   [0430]          As  shown in Figure 62     (b),  the end member 12151
   is provided with a coupling containing section 12151j            for
   accommodating the drive transmitting portion 12150b of the
   coupling 12150.
25 [0431]          Figure 62    (c) is a sectional view illustrating
   the step of assembling the coupling 12150.
   [0432]          As  for the driven portion 12150a and the
   intermediate part 12150c of the coupling, the retaining member
   12156 is   inserted into the intermediate part 12150c.           And, the
   10156073 1                                                     905731D2

                                  -  117
   driven portion 12150a and the intermediate part 12150c are
   capped in the direction of the arrow X32 by a positioning
   member 12150q   (a driving portion 12150b) which has a retaining
   portion 12150i.    The pin 12155 penetrates the fixing hole
 5 12150g of the positioning member 12150q, and the fixing hole
   12150r of the intermediate part 12150c.      And, the pin 12155
   fixes the positioning member 12150q to the intermediate part
   12150c.
   [0433]         Figure 62  (d) is a sectional view illustrating
10 the step of fixing the coupling 12150 to the end member 12151.
   [0434]         The  coupling 12150 is moved in the X33
   direction, and the transmission part 12150b is     inserted in the
   accommodating portion 12151j.      The retaining member 12156 is
   inserted in the direction of an arrow X33 to fix it to the end
15 member 12151.    The retaining member 12156 is fixed with play
   to the positioning member 12150q.      By this, the coupling 12150
   can change the orientation.      In this manner, a coupling unit
   which has the coupling and the end member 12151 integrally is
   provided.
20 [0435]         The  retaining portion 12156i mounts the coupling
   12150  so that it is movable   (pivotable) between the rotational
   force transmitting angular position, the pre-engagement
   angular position, and the disengaging angular position.        In
   addition, the retaining portion 12156i regulates the movement
25 of the coupling 12150   in the direction of the axis L2.      In
   other words,  the opening 12156j    has diameter phi D15 smaller
   than the diameter of the retaining portion 12150i.
   [0436]         Similarly to the projection    12150d, the
   rotational force transmitting surfaces     (rotational force
   10156073 1                                               905731D2

                                    - 118
   transmitting portions) 12150h 1 or 12150h2      are preferably
   disposed diametrically opposed on the same circumference.
   [0437]          The  coupling and the end member can be
   integrally treated by the structure as described above.           By
 5 this, the handling at the time of the assembly is easy, and
   the improvement of the assembling property can be
   accomplished.
   [0438]          Referring to Figure 63 and Figure 64,     ,   the
   mounting of the cartridge B will be described.        Figure 63     (a)
10 is  a perspective view of the major part of the cartridge         ,  as
   seen from the driving side, and Figure 63      (b) is  a perspective
   view thereof ,   as seen from the non-driving side.      In
   addition, Figure 64 is     a sectional view taken along a line
   S23-S23   in Figure 63   (a).  The developing roller 110     is
15 rotatably mounted on the developing device frame 119.
   [0439]          In the description described above, the coupling
   12150  and the end member 12151 are assembled to the coupling
   unit.   And, the unit U10 is mounted to the development shaft
   12153 by the side of the end of the developing roller 110           so
20 that the transmission part 12150a is exposed.       And, the
   transmission part 12150a is     assembled through an inner space
   12157b of the supporting member 12157.      By this, the
   transmission part 12150a is exposed through the cartridge.
   [0440]          As  shown in Figure 64,  a positioning portion for
25 the developing roller 12110 12157e is provided on the
   supporting member 12157.      By this, the end member 12151 is
   retained assuredly.
   [0441]          Here,  as shown in Figure 66,   the axis L2 of the
   coupling 12150   can incline in any directions relative to the
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                         - 119
   axis L1.      Figure 66(al)    -   (a5) is   a view ,    as seen from the
   drive shaft       (180) side, and Figure 66(bl)-          (b5) is the
   perspective view thereof.           In Figure 66      (al)  (bi),  the axis L2
   is  co-axial with the axis Li.           Figure 65     (a2)   (b2) illustrates
 5 the coupling 12150        in the upward inclined state from this
   state.     While the coupling inclines toward the position of the
   opening 12151g, the transmission pin 12155 is moved along the
   opening 12151g        (Figure 66   (a2)   (b2)).    As a result, ,     the
   coupling 12150       is   inclined about the axis AX perpendicular to
10 the opening 12151g.
   [0442]              In Figure 66    (a3)   (b3),  the coupling 12150 is
   inclined rightward.         Thus, when the coupling inclines in the
   orthogonal direction of the opening 12151g, the pin 12155
   rotates inside of the opening 12151g.               The  axis of rotation is
15 the axis line AY of the transmission pin 12155.
   [0443]              The  coupling 12150 inclined downward and the
   coupling inclined leftward are shown in Figs.                66  (a4)  (b4) and
   66   (a5)   (b5).    The coupling 12150 is       inclined about the
   rotation axis AX, AY.
20 [0444]              With respect to the direction different from the
   inclining direction, and in the midrange, the rotation of the
   circumference of the axis AX and the rotation of the
   circumference of AY can combine with each other, so that the
   inclination is permitted.           For example, the directions
25 different from the inclining direction are Figures 66                  (a2),
    (a3),   (a3),    (a4),  (a4),  (a5),   (a5),   and   (a2).    In this manner,
   the axis L2 can be inclined in any directions relative to the
   axis Li.
   [0445]          However, the axis L2 does not need to be
30 necessarily pivotable relative to the axis Li                linearly to the
   10156073  1                                                          905731D2

                                  - 120
   predetermined angle in any directions over 360 degrees.         In
   that case, for example, the opening 12151g     is set slightly
   wide in the circumferential direction.      By such the setting,
   when the axis L2   inclines relative to the axis Li,    the
 5 coupling 12150   rotates to a slight degree about the axis L2,
   even if it is   the case where it cannot incline to the
   predetermined angle linearly.     By this, the axis L2 can be
   inclined to the predetermined angle relative to the axis Li.
   In other words, the play in the rotational direction of the
10 opening 150g   can be selected properly by one skilled in the
   art.
   [0446]          As has been described hereinbefore,    (Figure 64),
   the spherical surface 12150i contacts to the retaining portion
   12156i.    For this reason, the rotation axis of the coupling
15 12150  is  on the center P2 of the spherical surface 12150i.       In
   other words,   the axis L2 is pivotable irrespective of the
   phase of the end member 12151.     In addition, as will be
   described hereinafter,   in order for the coupling 12150 to
   engage with the drive shaft 180,     the axis L2 is  inclined to
20 the downstream in the rotational direction X4 relative to the
   axis Li   just before the engagement.    In other words,   as shown
   in Figure 67,   the axis L2 inclines relative to the axis Li,      so
   that the driven portion 12150a is     the downstream with respect
   to the rotational direction X4.
25 [0447]          Figure 60 shows the state where the axis L2 is
   inclined relative to the axis Li.      In addition, Figure 65 is a
   sectional view taken along a line S24-S24     in Figure 60.
   [0448]          By the structure described heretofore, the axis
   L2 in the inclined state shown in Figure 65 can also become
30 substantially parallel with the axis Li.      In addition, the
   maximum possible inclination angle alpha 4      (Figure 65) between
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                  -  121
   the axis Li   and the axis L2 is determined so that the range to
   the position where the driven portion 12150a and the
   intermediate part 12150c contact to the end member 12151 or
   the supporting member 12157 is covered.       And, the angle alpha
 5 4 is set to the value required for the mounting and demounting
   to the apparatus main assembly.
   [0449]          Here, in the case of the present embodiment, the
   maximum possible inclination angle alpha 4 is 20 degrees        -  80
   degrees.
10 [0450]          As has been described with respect to Embodiment
   1,  immediately before Cartridge B    (B5)  is determined to the
   predetermined position of the apparatus main assembly A,        or,
   substantially simultaneously with it being determined to the
   predetermined position, the coupling 12150 and the drive shaft
15 180 engage with each other.      More particularly, the coupling
   12150  and the drive shaft  180 are engaged with each other
   immediately before or substantially simultaneously with the
   stoppage of the rotary C.
   [0451]          Referring to Figure 67,    the engaging operation
20 of this coupling 12150 will be described.       Figure 67 is a
   longitudinal sectional view of the apparatus main assembly A
   as seen from the lower part.
   [0452]          In the moving process of the cartridge B7 by the
   rotary C,   the axis L2 of the coupling 12150 inclines
25 beforehand in the pre-engagement angular position to the
   rotational direction X4 relative to the axis Li       (Figure 67
    (a)).   In the direction of the axis Li,    the downstream free
   end position 12150A1 with respect to the rotational direction
   X4  is positioned in the developing roller 12110 direction side
30 beyond the drive shaft free-end 180b3 by the inclination of
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                   - 122
   the coupling 12150.      In addition, the upstream free end
   position 12150A2 with respect to the rotational direction X4
   is positioned in the pin 182 direction side than the drive
   shaft free-end 180b3     (Figure 67  (a)).
 5 [0453]          First, the upstream free end position 12150A1
   with respect to the rotational direction X4 of the coupling
   12150 passes by the drive shaft     free-end 180b3.      A part of
   coupling   (receiving surface 12150f and/or projection 12150d)
   which is   the cartridge side contact portion contacts to the
10 main assembly side engaging portion        (the drive shaft 180
   and/or the pin 182),    after the passage.      The coupling is
   inclined so that the axis L2 becomes parallel to the axis Li
   in response to the rotation of the rotary C         (Figure 67   (c)).
   And, when the developing cartridge B7        finally stops at the
15 predetermined position     (developing position) in the apparatus
   main assembly A    (stoppage of the rotation of the rotary),         the
   drive shaft   180 and the developing roller 12110 will become
   substantially co-axial with each other.         And, the coupling
   12150  is moved from the pre-engagement angular position toward
20 the rotational force transmitting angular position where the
   axis L2 is substantially co-axial with the axis Li.           And, the
   coupling 12150   and the drive shaft 180      are engaged with each
   other   (Figure 67  (d)).   The recess 12150z of the coupling
   covers the free end portion 180b.
25 [0454]          As has been described hereinbefore, the coupling
   12150  is mounted for inclining motion relative to the axis Li.
   More particularly, the coupling 12150 inclines without
   interfering with the drive shaft 180        in response to the
   rotating operation of the rotary C.         By this, the coupling
30 12150  can be engaged with the drive shaft       180.
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                   - 123
   [0455]          Similarly to embodiment 1, the engaging
   operation of the coupling 12150 described above can be carried
   out irrespective of the phase of the drive shaft 180       and the
   coupling 12150.
 5 [0456]          In this manner, in this embodiment, the coupling
   12150  is mounted to the cartridge B7     for substantial
   revolvement relative to the developing roller 110.
   [0457]         Referring to Figure 68,     the rotational  force
   transmitting operation at the time of rotating the developing
10 roller 110 will be described.      The drive shaft  180 rotates
   with the gear   (helical gear) 181    in the direction of X8 in the
   Figure by the rotational force received from the motor 64
    (driving source).    The transmission pin 182   integral with the
   drive shaft  180 contacts to two of the four rotational force
15 receiving surfaces 150e    of the coupling 12150 to rotate the
   coupling 12150.     Furthermore, as stated in the foregoing, the
   coupling 12150   is  coupled with the developing roller 110     for
   drive transmission.     For this reason, the rotation of the
   coupling 12150   rotates the developing roller 110    through the
20 end member 12151.
   [0458]          In addition, even if the axis L3 and the axis Li
   deviate from the co-axial relations somewhat, the coupling can
   rotate without applying the large load to the developing
   roller and the drive shaft because the coupling 12150 inclines
25 slightly.
   [0459]         This   is one of the remarkable effects according
   to an embodiment of the coupling of the present invention.
   [0460]         Referring to Figure 69,     the description will be
   made as to operation of the coupling 12150 and so on at the
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                    -  124
   time of the cartridge B     (B7)   moving to another station by the
   rotation of the rotary C.      Figure 69   is a longitudinal
   sectional view of the apparatus main assembly A        ,  as seen from
   the lower part.     First, similarly to embodiment 1, whenever
 5 the cartridge B moves    from the position     (developing position)
   where opposes to the photosensitive drum, the pin 182          is
   positioned at any two of the entrance portions 12150kl-12150k4
    (Figure 61).
   [0461]          In the state where the rotary C is       at rest at
10 the developing position, the axis L2 of the coupling 12150 is
   substantially co-axial relative to the axis Li        (rotational
   force transmitting angular position).        When the rotary C
   further starts the rotation to one direction after termination
   of the development, The upstream receiving surface 12150f with
15 respect to the rotational direction X4 and/or the projection
   12150d of the coupling 12150 contact to free end portion 180b
   of the drive shaft 180,    and/or the pin 182     (Figure 69a),    in
   response to the movement in the rotational direction X4 of the
   cartridge B   (developing roller 110)..      And, the axis L2 begins
20  (Figure 69b)  to incline toward the upstream in the rotational
   direction X4.    The inclining direction      (pre-engagement angular
   position) of the coupling at the time of the cartridge B
   moving this direction to the developing position is the
   substantially opposite relative to the axis Li.          By the
25 rotating operation of this rotary C,       the upstream free end
   portion 12150A2 with respect to the rotational direction X4
   moves, while it is    in contact with the drive shaft      180   (free
   end portion 180b).     The axis L2 of the coupling 12150 inclines
   to the position    (disengaging angular position) where the
30 upstream free end portion 150A2 reaches to the drive shaft
   free-end 180b3    (Figure 69c).     And, in this state, the coupling
   12150  is passed while   it is   in contact with the drive shaft
   free-end 180b3    (Figure 69d).     Thereafter, the cartridge B is
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                    - 125
   completely retracted from the developing position by the
   rotating operation of the rotary C.
   [0462]            As has been described hereinbefore, the
   coupling 12150    is mounted for inclining motion relative to the
 5 axis Li   to the cartridge B.     And, the coupling 12150 is
   inclined without interfering with the drive shaft in response
   to the rotational movement of the rotary C.        By this, the
   coupling 12150    can be disengaged from the drive shaft 180.
   [0463]           The coupling 12150 can be integrally handled
10 with the end members     (gear and so on) by the structure as
   described above.     For this reason, the assembly operation
   property is    improved.
   [0464]           The structure for inclining the axis L2 of the
   coupling to the pre-engagement angular position, immediately
15 before the coupling engages with the drive shaft may employ
   any of the embodiment 2-embodiment 5.
   Embodiment   11:
   [0465]        Referring to Figure 70,    Figure 71,   and Figure 72,
   embodiment 11 will be described.
20 [0466]               The present embodiment is different from
   Embodiment   10 in the position     (position of the coupling) which
   inputs the drive, and the structure which transmits the
   rotational force to the developing roller and the developer
   supply roller from the coupling.
25 [0467]           Figure 70  is a perspective view of a cartridge
   according to the present embodiment.        Figure 71  is a
   perspective view illustrating a driving portion of the
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                   - 126
   cartridge.   Figure 72   (a) is  a perspective view of a driving
   input gear, as seen from the driving side.      Figure 72   (b) is a
   perspective view of the driving input gear, as seen from the
   non-driving side.
 5 [0468]          The development gear 145   and the feed roller
   gear 146 are disposed at the drive lateral end portions of the
   developing roller 110 and the feed roller 115      (Figure 1),
   respectively.    The gears 145   and 146 are fixed to the shaft.
   The rotational force received by the coupling 13150 from the
10 apparatus main assembly A is     transmitted through the gear to
   the other rotating members     (the developing roller 110,   the
   developer supply roller 115,     the toner stirring  (unshown), and
   so on) of cartridge B    (B6).
15 [0469]          A driving input gear 13147 which supports the
   coupling 13150 will be described.
   [0470]          As  shown in Figure 71,  the gear 13147 is
   rotatably provided at the position for      engagement with the
   development gear 145 and the feed roller gear 146.       The gear
20 13147  has the coupling containing section 13147j     similar to
   the end member 12151    described in Embodiment 10   (Figure 72
    (a)).  The coupling 13150   is pivotably retained by a retaining
   member 13156 on the gear 13147.
   [0471]          Further, the supporting member 13157 and the
25 inclination regulation member 13157i are mounted to the
   cartridge B   (Figure 70).
   [0472]          The  supporting member 13157 is provided with the
   hole and the inner surface 13157i thereof engages with the
   gear 13147.    Since the engagement, drive, and disengagement of
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                  - 127
   the coupling by the rotating operation of the rotary are the
   same as that of Embodiment 10,    the description is omitted for
   simplicity.
   [0473]          In addition, The structure for inclining the
 5 axis L2 of the coupling to the pre-engagement angular
   position, immediately before the coupling engages with the
   drive shaft may employ any of that of the embodiment 2
   embodiment 5.
   [0474]          As has been described hereinbefore, it is not
10 necessary to dispose the coupling at the end co-axial with the
   developing roller.    According to this embodiment, the latitude
   in the design of the image    forming device body and the
   cartridge can be improved.     According to this embodiment, the
   effects similar to Embodiment    9 are provided.
15 Embodiment  12:
   [0475]       Embodiment  12 will be described with reference to
   Figures 73 and 74.
   [0476]          In the above-described Embodiments, the case of
   using the rotation selecting mechanism     (rotary) as the moving
20 member for the developing device     (cartridge B) is described.
   In this embodiment, another moving member will be described.
   [0477]          Figures 73(a) and 73(b) are sectional views
   showing a cartridge supporting member for supporting four
   cartridges B   (14B1 to 14B4).   Figures 74(a) to 74(e) are
25 perspective views and side views showing processes for
   engaging and disengaging a coupling with respect to a driving
   shaft.
   10156073 1                                               905731D2

                                   - 128
   [0478]          Referring to Figures 73(a) and 73(b),    the
   respective cartridges B     (14B1 to 14B4)  are laterally arranged
   in cross section in a cartridge     supporting member 14190 and
   are detachably mounted to the cartridge supporting member
 5 14190.    Figure 73(a) is  a schematic view showing a state     in
   which a first color cartridge 14B1     is  located at a portion
   opposite to a photosensitive drum 107      and is capable of
   performing development with respect to the photosensitive drum
   107.   When the cartridge 14B1    completes the development, the
10 supporting member 14190 moves in an X20 direction, so that an
   adjacent   (second) color cartridge 14B2    is located at the
   opposing portion    (developing position) with respect to the
   photosensitive drum 107.      Incidentally, a developer image
   formed on the photosensitive drum 107      is transferred onto a
15 transfer belt 104a.     These operations   are repeated for each of
   the colors.    Finally, as shown in Figure 73(b),    a fourth color
   cartridge 14B4   is moved to the opposing portion with respect
   to the photosensitive drum 107,     so that four color developer
   images are transferred onto the transfer belt.       Then, the
20 developer images are transferred from the transfer belt onto a
   recording material S and are fixed on the recording material
   S.
   [0479]          Incidentally, each of the cartridges    14 is moved
   in a direction substantially perpendicular to a direction of
25 the axial line L3 of the driving shaft 180 by the movement of
   the supporting member 14190 in one direction.
   [0480]          As a result, a color image is    formed on the
   recording material S.
   [0481]          When a series   of the color image  formation is
30 completed, the supporting member 14190 is moved in the X21
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                  - 129
   direction to be returned to an initial position     (the state of
   Figure 73(a)).
   [0482]          Next, with reference to Figures 74(a) to 74(e),
   steps of connecting and disconnecting the coupling with
 5 respect to the driving shaft by the movement of the supporting
   member will be described.    Representatively, connection and
   disconnection of the cartridge    14B3 with respect to a coupling
   14150C will be described.    Figure 74(a) is  a perspective view
   showing a state of the coupling 14150C immediately before
10 connection to the driving shaft    180 and Figure 74(b) is a side
   view thereof.    Figure 74(c) is a perspective view showing a
   state in which the coupling is connected to the driving shaft
   and placed in a driving force transmittable condition.       Figure
   74(d) is   a perspective view showing a disconnected state of
15 the coupling from the driving shaft and Figure 74(e) is a side
   view thereof.
   [0483]          In this embodiment, as a means for including the
   axial line L2,   the constitution described in Embodiment 5 is
   used.   That is,  a regulation rib 14191 provided to the
20 apparatus main assembly is disposed along a lower side of a
   line L20 through which a coupling 14150C passes     and upstream
   from the driving shaft 180 with respect to a movement
   direction X20.    Further, similarly as in Embodiment 6, a
   distance between a top surface 14191a of the regulation rib
25 and the coupling 14150C is   set to be smaller when the coupling
   14150C comes   closer to the driving shaft  180.   Further, as
   shown in Figure 74(b),   an inclination direction of an axial
   line L is regulated so that a driven portion     (portion to be
   driven) 14150Ca is directed upwardly with respect to the line
30 L20  (the inclination direction is   indicated by a line L30).
   10156073 1                                               905731D2

                                  - 130
   [0484]          Here, when development with the cartridge       14B2
   is  completed, the supporting member is horizontally moved in
   one direction.    By this movement, the cartridge 14B3 is moved
   toward a predetermined position.      During its process, an
 5 intermediate portion 14150Cc contacts the top surface 14191a.
   At this time, as described in Embodiment     6, the driven portion
   14150Ca is directed toward the driving shaft 180       (the
   pre-engagement angular position)     (the state of Figure 74(a)).
   Thereafter, similarly as in the above-mentioned description,
10 the coupling 14150C engages with the driving shaft       180   (the
   rotating force transmitting angular position)      (the state of
   Figure 74(c)).    Then, when image formation with the cartridge
   14B3 is   completed, the cartridge 14B3 is moved in the X20
   direction.    The coupling 14150C is disengaged from the driving
15 shaft   180 (disengagement angular position)    (the state of
   Figure 74(d)).    Details are the same as those described above,
   thus being omitted.
   [0485]          As described above, the developments with all
   the couplings are completed, the supporting member 14190 is
20 returned to the initial position     (the state of Figure 74 (b)).
   An operation during a process thereof will be described.          The
   coupling of each of the cartridges is     required to pass through
   the driving shaft 180.    For this reason, the coupling is,
   similarly as during the development, moved from the
25 pre-engagement angular position to the disengagement angular
   position through the rotating force transmitting angular
   position.    For this purpose, it is necessary to employ a
   constitution for inclining the axial     line L2.   As shown in
   Figure 74(d),   a regulation rib  14192 similar to that descried
30 in Embodiment 6 is disposed along the upper side of the line
   L20 through which the coupling 14150C passes.       The rib 14192
   is disposed upstream from the driving shaft 180 with respect
   to the movement direction X21.     Further, the distance between
   10156073 1                                                 905731D2

                                   - 131
   the regulation rib 14192     and the line L20  is set similarly as
   in the case of the regulation rib 14192.       That is, the
   regulation rib 14191    and the regulation rib 14192 are set in a
   point-symmetry relationship with respect to the center of the
 5 driving shaft 180.     Incidentally, as shown in Figure 74(e),     a
   regulation direction of the coupling 14150C is not changed.
   For this reason, the coupling 14150C is also moved, at the
   initial   stage  (X21 direction),  from the pre-engagement angular
   position to the disengagement angular position through the
10 rotating force transmitting angular position by the same
   operation as during the image formation      (development) (during
   the movement in the X20 direction).      During this operation,
   the coupling 14150C passes through the driving shaft 180 and
   then is   returned to the initial position.
15 [0486]           In this embodiment, the cartridge is detachably
   supported with respect to the image forming apparatus.        During
   replacement of the cartridge, as shown in Figure 74(a),       the
   supporting member 14190     is rotationally moved in the X30
   direction.     By this rotational movement, the user moves each
20 of the cartridges    14B1  to 14B4 to a replaceable position.
   [0487]           Incidentally, in this embodiment, the movement
   direction of the developing cartridge is obliquely upward but
   may also be an opposite direction and the developing cartridge
   may be disposed so as to be movable in other directions.
25 [0488]           In the foregoing description, the image
   formation    (development) is effected when the cartridge is
   moved in one direction but is not effected when the cartridge
   is moved other directions.      However, the present invention is
   not limited thereto.      For example, when the cartridge is moved
30 in other directions, the image formation may be effected.
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

   [Embodiment    13]
   [0489]        Embodiment    13 will be described with reference to
   Figure 75.
   [0490]            In the foregoing description, the cartridge
 5 detachably mountable the apparatus main assembly A is
   described.     In this embodiment, such an image forming
   apparatus that the developing device as the developing
   apparatus is    fixed to an apparatus main assembly and image
   formation is effected by real time supply of the developer.
10 That is,   the developing device in this embodiment is mounted
   to the apparatus main assembly A by the user but is not
   demounted.    The developing device in this embodiment is a
   fixed-type in which the developing device is fixed to the
   apparatus main assembly A and is used in a fixed state.
15 Maintenance    is performed by a service person.
   [0491]            Figure 75   is a sectional view of the apparatus
   main assembly.
   [0492]            As shown in Figure 75,   a rotary C2 includes four
   color developing devices 15A, 15B,       15C and 15D mounted
20 therein.    The rotary C2 further includes developer bottles
   16A, 16B,   16C and 16D each for supplying a developer to an
   associated developing device.        These bottles 16A, 16B,   16C and
   16D are detachably mounted to the apparatus main assembly A in
   a direction perpendicular to the drawing.         When the developer
25 in the bottle empties,      the bottle is replaced by the user.
   [0493]            By the rotation of the rotary C,    each of the
   developing devices 15A, 15B,       15C and 15D is  successively moved
   to a portion     (developing position) opposite to the
   photosensitive drum 107       and at the opposing portion, a latent
   10156073 1                                                  905731D2

                                  - 133
   image formed on the photosensitive drum 107      is developed.
   Depending on the movement of each of the developing devices to
   the opposing portion, the coupling member      (not shown) provided
   to the developing device is engaged with the driving shaft
 5 provided to the apparatus main assembly      (not shown).
   Thereafter, when the image    formation is completed, the
   cartridge  (not shown) is disengaged from the driving shaft.
   This operation is   similar to that in Embodiment 1 and the
   like, so that description thereof is omitted.
10 [0494]          As described above, even in the case of drive
   switching of the developing device fixed to the apparatus main
   assembly, the operation can be performed similarly as in the
   cases of Embodiments described above.
   Embodiment  14:
15 [0495]       Referring to Figure 76,    Figure 77,  and Figure 78,,
   embodiment 14 will be described.
   [0496]          These embodiments differ from Embodiment 11      in
   the configuration of the coupling, and provision of the
   elastic material for maintaining the coupling at the pre
20 engagement angular position.
   [0497]          Figure 76  (a) is a perspective view illustrating
   a part of cartridge B.     Figure 76  (b) and Figure 76   (a) are
   sectional views taken along a line extended in the inclining
   direction of the axis of the coupling through the center of
25 the driving input gear    (the member which mounts   the driving
   input gear is   also illustrated).    Figure 77  (a) is a side view
   of the coupling alone.     Figure 77  (b) is a perspective view of
   the coupling alone.    Figure 78   (a) is a sectional view
   illustrating the state where the coupling      (cartridge) is
   10156073 1                                                905731D2

                                     - 134
   positioned at the pre-engagement angular position.             Figure 78
    (b) is a sectional view illustrating the state where the
   coupling    (cartridge) is positioned at the rotational          force
   transmitting angular position.        Figure 78    (c) is   a sectional
 5 view illustrating the state where the coupling            (cartridge) is
   positioned at the disengaging angular position.             Figure 78
    (a),  (b),  and   (c) illustrate the positional relations between
   the coupling 15150      and the drive shaft 180.
   [0498]            As  shown in Figure 76, the development gear 145
10 is disposed to the end of the developing roller 110.              And, the
   gear 145    is fixed to the shaft    155 of the developing roller
   110.
   [0499]            A driving input gear 15147 which mounts the
   coupling 15150 will be described.
15 [0500]            As  shown in Figure 76, the gear 15147 has the
   gear portion for meshing engagement with the development gear
   145   15147a, and the gear portion 15147b for meshing engagement
   with the feed roller gear 146       (Figure 58).     And, the gear
   15147   is  rotatably mounted to the cartridge B by a supporting
20 member 15170     and a supporting member 15157.       The supporting
   member 15170     functions also as the bearing member for the
   developing roller 110.
   [0501]            By this,  the rotational   force received by the
   coupling 15150      from the apparatus main assembly A is
25 transmitted to the developing roller 110 through the pin 15155
    (rotational force transmitting portion),       the rotational force
   transmitting surface 12151h       (Figure 62  (a),   (b),   rotational
   force receiving portion),      the gear 147,   and gear 145.
   10156073 1                                                      905731D2

                                   - 135
   [0502]          The  coupling 15150 is pivotably mounted to the
   gear 15147 by a retaining portion 15147m       (movable among said
   three angular positions).      In addition, the coupling 15150 is
   urged by an urging spring     (elastic material) 15159 in order to
 5 maintain the pre-engagement angular position.         In this
   embodiment, the spring 15159 is a torsion coil        spring.    A
   supporting portion 15159a of the spring 15159 is        locked by a
   mounting portion    (unshown) provided on the cartridge B.         And,
   an arm portion 15159b thereof elastically urges an
10 intermediate part 15150c of the coupling.         By this, the axis
   L2 of the coupling 15150    is maintained at the pre-engagement
   angular position    (Figure 78  (a)).   In the present embodiment,
   a spring force    (elastic force) of the spring 15159 is      5g
   100g.    If it is below 5g, the coupling may not      incline
15 correctly due to the frictional      force and so on.    If it is
   more than 100g, the contact portion of the spring may be
   shaved at the time of the rotation of the coupling.          However,
   the spring force other than this range may be employed
   depending on the conditions,     such as the wire diameter and the
20 material of spring, and configuration and material of the
   coupling.    In addition, it is not limited to the torsion coil
   spring.
   [05031          More particularly, the spring 15159       (elastic
   material) elastically urges the coupling 15150.         The elastic
25 force thereof is    such that  it can maintain the coupling 15150
   at the pre-engagement angular position, while it permits
   moving the coupling from the pre-engagement angular position
   to the rotational    force transmitting angular position      (Figure
   78  (b)),  and it permits moving the coupling 15150 from the
30 rotational force transmitting angular position to the
   disengaging angular position     (Figure 78   (c)).

   [0504]            This    applies also to the spring     (elastic
   material) 4159 described by the embodiment of the embodiment 3
   and so on.
   [05051            Further, the cartridge B has       the inclination
 5 regulating portion for regulating the inclining direction of
   the coupling.       Since this structure is      the same as that of
   Embodiment   11,    the description is      omitted for simplicity.
   [05061            As   shown in Figure 77,     the couplings  15150
   differ from the coupling 12150 described in Embodiment 10               in
10 the configuration of the driven portion 15150a.
   [0507]            More particularly, an opening 15150m of the
   driven portion 15150a         is provided with the recess 15150z and
   the flat portion 15150y.          The recess 15150z is contacted to
   the free end portion 180b of the drive shaft 180            (Figure 78
15  (b)).   As shown in Figure 78,         when the coupling 15150 reaches
   the rotational force transmitting angular position            (Figure 78
    (b))  through the pre-engagement angular position          (Figure 78
    (a)),  the rotational force of the drive shaft         180 will be
   transmitted to the coupling 15150 through the pin 182.               In
20 this embodiment, not the recess 15150z but the drive shaft 180
   side is   the flat portion 15150y.          By this, the peripheral part
   182d   (Figure 78     (a),   (b),  (c))  and the flat portion 15150y of
   the coupling of the pin 182          can be brought close to each other
    (Figure 78   (b)).
25 [05081            By this,     the lengths of the cartridge B and the
   apparatus main assembly in the direction of the axis Li,              L3
   can be shortened.         Therefore, the cartridge B and the
   apparatus main assembly can be downsized.
   10156073 1                                                      905731D2

                                  -  137
   [05091         Here,  an inner diameter Z1=phi of the flat
   portion 15150y of the coupling used by this implementation is
   about 5mm.  In addition, an outer diameter Z2=phi thereof is
   approx. 11mm.   In addition, a depth Z3= of the flat portion is
 5 approx. 0.6mm.   In addition, a depth of the recess 15150z of
   conical shape is approx. 1.5mm in the top part of conical
   shape, and the diameter thereof is approx. 5mm.          In addition,
   a weight of the coupling 15150 is      approx. 1.5g.     In this
   embodiment, the material of the coupling is polyacetal.
10 However, the values of the size and weight are not inevitable,
   and the person skilled in the art can select them properly.
   [0510]         In addition,   in the present embodiment, the
   projection 15150d   (15150d1,  d2)  of the coupling is disposed at
   each of two places.    By this, the width measured along the
15 circumference of the entrance portion 150k       (150k1,   k2)  can be
   enlarged.  Therefore, the entrance of the pin 182 to the
   entrance portion 150k can be smoothed.       Although the number of
   the projections can be selected properly, a plurality of
   projections are desirable.     This   is because the rotational
20 force can be transmitted with high precision.
   [0511]         Since the configuration of the coupling other
   than these and engagement, drive, and disengagement of the
   coupling by the rotating operation of the rotary are the same
   as that of those of Embodiment     10,  the description is     omitted
25 for simplicity.
   [0512]         In addition, the structure for inclining the
   axis of the coupling to the pre-engagement angular position
   may employ any of the embodiment 2-embodiment 5.
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                    - 138
   [0513]          In addition,    in this embodiment, the coupling
   15150  is provided at the position remote from the axis Li            in
   the direction perpendicular to the axis Li        (Figure 76    (b)).
   [0514]          In this embodiment, the coupling is disposed at
 5 such a position.      For this reason, the latitude in the design
   of the apparatus main assembly and the cartridge can be
   improved.    When the coupling is disposed co-axially with the
   axis Li,   the position of the coupling will approach the
   photosensitive drum.      For this reason, it is a constraint to
10 the disposition of the coupling, but in the present
   embodiment, the constraint from the photosensitive drum is
   mitigable.
   [0515]          As has been described hereinbefore, in this
   embodiment, the coupling 15150 has a circular flat portion
15 15150y   in the free end side.     A recess 15150z is provided in
   the center 0 of the flat portion 15150y        (circular).    The
   recess 15150z has     a conical shape which expands toward the
   free end side thereof.       In addition, projections    (rotational
   force receiving portions)      15150d are disposed at the edge of
20 the circular flat portion 15150y in the position diametrically
   opposed interposing the center 0       (two positions).    These
   projections project in the direction of the rotation axis L2
   of the coupling.      In addition, the pins    (rotational force
   applying portions) 182 project in the directions perpendicular
25 to the axis L3.     (-C)  to provide the projections at the two
   places opposed to each other, respectively.         Any one of the
   rotational force receiving surfaces       (rotational force
   receiving portions) 15150e engages with one of the pin
   projections   182.    And, the other one of the rotational force
30 receiving surfaces 15150e engages with the other one of the
   pin projections    182.   By this, from the drive shaft     180,    the
   coupling 15150   receives the rotational force and rotates.
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

   [0516]            Here, according to the embodiments described
   above, in the structure of moving the cartridge B               (developing
   roller 110)     in the direction substantially perpendicular to
   the direction of the axis L3 of the drive shaft 180               in
 5 response to in the movement to the one direction of the rotary
   C  (supporting member 14190),         the coupling 150      (1350, 3150,
   4150,    5150,  7150, 8150,    9150,   10150,  12150,   13150,   15150 and
   so on)    can accomplish the coupling, the engagement, and the
   disengaging operation      relative     to the drive    shaft   180.    This
10 is  accomplished because         this coupling can take the next
   positions as described above:
         1.   The rotational    force transmitting angular position for
   transmitting the rotational          force from the apparatus main
   assembly A to the developing roller 110;
15       2.   this pre-engagement angular position inclined from
   this rotational force transmitting angular position before
   this coupling engages with the rotational             force applying
   portion;    and
         3.   The disengaging angular position inclined toward the
20 opposite side from the pre-engagement angular position from
   the rotational force transmitting angular position for the
   coupling to disengage from drive shaft.
   [0517]            Here, the rotational force transmitting angular
   position is the angular position of the coupling for
25 transmitting the rotational          force for rotating the developing
   roller 110 to the developing roller 110.
   [0518]            In addition, the pre-engagement angular position
   is  the angular position which is          inclined from the rotational
   force transmitting angular position and which is               taken before
30 the drum coupling member engages with the rotational                 force
   applying portion.
   10156073 1                                                         905731D2

                                - 140
   [0519]        In addition, the disengaging angular position is
   the angular position which is inclined toward the opposite
   side from the pre-engagement angular position from the
   rotational force transmitting angular position and which
 5 permits the disengagement of the coupling from the drive shaft
   180.
   [0520]        Here, the meaning "perpendicular substantially"
   will be described.  Here, the description will be made about
   "perpendicular substantially".   Between the cartridge b and
10 the apparatus main assembly A and in order to mount and
   demount the cartridge B smoothly, small gaps are provided.
   More specifically and the small gaps are provided between the
   guide 140R1 and the guide 130R1 with respect to the
   longitudinal direction, between the guide 140R2 and the guide
15 130R2 with respect to the longitudinal direction, between the
   guide 140L1 and the guide 130L1 with respect to the
   longitudinal direction    between , and the guide 140L2 and
   the guide 130L2 with respect to the longitudinal direction.
   Therefore, at the time of the mounting and demounting of the
20 cartridge B relative to the apparatus main assembly A and the
   whole cartridge B can slightly incline within the limits of
   the gaps.  For this reason and the perpendicularity is    not
   meant strictly.  However, even in such a case, the present
   invention is accomplished with the effects thereof.
25 Therefore, the term" perpendicular substantially" covers the
   case where the cartridge slightly inclines.
   [0521]        Between the cartridge b   and the cartridge
   accommodating portion 130A, small gaps are provided    in order
   to mount and demount the cartridge B smoothly.   more
30 specifically and the small gaps are provided   between the
   guide 140R1 or 140R2 and the guide 130R1 with respect to the
   longitudinal direction, between the guide 140L1 or 140L2
   10156073 1                                            905731D2

                                 - 141
   and the guide 130L1 with respect to the longitudinal
   direction.   Therefore, at the time of the mounting and
   demounting of the cartridge b relative to the accommodating
   portion 130A and the whole cartridge B can slightly incline
 5 within the limits  of the gaps.   In addition, a slight
   positional deviation may occur between the rotary member C
    (movable member) and the driving shaft  (180).   For this
   reason, the perpendicularity is not meant   strictly.    However,
   even in such a case, the present invention is accomplished
10 with the effects thereof.   Therefore, the term "perpendicular
   substantially" covers the case where the cartridge slightly
   inclines.
   [0522]         It has been described that the axis L2 is
   slantable or inclinable in any direction relative to the axis
15 Li.   However, the axis L2 does not necessarily need to be
   linearly slantable to the predetermined angle in the full
   range of 360-degree direction in the coupling 150.     For
   example, the opening 150g can be selected to be slightly wider
   in the circumferential direction.    By doing so,  the time of
20 the axis L2  inclining relative to the axis Li,   even if it is
   the case where it cannot incline to the predetermined angle
   linearly, the coupling 150 can rotate to a slight degree
   around the axis L2.   Therefore, it can be inclined to the
   predetermined angle.   In other words,  the amount of the play
25 in the rotational direction of the opening 150g    is selected
   properly if necessary.
   [0523]         In this manner, the coupling 150   is revolvable
   or swingable over the full-circumference substantially
   relative to the axis Li  of the developing roller 110.     More
30 particularly, the coupling 150 is pivotable over the full
   circumference thereof substantially relative to the drum shaft
   153.
   10156073 1                                              905731D2

                                     -  142
   [0524]           Furthermore, as will be understood from the
   foregoing explanation, the coupling 150 is          capable of whirling
   in and substantially over the circumferential direction of the
   drum shaft    153.   Here,  the whirling motion is not a motion
 5 with which the coupling itself rotates about the axis L2,            but
   the inclined axis L2 rotates about the axis Li          of the
   developing roller although the whirling here does not preclude
   the rotation of the coupling per se about the axis L2 of the
   coupling 150.
10 [0525]           In addition, as has been described hereinbefore,
   each coupling has     the function of transmitting the rotational
   force to the developing roller 110.
   [0526]           And, each coupling, it has the rotational force
   reception surface     (rotational force receiving portion) 150e
15  (8150e, 9150e,    9250e,  9350e,   9450e, 15150e)   for receiving the
   rotational force     from the drive shaft 180      (1180, 1280,  9180)
   by engaging with the pin       (rotational force applying portion)
   182  (1182,   9182).   In addition,    it has  the rotational force
   transmitting surface      (rotational force transmitting portion)
20 150h   (1550h, 1450h, 8150h, 9150h, 12150h, 12151h, and so on)
   which transmits the rotational force received through the
   rotational force receiving portion 150e         to the developing
   roller 110.     The rotational    force received by the rotational
   force transmitting surface 150h is transmitted to the
25 developing roller 110 through the pin         (rotational force
   receiving portion) 155      (1155, 1355,   12155).
   [0527]           And, this coupling moves from this pre
   engagement angular position to this rotational          force
   transmitting angular position in response to the movement of
30 cartridge B at the time of the rotary C          (supporting member
   141190)    (movable member) rotating in one direction        (movement).
   10156073 1                                                    905731D2

                                   -  143
   By this, this coupling is opposed to this drive shaft.            When
   the rotary C further rotates in said one direction from the
   position where the coupling opposes to the drive shaft
    (movement), the coupling moves from the rotational force
 5 transmitting angular position to the disengaging angular
   position in response to the cartridge B moving.          By this,     the
   coupling disengages from the drive shaft.
   [0528]           The coupling has the recess 150z      (1450z, 1550z,
   4150z,   515z0,  15150z, 15150z, and so on) on the rotation axis
10 L2.   And, the cartridge B moves     in the direction substantially
   perpendicular to the axis Li      of the developing roller 110 by
   the rotation of the rotary C in said one direction.           In
   response to this, each coupling moves from the pre-engagement
   angular position to the rotational force transmitting angular
15 position, so that     a part of coupling     (downstream free end
   position 150A1,    1850A1, 4150A1,   515OA1,   8150A1,  12150A1 and so
   on) which is    the downstream portion with respect to the
   rotational direction of the rotary C         is permitted to
   circumvent the drive shaft.       By this,   the recess covers the
20 free end of the drive shaft.       And, the rotational force
   receiving portion engages,    in the rotational direction of the
   coupling, with the rotational force applying portion which
   projects in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the
   drive shaft    in the free end side of the drive shaft.        By this,
25 from the drive shaft, the coupling receives the rotational
   force and rotates.     And, the rotary C further moves to said
   one direction.     By this, the cartridge B moves      in the
   direction substantially perpendicular to the axis Li.            It
   responds to this,    the coupling is moved to the disengaging
30 angular position, in the rotational direction, from the
   rotational force transmitting angular position, so that             a
   part of upstream drive shafts of this coupling member
    (upstream free end position 150A2,     1750A2,   4150A2, 5150A2,
   10156073 1                                                   905731D2

                                   - 144
   12150A2   and so on)   is permitted circumventing the drive
   shaft.    By this, the coupling disengages from the drive shaft.
   [0529]          The  rotational force receiving portions     (150e,
   15150e,   and so on) are disposed, respectively on a phantom
 5 circle Cl which has a center 0 on the rotation axis Li        of this
   each coupling, at the positions diametrically opposed
   interposing the center 0.     The forces  received by the
   couplings by this disposition are force couples.       For this
   reason, the couplings can continue rotary motion only with the
10 force couple.    In view of this, each coupling can rotate
   without determining the position of the rotation axis.

15 The other embodiments:
   [0531]          In this embodiment, although the rotary rotates
   in the clockwise direction on the drawing      (Figure 17,   for
   example),   it may rotate in the opposite direction.
   [0532]          In addition, the image   forming position
20  (developing position) may be another position.
   [05331          In addition, the rotary of the present
   embodiment carries the four color developing cartridges.
   However, the developing cartridge for the black may be fixed
   and the cartridges for the other three colors may be carried

   [0534]          In addition,  in this embodiment, the developing
   roller is a contact development type and uses an elastic
   10156073 1                                                 905731D2

   roller, but it may be a metal sleeve which contains a magnet
   roller employed by the jumping development.
   [05351        The developing cartridge and the developing
   device are provided with the developing roller     (or developing
 5 means including the developing roller) at least.      For this
   reason, for example, the developing cartridge     (developing
   device) is the developing roller.     Or, it may be a cartridge
   which includes integrally the developing means     including the
   developing roller and the cleaning means and which is
10 detachably mountable to the apparatus main assembly, in
   addition to the type in the embodiment described above
   further, it may be a cartridge which includes integrally the
   developing roller  (or developing means including the
   developing roller) and the charging means and which is
15 detachably mountable to the apparatus main assembly.
   [05361        Further, in addition, in this embodiment,
   although a laser beam printer is    taken as an image forming
   device, the present invention is not    limited to this example.
   For example, the present invention can be used to the other
20 image forming apparatuses, such as an electrophotographic
   copying machine, a facsimile device, or a word processor.
   according to the embodiments described above the engagement
   and disengagement of the coupling are possible in the
   direction substantially perpendicular to the axis of the drive
25 shaft provided in the main assembly of the electrophotographic
   image forming apparatus relative to the drive shaft by the
   movement in  one direction of the movable member     (the rotary,
   for example, the cartridge  supporting member, cash drawer).
   [0537]        As has been described hereinbefore, the axis of
30 the coupling can take the different angular positions in the
   present invention.   More particularly, the axis of the
   10156073 1                                               905731D2

                                  - 146
   coupling can take the pre-engagement angular position, the
   rotational force transmitting angular position, and the
   disengaging angular position.     The coupling can be engaged
   with the drive shaft in the direction substantially
 5 perpendicular to the axis of the providing-in the main
   assembly drive shaft by this structure.     In addition, the
   coupling can be disengaged from the drive shaft in the
   direction substantially perpendicular to the axis of the drive
   shaft.    The present invention can be applied to a developing
10 device, a drum coupling member, and an electrophotographic
   image forming device.
