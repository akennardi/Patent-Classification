                                                                 Technical Field
[0002]                  In various embodiments, the present invention relates to devices and methods for
puncturing a capsule to release a powdered medicament therefrom.
                                                                  Background
[0003]                  In the medical field, it is often desirable to administer various forms of medication
to patients. Well known methods of introducing medication into the human body include, for
example, the oral ingestion of capsules and tablets, and intravenous injection through
hypodermic needles. In accordance with another exemplary method, medications are inhaled
into a patient's respiratory tract and lungs through the nose or mouth. Certain ones of these
medications, such as those for the treatment of asthma and/or other respiratory anomalies (e.g.,
bronchodilators, corticosteroids, etc.), may be aimed at the respiratory tract directly. Others
may be inhaled for purposes of systemic treatment, i.e., for treatment of any area of the body
through absorption from the respiratory tract through the lung tissue, into the deep lungs, and
into the bloodstream. Each of these medications comes in a variety of forms, including fluids,
which are commonly administered as an aerosol vapor or mist, as well as solids. Inhalable
solids typically take the form of fine, dry powders. Specialized devices, such as inhalers, may

C:\Interoven\NRPortbl\DCC\AAR\723567 I_.DOC-6/28/20l8
                                                          -2
be provided to assist the patient in directing these fine powder medications into the respiratory
tract.
[0004]                 Various types of inhalers are known for the administration of dry powder
medicaments. Typically, the dry powder medicament is initially contained in a capsule. In
order for the powder to be emitted from the capsule, the inhaler must first create a passage
through the capsule film. This is generally done through the use of sharpened pins or staples
that pierce the capsule. In particular, the capsule film is typically thin and made of a material
that has relatively low strength properties, thereby facilitating the piercing of the capsule.
[0005]                 Generally, 20 mg to 30 mg of a traditional inhalation powder made through dry
blending of an active drug substance with lactose carrier particles are included in a capsule.
The volume of this powder is typically low, however, due to the density of the powder
generally being on the order of 1 g/cm 3 . Because the volume is low, the required capsule size
is also small. For example, a lactose blend product can be easily accommodated in a size 3
(i.e., 0.30 cm ) or lower (i.e., smaller) capsule. In practice, however, the final decision on
capsule size is more often than not related to patient convenience than to the volumetric
requirements, as capsules that are too small can be difficult for patients to handle.
[0006]                 In cases where a low volume of powder is to be delivered, the required volumetric
flow rate of the powder (i.e., the required volume of powder delivered per unit time) through
one or more openings created in the capsule is also very modest. For example, with a powder
density of approximately 1 g/cm 3 , a 25 mg fill of a lactose blend with a total active drug load of
0.20 mg has a volume of approximately 0.025 cm 3 . In this example, for a 5 second inhalation,
the required volumetric flow rate is just 0.005 cm 3/s.
[0007]                 However, high performance inhalation powders have recently been introduced as an
alternative to traditional lactose blends. These new powders are characterized by highly
efficient delivery of drug to the lungs, which is generally achieved by producing powders with
low densities (i.e., typically below 0.10 g/cm 3). These lower density, high performance
powders create new demands on the delivery devices used by patients.
[0008]                 One consideration is that larger capsules are required. For example, 25 mg of
powder with a density of 0.04 g/cm3 has a volume of 0.625 cm 3 . This volume of powder
requires at least a size 0 (i.e., 0.68 cm 3) capsule, and possibly even a size 00 (i.e., 0.95 cm 3)
capsule to allow for a reasonable commercial filling process.

C \Interoven\NRPortbl\DCC\AAR\723567 I_.DOC-6/28/20l8
                                                              -3
[0009]                 Another consideration is that a full dose emission should be achievable in a single
breath of a typical adult patient. As described above, the volumetric flow rate required for
traditional dry powder blends is very modest. In comparison, a size 00 (i.e., 0.95 cm 3) capsule
with a 25 mg fill of a 0.04 g/cm 3 powder (i.e., 0.625 cm 3 of powder) requires a volumetric flow
rate of 0.125 cm 3/s in order to be fully emitted during a 5 second inhalation, which is 25 times
greater than that required in the example provided above for lactose blends.
[0010]                 Small diameter pins or staples can readily pierce a capsule without causing undue
material deformation, such as collapse of the capsule's walls or domes. For higher density
lactose blends, use of small diameter pins or staples does not present an issue. In particular, the
low volumetric flow rates required for these products allows for the total hole area to be small.
The hole made by, for example, a 1 mm diameter round pin will have an area of about 0.008
       23
cm . In the first (i.e., high density powder) example above, 25 mg of the 1 g/cm3 lactose blend
powder emitted from a hole of this size in 5 seconds will have a volumetric flux of about 0.625
cm 3/[cm2s]. This level of flux is readily obtainable in capsule-based inhalers. In the second
(i.e., low density powder) example above, though, 25 mg of the 0.04 g/cm 3 powder emitted
from a 1 mm diameter hole in 5 seconds would require a volumetric flux of about 15.625
cm 3/[cm2s]. In practice, a volumetric flux of this magnitude is not achievable. This can be
remedied by increasing the hole area, but piercing a large hole through the capsule requires
high force loading which will, without more, collapse the capsule before the puncture is
created. Improving the sharpness of the piercing mechanism can also provide some relief, but
this is limited by the nature of the metals and forming processes used.
[0011]                 Accordingly, a need exists for improved devices and methods for puncturing a
capsule to release a powdered medicament therefrom. In particular, an improved approach is
required in order to produce enough hole area in a capsule to allow for a full dose emission of a
low density powder without the capsule being collapsed.
                                                      Summary of the Invention
[0012]                 Various embodiments of the inhalation device described herein allow for high doses
of low-density inhalation powders to be delivered. In one embodiment, the inhalation device
accomplishes this by strategically piercing the highest strength region of the capsule (i.e., the
domes) and by positioning the piercing elements towards the perimeter of the domed regions.
In other words, the piercing elements (e.g., the individual prongs or tines) are placed far apart

C:\Interoven\NRPortbl\DCC\AAR\723567 I_.DOC-6/28/20l8
                                                          -4
and at the point where most of their force is transmitted to the cylindrical wall of the capsule,
thus placing as little force as possible on the dome. Such a design allows for relatively large
pins or staple tines to produce large openings in the capsule's dome without collapsing the
capsule. In particular, the inhalation device can incorporate pins or staples with large cross
sectional areas, which results in a substantial increase in the total hole area available for dose
emission from the capsule.
[0013]                 In one embodiment, the preferred location for the center of each puncture hole is in
an annular region on the dome's surface that is positioned at no less than 40% (e.g., between
about 40% and about 80%, or between about 40% and about 60%) of the dome's radius away
from a central axis of the dome. In addition, in one such embodiment, the preferred total
surface area of all puncture holes is between about 0.5% and about 2.2% of the total surface
area of the capsule, or between about 3% and about 15% of the total surface area of a single
dome. It has been determined that these particular combinations of puncture hole location and
puncture hole surface area advantageously avoid the capsule collapsing upon itself when
punctured. Moreover, it has been determined that such a puncture hole surface area allows for
a full dose of a low-density (i.e., below 0.10 g/cm 3) powder to be emitted from a capsule at a
sufficient volumetric flow rate and an achievable magnitude of volumetric flux so as to be
consumed in a single breath by a typical adult patient.
[0014]                 In general, in one aspect, embodiments of the invention feature a device for
puncturing a capsule to release a powdered medicament therefrom. The device includes a
chamber for receiving the capsule. The capsule includes opposing domes and a cylindrical wall
portion defined by a capsule wall radius r. The device further includes a mechanism for
puncturing at least one hole in at least one dome. A center of each hole is located within an
annular puncture region situated at no less than 0.4r, and a total surface area of all puncture
holes is between about 0.5% and about 2.2% of a total surface area of the capsule. The annular
puncture region may, for example, be situated between about 0.4r and about 0.8r, or between
about 0.4r and about 0.6r.
[0015]                 In general, in another aspect, embodiments of the invention feature a method for
puncturing a capsule to release a powdered medicament therefrom. The method includes
receiving, within a chamber, a capsule that itself includes opposing domes and a cylindrical
wall portion defined by a capsule wall radius r. The method also includes puncturing at least

one hole in at least one dome. A center of each hole is located within an annular puncture
region situated at no less than 0.4r, and a total surface area of all puncture holes is between
about 0.5% and about 2.2% of a total surface area of the capsule. The annular puncture region
may, for example, be situated between about 0.4r and about 0.8r, or between about 0.4r and
about 0.6r.
[0016]                 In various embodiments, the puncturing mechanism (which may include a plurality
of prongs and which may be moveable between a non-puncturing position and a puncturing
position) is configured to puncture only a single dome. In such instances, the total surface area
of all puncture holes is between about 3% and about 15% of a total surface area of the single
                                                                                     3
dome. In one embodiment, the capsule has a volume of at least 0.50 cm . The capsule may
house a powdered medicament, which may have a density below 0.10 g/cm 3 and/or contain
levodopa as an active drug. Puncturing the capsule's dome causes the powdered medicament
to be released from the capsule.
[0017]                 In certain embodiments, an outer surface of the capsule is between about 0.08 mm
and about 0.12 mm thick. The capsule (i.e., the opposing domes and the cylindrical wall
portion thereof) may be made from a material such as, for example, hydroxy propyl methyl
cellulose or gelatin.
[0018]                 In one embodiment, the device further includes an inhalation portion that is coupled
to the chamber. The inhalation portion may define, for example, at least one aperture for
emitting the powdered medicament therethrough. For its part, the chamber may include a wall
defining a plurality of vents for introducing air into the chamber to disperse the powdered
medicament released from the capsule.
[0019]                 In general, in yet another aspect, embodiments of the invention feature a punctured
capsule. The punctured capsule includes opposing domes (at least one of which is punctured
with at least one hole) and a cylindrical wall portion defined by a radius r. A center of each
hole is located within an annular region situated at no less than 0.4r, and a total surface area of
all puncture holes is between about 0.5% and about 2.2% of a total surface area of the capsule.
The annular region may, for example, be situated between about 0.4r and about 0.8r, or
between about 0.4r and about 0.6r.
[0020]                 In various embodiments, only a single dome of the capsule is punctured. In such
instances, the total surface area of all puncture holes is between about 3% and about 15% of a

total surface area of the single dome. In one embodiment, the punctured capsule has a volume
of at least 0.50 cm 3 . The punctured capsule may include therein a powdered medicament,
which may have a density below 0.10 g/cm 3 and/or contain levodopa as an active drug. In
addition, an outer surface of the punctured capsule may be between about 0.08 mm and about
0.12 mm thick. The opposing domes and the cylindrical wall portion of the punctured capsule
may each be made from a material such as, for example, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose or
gelatin.

[0032]                  In various embodiments, the present invention features devices and methods for
puncturing a capsule to release a powdered medicament therefrom. In particular, the capsule is
punctured in a specific region with sufficiently-sized puncture holes so as to allow a full dose
of a low-density (i.e., below 0.10 g/cm 3) powder to be emitted from the capsule and be
consumed by a typical adult patient in a single breath (i.e., emitted at a sufficient volumetric
flow rate and an achievable magnitude of volumetric flux), while, at the same time, not causing
the capsule to collapse upon itself.
[0033]                  FIG. 1 depicts a front view of an inhalation device 100 in accordance with one
embodiment of the invention. A rear view of the device 100 is substantially identical to the
front view. As shown, the device 100 includes a first or lower casing portion 120 and a second
or upper casing portion 130 removably coupled to the first casing portion 120. The upper
casing portion 130 and lower casing portion 120 each include a flattened region 132 and 122,
respectively, to facilitate gripping of the casing by a patient. In one embodiment, the lower
casing portion 120 includes an outer casing 126 and an inner casing 124 movably received
within the outer casing 126. A removable cap 110 is provided at the user or inhalation end of
the device 100.
[0034]                  Preferred materials for the device 100 include Food and Drug Administration
("FDA") approved, and United States Pharmacopeia ("USP") tested, plastics. In one
embodiment, the device 100 is manufactured using an injection molding process, the details of
which would be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.
[0035]                  FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the device 100 depicted in FIG. 1 along the line
2-2. As shown in FIG. 2, the device 100 includes an inhalation or emitter portion 220. The
inhalation portion 220 includes a hemispheric region 222 that defines a plurality of apertures
224. It should be understood, however, that the present invention is not limited to a particular
number of apertures 224, and can be configured such that at least one aperture 224 is provided.
An inhalation piece 226 is provided to allow for inhalation of the medicament by a user. The
inhalation piece 226 can be configured as a mouth piece for inhalation through a user's mouth.
Alternatively, the inhalation piece 226 can be configured as a nose piece for inhalation through

[0036]                 The device 100 also includes a cylindrical chamber 210 that is defined by a straight
wall 212 of circular cross-section. The chamber 210 has a proximal end 214 that is coupled to
the inhalation portion 220, and an opposite, distal end 216. In particular, the proximal end 214
of the chamber 210 is in fluid communication with the inhalation portion 220. As shown in
FIG. 2, the chamber 210 may receive therein a capsule 219. A plurality of vents 218 are
defined by the wall 212, and are configured for introducing air into the chamber 210 to disperse
powdered medicament released from the capsule 219. It should be understood that the present
invention is not limited to a particular number of vents 218, and can be configured such that at
least one vent 218 is provided. Powder released from the capsule 219 is dispersed in the
chamber 210 and inhaled through the apertures 224 and inhalation piece 226 by the user.
[0037]                 FIG. 3 depicts a table 300 of standard capsule sizes. In one embodiment of the
invention, the capsule 219 employed in connection with the inhalation device 100 has a volume
of at least 0.50 cm 3 . In other words, with reference to the table 300 of FIG. 3, a size 1 capsule
is the minimum capsule size employed. Alternatively, the capsule 219 may be at least of size 0
(i.e., 0.68 cm 3 ), size OE (i.e., 0.70 cm 3), size 00 (i.e., 0.95 cm 3), or size 000 (i.e., 1.37 cm 3).
Suitable capsules 219 can be obtained, for example, from Shionogi, Inc. of Florham Park, New
Jersey.
[0038]                 In one embodiment, the capsule 219 stores or encloses particles, also referred to
herein as powders. The capsule 219 may be filled with powder in any manner known to one
skilled in the art. For example, vacuum filling or tamping technologies may be used. In one
embodiment, the capsule 219 is filled with a powdered medicament having a density below
0.10 g/cm3. The powdered medicament housed by the capsule 219 may also include any of a
variety of active drugs, including, for example, levodopa. In one embodiment, the powder
housed within the capsule 219 has a mass of at least 20 mg. In another embodiment, the mass
of the powder is at least 25 mg, and up to approximately 30 mg.
[0039]                 With reference again to FIG. 2, the inhalation device 100 also includes a puncturing
mechanism 230 that is used to puncture at least one hole in at least one dome of the capsule 219
to release the powdered medicament contained therein into the chamber 210. In the
embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the puncturing mechanism 230 is configured as a substantially
U-shaped staple having two prongs 232. In one such embodiment, each of prongs 232 is
configured with a square cross-section 234, thereby providing a sharp point and two cutting

edges. Alternatively, one, or a plurality of, straight needle-like implements may be used as the
puncturing mechanism 230. Further exemplary puncturing mechanisms suitable for use in
connection with the inhalation device 100 are described in detail in, for example, United States
Patent No. 6,732,732 and United States Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0025721, the
disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. The
puncturing mechanism 230 can be configured to puncture one or, alternatively, multiple hole(s)
(through a single or, alternatively, multiple piercing point(s)) in the capsule 219. As described
below, however, the total surface area of all puncture holes is of greater importance than the
actual number of puncture holes.
[0040]                 The puncturing mechanism 230 is preferably configured to be movable between a
non-puncturing position (as depicted in FIG. 2) and a puncturing position. In the puncturing
position, the prongs 232 pierce or puncture the capsule 219 to make holes therein. In one
embodiment, a biasing mechanism is provided that biases the puncturing mechanism 230 in the
non-puncturing position. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the biasing mechanism is
configured as a first spring 242 that biases the substantially U-shaped staple 230 in the non
puncturing position.
[0041]                 As noted above with reference to FIG. 1, the lower casing portion 120 of the device
100 includes the inner casing 124 and the outer casing 126. As shown in FIG. 2, a second
spring 244 is disposed in the lower casing portion 120. The second spring 244 biases the inner
casing 124 in an outward position. Upon compression of the second spring 244, the inner
casing 124 moves from the outward position to an inward position, thereby drawing the lower
casing portion 120 toward the upper casing portion 130. Compression of the second spring 244
also causes compression of the first spring 242, thereby causing the puncturing mechanism 230
to move upward to the puncturing position and to pierce or puncture the capsule 219 to make
holes therein. Upon release of compression, the first and second springs 242, 244 return to
their biased state, thereby returning the puncturing mechanism 230 to its non-puncturing
position, and the inner casing 124 to its outward position. In particular, upon the release of
compression, the capsule 219 is stripped from the prongs 232 of the puncturing mechanism 230
as the first spring 242 returns to its biased state. The second spring 244 may act as a backup to
strip the capsule 219 from the prongs 232 of the puncturing mechanism 230 in the event that
the first spring 242 fails to do so.

[0042]                 Although the puncturing mechanism 230 of the inhalation device 100 depicted in
FIG. 2 is configured to puncture only a single dome of the capsule 219, other designs are also
within the scope of the invention. For example, as will be understood by one of ordinary skill
in the art, the puncturing mechanism 230 may also be designed to (or a second puncturing
mechanism may be employed to) puncture both domes of the capsule 219.
[0043]                 As also depicted in FIG. 2, a pair of flanges 252 is disposed on the lower casing
portion 120. A pair of grooves 254 is disposed on the upper casing portion 130, so that the
flanges 252 can be received within the grooves 254 to thereby couple the lower and upper
casing portions 120, 130. In one embodiment, the lower and upper casing portions 120, 130 are
coupled with a friction-fit engagement. A friction-fit engagement may be achieved using the
groove 254 and flange 252 arrangement depicted in FIG. 2. Other alternative configurations
for a friction-fit engagement will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art.
[0044]                 FIG. 4 depicts a side view of a capsule 219 that may be punctured using the
exemplary inhalation device 100 described above. As illustrated, the capsule 219 includes a
first dome 404, a second, opposing dome 408, and a cylindrical wall portion 412 that is defined
by a radius r. The cylindrical wall portion 412 extends between first and second ends 416 and
420, where it meets the first and second domes 404 and 408, respectively.
[0045]                 FIG. 5 depicts a top view of the first dome 404 (i.e., a view of the dome 404 when it
is observed in the direction of arrow 424). As illustrated, the first dome 404 features two
puncture holes 504, 508 within an annular region 428. As described further below, the annular
puncture region 428 represents the preferred region on an outer surface 432 of the first dome
404 in which to puncture the holes 504, 508. In particular, in one embodiment, the puncturing
mechanism 230 of the inhalation device 100 is configured to puncture a center of each hole
504, 508 within the annular puncture region 428.
[0046]                 In one embodiment, the outer surface 432 of the capsule 219 is between about 0.08
mm and about 0.12 mm thick. For example, the outer surface 432 of each of the first dome
404, the second dome 408, and the cylindrical wall portion 412 may be approximately 0.10 mm
thick. Within that outer surface 432 the capsule 219 may be hollow and, as described above,
may be at least partially filled with a powdered medicament. Materials such as, for example,
hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose or gelatin may form the relatively thin outer surface 432 of the
capsule 219 (i.e., the opposing domes 404 and 408 and the cylindrical wall portion 412).

[0047]                 As illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5, the annular puncture region 428 is situated on the
outer surface 432 of the first dome 404 between about 0.4r and about 0.8r. In other words, the
preferred location for the center of each puncture hole 504, 508 is in an annular region of the
dome 404 that is positioned between about 40% and about 80% of the dome's radius away
from a central axis 436 of the dome 404. As an example, for a size 00 (i.e., 0.95 cm 3) capsule
219, the annular puncture region 428 is situated between about 0.16 cm and about 0.32 cm
away from the central axis 436 of the dome 404. It has been found that, in puncturing the dome
404 in this region 428, most of the force is transmitted to the cylindrical wall 412 of the capsule
219, thus placing as little force as possible on the dome 404. Such an approach allows for the
use of relatively large prongs 232 in the puncturing mechanism 230 so as to produce large holes
504, 508 in the dome 404 without collapsing the capsule 219.
[0048]                 In particular, where the puncturing mechanism 230 is configured to puncture only a
single dome 404 of the capsule 219 (as is the case, for example, in the exemplary inhalation
device 100 depicted in FIG. 2), the total combined surface area of all puncture holes 504, 508
may be up to about 15% of a total surface area of the dome 404. As an example, each puncture
hole 504, 508 may represent about 7.5% of the total surface area of the dome 404, and, thus, in
combination the puncture holes 504, 508 may represent about 15% of the total surface area of
the dome 404. This is a substantial total hole area that is available for dose emission from the
capsule 219.
[0049]                 In fact, in testing, it has been found that a full dose of a low-density (i.e., below 0.10
g/cm 3) powder may be emitted from the capsule 219 and consumed by a typical adult patient in
a single breath (i.e., emitted at a sufficient volumetric flow rate and an achievable magnitude of
volumetric flux) where the combined total surface area of all puncture holes is between about
3% and about 15% of a total surface area of a single dome 404 or, equivalently, where the
combined total surface area of all puncture holes is between about 0.5% and about 2.2% of a
total surface area of the entire capsule 219. As an example, for a size 00 (i.e., 0.95 cm 3)
capsule 219, the preferred total surface area for all puncture holes 504, 508 is between about
                2                         2
0.03 cm and 0.14 cm.
Experimental Results and Simulation
[0050]                 The effect of the total combined surface area of all puncture holes on the efficiency
of dose delivery was examined using a representative low density, high performance dry

powder formulation. In particular, size 00 (i.e., 0.95 cm 3) capsules were filled with equal
quantities of powder and punctured in a manner so as to create holes with a total combined
surface area ranging from 0.027 cm 2 to 0.066 cm                2
                                                                  (i.e., 0.0042 in 2 to 0.0102 in2).
Approximately 30 capsules were tested for each target hole area value. The percentage of the
filled powder mass emitted during a simulated breath was then measured for each hole area
configuration. Specifically, this dose emission study was conducted at a simulated inhalation
flow rate and volume performance associated with typical pediatric patients. The study
therefore represents the worst case in adult populations (i.e., the study is representative of the
lower 5% to 10% of adults). The results of the study are shown in the table 600 of FIG. 6 and
in the corresponding graph 700 of FIG. 7.
[0051]                 From the results shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, it was concluded that the average fraction
of powder emitted in a single breath increases asymptotically towards 100% with increasing
puncture hole area. In addition, the variability of dose emission follows an inverse relationship
with the total combined surface area of all puncture holes, as the standard deviation (a measure
of dose delivery variability) decreases with increasing puncture hole area.
[0052]                 In particular, as can be seen in the table 600 depicted in FIG. 6, when a combined
total surface area of all the puncture holes is about 0.5% of the total surface area of the entire
capsule, 48% of the capsule's powder is emitted, on average, in a single breath of a pediatric
patient. This represents the lower bound on an acceptable percentage of powder to be emitted
in a single breath of a pediatric patient. In a typical adult, a much greater percentage of powder
(e.g., essentially a full dose) would be emitted when the combined total surface area of all the
puncture holes is about 0.5% of the total surface area of the entire capsule. This minimum
value of surface area for the puncture holes therefore also represents the lower bound on an
acceptable percentage of powder to be emitted in a single breath of an adult patient.
[0053]                 While the percentage of powder emitted in a single patient breath increases with
increasing puncture hole area, it does so generally asymptotically. It has been found that it is
undesirable for the combined total surface area of all the puncture holes to be greater than about
2.2% of the total surface area of the entire capsule, because the puncturing force that results
from producing puncture holes greater than that size can approach or exceed the loading limits
for typical capsule materials, such as hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose and gelatin. Moreover,
it is typically unnecessary for the combined total surface area of all the puncture holes to be

                                                          - 14
greater than about 2.2% of the total surface area of the entire capsule because, as can be seen
from the table 600 of FIG. 6 and the graph 700 of FIG. 7, the percentage of powder emitted
from the capsule approaches 100% generally asymptotically and little to no appreciable benefit
(in terms of the percentage of powder emitted from the capsule) exists for puncture hole areas
beyond that size.
[0054]                 The use of puncture holes having a combined total surface area in narrower ranges
between about 0.5% and about 2.2% of the total surface area of the entire capsule (e.g., with
minimum values of about 0.5%, about 0.8%, about 1.1%, and/or about 1.3% of the total surface
area of the entire capsule in any combination with maximum values of about 1.6%, about 1.8%,
about 2.0%, and/or about 2.2% of the total surface area of the entire capsule) is also
contemplated and within the scope of the present invention.
[0055]                 A limiting factor for positioning a puncture hole in a capsule's dome is the capsule
material's strength and tendency to deflect under load. In order for the capsule material to be
penetrated, the capsule material has to essentially maintain its position prior to the penetrating
tip perforating the capsule's surface. If the capsule material deflects (e.g., bends inward) to too
great a degree before perforation occurs, the capsule's dome will tend to collapse before the tip
fully penetrates and creates a hole in the capsule material. Using Finite Element Analysis
("FEA") and the mechanical properties of the capsule material, the capsule material's response
to a constant force loading at different positions along the radius of the capsule's dome was
simulated. The results of that analysis are shown in the table 800 of FIG. 8 and in the
corresponding graph 900 of FIG. 9.
[0056]                 The analysis predicts, as can be observed from FIGS. 8 and 9, that a change in
degree of deflection in response to a constant loading force similar to that imparted to the
capsule material during puncturing will occur between 40% to 50% of the dome radius. The
change, as one moves from a puncture hole centered at 50% of the dome radius towards a
puncture hole centered at 40% of the dome radius, is a transition from minor bending (which is
recoverable or elastic deformation) to plastic or irreversible deformation. This transition occurs
when the capsule material begins to yield under load. Once this transition point is reached, the
efficiency of puncture hole generation is significantly reduced as the capsule's dome will
continue to deflect under increasing load rather than being penetrated.

                                                        - 15
[0057]                 A separate laboratory study measuring the efficiency of puncture hole generation for
various geometric positions of two penetrating tips was conducted to confirm these simulation
results. The study showed that once the centers of the puncture holes reached values below
0.4r the rate of dome collapse increased dramatically. The nature of the dome collapse was
such that a reliable dose emission was unlikely to occur with penetration positions at less than
0.4r.
[0058]                 Accordingly, as mentioned above, the preferred location for the center of each
puncture hole is in an annular region of the capsule's dome that is situated at no less than 0.4r
(and, in some embodiments, at no less than 0.5r). For example, the annular puncture region
may be situated between about 0.4r and about 0.6r, or between about 0.4r and about 0.8r. In
fact, in practice, the annular puncture region may be situated in any region on the capsule's
dome having a minimum value of about 0.4r, about 0.5r, and/or about 0.6r in any combination
with a maximum value of about 0.6r, about 0.7r, and/or about 0.8r. Attempting to puncture the
capsule's dome in a region greater than 0.8r is undesirable for several reasons. For instance,
beyond 0.8r the prong of the puncturing mechanism could slip off the capsule's dome and/or
tear down the cylindrical wall portion of the capsule. Tearing down the cylindrical wall portion
of the capsule could leave too great a hole in the capsule and/or cause portions of the capsule to
be ripped apart and (potentially) be inhaled by the patient. Attempting to puncture the
capsule's dome in a region greater than 0.8r could also create a side load on the capsule,
causing it to detrimentally deflect within the inhaler's chamber.
Exemplary Method of Use
[0059]                 In an exemplary method of use of the inhalation device 100, a user (e.g., a patient)
places the capsule 219 containing a powdered medicament within the cylindrical chamber 210.
When the user compresses the inhalation device 100, the puncturing mechanism 230 is moved
toward the capsule 219, thereby puncturing the capsule 219 and causing the release of
powdered medicament into the chamber 210. After release into the chamber 210, the powdered
medicament is then inhaled by the user through the apertures 224 and the inhalation piece 226.
As noted, the inhalation piece 226 can be configured as either a mouth piece or a nose piece.
For subsequent uses, the user merely replaces the emptied capsule 219 with another capsule
219 that contains a new supply of the powdered medicament.
