                       A DENTAL CLEANING APPLIANCE
TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a dental cleaning appliance.
BACKGROUND
Electric toothbrushes generally comprise a cleaning tool which is connected to a handle.
The cleaning tool comprises a stem and a brush head bearing bristles for brushing teeth.
The brush head comprises a static section which is connected to the stem, and at least one
moveable section which is moveable relative to the static section, for example with one of
a reciprocating, oscillating, vibrating, pivoting or rotating motion, to impart a brushing
movement to bristles mounted thereon. The stem houses a drive shaft which couples with
a transmission unit within the handle. The transmission unit is in turn connected to a motor,
which is driven by a battery housed within the handle. The drive shaft and the transmission
unit convert rotary or vibratory motion of the motor into the desired movement of the
moveable section of the brush head relative to the static section of the brush head.
It is known to incorporate into an electric toothbrush an assembly for generating a jet of
fluid for interproximal cleaning. For example, US 8,522,384 describes an electric
toothbrush in which the handle of the toothbrush defines a fluid chamber for storing a liquid
such as water, and a slidable cover for enabling the fluid chamber to be accessed for
replenishment by a user. A fluid path connects the fluid chamber to a nozzle located on a
static portion of the brush head. A pump located within the fluid path is actuated upon user
operation of an actuator on the handle to pump fluid from the fluid chamber to the nozzle
for release under pressure from the nozzle.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Figures l(a) to l(c) illustrate external views of an embodiment of a dental cleaning
appliance 10. In this embodiment, the appliance is in the form of a handheld appliance,
which is in the form of an electric tooth brush having an integrated assembly for
dispensing a working fluid for improved interproximal cleaning.
The appliance 10 comprises a handle 12 and a cleaning tool 14. The handle 12 comprises
                                                    3

an external body 16 which is gripped by a user during use of the appliance. The body 16
is preferably formed from plastics material, and is preferably generally cylindrical in
shape. The handle 12 comprises a plurality of user operable buttons 18, 20, 22 which are
located within respective apertures formed in the body 16 so as to be accessible to the
user. The handle 12 may comprise a display which is positioned so as to be visible to a
user during use of the appliance.
The cleaning tool 14 comprises a stem 26 and a head 28. The stem 26 is elongate in
shape, which serves to space the head 28 from the handle 12 to facilitate user operability
of the appliance 10. In this embodiment, the head 28 of the cleaning tool 14 comprises a
brush unit 29, which comprises a bristle carrier 30 and a plurality of bristles 32 mounted
on the bristle carrier 30. However, in other embodiments the cleaning tool 14 may be
provided without a brush unit 29 so that the appliance is in the form of a dedicated
interproximal cleaning appliance for cleaning between the gaps in the user' s teeth.
The cleaning tool 14 also comprises a fluid reservoir 34 for storing a working fluid, and a
nozzle 36 for delivering one or more bursts of working fluid to the teeth of the user
during use of the appliance 10. The fluid reservoir 34 is connected to the stem 26. The
fluid reservoir 34 extends at least partially at round the stem 26. In this embodiment
which includes a brush unit 29, the brush unit 29 extends at least partially around the
nozzle 36.
The nozzle 36 for the fluid reservoir 34 and for delivering bursts of working fluid to the
teeth of a user during use of the appliance 10. The tip of the nozzle 36 comprises a fluid
outlet 42 through which a burst of working fluid is delivered to the teeth of the user. The
fluid delivery system 40 is illustrated schematically in Figure 2. In overview, the fluid
delivery system 40 comprises a fluid inlet 44 for receiving working fluid from the fluid
reservoir 34. In this embodiment, the working fluid is a liquid working fluid, which is
preferably water. The fluid delivery system 40 comprises a pump assembly 46 for
drawing working fluid from the fluid reservoir 34 through the fluid inlet 44, and for
delivering a burst of working fluid to the nozzle 36. The pump assembly 46 is located
within the handle 12, and comprises a positive displacement pump 48 and a drive for
driving the pump 48. The drive preferably comprises a motor 50. A battery 52 for
supplying power to the motor 50 is also located in the handle 12. The battery 52 is
                                                  4

preferably a rechargeable battery.
A first conduit 54 connects the fluid inlet 44 of the fluid delivery system 40 to a fluid
inlet 56 of the pump 48. A first one-way valve 58 is located between the fluid inlet 44
and the pump 48 to prevent water from returning to the fluid reservoir 34 from the pump
48. A second conduit 60 connects a fluid outlet 62 of the pump 48 to the nozzle 36. A
second one-way valve 64 is located between the pump 48 and the nozzle 34 to prevent
water from returning to the pump 48. A control circuit 66 controls the actuation of the
motor 50, and so the motor 50 and the control circuit 66 provide a drive for driving the
pump 48. The battery 52 supplies power to the control circuit 66. The control circuit 66
includes a motor controller, which supplies power to the motor 50.
In this embodiment, the control circuit 66 receives signals generated when the user
depresses the buttons 18, 20, 22 located on the handle 12 of the appliance 10.
Alternatively, or additionally, the control circuit 66 may receive signals which are
generated by a sensor located within the appliance, or which are received from a remote
device, such as a display or a personal device. For brevity, in the following description
the control circuit 66 receives signals which are generated when the user operates one of
the buttons 18, 20, 22.
The cleaning tool 14 is detachably connected to the handle 12. With reference to Figures
3 to 5, the handle 12 comprises a male connector, preferably in the form of a spigot 70,
which is received by a complementary female connector, preferably in the form of a
recessed connect 72, of the cleaning tool 14. The recessed connector 72 defines a
generally cylindrical recess 73 for receiving the spigot 70. The spigot 70 preferably
protrudes outwardly from an end surface 74 of the body 16, and preferably in a direction
which is parallel to a longitudinal axis of the handle 12. The end surface 74 defines an
annular seat 76 for receiving an annular bottom wall 78 of the fluid reservoir 34 when the
cleaning tool 14 is mounted on the handle 12. The annular seat 76 comprises the fluid
inlet 44 of the fluid delivery system 40. The fluid inlet 44 receives fluid from a reservoir
fluid outlet port 80 of the fluid reservoir 34 when the cleaning tool 14 is mounted on the
handle 12.
The second conduit 60, which connects the fluid outlet 62 of the pump 48 to the nozzle
36, comprises a handle conduit section located within the handle 12, and a cleaning tool
                                                 5

conduit section located within the cleaning tool 14. The handle conduit section extends
from the fluid outlet 62 of the pump 48 to a handle fluid outlet port 82 located adjacent to
the spigot 70. The cleaning tool conduit section 84 extends from a cleaning tool fluid
inlet port 86 to the nozzle 36. The cleaning tool fluid inlet port 86 protrudes from the base
of the recessed connector 72. The recessed connector 72 is housed within, and connected
to, a relatively wide base section 88 of the stem 26.
As mentioned above, the cleaning tool 14 includes a bristle carrier 30 which is moveable
relative to the stem 26. The appliance 10 comprises a drive mechanism for driving the
movement of the bristle carrier 30 relative to the stem 26. The drive mechanism
comprises a transmission unit connected to the bristle carrier 30, and a drive unit for
driving the transmission unit to move the bristle carrier 30 relative to the stem 26.
The handle 12 comprises the drive unit of the drive mechanism. The drive unit comprises
a motor, preferably in the form of a DC motor, which is actuated by the control circuit 66
in response to the user depression of one or more of the buttons of the handle 12. The
motor of the drive unit is connected via a gear train to a rotatable drive unit coupling
member 90 which protrudes outwardly from the spigot 70, and which rotates relative to
the body 16 upon actuation of the motor of the drive unit.
The cleaning tool 14 comprises the transmission unit of the drive mechanism. The
transmission unit comprises a transmission unit coupling member 92 which couples with,
and preferably receives, the drive unit coupling member 90 when the cleaning tool 14 is
connected to the handle 12. The transmission unit coupling member 92 is connected to,
and is preferably integral with, one end of a connecting rod 94 housed within the stem 26.
The other end of the connecting rod 94 is connected to the side surface of the bristle
carrier 30 so that periodic rotation of the connecting rod 94 about a 15 degree angle
results in a 15 degree sweeping movement of the bristle carrier 30 relative to the stem
26.
The fluid reservoir 34 is mounted on, and extends at least partially around, the stem 26 of
the cleaning tool 14. In this embodiment, the fluid reservoir 34 is annular in shape, and so
surrounds the stem 26. The fluid reservoir 34 is preferably located at or towards the end
of the stem 26 which is remote from the head 28, and so in this embodiment extends
                                                6

around the base section 88 of the stem 26. The fluid reservoir 34 preferably has a
capacity in the range from 55 to 75 ml, and in this embodiment has a capacity of 65 ml.
The fluid reservoir 34 is filled through a reservoir fluid inlet port 100 formed in the
external wall of the fluid reservoir 34. The fluid inlet port 100 is preferably formed in an
annular external side wall 110 of the fluid reservoir 34. The reservoir fluid inlet port 100
is sealed by a closure member 102. The closure member 102 is moveable relative to the
fluid reservoir 34 between a closed position, as shown in Figure 3, in which the closure
member 102 inhibits the leakage of working fluid from the reservoir fluid inlet port 100,
and an open position. In this embodiment, the closure member 102 is pivotably connected
to the fluid reservoir 34. The closure member 102 is locatable within, and form closure
member 102 comprises a head 104 which may be gripped by the user to move the closure
member 102 from the closed position to the open position, and which may be pushed by
the user towards the reservoir fluid inlet port 100 to return the closure member 102 to the
closed position.
The closure member 102 is connected to the fluid reservoir 34 by a pair of arms 106. One
end of each arm 106 is connected to the closure member 102, and the other end of each
arm 106 is connected to the fluid reservoir 34. In this embodiment, the arms 106 are
integral with the closure member 102, with a portion of each arm 106 which is remote
from the closure member 102 being connected to the bottom wall 78 of the fluid reservoir
34, for example using an adhesive or by welding. Each arm 106 comprises a hinge 108,
which may be for thickness, to enable the part of the arm 106 which is connected to the
closure member 102 to pivot relative to the other part of the arm 106 which is connected
to the fluid reservoir 34.
To fill the fluid reservoir 34, the user detaches the cleaning tool 14 from the handle 12, as
explained in more detail below, grips the head 104 of the closure member 102 between
finger and thumb and pulls it out from the reservoir fluid inlet port 100. The fluid
reservoir 34 may then be filled by the user, for example by locating the reservoir fluid
inlet port 100 beneath a running tap. Once the fluid reservoir 34 has been filled, the user
pushes the head 104 of the closure member 102 back into the reservoir fluid inlet port
100, and reconnects the cleaning tool 14 to the handle 12. The pivoting connection
between the closure member 102 and the bottom wall 78 of the fluid reservoir 34 inhibits
                                                  7

accidental loss of the closure member 102 while the reservoir fluid inlet port 100 is
exposed, and enables the joint between the closure member 102 and the fluid reservoir 34
to be located between the handle 12 and the fluid reservoir 34 when the cleaning tool 14
is mounted on the handle 12. As shown in Figure 3, the lower parts of the arms 106 of the
closure member 102 are located within a recessed section of the bottom wall 78 of the
fluid reservoir 34 when the closure member 102 is in its closed position so that the
bottom surfaces of the lower parts of the arms 106 are substantially flush with the bottom
wall 78 of the fluid reservoir 34.
At least part of the external wall 110 of the fluid reservoir 34 is preferably transparent to
allow a user to observe the contents of the fluid reservoir 34, and so assess whether the
fluid reservoir 34 requires replenishment prior to the desired use of the appliance 10. The
external wall 110 preferably has a shape which is symmetrical about the longitudinal axis
of the cleaning tool 14. The external wall 110 preferably has a curved shape, more
preferably a convex curved shape, but alternatively the external wall 110 may have a
polygonal or faceted shape. In this embodiment, the external wall 110 has a spherical
curvature. As described below, the fluid reservoir 34 is mounted on the relatively wide
base section 88 of the stem 26, and so the external wall 110 has opposed circular
apertures which are centered on the longitudinal axis of the cleaning tool 14 to allow the
base section 88 of the stem 26 to pass therethrough.
The fluid reservoir 34 further comprises an inner wall 112 which is connected to the
external wall 110. The inner wall 112 is tubular in shape. The ends of the inner wall 112
are preferably circular in shape, and are connected to the external wall 110 so as to form a
fluid-tight seal between the external wall 110 and the inner wall 112. In this
embodiment, the fluid reservoir 34 is formed from two housing parts. A first housing
part 114 comprises an upper section of the external wall 110 and the inner wall 112, and
so the upper end of the inner wall 112 is integral with an upper section of the external
wall 110. A second housing part 116 comprises a lower section of the external wall 110
and the bottom wall 78 of the fluid reservoir 34.
The fluid reservoir 34 also comprises a diaphragm 118. The diaphragm 118 is tubular in
shape, and surrounds the inner wall 112 of the fluid reservoir 34. The ends 120, 122 of
the diaphragm 118 may be connected to the external wall 110, or to the inner wall 112.
                                                 8

The diaphragm 118 thus has an external surface 124 which faces the external wall 110 of
the fluid reservoir 34, and which defines with the external wall 110 the capacity of the
fluid reservoir 34. As the diaphragm 118 is visible to the user through at least part of the
external wall 110, the external surface 124 of the diaphragm 118 may bear an identifier
for user identification of the cleaning tool 14. For example, the identifier may be a
colored portion of the external surface 124 of the diaphragm 118, or one or more
alphanumeric characters molded or otherwise formed on the external surface 124 of the
diaphragm 118.
Figures 5 and 6(a) illustrates the fluid reservoir 34 when it has been filled with working
fluid. The thickness of the diaphragm 118, and the material from which the diaphragm
118 is formed, are selected so that at least part of the diaphragm 118 is moveable
relative to the external wall 110 in response to a pressure differential which is
established across the diaphragm 118 as working fluid is drawn from the fluid reservoir
34 by the pump 48. In this embodiment, the diaphragm 118 is expandable in response to a
pressure differential which is generated across the surfaces 124, 126 of diaphragm 118 as
working fluid is drawn from the fluid reservoir 34. Figure 6(a) illustrates the diaphragm
118 in a fully contracted configuration, or state, in which the capacity of the fluid
reservoir 34 is maximized.
In this embodiment, the cleaning tool 14 comprises an expansion chamber 128 which is
located adjacent to the inner wall 112. The expansion chamber 128 has a volume which
increases as the volume of the fluid reservoir 34 decreases. In this embodiment, the
expansion chamber 128 is open to the atmosphere to allow atmospheric air to enter the
expansion chamber 128 as the inner wall 112 moves towards the external wall 110 as
working fluid is supplied to the fluid delivery system 100. The expansion chamber 128 is
shown in Figures 6(b) and 6(c), which illustrate the diaphragm 118 in a partially
expanded configuration, and in an almost fully expanded configuration, respectively. The
expansion chamber 128 is delimited by the internal surface 126 of diaphragm 118, and
the external surface 130 of the inner wall 112. One or more apertures or ports 132 are
formed in the inner wall 112 to allow atmospheric air to enter the expansion chamber
128, for example, from an air flow path which extends between the stem 26 and the inner
wall 112, with expansion of the diaphragm 118.
                                                 9

As the diaphragm 118 expands towards its fully expanded configuration, the size and
shape of the diaphragm 118 approaches that of the external wall 110. In other words,
when the diaphragm 118 is in a fully expanded configuration, which occurs when the
fluid reservoir 34 is substantially empty, the size and the shape of the diaphragm 118 are
substantially the same as the size and the shape of the external wall 110 of the fluid
reservoir 34. Thus, the maximum volume of the expansion chamber 128 is preferably
substantially the same as the maximum volume of the fluid reservoir 34.
As mentioned above, the fluid reservoir 34 is mounted on the relatively wide base 10
section 88 of the stem 26. To mount the fluid reservoir 34 on the stem 26, the circular
aperture formed in the first housing part 114 of the fluid reservoir 34 is aligned with the
free end of the base section 88 of the stem 26, and the fluid reservoir 34 is pushed on to
the stem 26. The internal surface of the inner wall 112 of the fluid reservoir 34 bears
against the base section 88 of the stem 26 so that frictional forces therebetween prevent
the fluid reservoir 34 from falling from the stem 26. The movement of the fluid reservoir
34 along the stem 26 is restricted by a flange 140 which extends radially outwardly from
the stem 26, and is located at the upper end of the base section 88 of the stem 26. The
flange 140 is annular in shape, and is arranged to engage an annular planar end portion or
recess 142 of the first housing part 114 of the fluid reservoir 34. When the recess 142 of
the fluid reservoir 34 engages the flange 140 of the stem 26, the fluid reservoir 34 is in
the correct axial position along the stem 26 for the subsequent connection of the reservoir
fluid outlet port 80 to the fluid inlet 44 of the fluid delivery system 40. To facilitate
angular alignment of the fluid reservoir 34 relative to the stem 26, the flange 140 and the
recess 142 may be provided a non-annular shape, for example, a C- shape. Otherwise, the
fluid reservoir 34 may be visually angularly aligned by the user relative to the head 28,
for example so that the head 104 of the closure member 102 is aligned with the nozzle 36.
To mount the cleaning tool 14 on the handle 12, as shown in Figure 7 the spigot 70 of he
handle 12 is aligned with the recess 73 formed in the connector 72 of the cleaning tool
14, and the handle fluid outlet port 82 located adjacent to the spigot 70 is aligned with the
cleaning tool fluid inlet port 86 of the cleaning tool 14. The cleaning tool 14 is then
pushed on to the spigot 70 so that the handle fluid outlet port 82 connects to the cleaning
tool fluid inlet port 86, and so that the fluid reservoir 34 engages an annular seat 76 to
connect the reservoir fluid outlet port 80 to the fluid inlet 44 of the fluid delivery
                                                   10

system 40. The internal surface 150 of the connector 72 of the stem 26 bears against the
external surface of the spigot 70 so that frictional forces therebetween retain the stem 26
on the handle 12. The connector 72 is preferably formed from resilient plastics material
which flexes as the connector 72 is pushed on to the spigot 70 to increase the frictional
forces therebetween. A spring clip 152 may be provided at least partially about the
connector 72 for urging the internal surface 150 of the connector 72 against the spigot 70.
To prevent the cleaning tool 14 from becoming accidentally dislodged from the handle
12, the connector 73 may comprises a detent 154 mounted on an arm 156 which is
hingedly connected to the connector 72. For example, the arm 156 may be integral with
the connector 72, and connected to the remainder of the connector 72 by an elastic hinge.
As the cleaning tool 14 is pushed on to the spigot 70, the detent 154 enters a recess (not
shown) for reference to Figures 3 and 4, to inhibit accidental rotation of the fluid
reservoir 34 relative to the handle 12, the bottom wall 78 of the fluid reservoir 34 may be
provided with a male connector 160 which engages with a female connector 162 disposed
on the annular seat 76 of the handle 12. In this embodiment, the male connector 160 at
least partially surrounds, preferably entirely surrounds, the cleaning tool fluid inlet port
86, and the female connector 162 surrounds the handle fluid outlet port 82. Alternatively,
the fluid reservoir 34 may be provided with a female connector which receives a male
connector located on the handle 12 as the cleaning tool 14 is connected to the handle 12.
To operate the appliance 10, the user presses buttons 18, 20, 22 located on the handle 12.
The user switches on the appliance 10 by depressing button 18, the action of which is
detected by the control circuit 66. The user may select a mode of operation of the
appliance 10 by depressing button 20. For example, through pressing button 20 once, the
control circuit 66 may activate the motor to move the brush unit 29 relative to the handle
12. Pressing that button 20 again may switch off the motor. When the button 22 is
pressed, a burst of water is emitted from the nozzle 36. The control circuit 66 activates
the pump 48 to urge a volume of water from a fluid chamber of the pump 48 to the nozzle
36, and to replenish the fluid chamber through drawing a volume of water from the fluid
reservoir 34.
The various connections between the handle 12, the stem 26 and the fluid reservoir 34
enable the appliance 10 to be readily dismantled by the user, for example to allow
components of the appliance 10 to be replaced, for example due to wear. To replace the
                                                 11

cleaning tool 14, the user grasps the stem 26 or the fluid reservoir 34 with one hand, and
the handle 12 with the other hand, and pulls the cleaning tool 14 away from the handle
12. Under the force applied by the user, the detent 154 moves away from the recess
located on the external surface of the spigot 70 to enable the cleaning tool 14 to be
detached from the handle 12. If required, the user may then detach the fluid reservoir 34
from the stem 26, as shown in Figure 9, by pulling the fluid reservoir 34 from the handle
12.
Alternatively, as shown in Figure 8 the stem 26 may be separately detached from the
handle 12 for replacement. To replace the stem 26, the user grasps the stem 26 with one
hand, and the fluid reservoir 34 and the handle 12 with the other, and pulls the stem 26
away from the handle 12, leaving the fluid reservoir 34 connected to the handle 12.
While the stem 26 is detached from the handle 12, friction forces between the male
connector 160 on the fluid reservoir 34 and the female connector 162 on the handle 12
can retain the fluid reservoir 34 on the handle 12. If required, the fluid reservoir 34 may
be subsequently detached from the handle 12 by pulling the fluid reservoir 34 from the
annular seat 76, thereby fully dismantling the appliance 10, as shown in Figure 9. In the
event that the user wishes to use the brush unit 29 without any fluid ejection from the
appliance 10, the user may simply reinsert the stem 26 on to the spigot 70 without having
previously connected the fluid reservoir 34 to either the handle 12 or the stem 26, as
shown in Figure 10.

intended to limit the present invention. For those skilled in the art, the present invention
can have various changes and modifications. Any changes, equivalent substitutions,
modifications etc. made within the concept and principle of present invention should be
