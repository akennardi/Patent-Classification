                     CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)
[0001]          This application is a continuation of U.S. Application No. 14/400,201 filed
November 10, 2014 entitled "ELECTRO-HYDRAULIC ACTUATED SPRAY GUNS" by
James C. Schroeder, Christopher A. Lins, and Steven R. Kuczenski, which claims benefit of
International Application No. PCT/US2013/040386 filed May 9, 2013, which claims benefit of
Provisional Application No. 61/645,274 filed May 10, 2012, which are incorporated herein.
                                          BACKGROUND
[0002]          The present disclosure relates generally to line striping systems, such as those
used for applying painted stripes to roadways and athletic fields. More particularly, the present
disclosure relates to activation systems for self-propelled line striping systems.
[0003]          Line striping systems typically comprise carts that include a gas-operated engine
that drives a pump. The pump is fed a liquid, such as paint, from a container disposed on the cart
and supplies pressurized fluid to spray nozzles mounted so as to discharge toward the ground.
Conventional line striping systems comprise walk-behind carts that are pushed by the operator,
who simultaneously operates the spray nozzles with levers mounted to a handlebar for the cart.
Such a handlebar typically comprises a fixed pair of handles that are used to orientate swivel
mounted wheels at the front of the cart.      These handlebars require the operator to manually
actuate the spray nozzles to determine the length of each stripe and the interval between stripes,
while physically pushing and turning the entire system.
[0004]          Line striping carts can be pushed by self-propelled trailers that attach to the rear
of the carts, such as at a ball and socket hitch. Each trailer includes a gas-operated engine,
separate from the pumping engine, that drives a hydrostatic propulsion system. An operator sits
on the trailer and grasps the handlebar of the cart. The hydrostatic propulsion system is typically
operated with foot pedals that leave hands of the operator free to manipulate the spray nozzle
levers of the cart.   In order to facilitate application of straight-line stripes, the front swivel
mounted wheels can be locked to promote straight-line movement of the cart. The pivot-point
between the cart and the trailer at the hitch still allows for steering of the system by "wiggling"
                                                   1

the cart relative to the trailer. These systems reduce operator fatigue, but still require operator
judgment in applying the stripes and are bulky and difficult to maneuver.
 [0005]          Conventional line striping systems utilize compressed air to actuate the spray
nozzles.    Spray nozzles that utilize compressed air react slowly to activation.        Thus, a delay
results between the activation and the actual spraying process, which can generate stripes of
varying lengths.      Additionally, generation of compressed air requires powering of an air
compressor that adds weight, cost and complexity to the line striping system.
 [0006]          There is a continuing need to increase the consistency and accuracy of lines
produced by the striping system, while at the same time reducing operator fatigue.
                                               SUMMARY
IN one form, although it need not be the only or indeed the preferred form, the invention relates
to a line striping system comprising:
                 a chassis;
                 a wheel mounted to the chassis;
                 a spray system mounted on the chassis, the spray system comprising:
                         a spray gun having a lever; and
                         a fluid pump that provides pressurized fluid to the spray gun;
                 an electrically controlled actuation system connected to the spray system, the
                         electrically controlled actuation system comprising:
                         an actuator; and
                         a cable connected between the actuator and the lever of the spray gun, so
                                 that activation of the actuator causes the cable to actuate the spray
                                 gun.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[00131          FIG. 1A is a perspective front view of stand-on line striper 10 in which an electro
hydraulic actuation system of the present disclosure is used. FIG. lB is a top plan view of stand
on line striper 10 of FIG. 1A showing steering system 12, chassis 14, engine 16, hydraulic
system 18 and paint system 19. Steering system 12 additionally includes forward and reverse
speed controls. Paint system 19 comprises fluid pump 20, fluid container 21, spray guns 22A
and 22B, actuators 23 (FIG. 2), solenoids 24 (FIG. 2) and controller 25.         Steering system 12
includes handlebar 26, speed bar 28, steering cables 30A and 30B, centering device 32 and
alignment system 34. Steering system 12 is coupled to power wheels 36A and 36B (FIG. 1B)
and steering wheel 38. Hydraulic system 18 includes pump 40, motor 42 (FIG. 2) and reservoir
44 (FIG. 1B). FIGS. 1A and lB are discussed concurrently.
[0014]          Power wheels 36A and 36B and steering wheel 38 are mounted to chassis 14 so as
to support line striper 10 and allow line striper 10 to roll under power from hydraulic system 18.
Power wheels 36A and 36B are coupled to one or more hydraulic motors 42 (FIG. 2) that receive
motive fluid power from pump 40, which is driven by engine 16. Via cable 46, speed bar 28
regulates pump 40 to control fluid flow from reservoir 44 (FIG. 1B) to motors 42 (FIG. 2). As
such, in one embodiment, hydraulic system 18 operates as a hydrostatic propulsion system.
[0015]          Steering wheel 38 is connected to handlebar 26 of steering system 12 via cables
30A and 30B to rotate steering wheel 38 relative to chassis 14. Cables 30A and 30B are pushed
and pulled by rotation of handlebar 26. Centering device 32 pulls steering wheel 38 to center
                                                  3

when handlebar 26 is not subject to rotational force. Alignment system 34 adjusts the position of
centering device 32 so as to allow for tuning of steering system 12, such as may be needed to
accommodate stretching of cables 30A and 30B or wear of wheel 38.
[00161           Engine 16 provides motive power to pump 40 of hydraulic system 18, which
drives both wheels 36A and 36B and paint system 19. Fluid pump 20 receives an unpressurized
fluid, such as paint, from fluid container 21 and provides pressurized fluid to spray guns 22A and
22B.     In one embodiment, fluid pump 20 comprises a hydraulically operated double-acting
piston pump.      Spray guns 22A and 22B are mechanically operated by hydraulic actuators 23
(FIG. 2) that receive pressurized hydraulic fluid from hydraulic system 18. Hydraulic actuators
23 pull cables 48A and 48B to actuate spray guns 22A and 22B. Hydraulic actuators 23 are
powered by solenoids 24 (FIG. 2), which are electronically controlled by controller 25.
Hydraulic actuators 23 and solenoids 24 form part of an electro-hydraulic activation system of
the present disclosure.
[00171           Controller 25 comprises a computer system that is configured to operate spray
guns 22A and 22B via solenoids 24 based on operator inputs. For example, stand-on line striper
10 is configured to apply two parallel stripes of fluid from container 21 using spray guns 22A
and 22B. Controller 25 controls when either or both of spray guns 22A and 22B are operated so
that either one or two stripes are applied. Controller 25 also controls if the stripes are to be
continuous or intermittent.     If the stripes are to be intermittently applied, as specified by the
operator, controller 25 controls the length of each stripe and the interval between stripes by
controlling the length of time each spray gun is actuated. An operator of system 10 activates
spray guns 22A and 22B with push-button 49 via controller 25, after setting desired parameters
(e.g. single stripe, double stripe, stripe length, interval length) at controller 25.
[0018]           FIG. 2 is a schematic view of hydraulic system 18 and paint system 19 of stand
on line striper 10 of FIGS. 1A and 1B interconnected with steering system 12 and actuation
system 52. Hydraulic system 18 and paint system 19 are jointly operated by engine 16. In one
embodiment, engine 16 comprises a gas-operated internal combustion engine.                Engine 16
provides direct mechanical input to pump 40 via a system of belts and pulleys (not shown).
Hydraulic system 18 may, however, include multiple pumps driven by engine 16. For example,
a first hydraulic pump may provide input to motors 42, while a second pump may provide input
to fluid pump 20, with both pumps operating with fluid from reservoir 44.             Pump 40 draws
                                                     4

hydraulic fluid from reservoir 44 and provides pressurized fluid directly to pump 20 and to
motors 42 via valve 50. Pump 40 and pump 20 return hydraulic fluid directly to reservoir 44,
while valve 50 re-circulates fluid to motor 42.
[0019]          In one embodiment, engine 16, pump 40, motors 42, reservoir 44, wheels 36A and
36B and valve 50 comprise a hydrostatic system, as is known in the art. Although only one
motor 42 is shown in FIG. 2, each of power wheels 36A and 36B may be provided with a
dedicated motor served by pump 40. For example, power wheel 36A is connected to motor 42A,
as shown in FIG. 3A. Motors 42 are configured to provide both forward and aft motive power to
wheels 36A and 36B. Specifically, hydraulic system 18 utilizes reversing valve 50 with pump
40, as is known in the art, to reverse the direction of motors 42 by changing the direction of flow
through motors 42.
[0020]          Pump 40 (or another pump within system 18) additionally provides fluid power
directly to fluid pump 20, which receives a fluid from container 21.      Pump 40 pressurizes the
fluid from container 21 and pumps the pressurized fluid to spray guns 22A and 22B. In one
embodiment, pump 20 comprises piston pump, such as the Viscount® 4-Ball piston pump
commercially available from Graco Inc., Minneapolis, MN. Spray guns 22A and 22B are lever
actuated nozzles that are connected to cables 48A and 48B.             Cables 48A and 48B are
mechanically pulled by actuators 23.         Actuators 23 comprise hydraulic cylinders that are
pressurized to displace a piston.     Actuators 23 use high pressure hydraulic fluid bled from
between pumps 40 and 20. For example, inlet hose 53A provides high pressure fluid to actuator
23, while outlet hose 53B returns low pressure fluid to reservoir 44. Actuators 23 are activated
using electric solenoids 24 that are powered and activated by controller 25. Actuators 23 and
electric solenoids 24 comprise an electro-hydraulic actuation system of the present disclosure.
Controller 25 includes push-button 49 (FIGS. 1A and 1B), or some other activation switch, that
sends a signal from controller 25 to solenoids 24 to initiate activation of actuators 23, thus
causing discharge of fluid from spray guns 22A and 22B. As shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, push
button 49 is conveniently located within steering system 12.
[0021]          Steering system 12, which includes handlebar 26 and speed bar 28 (FIGS. 1A and
1B), provides direct mechanical input to valve 50 and steering wheel 38. Specifically, cables
30A and 30B extend from handlebar 26 to steering wheel 38, while cable 46 extends between
speed bar 28 and valve 50 on pump 40.
                                                   5

[00221          Returning to FIGS. 1A and 1B, in order to apply stripes, such as to pavement or
an athletic field, the hydrostatic system is engaged to provide motive force to power wheels 36A
and 36B.     As such, stand-on line striper 10 rolls along the surface to which stripes are to be
applied. With line striper 10 moving, an operator utilizes steering system 12 to control the speed
and direction of line striper 10. Once the operator positions line striper 10 into a place where
painted stripes are to be applied, paint system 19 is activated by controller 25. Steering system
12 allows the operator to control activation of paint system 19, the speed of line striper 10 and
the direction of line striper 10 with easy to use, intuitive controls. Specifically, push-button 49 is
connected to controller 25, which operates solenoids 24 to control actuators 23 and dispense
paint at spray guns 22A and 22B, as is discussed with reference to FIGS. 3A - 5.
[0023]          FIGS. 3A and 3B are perspective rear and front views, respectively, of stand-on
line striper 10 of FIGS. 1A and lB with parts of hydraulic system 18 (FIG. 1A) and paint system
19 (FIG. 1A) removed to show electro-hydraulic actuation system 52.             Actuation system 52
includes manifold 54, bracket 56, solenoids 57 and actuators 58. FIGS. 3A and 3B are discussed
concurrently.
[0024]          Chassis 14 provides a frame upon which the various systems of line striper 10 and
wheels 36A, 36B and 38 are mounted. In the embodiment shown, chassis 14 is fabricated from
rectangular tubing bent into a rectilinear shape.        Power wheels 36A and 36B are mounted
proximate an aft end of chassis 14.        In one embodiment, power wheels 36A and 36B are
mounted directly onto shafts from motors 42 (FIG. 2). For example, power wheel 36A can be
mounted onto a shaft from motor 42A, as shown in FIG. 3A. In other embodiments, power
wheels 36A and 36B can be mounted onto spindles extending from chassis 14 and connected to
motors 42 via gear systems.
[0025]          Handlebar 26 and speed bar 28 are mounted on post 62, which is connected to
chassis 14 through frame 64. Frame 64 provides a structure for mounting platform 60 (FIG. IB)
upon which an operator of line striper 10 may stand. In one embodiment, post 62 extends
telescopically from stud 67 connected to frame 64 such that the height of handlebar 26 relative to
platform 60 can be adjusted. Thus, an operator is positioned above power wheels 36A and 36B
behind post 62, in position to grasp handlebar 26.
[0026]          Post 62 provides pivot point 63 for handlebar 26. Pivot point 63 extends along
axis Al, which extends generally perpendicularly to both the plane of chassis 14 and axis A2
                                                   6

along which power wheels 36A and 36B rotate.          An operator of line striper 10 can rotate
handlebar 26 about axis Al to control the position of steering wheel 38 via cables 30A and 30B.
Speed bar 28 is connected to handle bar 26 at pivot point 66. Pivot point 66 extends along axis
A3, which extends generally parallel to the plane of chassis 14 and perpendicular to axis A2.
Cable 46 extends from speed bar 28 to valve 50 that controls output of hydraulic pump 40 to
hydraulic motors 42 (FIG. 2). Rotation of speed bar 28 in opposite directions causes forward or
reverse movement of line striper 10. For example, rotation of speed bar 28 about axis A3 in a
counter-clockwise direction from center (as depicted) causes valve 50 to route hydraulic fluid
through motors 42 in a direction that causes forward movement of line striper 10, while rotation
of speed bar 28 about axis A3 in a clockwise direction from center (as depicted) causes valve 50
to route hydraulic fluid through motors 42 in a direction that causes rearward movement of line
striper 10.
[00271          Handlebar 26 additionally provides a convenient location for mounting push
button 49. Push-button 49 is electrically coupled to controller 25 (FIGS. lB & 2) to operate
paint system 19 (FIG. 1A), including pump 20 and spray guns 22A and 22B. Push-button 49 is
located so that an operator of striper 10 need not remove his or her hands from handlebar 26 in
order to initiate operation of paint system 19. In particular, an operator can set parameters of
paint system 19 in controller 25 and subsequently, while driving striper 10 in a desired location,
operate spray guns 22A and 22B (FIG. 1A) with push-button 49. Actuation system 52 provides
rapid, on-off actuation of spray guns 22A and 22B using actuators 58 and solenoids 57.
Actuators 58 are hydraulically driven by hydraulic system 18 and solenoids 57 are electrically
controlled to operate actuators 58 via controller 25. Actuators 58 and solenoids 57 are mounted
to frame 64 using manifold 54 and bracket 56, as are discussed in greater detail with reference to
FIGS. 4A - 5.
[0028]          FIGS. 4A and 4B are perspective and exploded views, respectively, of electro
hydraulic actuation system 52 of FIGS. 3A and 3B showing manifold 54, bracket 56, solenoids
57A and 57B and actuators 58A and 58B. Actuation system 52 also includes cables 48A and
48B, inlet hose 53A, outlet hose 53B, couplers 70A and 70B and cable conduits 72A and 72B.
FIGS. 4A and 4B are discussed concurrently.
[0029]          Manifold 54 is mounted to frame 64 (FIG. 3A) of striper 10 (FIG. 1A) in a
position conveniently accessible to hydraulic system 18 and paint system 19.        Bracket 56 is
                                                 7

connected to manifold 54 using fasteners 73. Hoses 53A and 53B are coupled to hydraulic fluid
lines connecting hydraulic fluid pump 40 and paint pump 20. Inlet hose 53A connects to a high
pressure, feed line, and outlet hose 53B connects to a low pressure, return line. Solenoids 57A
and 57B are coupled to manifold 54 to interact with hydraulic fluid passing between inlet hose
53A and outlet hose 53B. Likewise, actuators 58A and 58B are coupled to manifold 54 so that
pistons 74A and 74B (FIG. 4B) interact with the hydraulic fluid.
[0030]           Couplers 70A and 70B are connected to pistons 74A and 74B and include
multiple studs that enable each of pistons 74A and 74B to be connected to multiple linkages for
actuating multiple paint guns. For example, coupler 70A is joined to piston 74A with fastener
75A, and includes studs 76A and 76B. Eye socket 78A is slipped over stud 76B and clip 80B
secures eye socket 78A to coupler 70A. Eye socket 78A is connected to an extension cable that
extends through an opening in bracket 56 to pass through cable conduit 72A. Cable 48A links
directly to spray gun 22A (FIG. 1A). Cable conduit 72A includes a threaded stud that permits
axial adjustment in its length, thereby altering the tension and slack in cable 48A. A second eye
socket and cable assembly can be connected to stud 76A and an additional spray gun such that
piston 74A can simultaneously actuate two spray guns.           Clips 80A and 80B allow quick
conversion between single and double spray gun operation. Using all the studs of couplers 70A
and 70B, actuation system 52 can actuate up to four spray guns.
[0031]           Pistons 74A and 74B slide in and out of manifold 54 via hydraulic fluid pressure.
Boots 81A and 81B are positioned over pistons 74A and 74B to provide protection from dust,
dirt, debris, etc. Pistons 74A and 74B include lands that react with pressurized hydraulic fluid to
alternatively drive pistons 74A and 74B up or down, based on the position of solenoids 57A and
57B. For example, with solenoid 57A not activated, a plunger is positioned within manifold 54
so that high pressure hydraulic fluid from inlet hose 53A is routed to a first end of piston 74A
and piston 74A is pushed downward (with reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B) so as to not displace
cable 48A. When solenoid 57A is activated, a plunger is repositioned within manifold 54 to
route high pressure hydraulic fluid from inlet hose 53A to a second end of piston 74A so that
piston 74A is pushed upward (with reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B) so as to apply tension to cable
48A, thereby actuating spray gun 22A. Hydraulic fluid continues to run through manifold 54 so
long as pump 40 (FIG. 2) is running and is returned to reservoir via outlet hose 53B. Cable
                                                   8

conduits 72A and 72B can be adjusted to provide the proper amount of pre-tension in cables 48A
and 48B so that actuation system 52 provides rapid activation of spray guns 22A and 22B.
[0032]          FIG. 5 is an exploded view of actuation system 52 of FIG. 4B showing hydraulic
actuator 58A and electric solenoid 57A exploded from manifold 54. Hydraulic actuator 58B and
electric solenoid 57B (FIGS. 4A & 4B) are not shown in FIG. 5 for clarity.            Solenoid 57A
includes coil 82A, housing 83A and spool valve 84A. Hydraulic actuator 58A includes piston
74A, housing 86A, land 88A and land 90A.
[0033]          Housing 83A of solenoid 57A is threaded into socket 92A in manifold 54 so as to
intersect fluid pathways (not shown) between inlet hose 53A and outlet hose 53B. Housing 83A
includes various bores that permit hydraulic fluid to pass through housing 83A. Spool valve 84A
is inserted into housing 83A and coil 82A is positioned around spool valve 84A. Coil 82A is
electrically activated, such as by connection to controller 25 (FIG. 2) by an electrical connection
at socket 94A, to displace spool valve 84A, as is known in the art. Spool valve 84A thus moves
to cover and uncover various bores in housing 83A. As spool valve 84A moves, piston 74A of
actuator 58A is displaced via flow of hydraulic fluid through manifold 54.
[0034]          Housing 86A of actuator 58A is threaded into a socket (not shown) in manifold
54. Piston 74A extends though housing 86A so as to intersect fluid pathways inside manifold 54
at first end 96.   Second end 98 of piston 74A extends out of manifold 54 so as to facilitate
connection to coupler 70A (FIG. 4B). Land 88A prevents hydraulic fluid from passing out of
housing 86A. Piston 74A is, however, free to move within housing 86A.
[0035]          For the described embodiment, when spool valve 84A is in a down position (fully
inserted into manifold 54), high pressure hydraulic fluid is directed to first end 96 at land 90A to
force piston 74A down via passage of the hydraulic fluid through appropriate bores in housing
83A. Thus, cable 48A (FIG. 4B) remains sufficiently slack to not activate spray gun 22A (FIG.
1A). Solenoid 57A may include a spring to bias spool valve 84A to down position, for example,
in an un-activated state. When an appropriate electrical signal is provided to socket 94A, coil
82A is activated to move spool valve 84A in housing 83A, uncovering different bores in housing
83A.    Thus, when spool valve 84A is in an up position (withdrawn from manifold 54), high
pressure hydraulic fluid is directed to the underside of land 88A to force piston 74A up via
passage of the hydraulic fluid through appropriate bores in housing 83A. Thus, cable 48A is put
                                                 9

into tension and displaced to mechanically trip a lever controlling flow of fluid through a valve
in spray gun 22A.
[0036]         High pressure hydraulic fluid is directed to piston 74A for both activated and un
activated states of solenoid 57A.      Actuation system 52 does not rely on a pressure drop in
manifold 54 to stop dispensing at spray gun 22A. Instead, actuation system 52 actively moves
piston 74A in both directions. Thus, piston 74A rapidly responds to both states, which leads to
precise and accurate control of the striping process by controller 25. Controller 25 and actuation
system 52 additionally increase the precision and accuracy of the striping process by automating
the activation process, which is manually controlled in conventional, prior art systems.
Furthermore, actuation system 52 is incorporated into a hydraulic system within the line striping
system, thereby reducing the need for additional, dedicated components for the paint system,
such as an air compressor.       Push-button 49 (FIG. 1A) provides a user-friendly means of
commanding controller 25 when to activate solenoids 57A and 57B to commence painting
operations.
