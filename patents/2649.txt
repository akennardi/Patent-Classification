                                 Arrangement for parking a trailer
             Area of technology: an invention relates to an arrangement to save working time,
   especially when parking a trailer.
                                         Background of the technology
 5           E-commerce has become very popular and consumers order huge amounts of
   products packed into parcels. In a click & collect service the parcels are collectable in
   automated parcel lockers (also known as a packet automaton). A conventional packet
   automaton includes fixed lockers and thus an employee of a logistics company needs to
   open a closure (a locker door) to place a parcel into the locker and filling of lockers may
10 take a lot of time. F120165669 and W0<removed-apn> describe a movable packet automaton,
   which is termed a delivery trailer. The delivery trailer comprises a trunk for carts or frames
   filled with parcels or other products. When the carts or frames are moved inside the trunk
   the delivery trailer is ready to be transported with a road vehicle to a delivery site.
             The following prior art documents provide solutions for coupling a trailer to a
15 road vehicle.
             US<removed-apn> describes a drawbar for a trailer, comprising a half-spherical
   receiving socket with an opening for receiving a coupling ball, and a drawbar carrier for
   connecting the receiving socket to the trailer. By using the drawbar the trailer and a tractor
   (a road vehicle) can be rapidly separated, for example, in case of fire.
20           US2015306928 describes a system for operating alarm features of a trailer towed
   by a tractor in the event of unintended decoupling of the trailer from the tractor. The
   system may include a breakaway switch or its functional equivalent, a flasher, and a source
   of emergency power such as a battery.
             US7926832 describes a trailer coupler for connecting a trailer to a ball hitch
25 mounted on a towing vehicle, wherein the towing vehicle comprises an alarm system for
   indicating coupling and decoupling, and a mechanical means to assist an operator (a driver)
   to remotely attach and remove safety chains.
             A problem to be solved is a "last mile problem" concerning, for example, delivery
   of parcels. One part of the last mile problem is parking of a trailer that is used in the
30 delivery of parcels.

                                                    2
                                          Summary of the invention
              An aspect of the present invention is to fasten parking of a trailer. Another aspect
   is that a driver of a road vehicle can park the trailer without leaving the cockpit. Another
   aspect is omitting tasks which are unnecessary when parking the trailer.
 5           One unnecessary task is decoupling the trailer from the road vehicle power
   system. The decoupling is avoided by using an accumulator and an independent power
   system in the trailer. Then no wire is needed between the trailer and the road vehicle.
             Another unnecessary task relates to a safety wire rope between the trailer and the
   road vehicle. If the trailer unintentionally decouples from the road vehicle, the safety wire
10 rope triggers trailer breaks for stopping the trailer. Use of the safety wire rope can be
   avoided by an arrangement that detects electrically the decoupling.
             The invention concerns an arrangement for parking a trailer, the trailer comprising
             a coupling part for coupling trailer to a road vehicle,
             a lock to secure the coupling for transport, and
15           a trailer leg between the coupling part and trailer wheels such that the trailer leg
   stabilizes the trailer after decoupling from the road vehicle,
             the arrangement comprising at least
             a lock opener for opening the lock affecting the coupling part,
             a leg actuator for moving the trailer leg such that the coupling part detaches from
20 the road vehicle,
             an electrical system independent from the road vehicle,
             a receiver for receiving a decoupling command, and
             a control unit comprising a processor and a memory, and the control unit is
   configured to a) receive the decoupling command through the receiver and b) command
25 the lock opener to open the lock and c) command the leg actuator to detach the trailer from
   the road vehicle.

             For a more complete understanding of examples and embodiments of the present
   invention, reference is now made to the following descriptions taken in connection with the

15                                   Detailed description of the invention
             It is appreciated that the following embodiments are exemplary. Although the
   specification may refer to "one" embodiment, the reference is not necessarily made to the
   same embodiment(s), or the feature in question may apply to multiple embodiments.
             FIGURE 1A shows an arrangement for parking a trailer 100. Trailer 100
20 comprises a coupling part 101 for coupling trailer 100 to a road vehicle 102 and a lock 103
   to secure the coupling for transport, i.e. when transporting trailer 100 to a delivery site.
   Trailer 100 further comprises and a trailer leg 104 between coupling part 101 and trailer
   wheels 105 such that trailer leg 104 stabilizes trailer 100 after decoupling trailer 100 from
   road vehicle 102. In FIG. 1 road vehicle 102 is transporting trailer 100 and thus trailer leg
25  104 is not in use.

                                                    4
             The arrangement comprises a lock opener 106 for opening lock 103 affecting
   coupling part 101 and a leg actuator 107 for moving trailer leg 104 such that coupling part
   101 detaches from road vehicle 102. The arrangement further comprises an electrical
   system 108 (such as an accumulator) independent from road vehicle 102, a receiver 109 for
 5 receiving a decoupling command (from road vehicle 102), and a control unit 110
   comprising a processor and a memory. Control unit 110 is configured to receive the
   decoupling command through receiver 109 and command lock opener 106 to open lock
   103 and command leg actuator 107 to detach trailer 100 from road vehicle 102.
             FIGURE 1B shows an arrangement when trailer 100 is parked. Leg actuator 107
10 has moved trailer leg 104 such that it has lengthened and due to the lengthening of trailer
   leg 104, trailer 100 is tilted. In this example coupling part 101 is a trailer tongue 112
   attached to a trailer pole 111 and a counterpart 113 of coupling part 101 is a ball hitch 114.
   When trailer 100 is parked trailer lights 115 are turned off
             In one embodiment road vehicle 102 includes a camera for providing a rear view
15 for the road vehicle driver when he/she aims to reverse road vehicle 102 such that ball
   hitch 114 is located in the proximity of coupling part 101. Then road vehicle driver need to
   horizontally move coupling part 101, for example, 10-20 cm to couple trailer 100 to ball
   hitch 114 of road vehicle 102.
             In one embodiment road vehicle 102 is an autonomous car (also known as a
20 driverless car, a self-driving car, or a robotic car). Road vehicle 102 should have
   counterpart 113 for coupling part 101 but otherwise trailer 100 is basically independent
   from features of road vehicle 102.
             FIGURE 2 shows in two views 201, 202 another example of trailer 100 and road
   vehicle 102, where road vehicle 102 is a truck and trailer 100 is a semitrailer 203.
25           In the first view 201, trailer 100 is coupled to road vehicle 102. In response to a
   decoupling command received from a road vehicle driver through receiver 109, control
   unit 110 has commanded lock opener 106 to open lock 103 affecting coupling part 101.
   Coupling part 101 is located at a front part 204 of semitrailer 203. Leg actuator 107
   comprises a hydraulic pump and a hydraulic cylinder. In the first view 201 leg actuator 107
30 is almost parallel to the bottom of semitrailer 203.

                                                  5
             In the second view 202, semitrailer 203 is decoupled from road vehicle 102 such
   that control unit 110 has commanded, in response to a decoupling command, leg actuator
   107 to move trailer leg 104. Due to the control unit command the hydraulic pump has
   pumped oil into the hydraulic cylinder which has pushed trailer leg 104 towards the ground
 5 and thus lifted trailer 100 upwards from the ground.
             FIGURE 3 shows coupling part 101 comprising a body 301, trailer tongue 112
   attachable to ball hitch 114, a lock 103, and a coupling switch 302 for detecting unintended
   decoupling of trailer 100. Ball hitch 114 is mounted to road vehicle 102 (not shown) and
   coupling part 101 is mounted to trailer pole 111.
10           Body 301 of coupling part 101 comprises a handle 303, by which a road vehicle
   driver can guide coupling part 101, and a lift switch 304 which is in this example a push
   button. Lift switch 304 is a button type of switch and it affects leg actuator 107 such that
   leg actuator 107 lifts coupling part 101 upwards from the ground when lift switch 304 is in
   ON position, i.e. pressed in. When pressing of lift switch 304 stops, lift switch 304 returns
15 to OFF position and leg actuator 107 lowers coupling part 101 towards the ground.
             Coupling switch 302 is intended for replacing a safety wire rope or a safety chain.
   In one embodiment coupling switch 302 comprises a press button 305 made of steel and a
   spring 306 that aims to move coupling switch 302 to OFF position. Coupling switch 302 is
   installed inside trailer tongue 112 such that ball hitch 114 can touch it. When ball hitch 114
20 is coupled to trailer tongue 112, ball hitch 114 presses coupling switch 302 and keeps it in
   ON position. If trailer tongue 112 decouples (due to an accident) from ball hitch 114,
   spring 306 moves coupling switch 302 to OFF position and control unit 110 detects the
   decoupling of trailer 100.
             Lock 103 for ball hitch 114 comprises a locking plate 307 (marked with a dot
25 line) and a spring 308 pushing locking plate 307 towards ball hitch 114. Locking plate 307
   is located between a fixed plate 309 and a fixed bottom part of body 301 of coupling part
   101 (fixed plate 309 is marked with a dot line).
             FIGURE 4 shows the plates and other parts of lock 103 in an explosion figure.
   Lock 103 comprises locking plate 307, spring 308, three other springs, fixed plate 309, and
30 a pin 401 for holding locking plate 307 in position.

                                                   6
             Fixed plate 309 and locking plate 307 include apertures 402, 403 and fixed plate
   309 includes a ball aperture 404. Locking plate 307 locks ball hitch 114 when ball hitch
   114 is pushed through ball aperture 404 and pin 401 is pushed through apertures 402, 403.
   Locking plate 307 is retractable and it operates in communication with a spring assembly
 5 405. Spring assembly 405 comprises spring 308 and the three other springs attached
   permanently to locking plate 307. When lowering trailer tongue 112 ball hitch 114 touches
   locking plate 307 and thus compresses spring assembly 405. After the widest portion of
   ball hitch 114 has passed locking plate 307, spring assembly 405 pushes locking plate 37
   against the narrowest portion of ball hitch 114 and then pin 401 is possible to push through
10 apertures 402, 403 to lock ball hitch 114.
             An electric lock can be used for controlling movements of pin 401. It is generally
   known that the electric lock may use a magnet, an electromagnet, a solenoid, or a motor to
   actuate pin 401. In one implementation the electric lock comprises a spring 406, which
   aims to push pin 401 through apertures 402, 403, and an electromagnet for repelling pin
15 401 towards spring 406. In more detail, when electric current is lead to the electromagnet,
   it releases locking plate 307 by repelling pin 401 out of aperture 403. The electromagnet is
   therefore an example of lock opener 106.
             FIGURE 5 shows a trailer leg 104 with a wheel 501. In this example trailer leg
   104 is a part of an electric A-frame jack. The electric A-frame jack comprises a fixed part
20 502 attached to trailer pole 111, trailer leg 104 that can be slid inside fixed part 502, and an
   electric motor for moving trailer leg 104 and wheel 501 attached to trailer leg 104. In FIG.
   the electric motor operates as leg actuator 107 and it has moved trailer leg 104 outwards
   from fixed part 502 and wheel 501 touches the ground.
             In one embodiment trailer leg 104 with wheel 501 is an electric scissor jack.
25           FIGURE 6A shows trailer 100 that can be used as a movable locker system 600.
   Trailer 100 comprises a trailer body 601 with wheels 105, trailer lights 115, trailer pole
   111, and coupling part 101. Coupling part 101 comprises a lock 103 for ball hitch 114,
   coupling switch 302 for detecting unintended decoupling of trailer 100, and handle 303 for
   a road vehicle driver. Trailer leg 104 is attached to trailer pole 111 and it includes wheel
30 501, and it can be guided by control unit 110.

                                                   7
             Trailer 100 comprises a motion sensor 602 which is an option in the innovative
   arrangement. Motion sensor 602 detects whether trailer 100 is moving and if trailer 100 is
   moving, motion sensor 602 (or a signal sent by it) prevents decoupling of trailer 100.
   Operation of an electronic motion detector may be based on, for example, an optical, a
 5 microwave, or an acoustic detection. In one embodiment motion sensor 602 is an optical
   sensor that is attached to trailer pole 111 and directed towards the ground.
             Trailer 100 further comprises a hut 603 on trailer body 601. In this example hut
   603 has a roof plate 604, a front plate 605, pair 606 of doors for loading trailer 100, and a
   tarp 607 on the both sides of hut 603. An upper edge of tarp 607 is attached with rollers to
10 a curtail rail 608, one side edge of tarp 607 is permanently attached to front plate 605, and
   the opposite side of tarp 607 is attached with (three) rubber bands 609 to hut 603. Rear
   jacks 610 are useful, especially when loading trailer 100. In this example rear jacks 610 are
   manual (alternatively, they could be automated). For example, a tablet with a WiFi modem
   can be used as a platform for a trailer control application by which a road vehicle can give
15 a decoupling command to decouple trailer 100 from the road vehicle. Then also trailer 100
   includes a WiFi modem for wireless communication between the trailer control application
   and control unit 110 of trailer 100.
             FIG. 6A shows trailer 100 decoupled from a road vehicle and parked at a delivery
   site. In more detail, control unit 110 has received OFF signal from coupling switch 302
20 when trailer 100 detached from the road vehicle and after that control unit 110 has waited a
   predetermined time period (for example, ten seconds) and then trailer 100 is positioned by
   using trailer leg 104 such that trailer pole 111 is parallel with the ground.
             FIGURE 6B shows movable locker system 600 in use. In other words, trailer 100
   is parked and customers can collect their parcels from it.
25           In FIG. 6B the road vehicle driver has set rear jacks 610 against the ground and
   locked them to prevent unwanted tilting of trailer 100. The road vehicle driver has also
   drawn tarp 607 against front plate 605 on the both sides of hut 603 to uncover openable
   closures 611 of movable locker system 600. A locker door is a typical example of an
   openable closure. When a customer has input via a user interface 612 a correct access code
30 for a locker, the locker door opens.

                                                    8
             Movable locker system 600 comprises lockers, a delivery time window for parcels
   to be delivered, a locker frame inside hut 603, and openable closures 611 such that the
   locker frame includes at least some of the lockers. The locker frame is movable on its
   wheels or by an automated guided vehicle (AGV). During loading of trailer 100 pair 606 of
 5 doors is opened to move at least one locker frame inside hut 603. Movable locker system
   600 is described in detail in W0<removed-apn>.
             Hut 603 comprises a lower edge 613 and a vertical edge 614 such that lower edge
   613, vertical edge 614, and curtail rail 608 are located at the same distance from a plane
   defined by openable closures 611 (the distance is, for example, 5-10 cm). Hut 603 further
10 comprises an L list 615 such that L list 615 covers a gap between the upper edge of tarp
   607 and curtail rail 608. L list 615 and tarp 607, and the other structures of hut 603 can
   protect (without gaps) movable locker system 600 from rain, snow, ice, dust, and dirt when
   tarp 607 covers openable closures 611 (as shown in FIG. 6A).
             Movable locker system 600 and trailer 100 can be used so that a taxi or some
15 other car transports trailer 100 (at night) to a postal sortation hub to be filled there (in few
   minutes using AGVs) and the same taxi or car then returns trailer 100 to the delivery site.
             FIGURE 7 shows a state transition diagram for control unit 110. The state
   transition diagram determines the operation of control unit 110 in the innovative
   arrangement and the operation of control unit 110 is explained in connection with the
20 previous figures. The state transition diagram illustrates, for example, in which manner the
   above-mentioned decoupling command, referred here 700, affects trailer 100.
             Control unit 110 has three states: a loading state 701, a transport state 702, and a
   delivery state 703. In loading state 701 trailer 100 is parked for loading, in transport state
   702 trailer 100 is in traffic (and coupled to a road vehicle), and in delivery state 703 trailer
25  100 is parked for delivery, i.e. it serves customers.
             Transitions are marked with arrows. Some of the transitions happen within one
   state and some other transitions happen between two states. Each of the transitions requires
   one or more commands and/or signals. The commands are originated outside of trailer 100
   and the signals are received from trailer 100. In more detail, the signals are received from
30 coupling switch 302, lift switch 304, or motion sensor 602.

                                                     9
              In FIG. 7 the commands are abbreviated 'c.' and the signals are abbreviated 's.'.
              The commands are: a decelerate command 704, a loading command 705, a
   transport command 706, and a delivery command 707. Loading command 705 and delivery
   command 707 both represent decoupling command 700, because trailer 100 is decoupled
 5 from road vehicle 102 for the loading as well as for the delivery. In one embodiment
   pressing of a brake pedal of road vehicle 102 causes decelerate command 704 with value
   1,2,3,...,10 such that value I means a very light braking, and value 10 means very strong
   braking. The rest of the commands (705, 706, and 707) have only one value and they are
   originated, for example, from a tablet used by a driver of road vehicle 102.
10            The signals are: a lift signal 708, a coupling signal 709, and a motion signal 710.
   Each of the signals has either ON value or OFF value. Lift signal 708 is originated from lift
   switch 304, coupling signal 709 is originated from coupling switch 302, and motion signal
   710 is originated from motion sensor 602.
              In loading state 701 control unit 110 is configured to receive lift signal 708. If lift
15 signal 708 has ON value, control unit 110 commands leg actuator 107 to move trailer leg
   104 towards the ground. If lift signal 708 has OFF value, control unit 110 commands leg
   actuator 107 to move trailer leg 104 outwards from the ground until trailer leg 104 has
   reached its highest position in relation to the ground.
              In loading state 701 control unit 110 is further configured to receive transport
20 command 706 and coupling signal 709 with ON value. To avoid misuse of trailer 100
   coupling signal 709 has no effect, if control unit 110 hasn't before it received transport
   command 706. When control unit 110 has received transport command 706 and coupling
   signal 709 with ON value, control unit 110 moves to transport state 702. In transport state
   702, for example, trailer lights 115 are turned on.
25            In transport state 702 control unit 110 is configured to receive decelerate
   command 704. In response to decelerate command 704 control unit 110 is configured to
   command the breaks of trailer 100 to decelerate the velocity of trailer 100.

            In transport state 702 control unit 110 is further configured to receive coupling
   signal 709 with OFF value. Coupling signal 709 with OFF value indicates in transport state
   702 that an accident has happened. Then control unit 110 commands, for example, the
   breaks of trailer 100 to decelerate the velocity.
 5          In transport state 702 control unit 110 is further configured to receive delivery
   command 707 and motion signal 710 with OFF value, and coupling signal 709 with OFF
   value. In response to delivery command 707 and motion signal 710 (with OFF value), and
   coupling signal 709 (with OFF value), control unit 110 is configured to command lock
   opener 106 to open lock 103 and command leg actuator 107 to detach trailer 100 from
10 road vehicle 102. In delivery state 703, for example, trailer lights 115 are turned off and
   movable locker system 600 is activated for customers.
            In transport state 702 control unit 110 is further configured to receive loading
   command 705 and motion signal 710 with OFF value, and coupling signal 709 with OFF
   value. In response to loading command 705 and motion signal 710 (with OFF value), and
15 coupling signal 709 (with OFF value), control unit 110 is configured to command lock
   opener 106 to open lock 103 and command leg actuator 107 to detach trailer 100 from
   road vehicle 102. In loading state 701, for example, trailer lights 115 are turned off.
   Loading state 701 is appropriate for recharging electrical system 108, for example, by
   recharging an accumulator included in trailer 100.
20          In delivery state 703 control unit 110 is configured to receive transport command
   706 before lift signal 708. The operation is otherwise the same as in the loading state 701
   (described in the above).
            In delivery state 703 control unit 110 is further configured to receive transport
   command 706 and coupling signal 709 with ON value. The operation is the same as in the
25 loading state 701 (described in the above).
             While the present invention has been described in connection with a number of
   exemplary embodiments, and implementations, the present invention is not so limited, but
   rather covers various modifications, and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the
   purview of prospective claims.
