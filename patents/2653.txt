                          BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]      Set gypsum (i.e., calcium sulfate dihydrate) is a well-known material that is
used in many products, including panels and other products for building construction
and remodeling. One such panel (often referred to as gypsum board) is in the form
of a set gypsum core sandwiched between two cover sheets (e.g., paper-faced
board) and is commonly used in drywall construction of interior walls and ceilings of
buildings. One or more dense layers, often referred to as "skim coats" may be
included on either side of the core, usually at the paper-core interface.
[0003]      During manufacture of the board, stucco (i.e., calcined gypsum in the form
of calcium sulfate hemihydrate and/or calcium sulfate anhydrite), water, and other
ingredients as appropriate are mixed, typically in a pin mixer as the term is used in
the art. A slurry is formed and discharged from the mixer onto a moving conveyor
carrying a cover sheet with one of the skim coats (if present) already applied (often
upstream of the mixer). The slurry is spread over the paper (with skim coat
optionally included on the paper). Another cover sheet, with or without skim coat, is
applied onto the slurry to form the sandwich structure of desired thickness with the
aid of, e.g., a forming plate or the like. The mixture is cast and allowed to harden to
form set (i.e., rehydrated) gypsum by reaction of the calcined gypsum with water to
form a matrix of crystalline hydrated gypsum (i.e., calcium sulfate dihydrate). It is the
desired hydration of the calcined gypsum that enables the formation of the

                                                2
interlocking matrix of set gypsum crystals, thereby imparting strength to the gypsum
structure in the product. Heat is required (e.g., in a kiln) to drive off the remaining
free (i.e., unreacted) water to yield a dry product.
[0004]      The excess water that is driven off represents an inefficiency in the
system. Energy input is required to remove the water, and the manufacturing
process is slowed to accommodate the drying step. However, reducing the amount
of water in the system has proven to be very difficult without compromising other
critical aspects of commercial product, including board weight and strength.
[0005]       It will be appreciated that this background description has been created by
the inventors to aid the reader, and is not to be taken as a reference to prior art nor
as an indication that any of the indicated problems were themselves appreciated in
the art. While the described principles can, in some regards and embodiments,
alleviate the problems inherent in other systems, it will be appreciated that the scope
of the protected innovation is defined by the attached claims, and not by the ability of
the claimed invention to solve any specific problem noted herein.
                           BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]       In one aspect, the present invention provides board comprising set
gypsum core. The core can comprise an interlocking crystal matrix of the gypsum.
The board can be disposed between two cover sheets (e.g., formed from paper).
The set gypsum core is formed from a slurry comprising water, stucco, and at least
one pregelatinized starch characterized as having a "mid-range" viscosity (i.e.,
having a viscosity from about 20 centipoise to about 700 centipoise) when the starch
is subjected to conditions according to the VMA method, as set forth in Example 1
below, with the starch in water in an amount of 15% by weight of the total weight of
the starch and water. Thus, the VMA method is used to determine whether the
starch exhibits the mid-range viscosity characteristic when subjected to the
conditions of the VMA method. This does not mean that the starch must be added to
the gypsum slurry under these conditions. Rather, when adding the starch to the
slurry, it can be in wet (in various concentrations of starch in the water) or dry forms,
and it need not be fully gelatinized or otherwise under the conditions set forth in the
VMA method, in accordance with embodiments of the invention. As used herein,
"pregelatinized" means any degree of gelatinization.

                                              3
[0007]       In another aspect, the present invention provides slurry comprising water,
stucco, and at least one pregelatinized starch having the mid-range viscosity from
about 20 centipoise to about 700 centipoise wherein the viscosity is measured
according to the VMA method. The slurry is sometimes referred to as "gypsum
slurry" since gypsum forms therein as water reacts with stucco. As the stucco in the
slurry reacts with water, gypsum, i.e., calcium sulfate dihydrate, starts to form. The
slurry can be used to make board as well as other gypsum products.
[0008]       In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of making
board. Water, stucco, and at least one pregelatinized starch characterized by mid
range viscosity according to the VMA method are mixed to form a slurry. The starch
can be added in wet or dry form. The pregelatinized starch need not be fully
gelatinized when added to the slurry and need not be under the conditions set forth
in the VMA method. The slurry is disposed between a first cover sheet and a second
cover sheet to form a wet assembly that is a panel precursor. In this respect, as
used herein "disposed between" will be understood to mean that skim coat can be
optionally applied or included between the core and one or both cover sheets such
that it will be understood that a cover sheet can include skim coat. The panel is cut
to form a board. The board is dried. After drying, final dimensioning (e.g., cutting)
and processing can take place, as desired. The starch can be chemically modified
(in any order relative to a pregelatinization step) in accordance with some
embodiments prior to inclusion in the slurry. In some embodiments, the
pregelatinized starch is partially gelatinized when added to the slurry, with the
remaining gelatinization taking place in the drying step (e.g., in a kiln). The starch
becomes fully gelatinized in the kiln in some embodiments.
[0009]       In another aspect, joint compound comprises calcium carbonate and at
least one pregelatinized starch, wherein the starch has a viscosity from about 20
centipoise to about 700 centipoise, and wherein the viscosity is measured according
to the VMA method. In some embodiments, the joint compound further comprises
calcined gypsum, water and/or set retarder.
[0010]       In another aspect, acoustical panel comprises an acoustical component
comprising fiber and at least one pregelatinized starch, wherein the starch has a
viscosity from about 20 centipoise to about 700 centipoise, wherein the viscosity is
measured according to the VMA method, and wherein the panel has a Noise

                                            4
Reduction Coefficient of at least about 0.5 according to ASTM C 423-02. In some
embodiments, the fibers comprise mineral wool.
[0011]     In another aspect, the invention provides a board that comprises a set
gypsum core disposed between two cover sheets, the core formed from a slurry
comprising stucco, water, and at least one pregelatinized starch, wherein the starch
has a cold water solubility greater than about 30%, and wherein the set gypsum core
has a compressive strength greater than a set gypsum core made with a starch
having a cold water solubility less than about 30%.
[0012]     In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of making a
board comprising mixing at least water, stucco, and at least one pregelatinized
starch to form a slurry, disposing the slurry between a first cover sheet and a second
cover sheet to form a wet assembly, cutting the wet assembly into a board, and
drying the board. The starch has a cold water solubility greater than about 30%, and
the set gypsum core has a compressive strength greater than a set gypsum core
made with a starch having a cold water solubility less than about 30%.
[0013]     In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of making a
pregelatinized starch comprising mixing at least water and non-pregelatinized starch
to make a wet starch, disposing the wet starch in an extruder having a die at a
temperature of about 90 0C or greater, and drying the starch. The pregelatinized
starch has a cold water solubility greater than about 30%.
                          BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS
[0014]     FIG. 1 is a viscogram developed from viscograph, illustrating the viscosity
of starch at different states, where the X-axis is time and the Y-axis superimposes
torque (primary Y-axis, on the left) and temperature (secondary Y-axis, on the right),
in accordance with embodiments of the invention.
[0015]     FIG. 2 is a line graph displaying compressive strength (Y-axis) at a
specified density (X-axis) for cubes of Example 13 in accordance with embodiments
of the invention.
                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0016]     Embodiments of the present invention are premised, at least in part, on
including in a gypsum slurry a pregelatinized starch characterized as having "mid-

                                              5
range" viscosity (e.g., from about 20 centipoise to about 700 centipoise). Although
the viscosity characteristic is determined as the starch is placed under certain
conditions according to the VMA methodology described herein, it will be understood
that the pregelatinized starch need not be added to the slurry under these conditions.
Surprisingly and unexpectedly, it has been found that the inclusion of the
pregelatinized starch of mid-range viscosity confers a combination of significant
benefits such as with respect to starch efficiency (e.g., so that less starch can be
used), product strength enhancements, and water demand, e.g., in unison in some
embodiments. In accordance with embodiments of the invention, the benefits
including with respect to starch efficiency, water demand, and/or strength represent
a considerable improvement and advancement over the starches known to used in
gypsum slurries, such as non-gelatinized starches (uncooked) or pregelatinized
starches (cooked) having viscosity below 20 centipoise, or above 700 centipoise, as
measured according to the VMA method. These discoveries impart considerable
advantages, including, but not limited to, reducing cost of raw material, enhancing
manufacturing efficiency, and enhancing product strength, e.g., allowing for lower
weight product with sufficient strength properties.
[0017]      Starches are classified as carbohydrates and contain two types of
polysaccharides, namely linear amylose, and branched amylopectin. Starch
granules are semi-crystalline, e.g., as seen under polarized light, and are insoluble at
room temperatures. Gelatinization is the process in which the starch is placed in
water and heated ("cooked") such that the crystalline structure of the starch granules
is melted and the starch molecules dissolve in water such that a good dispersion
results. It has been found that, when transforming a starch granule to gelatinized
form, initially the starch granule provides little viscosity in water because starch
granules are water insoluble. As the temperature increases, the starch granule
swells and the crystalline structure melts at the gelatinization temperature. The peak
viscosity is when the starch granule has maximum swelling. Further heating will
break the starch granules and dissolve the starch molecules in water, with a
precipitous dropoff in viscosity. After cooling, the starch molecule will reassociate to
form a 3-D gel structure, with the viscosity increasing due to the gel structure. See,
e.g., FIG. 1, discussed herein below. Some commercial starches are sold in a
pregelatinized form, while others are sold in the granular form. In accordance with

                                             6
some embodiments of the present invention, the commercial granular form
undergoes at least some degree of gelatinization so that it is pregelatinized prior to
addition to gypsum slurry (typically in a mixer, e.g., pin mixer).
[0018]      To achieve the desired mid-range viscosities according to embodiments of
the invention, the starch molecule can be modified, e.g., to hydrolyze glycosidic
bonds between glucose units to achieve desired molecular weight. For example,
such modifications can include acid modifications, enzyme modifications, and/or
other methods. For example, other approaches for achieving low viscosity include,
for example, mechanical energy-extrusion or modification of the starch molecule to
include more linear amylose units. As an example, in the case of Tackidex K720,
low viscosity is achieved by mechanical energy extrusion, more amylose units
(-35%), and hydroxypropylation. The modification can take place before or after
gelatinization takes place. In the case of enzyme modifications, it is generally
preferred that the modification take place after the gelatinization step. The most
commonly used starch converting enzyme is a-amylase (alpha-amylase). The
enzyme hydrolysis reaction can be stopped either by adjusting the pH or by heating.
In the case of acid modifications, it is generally preferred that the modification take
place before gelatinization because it tends to be more efficient and less cost
intensive. To prepare acid-modified starches, it will be appreciated that aqueous
suspension of unmodified starch can be treated with, e.g., a small quantity of a
strong acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid, or
the like. By adjusting reaction time, the degree of depolymerization can be modified.
For example, when the proper fluidity is achieved, e.g., as determined by in-process
laboratory controls, mild alkali is introduced to neutralize the acid and stop
hydrolysis. Thus, acid-modified starches can be prepared in various fluidities. Also,
acid-modified starches may be used directly after neutralization without further
purification or may be purified to remove salts. The end use of the acid-modified
starch may determine the desirability of purification. For example, a composition of
starch modified by sulfuric acid and neutralized by calcium hydroxide may contain
sulfate and calcium ions which could be added to a stucco and water slurry. Since
the stucco has sulfate and calcium ions already, it may not be necessary to purify the
sulfuric acid-modified starch prior to addition to the slurry. Thus, considerations to
determine the desirability of purification include, for example, the identity of the acid

                                             7
and alkali base and whether it is desirable to add other ions besides sulfate or
calcium ions to the slurry.
[0019]      Pregelatinized starches exhibiting the mid-range viscosity characteristic
according to the invention provide significant benefits to the strength of the product
(e.g., wallboard). Since starch contains glucose monomers containing three hydroxy
groups, starch provides many sites for hydrogen bonding to gypsum crystals. While
not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the molecular size
of pregelatinized starch that exhibit the mid-range viscosity characteristic allows for
optimal mobility of starch molecules to align starch molecules with the gypsum
crystals to facilitate good binding of starch to gypsum crystals to strengthen the
resulting crystalline gypsum matrix, e.g., via hydrogen bonding. Pregelatinized
starches having viscosities outside the mid-range, which would have either longer
chain lengths and higher molecular weight (viscosity that is too high) and shorter
chain lengths and lower molecular weights (viscosity that is too low), respectively, do
not provide the same combination of benefits. It is also believed that, with respect to
starch efficiency, when the starch molecules sufficiently bind to the gypsum crystals,
additional starch does not add significant benefit because the crystals are already
bound such that there is no further gypsum crystal sites for which the starch to
adhere or bind. Accordingly, because of the optimal binding between gypsum
crystals and the pregelatinized starch molecules of mid-range viscosity, in effect the
strength of the crystalline gypsum matrix is enhanced, and less starch is required to
promote that strength compared with conventional starches.
[0020]      Pregelatinized starch exhibiting the mid-range viscosity characteristic also
provides advantages with respect to water demand. Adding starch to gypsum slurry
requires that additional water be added to the gypsum slurry in order to maintain a
desired degree of slurry fluidity. This is because starch increases the viscosity and
reduces the fluidity of the gypsum slurry. Thus, the use of starch in conventional
systems has resulted in an increase in water demand such that even more excess
water would be required in the gypsum slurry. Surprisingly and unexpectedly,
pregelatinized starch having the mid-range viscosity characteristic according to the
present invention demands less water so that the effect on water demand in the
gypsum slurry is reduced, especially in comparison to conventional starches.
Furthermore, because of the efficiency of the inventive pregelatinized starch having

                                              8
the mid-range viscosity characteristic, such that less starch can be used, the positive
impact on water demand can be even more significant in accordance with some
embodiments of the invention. This lower water demand provides considerable
efficiencies during manufacture. For example, excess water requires energy input
for drying. The speed of the line must be slowed to accommodate the drying. Thus,
by reducing the water load in the gypsum slurry, less energy resources and cost can
be seen, as well as faster production rates. In some embodiments, the increase in
water demand in a gypsum slurry is less than the increase in water demand required
by other starches such as pregelatinized starches having viscosity above 700
centipoise (e.g., about 773 centipoise).
[0021]     Any suitable starch can be selected so long as it can meet the mid-range
viscosity characteristic of the invention, e.g., via modification or otherwise. As used
herein, "starch" refers to a composition that includes a starch component. As such,
the starch can be 100% pure starch or may have other components such as those
commonly found in flours such as protein and fiber, so long as the starch component
makes up at least about 75% by weight of the starch composition. The starch can
be in the form of a flour (e.g., corn flour) containing starch, such as flour having at
least about 75% starch by weight of the flour, e.g., at least about 80%, at least about
85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, etc.). By way of example, and not in
any limitation, the starch can be in the form of a corn flour containing starch; corn
starch, such as, for example, Clinton@ 260 (ADM), Supercore@ S23F (GPC),
Amidon M-B 065R (Roquette); a pea starch, such as, for example, acid modified
acetylated starch such as Clearam LG 7015 (Roquette); alkylated starch such as
hydroxyethylated starch, such as, for example, Clineo@ 714 (ADM), Coatmaster@
K57F (GPC), or hydroxypropylated starch, such as, for example Tackidex@ K720
(Roquette); as well as oxidized starch, such as Clinton@ 444 (ADM); or any
combination thereof.
[0022]      Gypsum slurry is normally formed inside a pin mixer. However, the mode
of introduction of ingredients into the mixer may vary. For example, various
combinations of components may be pre-mixed before entering the mixer, e.g., one
or more dry ingredients and/or one or more wet ingredients may be pre-mixed. By
"added to the slurry," as used herein, it will be understood that ingredients may be

                                              9
pre-mixed in any suitable manner prior to entry into the mixer where the slurry is
formed as set forth herein.
[0023]      The pregelatinized starch having the mid-range viscosity characteristic of
the invention can be included in the gypsum slurry in a wet or dry form. If in a wet
form, the starch can be included in any suitable concentration, and could be pre
mixed with other wet ingredients. While the viscosity is measured according to the
VMA method set forth in Example 1 while in water in an amount of 15% starch by
weight of the total weight of starch and water, this does not necessarily mean that
the starch added to the slurry is fully gelatinized or otherwise under the conditions
outlined in the VMA method, or that it must be in a 15% solution in accordance with
embodiments the present invention. Rather, the viscosity feature of the starch is
characterized under these particular conditions to determine whether the starch
meets the viscosity criterion of embodiments of the invention and to allow
comparison of the viscosity characteristic of different starches under normalized
circumstance.
[0024]      Thus, as used herein, "pregelatinized" means that the starch has any
degree of gelatinization before included in the gypsum slurry. In some
embodiments, the pregelatinized starch can be partially gelatinized when included in
the slurry, but becomes fully gelatinized when exposed to elevated temperature, e.g.,
in the kiln for the drying step to remove excess water. In some embodiments, the
pregelatinized starch is not fully gelatinized, even upon exiting the kiln so long as the
starch meets the mid-range viscosity characteristic when under the conditions
according to the VMA method.
[0025]      Viscograph and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are two different
methods to describe starch gelatinization. Degree of starch gelatinization can be
determined by, for example, thermogram from DSC, e.g., using peak area (melting of
crystal) for calculation. A viscogram (from viscograph) is less desirable to determine
degree of partial gelatinization but is a good tool to obtain data such as the viscosity
change of starch, gelatinization maximum, gelatinization temperature, gelification,
viscosity during holding, viscosity at the end of cooling, etc. For degree of
gelatinization, the DSC measurements are done in the presence of excess water,
particularly at or above 67% by weight. If water content of starch/water mixture is
less than 67%, gelatinization temperature will increase as water content decreases.

                                              10
It is difficult to melt starch crystals when available water is limited. When water
content of starch/water mixture reaches 67%, gelatinization temperature will keep
constant no matter how much more water is added into the starch/water mixture.
Gelatinization onset temperature indicates the starting temperature of gelatinization.
Gelatinization end temperature indicates the end temperature of gelatinization.
Enthalpy of gelatinization represents the amount of crystalline structure melted
during gelatinization. By using the enthalpy from a starch DSC thermogram, the
degree of gelatinization can be indicated.
[0026]        Different starches have different gelatinization onset temperature, end
temperatures, and gelatinization enthalpy. Therefore, different starches may
become fully gelatinized at different temperatures. It will be understood that a starch
is fully gelatinized when starch is heated beyond the end temperature of
gelatinization in excess water. In addition, for any particular starch, if the starch is
heated below the end temperature of gelatinization, the starch will be partially
gelatinized. Thus, partial and not full gelatinization will occur when starch in the
presence of excess water is heated below gelatinization end temperature, e.g., as
determined by DSC. Full gelatinization will occur when starch in the presence of
excess water is heated above gelatinization end temperature, e.g., as determined by
DSC. The degree of gelatinization can be adjusted in different ways, such as, for
example, by heating the starch below the gelatinization end temperature to form
partial gelatinization. For example, if the enthalpy for fully gelatinizing a starch is 4
J/g, when the DSC shows the gelatinization enthalpy of the starch as being only 2
J/g, this means 50% of the starch has been gelatinized. Fully gelatinized starch
would not have the DSC thermogram gelatinization peak (enthalpy = 0 J/g) when it is
measured by DSC.
[0027]       As noted, the degree of gelatinization can be any suitable amount, such as
about 50% or more, etc. However, smaller degrees of gelatinization will more
closely approximate granular starch and may not take full advantage of the strength
enhancement, better (more complete) dispersion, and/or water demand reduction of
some embodiments of the invention. Thus, in some embodiments, it is preferred that
there is a higher degree of gelatinization, e.g., at least about 60%, at least about
70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about
97%, at least about 99%, or full (100%) gelatinization. Starch with lower degree of

                                            11
gelatinization can be added to slurry with additional gelatinization (e.g., to 100%)
taking place in the kiln. For purposes of addition to slurry, by "fully gelatinized," it will
be understood that the starch is sufficiently cooked at or above its gelatinization
temperature or to otherwise achieve full gelatinization as can be seen from DSC
techniques. Although some small degree of retrogradation upon cooling may be
expected, the starch still will be understood as "fully gelatinized" for addition to
gypsum slurry in some embodiments as one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize.
In contrast, for purposes of the VMA method discussed herein, such retrogradation is
not accepted in making the viscosity measurement.
[0028]             In some embodiments, the mid-range viscosity of the pregelatinized
starch can be from about 20 centipoise to about 700 centipoise, such as from about
20 centipoise to about 500 centipoise, or from about 30 centipoise to about 200
centipoise. In embodiments of the invention, the viscosity of the pregelatinized
starch when tested under the VMA method can be, e.g., as listed in Tables 1A, 1B
and 1C below. In the tables, an "X" represents the range "from about [corresponding
value in top row] to about [corresponding value in left-most column]." The indicated
values represent viscosity of the pregelatinized starch in centipoise. For ease of
presentation, it will be understood that each value represents "about" that value. For
example, the first "X" in Table 1A is the range "about 20 centipoise to about 25
centipoise." The ranges of the table are between and including the starting and
endpoints.

[0029]      Thus, the viscosity of the pregelatinized starch can have a range between
and including any of the aforementioned endpoints set forth in Tables 1A, 1B or 1C.
[0030]      The pregelatinized starch having the mid-range viscosity characteristic in
accordance with embodiments of the present invention surprisingly and
unexpectedly can be included in the slurry in a relatively low amount (solids/solids
basis) and still achieve significant strength enhancement in the board. Accordingly,
in preferred embodiments of the invention, the pregelatinized starch having the mid
range viscosity characteristic is included in the gypsum slurry in an amount that is
about 5% or less by weight of the stucco (e.g., about 0.1% to about 5%) or even
less, such as about 3% or less by weight of the stucco. For example, the
pregelatinized starch can be included in an amount from about 0.1% to about 4% by
weight of the stucco, about 0.1% to about 3%, about 0.1% to about 2%, about 0.1%
to about 1.5%, etc. It has been found that increasing the amount of the mid-range
viscosity starch in the slurry beyond these ranges does not improve strength as
efficiently since strength levels can somewhat plateau upon addition of even more
starch in some embodiments. However, higher starch quantities can be utilized if

                                          15
desired especially where the diminishing return on strength is accepted. For
example, while not preferred, in some embodiments, starch amounts greater than
about 5% can be used, e.g., from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight of the stucco.
[0031]     In embodiments of the invention, the amount of pregelatinized starch can
be, for example, as listed in Tables 2A and 2B below. In the table, an "X" represents
the range "from about [corresponding value in top row] to about [corresponding value
in left-most column]." The indicated values represent the amount of starch as a
percentage by weight of the stucco. For ease of presentation, it will be understood
that each value represents "about" that value. For example, the first "X" is the range
"from about 0.1 % of the starch by weight of the stucco, to about 0.25% of the starch
by weight of the stucco." The ranges of the table are between and including the
starting and endpoints.

[0032]     Thus, the amount of the pregelatinized starch can have a range between
and including any of the aforementioned endpoints set forth in Tables 2A or 2B.
[0033]     Pregelatinized starches having the desired mid-range viscosity
characteristic can be combined with other starches in accordance with embodiments
of the invention. For example, the pregelatinized starches exhibiting the desired
mid-range viscosity characteristic can be combined with other starches to enhance
both core strength and paper-core bond, particularly if some increase in water
demand is accepted. Thus, in some embodiments of the invention, gypsum slurry
may include one or more pregelatinized starches having the mid-range viscosity
characteristic, as well as one or more other types of starches. Other starches can
include, for example, pregelatinized starches having viscosity below 20 centipoise
and/or above 700 centipoise. One example is pregelatinized corn starch (e.g.,
having a viscosity over 700 centipoise such as about 773 centipoise). The other
starches may also be in the form of, e.g., non-pregelatinized starches, such as acid
modified starches, as well as alkylated starches, e.g., ethylated starches, that are not
gelatinized, etc. The combination of starches may be pre-mixed (e.g, in a dry mix,

                                             18
optionally with other components such as stucco, etc., or in a wet mix with other wet
ingredients) before addition to the gypsum slurry, or they can be included in the
gypsum slurry one at a time, or any variation thereof. Any suitable proportion of
pregelatinized starch having the mid-range viscosity characteristic and other starch
may be included. For example, the starch content of pregelatinized starch having
the mid-range viscosity characteristic as a percentage of total starch content to be
added to gypsum slurry can be, e.g., at least about 10% by weight, such as at least
about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least
about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least
about 95%, at least about 99%, at least about 100%, or any range in between). In
exemplary embodiments, the ratio of pregelatinized starch having the mid-range
viscosity characteristic to other starch can be about 25:75, about 30:70, about 35:65,
about 50:50, about 65:35, about 70:30, about 75:25, etc.
[0034]       In some embodiments, the invention includes a pregelatinized starch
having cold water solubility. Pregelatinization, a process that makes starch cold
water soluble, generally requires cooking starch in an excess amount of water. In
certain instances, it is not desirable to prepare pregelatinized starches by this
method. Extrusion, a combination of heating and mechanical shearing, is an energy
efficient method that can be used to produce pregelatinized starch of low moisture
content. Extrusion of starches can generate extruded pregelatinized starches that
are cold water soluble. Cold water solubility is defined as having any amount of
solubility in water at room temperature (about 25 0 C). It was discovered that starches
exhibiting solubility in cold water can provide significant benefits to the strength of
gypsum products (e.g., wallboard). Cold water soluble starches of the present
invention have a cold water solubility greater than about 30% and, when added to a
set gypsum core, can increase the strength of the gypsum core. The solubility of the
pregelatinized starch in water is defined as the amount of starch that dissolves in
room temperature water divided by the total amount of starch and can be measured
using the method of Example 14.
[0035]       In some embodiments, the cold water solubility of the pregelatinized starch
is from about 30% to about 75%. In other embodiments, the cold water solubility of
the extruded pregelatinized starch is from about 50% to about 75%. In embodiments
of the invention, the cold water solubility of the extruded pregelatinized starch can

                                               19
be, e.g., as listed in Table 2C. In the table, an "X" represents the range "from about
[corresponding value in top row] to about [corresponding value in left-most column]."
The indicated values represent the cold water solubility of extruded pregelatinized
starch (Table 2C). For ease of presentation, it will be understood that each value
represents "about" that value. For example, the first "X" in Table 2C is the range
"from about 30% to about 35%." The ranges of the table are between and including
the starting and endpoints.

[0036]         While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that a
combination of mechanical and thermal energy during extrusion is responsible for
the cold water solubility of the starch. It is believed that when the starch undergoes
extrusion, the hydrogen bonds between the starch molecules are broken. When the
extruded starch is dissolved in water, the starch forms hydrogen bonds with the
water molecules. After the pregelatinization process, the extruded pregelatinized
starch molecules are free to hydrogen-bond with the gypsum crystals, thus imparting

                                           20
higher strength to the gypsum product. Accordingly, because starches exhibiting
solubility in cold water improves the strength of gypsum wallboard, less starch is
required compared with conventional starches.
[0037]      The water soluble extruded pregelatinized starches of the present
invention can have any suitable cold water viscosity according to the cold-water
viscosity assay (CWVA) method (see Example 16). In some embodiments, the cold
water soluble starch has a viscosity from about 20 centipoise to about 300
centipoise. Pregelatinized starches having the viscosity range of the present
invention demand less water so that the effect on water demand in gypsum slurries
is reduced. In embodiments of the invention, the viscosity of the pregelantinized
starch can be, e.g., as listed in Table 2D. In the table, an "X" represents the range
"from about [corresponding value in top row] to about [corresponding value in left
most column]." The indicated values represent the viscosity of pregelatinized starch
(Table 2D). For ease of presentation, it will be understood that each value
represents "about" that value. For example, the first "X" in Table 2D is the range
"from about 20 centipoise to about 40 centipoise." The ranges of the table are
between and including the starting and endpoints.

[0038]     In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of preparing an
extruded pregelatinized starch having cold water solubility. An extruded
pregelatinized starch is prepared by mixing at least water and starch to make a wet
starch, extruding the wet starch through an extruder, and drying the starch. An
extruder is a machine generally used to melt and process polymers. The starch of
the present invention is pregelatinized in an extruder such as a Wenger TX 52 Twin
Screw extruder. In general, an extruder comprises a feed hopper to deliver the feed
material, a preconditioner comprising heat jackets for conditioning polymer with
plasticizer (e.g., water), extruder modular head comprising heating zones, and a die
assembly. The die assembly generally comprises a plate, spacer, and die head. For
the present invention, the starch and water are premixed and fed into the extruder.
In some embodiments, additional water may be added to the extruder. During
extrusion, a combination of heating elements and mechanical shearing melts and
pregelatinizes the starch. After extrusion, the pregelatinized starch is dried to

                                                  22
sufficient moisture content and then ground into a powder. While the die of the
extruder can be any sufficient temperature, the die temperature generally exceeds
the melting temperature of the starch crystals. In embodiments of the invention, the
temperature of the extruder can be, e.g., as listed in Table 2E. In the table, an "X"
represents the range "from about [corresponding value in top row] to about
[corresponding value in left-most column]." The indicated values represent the
extruder temperature (Table 2E). For ease of presentation, it will be understood that
each value represents "about" that value. For example, the first "X" in Table 2E is
the range "from about 900C to about 10OC." The ranges of the table are between
and including the starting and endpoints.

[0039]     The water content of the wet starch during extrusion is also an important
parameter for cold water solubility. The wet starch can have any water content, but
generally has a water content less than about 25%. In some embodiments, the wet
starch has a water content of about 12% to about 25%. It was discovered that when
a starch has lower moisture content, the process of extrusion produces a
pregelatinized starch with greater cold water solubility. While not wishing to be

                                              23
bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the presence of less water leads to
greater friction during extrusion. The increased friction can increase the disruption of
self-hydrogen bonding in the starch. The pregelatinized starch produced from
extrusion using a starch with a water content less than about 25% can have a cold
water solubility greater than about 30%. In embodiments of the invention, the water
content of the wet starch can be, e.g., as listed in Table 2F. In the table, an "X"
represents the range "from about [corresponding value in top row] to about
[corresponding value in left-most column]." The indicated values represent the
moisture content (%) of wet starch by weight of stucco (Table 2F). For ease of
presentation, it will be understood that each value represents "about" that value. For
example, the first "X" in Table 2F is the range "from about 12% to about 13%." The
ranges of the table are between and including the starting and endpoints.

[0040]      In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of
preparing a wallboard comprising a core comprising a pregelatinized starch having

                                           24
cold water solubility. Water, stucco, and at least one pregelatinized starch having a
cold water solubility greater than about 30% are mixed to form a slurry. The starch
can be prepared in any suitable manner, such as those described herein. The starch
having cold water solubility can be included in the stucco slurry in the amounts
described herein. In some embodiments, the cold water soluble starch is included in
the stucco slurry in an amount from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of stucco.
The pregelatinized starch of the present invention can be added in wet or dry form,
but is preferably added as a dry powder. The particle size of the cold water soluble
starch can be of any size. In some embodiments, the particle size is from about 100
microns to about 400 microns. In embodiments of the invention, the particle size of
the pregelatinized starch can be, e.g., as listed in Table 2G. In the table, an "X"
represents the range "from about [corresponding value in top row] to about
[corresponding value in left-most column]." The indicated values represent the
particle size of pregelatinized starch (Table 2G). For ease of presentation, it will be
understood that each value represents "about" that value. For example, the first "X"
in Table 2G is the range "from about 100 microns to about 125 microns." The ranges
of the table are between and including the starting and endpoints.

[0041]      The pregelantinized starch powder can be added to the dry ingredients
during the manufacture of stucco slurry. The slurry is disposed between a first cover
sheet and a second cover sheet to form a wet assembly that is a panel precursor.
The slurry comprises water, stucco, and at least one pregelatinized starch; the starch
having a cold water solubility greater than about 30%. The panel is cut to form a
board. The board is dried. After drying, final dimensioning (e.g., cutting) and
processing can take place as desired. The starch can be chemically modified (in any
order relative to a pregelatinization step) in accordance with some embodiments
prior to inclusion in the slurry. The wallboard of the present invention comprises a
set gypsum core having a compressive strength greater than a set gypsum core
made without starch.
[0042]      In addition to the starch component, the slurry is formulated to include
water, stucco, foaming agent (sometimes referred to simply as "foam"), and other
additives as desired. The stucco can be in the form of calcium sulfate alpha
hemihydrate, calcium sulfate beta hemihydrate, and/or calcium sulfate anhydrite.
The stucco can be fibrous or non-fibrous. Foaming agent can be included to form an

                                             26
air void distribution within the continuous crystalline matrix of set gypsum. In some
embodiments, the foaming agent comprises a major weight portion of unstable
component, and a minor weight portion of stable component (e.g., where unstable
and blend of stable/unstable are combined). The weight ratio of unstable component
to stable component is effective to form an air void distribution within the set gypsum
core. See, e.g., U.S. Patents 5,643,510; 6,342,284; and 6,632,550. It has been
found that suitable void distribution and wall thickness (independently) can be
effective to enhance strength, especially in lower density board (e.g., below about 35
pcf (561 kg/M 3 )). See, e.g., US 2007/0048490 and US 2008/0090068. Evaporative
water voids, generally having voids of about 5 pm or less in diameter, also contribute
to the total void distribution along with the aforementioned air (foam) voids. In some
embodiments, the volume ratio of voids with a pore size greater than about 5
microns to the voids with a pore size of about 5 microns or less, is from about 0.5:1
to about 9:1, such as, for example, about 0.7:1 to about 9:1, about 0.8:1 to about 9:1,
about 1.4:1 to about 9:1, about 1.8:1 to about 9:1, about 2.3:1 to about 9:1, about
0.7:1 to about 6:1, about 1.4:1 to about 6:1, about 1.8:1 to about 6:1, about 0.7:1 to
about 4:1, about 1.4:1 to about 4:1, about 1.8:1 to about 4:1, about 0.5:1 to about
2.3:1, about 0.7:1 to about 2.3:1, about 0.8:1 to about 2.3:1, about 1.4:1 to about
2.3:1, about 1.8:1 to about 2.3:1, etc. In some embodiments, the foaming agent is
present in the slurry, e.g., in an amount of less than about 0.5% by weight of the
stucco such as about 0.01% to about 0.5%, about 0.01% to about 0.4%, about
0.01% to about 0.3%, about 0.01% to about 0.2%, about 0.01% to about 0.1%, about
0.02% to about 0.4%, about 0.02% to about 0.3%, about 0.02% to about 0.2%, etc.
[0043]     Additives such as accelerator (e.g., wet gypsum accelerator, heat resistant
accelerator, climate stabilized accelerator) and retarder are well known and can be
included. See, e.g., U.S. Patents 3,573,947 and 6,409,825. In some embodiments
where accelerator and/or retarder are included, the accelerator and/or retarder each
can be in the gypsum slurry in an amount on a solid basis of, e.g, from about 0% to
about 10% by weight of the stucco (e.g., about 0.1% to about 10%), such as, for
example, from about 0% to about 5% by weight of the stucco (e.g., about 0.1% to
about 5%). Other additives as desired may be included, e.g., to impart strength to
enable lower weight product with sufficient strength, to avoid permanent deformation,
to promote green strength, e.g., as the product is setting on the conveyor traveling

                                            27
down a manufacturing line, to promote fire resistance, to promote water resistance,
etc.
[0044]     For example, the slurry can optionally include at least one dispersant to
enhance fluidity in some embodiments. Like the starch and other ingredients, the
dispersants may be included in a dry form with other dry ingredients and/or in a liquid
form with other liquid ingredients in the core slurry. Examples of dispersants include
naphthalenesulfonates, such as polynaphthalenesulfonic acid and its salts
(polynaphthalenesulfonates) and derivatives, which are condensation products of
naphthalenesulfonic acids and formaldehyde; as well as polycarboxylate
dispersants, such as polycarboxylic ethers, for example, PCE21 1, PCE1 11, 1641,
1641 F, or PCE 2641-Type Dispersants, e.g., MELFLUX 2641 F, MELFLUX 2651 F,
MELFLUX 1641 F, MELFLUX 2500L dispersants (BASF), and COATEX Ethacryl M,
available from Coatex, Inc.; and/or lignosulfonates or sulfonated lignin.
Lignosulfonates are water-soluble anionic polyelectrolyte polymers, byproducts from
the production of wood pulp using sulfite pulping. One example of a lignin useful in
the practice of principles of embodiments of the present invention is Marasperse C
21 available from Reed Lignin Inc.
[0045]     Lower molecular weight dispersants are generally preferred. Lower
molecular weight naphthalenesulfonate dispersants are favored because they trend
to a lower water demand than the higher viscosity, higher molecular weight
dispersants. Thus, molecular weights from about 3,000 to about 10,000 (e.g., about
8,000 to about 10,000) are preferred. As another illustration, for PCE211 type
dispersants, in some embodiments, the molecular weight can be from about 20,000
to about 60,000, which exhibit less retardation than dispersants having molecular
weight above 60,000.
[0046]     One example of a naphthalenesulfonate is DILOFLO, available from GEO
Specialty Chemicals. DILOFLO is a 45% naphthalenesulfonate solution in water,
although other aqueous solutions, for example, in the range of about 35% to about
55% by weight solids content, are also readily available. Naphthalenesulfonates can
be used in dry solid or powder form, such as LOMAR D, available from GEO
Specialty Chemicals, for example. Another exemplary naphthalenesulfonate is
DAXAD, available from Hampshire Chemical Corp.

                                            28
[0047]      If included, the dispersant can be included in any suitable (solids/solids)
amount, such as, for example, about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of the stucco, e.g.,
about 0.1% to about 4%, about 0.1% to about 3%, about 0.2% to about 3%, about
0.5% to about 3%, about 0.5% to about 2.5%, about 0.5% to about 2%, about 0.5%
to about 1.5%, etc.
[0048]      One or more phosphate-containing compounds can also be optionally
included in the slurry, if desired. For example, phosphate-containing components
useful in some embodiments include water-soluble components and can be in the
form of an ion, a salt, or an acid, namely, condensed phosphoric acids, each of
which comprises two or more phosphoric acid units; salts or ions of condensed
phosphates, each of which comprises two or more phosphate units; and monobasic
salts or monovalent ions of orthophosphates as well as water-soluble acyclic
polyphosphate salt. See, e.g., U.S. Patents 6,342,284; 6,632,550; 6,815,049; and
6,822,033.
[0049]      Phosphate compositions in accordance with some embodiments of the
invention can enhance green strength, resistance to permanent deformation (e.g.,
sag), dimensional stability, etc. Trimetaphosphate compounds can be used,
including, for example, sodium trimetaphosphate, potassium trimetaphosphate,
lithium trimetaphosphate, and ammonium trimetaphosphate. Sodium
trimetaphosphate (STMP) is preferred, although other phosphates may be suitable,
including for example sodium tetrametaphosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate
having from about 6 to about 27 repeating phosphate units and having the molecular
formula Nan+2PnO3n.1 wherein n=6-27, tetrapotassium pyrophosphate having the
molecular formula K4P207, trisodium dipotassium tripolyphosphate having the
molecular formula Na3K2P3010, sodium tripolyphosphate having the molecular
formula Na5P3010, tetrasodium pyrophosphate having the molecular formula
Na4P2O7, aluminum trimetaphosphate having the molecular formula AI(PO3)3,
sodium acid pyrophosphate having the molecular formula Na2H2P2O7, ammonium
polyphosphate having 1000-3000 repeating phosphate units and having the
molecular formula (NH4)n+2PnO3n.1 wherein n=1000-3000, or polyphosphoric acid
having two or more repeating phosphoric acid units and having the molecular
formula Hn+2PnO3n.1 wherein n is two or more.

                                             29
[0050]     The phosphate can be included in a dry form or in a form in water (e.g., a
phosphate solution from about 5% to about 20%, such as about a 10% solution). If
included, the phosphate can be in any suitable amount (solids/solids basis), such as
from about 0.01% to about 0.5% by weight of the stucco, e.g., from about 0.03% to
about 0.4%, from about 0.1% to about 0.3%, or from about 0.12% to about 0.4% by
weight of the stucco.
[0051]     Suitable additives for fire-rated and/or water resistant product can also
optionally be included, including, e.g., siloxanes (water resistance); fiber; heat sink
additives such as aluminum trihydrate (ATH), magnesium hydroxide or the like;
and/or high expansion particles (e.g., expandable to about 300% or more of original
volume when heated for about one hour at 1560OF (849 0C)). See, e.g., co-pending,
commonly assigned U.S. Application No. 13/400,010 (filed February 17, 2012) for
description of these and other ingredients. In some embodiments, high expansion
vermiculite is included, although other fire resistant materials can be included. The
board of some fire-related product according to the invention can have a Thermal
Insulation Index (TI) of about 17 minutes or greater, e.g., about 20 minutes or
greater, about 30 minutes or greater, about 45 minutes or greater, about 60 minutes
or greater, etc.; and/or a High Temperature Shrinkage (at temperatures of about
1560OF (849 0C)) of less than about 10% in the x-y directions and expansion in the z
direction of greater than about 20%. The fire or water resistance additives can be
included in any suitable amount as desired depending, e.g., on fire rating, etc. For
example, if included, the fire or water resistance additives can be in an amount from
about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of the stucco, such as from about 1% to about
10%, about 1% to about 8%, about 2% to about 10%, about 2% to about 8% by
weight of the stucco, etc.
[0052]     If included, the siloxane preferably is added in the form of an emulsion.
The slurry is then shaped and dried under conditions which promote the
polymerization of the siloxane to form a highly cross-linked silicone resin. A catalyst
which promotes the polymerization of the siloxane to form a highly cross-linked
silicone resin can be added to the gypsum slurry. In some embodiments, solventless
methyl hydrogen siloxane fluid sold under the name SILRES BS 94 by Wacker
Chemie GmbH (Munich, Germany) can be used as the siloxane. This product is a
siloxane fluid containing no water or solvents. It is contemplated that about 0.3% to

                                              30
about 1.0% of the BS 94 siloxane may be used in some embodiments, based on the
weight of the dry ingredients. For example, in some embodiments, it is preferred to
use from about 0.4% to about 0.8% of the siloxane based on the dry stucco weight.
[0053]      The slurry formulation can be made with any suitable water/stucco ratio,
e.g., about 0.4 to about 1.3. However, because the pregelatinized starches having
the mid-range viscosity characteristic of the invention reduce the amount of water
required to be added to the slurry to accommodate them, as compared with other
starches, the slurry can be formulated with a water/stucco ratio input that is lower in
some embodiments than what is conventional for other starch-containing gypsum
slurries, especially at low weight/density. For example, in some embodiments, the
water/stucco ratio can be from about 0.4 to about 1.1, about 0.4 to about 0.9, about
0.4 to about 0.85, about 0.45 to about 0.85, about 0.55 to about 0.85, about 0.55 to
about 0.8, about 0.6 to about 0.9, about 0.6 to about 0.85, about 0.6 to about 0.8,
etc.
[0054]      The cover sheets can be formed of any suitable material and basis weight.
Advantageously, board core formed from slurry comprising pregelatinized starch
characterized by mid-range viscosity provides sufficient strength in board even with
lower basis weight cover sheets such as, for example, less than 45 lbs/MSF (219.7
                                                                         2
g/m2 ) (e.g., about 33 lbs/MSF (161 g/m2 ) to 45 lbs/MSF (219.7 g/m )) even for lower
weight board (e.g., having a density of about 35 pcf (561 kg/m 3) or below) in some
embodiments. However, if desired, in some embodiments, heavier basis weights
can be used, e.g., to further enhance nail pull resistance or to enhance handling,
e.g., to facilitate desirable "feel" characteristics for end-users. In some
embodiments, to enhance strength (e.g., nail pull strength), especially for lower
density board, one or both of the cover sheets can be formed from paper and have a
basis weight of, for example, at least about 45 lbs/MSF (220 g/m2 ) (e.g., from about
45 lbs/MSF (220 g/m2 ) to about 65 lbs/MSF (317 g/m2 ), about 45 lbs/MSF (220 g/m2 )
to about 60 lbs/MSF (293 g/m2 ), about 45 lbs/MSF (220 g/m2 ) to about 55 lbs/MSF
(268 g/m2 ), about 50 lbs/MSF (224 g/m2 ) to about 65 lbs/MSF (317 g/m2 ), about 50
lbs/MSF (224 g/m2 ) to about 60 lbs/MSF (293 g/m2 ), etc.). If desired, in some
embodiments, one cover sheet (e.g., the "face" paper side when installed) can have
aforementioned higher basis weight, e.g., to enhance nail pull resistance and
handling, while the other cover sheet (e.g., the "back" sheet when the board is

                                             31
installed) can have somewhat lower weight basis if desired (e.g., weight basis of less
than 45 lbs/MSF (220 g/m2 ), e.g., from about 33 lbs/MSF (161 g/m2 ) to 45 lbs/MSF
(220 g/m2 ), e.g., about 33 lbs/MSF (161 g/m2 ) to about 40 lbs/MSF (195 g/m2 )).
[0055]       Board weight is a function of thickness. Since boards are commonly made
at varying thickness, board density is used herein as a measure of board weight.
The advantages of the mid-range viscosity starch in accordance with embodiments
of the invention can be seen across various board densities, e.g., about 40 pcf (641
kg/m 3 ) or less, such as from about 20 pcf (320 kg/m 3 ) to about 40 pcf (641 kg/m 3 ),
from about 24 pcf (384 kg/M 3 ) to about 37 pcf (593 kg/m 3 ), etc. However, preferred
embodiments of the invention have particular utility at lower densities where the
enhanced strength provided by the mid-range viscosity starches of the invention
advantageously enable the use of lower weight board with good strength and lower
water demand than board made from other starches. For example, in some
embodiments, board density can be from about 20 pcf (320 kg/M 3 ) to about 35 pcf
(561 kg/m 3 ), e.g., about 24 pcf (384 kg/m 3 ) to about 35 pcf (561 kg/m 3 ), about 24 pcf
(384 kg/m 3 ) to about 34 pcf (545 kg/m 3 ), about 27 pcf (432 kg/m 3 ) to about 35 pcf
(561 kg/M 3 ), about 27 pcf (432 kg/M 3 ) to about 34 pcf (545 kg/M 3 ), about 30 pcf (481
kg/m 3 ) to about 34 pcf (545 kg/m 3 ), about 27 pcf (432 kg/M 3 ) to about 30 pcf (481
kg/m 3 ), etc.
[0056]      The starches of the invention herein provide strength enhancement to
product according to the invention, which can be especially beneficial at lower
weight/density. For example, in some embodiments, board core or other slurry cast
according to the 2 inch cube test (without foam) described herein preferably exhibit a
compressive strength of at least about 1650 psi (11.38 MPa), e.g., at least about
1700 psi (11.72 MPa), at least about 1750 psi (12.07 MPa), at least about 1800 psi
(12.41 MPa), at least about 1850 psi (12.76 MPa), at least about 1900 psi (13.1
MPa), at least about 1950 psi (13.44 MPa), at least about 2000 psi (13.79 MPa), at
least about 2050 psi (14.13 MPa), at least about 2100 psi (14.48 MPa), at least
about 2150 psi (14.82 MPa), at least about 2200 psi (15.17 MPa), at least about
2250 psi (15.51 MPa), at least about 2300 psi (15.86 MPa), at least about 2350 psi
(16.2 MPa), etc.
[0057]       In some embodiments, board according to the invention meets test
protocols according to ASTM Standard C473-10 (e.g., Method B). For example, in

                                             32
some embodiments, when the board is cast at a thickness of % inch (1.27 cm), the
board has a nail pull resistance of at least about 65 lb (29.5 kg) as determined
according to ASTM C473 (e.g., at least about 68 lb (30.8 kg), at least about 70 lb
(31.8 kg), at least about 72 lb (32.7 kg), at least about 75 lb (34 kg), at least about 77
lb (35 kg), etc). With respect to flexural strength, in some embodiments, when cast
in a board of % inch (1.27 cm) thickness, the board has a flexural strength of at least
about 36 lb (16.3 kg) in a machine direction (e.g., at least about 38 lb (17.2 kg), at
least about 40 lb (18.1 kg), etc.) and/or at least about 107 lb (48.5 kg) (e.g., at least
about 110 lb (49.9 kg), at least about 112 lb (50.8 kg), etc.) in a cross-machine
direction as determined according to the ASTM standard C473. In addition, in some
embodiments, board can have an average core hardness of at least about 11
pounds (5 kg) as determined according to ASTM C473. Due at least in part to the
mid-range viscosity characteristic of embodiments of the invention, these standards
can be met even with respect to lower density board (e.g., about 35 pcf (561 kg/m 3 )
or less) as described herein.
[0058]      Product according to embodiments of the invention can be made on typical
manufacturing lines. For example, board manufacturing techniques are described in,
for example, U.S. Patent 7,364,676 and U.S. Patent Application Publication
2010/0247937. Briefly, in the case of gypsum board, the process typically involves
discharging a cover sheet onto a moving conveyor. Since gypsum board is normally
formed "face down," this cover sheet is the "face" cover sheet in such embodiments.
[0059]      Dry and/or wet components of the gypsum slurry are fed to a mixer (e.g.,
pin mixer), where they are agitated to form the gypsum slurry. The mixer comprises
a main body and a discharge conduit (e.g., a gate-canister-boot arrangement as
known in the art, or an arrangement as described in U.S. Patents 6,494,609 and
6,874,930). In some embodiments, the discharge conduit can include a slurry
distributor with either a single feed inlet or multiple feed inlets, such as those
described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2012/0168527 Al (Application No.
13/341,016) and U.S. Patent Application Publication 2012/0170403 Al (Application
No. 13/341,209), for example. In those embodiments, using a slurry distributor with
multiple feed inlets, the discharge conduit can include a suitable flow splitter, such as
those described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2012/0170403 Al. Foaming
agent can be added in the discharge conduit of the mixer (e.g., in the gate as

                                             33
described, for example, in U.S. Patents 5,683,635 and 6,494,609) or in the main
body if desired. Slurry discharged from the discharge conduit after all ingredients
have been added, including foaming agent, is the primary gypsum slurry and will
form the board core. This board core slurry is discharged onto the moving face
cover sheet.
[0060]      The face cover sheet may bear a thin skim coat in the form of a relatively
dense layer of slurry. Also, hard edges, as known in the art, can be formed, e.g.,
from the same slurry stream forming the face skim coat. In embodiments where
foam is inserted into the discharge conduit, a stream of secondary gypsum slurry can
be removed from the mixer body to form the dense skim coat slurry, which can then
be used to form the face skim coat and hard edges as known in the art. If included,
normally the face skim coat and hard edges are deposited onto the moving face
cover sheet before the core slurry is deposited, usually upstream of the mixer. After
being discharged from the discharge conduit, the core slurry is spread, as
necessary, over the face cover sheet (optionally bearing skim coat) and covered with
a second cover sheet (typically the "back" cover sheet) to form a wet assembly in the
form of a sandwich structure that is a precursor to the final product. The second
cover sheet may optionally bear a second skim coat, which can be formed from the
same or different secondary (dense) gypsum slurry as for the face skim coat, if
present. The cover sheets may be formed from paper, fibrous mat or other type of
material (e.g., foil, plastic, glass mat, non-woven material such as blend of cellulosic
and inorganic filler, etc.).
[0061]      The wet assembly thereby provided is conveyed to a forming station
where the product is sized to a desired thickness (e.g., via forming plate), and to one
or more knife sections where it is cut to a desired length. The wet assembly is
allowed to harden to form the interlocking crystalline matrix of set gypsum, and
excess water is removed using a drying process (e.g., by transporting the assembly
through a kiln). It also is common in the manufacture of gypsum board to use
vibration in order to eliminate large voids or air pockets from the deposited slurry.
Each of the above steps, as well as processes and equipment for performing such
steps, are known in the art.
[0062]      The starch characterized by mid-range viscosity of the invention can be
used in formulating various products, such as, for example, gypsum wallboard,

                                             34
acoustical (e.g., ceiling) tile, joint compound, gypsum-cellulosic fiber products, such
as gypsum-wood fiber wallboard, and the like. In some embodiments, such product
can be formed from slurry according to embodiments of the invention.
[0063]     As such, the pregelatinized starch characterized by mid-range viscosity
can have beneficial effects, as described herein, in product besides paper-faced
gypsum board in embodiments of the invention. For example, pregelatinized starch
characterized as having a mid-range viscosity can be used in mat-faced products
(e.g., woven) where board cover sheets are in the form of fibrous mats. The mats
can optionally bear a finish to reduce water permeability. Other ingredients that can
be included in making such mat-faced product, as well as materials for the fibrous
mats and methods of manufacture, are discussed in, e.g., U.S. Patent 8,070,895, as
well as U.S. Patent Application Publication 2009/0247937.
[0064]      In addition, gypsum-cellulosic product can be in the form of cellulosic host
particles (e.g., wood fibers), gypsum, pregelatinized starch of mid-range viscosity,
and other ingredients (e.g., water resistant additives such as siloxanes) as desired.
Other ingredients and methods of manufacture are discussed in, e.g., U.S. Patents
4,328,178; 4,239,716; 4,392,896; 4,645,548; 5,320,677; 5,817,262; and 7,413,603.
[0065]      Pregelatinized starches herein can also be included in joint compound
formulations, including both dry and ready-mix embodiments. The benefit of the
invention is not limited to embodiments including calcined gypsum since the
pregelatinized starch of mid-range viscosity in accordance with some embodiments
can have good bond and can enhance strength with other components, e.g., non
setting components such as calcium carbonate and the like. To inhibit premature
setting in some ready-mix embodiments, set retardant is also desirably included in
some embodiments as one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate. For example,
U.S. Patents 4,661,161; 5,746,822; and U.S. Patent Application Publication
2011/0100844 describe set retarders (e.g., phosphate such as tetra sodium
pyrophosphate (TSPP), polyacrylic acid and/or salt thereof, or the like), and other
ingredients (e.g., latex emulsion binder, thickener, phosphate as described herein,
and the like, or combinations thereof, etc) that may be useful in accordance with the
present invention. Other ingredients and methods of making and using joint
compound are discussed in, e.g., U.S. Patents 6,406,537 and 6,805,741; as well as
U.S. Patent Application Publication 2008/0305252.

                                               35
[0066]      The pregelatinized starches herein can be used with various types of
acoustical panels (e.g., ceiling tile). The starch can be mixed with calcined gypsum,
water, and other ingredients as desired in some embodiments. However, the
pregelatinized starch of mid range viscosity in accordance with some embodiments
is not limited to use with calcined gypsum. The pregelatinized starch of mid-range
viscosity in accordance with some embodiments can provide good bond between
starch and non-setting components such as fibers (e.g., mineral wool and the like).
In some embodiments, the panel has a Noise Reduction Coefficient of at least about
0.5 (e.g., at least about 0.7 or at least about 1) according to ASTM C423-02.See,
e.g., U.S. Patents 1,769,519; 6,443,258; 7,364,015; 7,851,057; and 7,862,687 for
discussion of ingredients and methods for making acoustical tile.
[0067]      Some embodiments of the invention can be substantially free of extruded
pregelatinized starch or mid-range viscosity pregelatinized starch. As used herein,
"substantially free" can mean either (i) 0 wt.% based on the weight of the
composition, or (ii) an ineffective or (iii) an immaterial amount of such starch. An
example of an ineffective amount is an amount below the threshold amount to
achieve the intended purpose of using such starch, as one of ordinary skill in the art
will appreciate. An immaterial amount may be, e.g., below about 5 wt.%, such as
below about 2 wt.%, below about 1 wt.%, below about 0.5 wt.%, below about 0.2
wt.%, below about 0.1 wt.%, or below about 0.01 wt.% as one of ordinary skill in the
art will appreciate. However, if desired in alternative embodiments, such ingredients
can be included in a slurry, method, or product.
[0068]      Thus, in an embodiment, the board comprises a set gypsum core disposed
between two cover sheets, the core formed from a slurry comprising stucco, water
and at least one pregelatinized starch, wherein the starch has the characteristic of a
viscosity from about 20 centipoise to about 700 centipoise when the viscosity is
measured with the starch under the conditions according to the VMA method (see

under the conditions of the VMA test, but rather that when the starch is subjected to
the VMA test, the characteristic is met.

[00143]    It shall be noted that the preceding are merely examples of embodiments.
Other exemplary embodiments are apparent from the entirety of the description
herein. It will also be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that each of these
embodiments may be used in various combinations with the other embodiments
provided herein.
[00144]    The following examples further illustrate the invention but, of course,
should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope.
                 EXAMPLE 1 - VISCOSITY MEASUREMENT METHOD
[00145]    This example sets forth the viscosity measurement assay method, referred
to herein as the "VMA method." When viscosity is referred to herein, it is in
accordance with the VMA method, unless otherwise indicated. The viscosity is
measured using a Discovery HR-2 Hybrid Rheometer (TA Instruments Ltd) with a
concentric cylinder, a standard cup (diameter of 30 mm) with vane geometry
(diameter of 28 mm and length of 42.05 mm).
[00146]     When the starch is obtained, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
techniques are used to determine whether the starch is fully gelatinized. It is to be
noted that even if the starch manufacturer identifies the starch as "fully gelatinized,"
the DSC step should be utilized to ensure that the starch is fully gelatinized, e.g., to
confirm that no retrogradation has occurred. One of two procedures is adopted,
depending on the temperature required to fully gelatinize the starch, which can also
be determined by DSC as one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate.
[00147]    Procedure 1 is utilized where the DSC reveals that the starch is fully
gelatinized or has a gelatinization temperature at or below 90 0 C. Procedure 2 is
utilized where the gelatinization temperature is above 90 0 C. Since the viscosity is
measured while the starch is in water, procedure 2 uses pressure cooking in a
sealed vessel to allow for superheating to temperatures above 100 0 C without
causing the water to appreciably evaporate. Procedure 1 is reserved for starches
already fully gelatinized or for starches having gelatinization temperature up to 90 0 C,
because, as discussed below, the gelatinization takes place in the rheometer which

                                              43
is an open system and cannot create pressurized conditions for gelatinization. Thus
procedure 2 is followed for starches having higher gelatinization temperatures.
Either way, starch (7.5 g, dry basis) is added into water for a total weight of 50 g
when the viscosity is measured.
[00148]     In procedure 1, the starch is dispersed in the water (15% starch of the total
weight of starch and water) and the sample is immediately transferred to a cylinder
cell. The cell is covered with aluminum foil. The sample is heated from 25 0 C to
90 0 C at 50C/min and a shear rate of 200 s-1. The sample is held at 90 0C for 10 min
at a shear rate of 200 s-1. The sample is cooled from 90 0C to 80 0 C at 50 C/min and a
shear rate of 200 s-1. The sample is held at 80 0C for 10 min at a shear rate of 0 s-1.
The viscosity of the sample is measured at 80 0 C and a shear rate of 100 s-1 for 2
min. The viscosity is the average of the measurement from 30 seconds to 60
seconds.
[00149]     Procedure 2 is used for starches having gelatinization temperature greater
than 90 0C. The starch is gelatinized according to the methods well-known in the
starch industry (e.g., by pressure cooking). The gelatinized starch water solution
(15% of total weight) is immediately transferred into the rheometer measuring cup
and equilibrated at 80 0 C for 10 minutes. The viscosity of the sample is measured at
80 0 C and a shear rate of 100 s-1 for 2 minutes. The viscosity is the average of the
measurement from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.
           EXAMPLE 2 -VISCOSITY OF STARCH AT DIFFERENT STATES
[00150]     This Example illustrates the viscosity of starch (in 15% solution in water) at
different states. The representative starch tested was hydroxyethyl corn starch
(Clineo 706, available from ADM)- Referring to FIG. 1, the X-axis reflects time, while
the Y-axis superimposes torque and temperature. The graph demonstrates how the
viscosity changes as the starch is cooked and is ultimately gelatinized. The torque
measures the force to turn the rotor and therefore is a measurement of viscosity.
The torque is in Brabender Units.
[00151]     One of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize Brabender units. For
example, briefly, a C.W. Brabender Viscograph can be used, e.g., a Viscograph-E
that uses reaction torque for dynamic measurement. The Viscograph-E is

                                              44
commercially available from C.W. Brabender Instruments, Inc., Hackensack, NJ. It
is to be noted that, as defined herein, the Brabender units are measured using a
sample cup size of 16 fl. oz (= 500 cc), with a 700 cmg cartridge at an RPM of 75.
One of ordinary skill in the art also will readily recognize that the Brabender units can
be converted to other viscosity measurements, such as centipoise (e.g., cP = BU X
2.1, when the measuring cartridge is 700 cmg) or Krebs units, as described therein.
[00152]     The torque (viscosity) and temperature curves, respectively, are labeled in
FIG. 1. With respect to temperature, the target and actual temperatures are
superimposed on each other but there is not an appreciable difference.
[00153]     As seen from the viscogram of FIG. 1, the granule, i.e., the physical
structure of native starch, is identified as "cold" at low temperature and "hot" above
80 0 C. At low temperature, before gelatinization, the viscosity does not appreciably
change. As the granule is heated, it will absorb water and swell. Beginning at the
peak of the torque curve, the granule is hot and swollen enough that the granular
structure begins to break and separate into loose molecules. As the granular
structure breaks down, the viscosity decreases until the starch is fully gelatinized as
shown at the trough of the curve. As the curve levels off at the trough, the solution is
cooled. As a result, retrogradation occurs as the gelatinized molecule begins to re
associate and the viscosity starts to increase again.
   EXAMPLE 3 - CUBE FORMULATION AND COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH TEST
[00154]     This Example describes cube compressive testing using a 2 inch (5.08
centimeter) cube. In some embodiments, the cube compressive test measures a
gypsum formulation where the starch and its amount can vary as described herein.
The formulation is formed from a gypsum slurry that is set with an input for
water/stucco ratio at 1.0, with the amount of starch set at 2% by weight of stucco
unless otherwise indicated.
[00155]     For starch requiring gelatinization at lab (e.g., all Clinton series, Clineo
series, S23F, LC21 1, identified below): starch was dispersed in water and heated to
boiling for 10 min with continuous stirring. The starch solution was then cooled to
78 0 F (25.6 0C) and transferred into the mixing cup of a Waring blender. Sodium
trimetaphosphate ("STMP") 10% solution, dispersant, and retarder were weighed
into starch solution and mixed. Stucco and HRA were weighed and mixed as dry

                                           45
mix. The stucco and HRA dry mix was poured into the starch solution, soaked for 10
seconds and mixed at high speed for 10 seconds. Molds of 2 inch (5.08 centimeter)
cubes were filled to a point slightly above the tops of the molds. The excess was
scraped as soon as the plaster set. The cubes were removed from the molds after
they hardened. The cubes were dried at 110OF (43.30 C) for 48 hours.
[00156]     For water soluble starches (e.g., extruded hydroxypropyl pea starch,
Maltrin M040, Maltrin M100, identified below): starch was dissolved in room
temperature water. Follow the same procedure for starch requiring gelatinization at
lab except skipping heating and cooling steps. As an alternative, soluble starch can
be prepared in a dry mix with stucco and heat-resistant accelerator, then mixed with
liquid ingredients (water, STMP, dispersant, and retarder).
[00157]     For granular starch: starch was weighed into dry mix (stucco and HRA).
Water, sodium trimetaphosphate 10% solution, dispersant, and retarder were
weighed into the mixing cup. The dry mix was poured into water, soaked for 10
seconds, mixed at high speed for 10 seconds and the slurry immediately poured into
the mold. The wet cube was wrapped with aluminum foil as soon as it hardened.
The wrapped cube was heated at 190OF (87.8 0 C) for 90 min. The cube was
unwrapped and dried at 11 00 F (43.3 0C) for 48 hours
[00158]     The formulation of the gypsum slurry for forming the cube is set forth
below in Table 3.

[00159]     The dried cubes were removed from the oven and cooled at room
temperature for 1 hour. The compressive strength was measured using a MTS
system (Model # SATEC). The load is applied continuously and without a shock at

                                           46
speed of 0.04 inch/min (1.02 mm/min) (with a constant rate between 15 to 40 psi/s
(103.4 to 275.8 kPa/s)).
[00160]     A cube was produced using extruded hydroxypropyl pea starch
(Tackidex@K720 (Roquette)) by dissolving the starch in room temperature water,
where the cube had a strength of 2106 psi (14.52 MPa). A cube was produced using
extruded hydroxypropyl pea starch (Tackidex@K720 (Roquette)) by preparing the
starch in a dry mix with stucco and heat-resistant accelerator, which was then mixed
with liquid ingredients (water, STMP, dispersant, and retarder), where the cube had
a strength of 2084 psi (14.37 MPa).

[00161]     This Example compares the effect of adding granular starch (i.e., non
gelatinized) into stucco slurry with adding gelatinized starches into stucco slurry on
the respective compressive strengths of gypsum formulations. Each starch was put
into a gypsum slurry for cube test as described in Example 3.

[00163]    This example illustrates the enhanced strength achieved with the input of
pregelatinized starch in a gypsum slurry instead of a granular starch in accordance
with embodiments of the invention. Granular form provides good fluidity to stucco
slurry due to the very low viscosity of granular starch. However, the granular form
does not impart as good of a strength. Thus, the pregelatinized form is desirable.

 [00165]    Some of the starches were supplied commercially in an already
 gelatinized form, and those starches are marked as gelatinized "during manufacture"
 in Table 5. Other starches were supplied without gelatinization, but were then
 gelatinized in the lab, as marked "at lab" in Table 5. In addition, some of the
 starches were chemically modified to achieve the indicated viscosity as noted. With

                                            49
respect to the extruded hydroxypropyl pea starch, while not wishing to be bound to
any particular theory, the low viscosity may be due to starch hydrolysis by high
pressure high shear extrusion combined with hydroxypropylation and the high
amylose content (35%). Each indicated viscosity is after gelatinization of the starch.
[00166]     This Example demonstrates the desirability of including gelatinized
starches having a mid-range viscosity, as set forth herein, in a cementitious (e.g.,
gypsum) slurry, in accordance with embodiments of the invention. The mid-range
viscosity starches provide good fluidity, as reflected by the starch viscosity, while
also achieving desirable strength properties. The good fluidity results in lower water
demand in the gypsum slurry. By including less water in the gypsum slurry, less
excess water must be dried off during manufacture, resulting in enhanced process
efficiency and lower manufacturing costs.
  EXAMPLE 6 - GELATINIZATION AND VISCOSITY OF ETHYLATED STARCHES
[00167]     This Example compares ethylated starches exhibiting a range of
viscosities after gelatinization. The effect on strength of a gypsum formulation, in
view of adding granular (ungelatinized starch) and gelatinized starch, respectively,
into stucco slurry was also evaluated according to the formulation and cube test set
forth in Example 3. Results showing the viscosity of the gelatinized starches and the
compressive strengths of gypsum cubes formed from slurries comprising the
starches are set forth below in Table 6. Each indicated viscosity is after
gelatinization of the starch, but the strength in view of adding granular starch
(ungelatinized starch) into stucco slurry is also included in the data.

[00168]     While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, ethylation
decreases the gelatinization temperature of starch. These ethylated starches may
be partially hydrolyzed to the appropriate viscosity.
[00169]     This Example shows that these ethylated starches having the mid-range of
viscosity after gelatinization, as described herein, provide desirable fluidity and
strength when included in a gypsum formulation, in accordance with embodiments of
the invention.
          EXAMPLE 7 - VARIATION IN STARCH AMOUNT ON STRENGTH
[00170]     This Example compares the effect of gelatinized starches on the strength
of a gypsum formulation, across a range of amounts of starch to be put into the
gypsum slurry. The formulation and cube test set forth in Example 3 were used,
except that the amount of starch was varied. The results are set forth in Table 7.

                    EXAMPLE 8 - FLUIDITY OF GYPSUM SLURRY
[00172]     This Example illustrates the effect on fluidity of gypsum slurry by various
gelatinized starches. Each starch was put into a gypsum formulation according to
Example 3, except that the water/stucco ratio and amount of starch were varied. A
slump test was used to measure fluidity as follows. Slump was measured by pouring
slurry into a 2 inch (5.08 cm) diameter cylinder that is 4" tall (10.2 cm) (open on each
end and placed on end on a flat smooth surface) and screeding the top of the slurry

                                              51
off. This provides a set volume of slurry for every test. Then the cylinder was
immediately lifted and the slurry rushed out the open bottom end of the cylinder. The
diameter of this patty is measured in centimeters and recorded. A more fluid slurry
will typically result in a larger diameter patty. The results are set forth in Table 8.

  EXAMPLE 13 - CUBE FORMULATION AND COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH TEST
[00182]     This Example describes cube compressive strength testing of cubes
comprising a lab-cooked acid-modified starch. The formulation is formed from a
gypsum slurry that has a water/stucco ratio of 1.0 for control pregelatinized corn
starch and 0.9 for lab-cooked acid-modified corn starch (Clinton 277), with the
amount of starch set at 2% by weight of stucco. The formulation used for the control
and lab-cooked acid-modified corn starch is disclosed in Table 13. The density of
the cube was set between 25 and 45 pound cubic feet (400 kg/m 3 and 721 kg/m 3 ) by
adding foam at various rates.
[00183]     For the control experiment, pregelatinized corn starch was weighed into a
dry mix comprising stucco and HRA. Water, sodium trimetaphosphate 10% solution,
dispersant, and retarder were weighed into the mixing bowl of a Hobart Mixer. The
dry mix was poured into the mixing bowl of the Hobart Mixer, soaked for 15 seconds,
and mixed at speed II for 30 seconds. For foam preparation, a 0.5% solution of PFM
33 soap was formed, and then mixed with air to make the air foam. The air foam
was added to the slurry using a foam generator. The foam generator was run at a
rate sufficient to obtain the desired board density. After foam addition, the slurry was
immediately poured to a point slightly above the tops of the molds. The excess was
scraped as soon as the plaster set. The molds had been sprayed with mold release
(DW40).
[00184]     To make the lab cooked acid-modified corn starch (Clinton 277), the acid
modified corn starch was dispersed in water and heated to boiling for 10 min with

                                           56
continuous stirring. The starch solution was then cooled to 78 0 F (25 0C), and
transferred into the mixing bowl of a Hobart Mixer. Sodium trimetaphosphate 10%
solution, dispersant, and retarder were added to the mixing bowl of the Hobart Mixer
and mixed. A dry mix of stucco and HRA was poured into the starch solution,
soaked for 15 seconds, and mixed at speed II for 30 seconds. For foam preparation,
a 0.5% solution of PFM 33 soap was formed, and then mixed with air to make the air
foam. The air foam was added to the slurry using a foam generator. The foam
generator was run at a rate sufficient to obtain the desired board density. After foam
addition, the slurry was immediately poured to a point slightly above the tops of the
molds. The excess was scraped as soon as the plaster set. The molds had been
sprayed with mold release (DW40).
[00185]    After the cubes had hardened, the cubes were removed from the mold,
and then dried at 110OF (43 0C) for 48 hours. After removing from the oven, the
cubes were allowed to cool at room temperature for 1 hour. The compressive
strength was measured using a MTS system (Model # SATEC). The load was
applied continuously and without a shock at speed of 0.04 inch/min (1.02 mm/min)
(with a constant rate between 15 to 40 psi/s (103.4 to 275.8 kPa/s)).

[00186]     Traces for the two starch types are shown in FIG. 2, where density is
plotted along the horizontal axis and the strength is plotted along the vertical axis.
FIG. 2 shows that lab boiled acid-modified corn starch (Clinton 277) with a WSR of
0.9 provides cubes of higher compressive strength than pregelatinized corn starch
having a WSR of 1.0. This increased strength was observed for cube densities from
25 lb/ft3 to 40 lb/ft 3 (400 kg/M 3 to 721 kg/m 3 ). This Example suggests that
compositions comprising lab boiled acid-modified corn starch (Clinton 277) have
higher compressive strengths at low density and requires less water.
    EXAMPLE 14 - COLD WATER SOLUBLE PREGELATINIZED STARCH AND
                                 COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH
[00187]     This Example describes a method of forming the cold water soluble
pregelatinized starch (Clinton 277) using pilot-scale extrusion, and compressive
strength of cubes comprising the extruded pregelatinized starch.
[00188]     Accordingly, Clinton 277 acid-modified starch (9% moisture content, 100
kg) and water (4.4 kg) were mixed in a cylinder. The acid-modified starch mixture
was added to a Wenger TX 52 Twin Screw extruder. Additional water (8.1 kg) was
added to the extruder. The total moisture content in the extruder barrel was 20%.
The extrusion conditions are set forth below in Table 15. The pregelatinized starch
was removed from the extruder as a relatively dry, expanded material. The starch
was dried until it had a moisture content of about 10%, and then ground into a
powder. When used to make gypsum products, the dry powder can be added to the
dry ingredients during manufacture.

[00189]     The cold water solubility of the pregelatinized starch is measured by the
following method. A wet starch was formed by adding water (80 mL, room
temperature (25 0 C)) and dry starch (4.000g) to a beaker with stirring. The wet starch
was stirred for 20 min, and then transferred into a 100 mL graduated cylinder. Water
was added up to the 100 mL line, and then the cylinder was inverted three times to
mix the slurry. The wet starch was allowed to stand for 30 min at room temperature.
The supernatant (1Og) was transferred from the top of the slurry into a tared pan.
After the pan was heated overnight (43 0C), the remaining solids were weighed. The
solubility (%) of the starch is set forth in the equation below.
[00190]     Solubility (%) = Weight of soluble solid/(0.4 x 100)
[00191]     The cold water soluble extruded pregelatinized starch was used to prepare
cubes according to the procedure of Example 13. The cubes had a density of 54
lb/ft3 (865 kg/m 3 ). The cold water solubility of extruded starch (Clinton 277) showed
a significant impact on cube strength (Table 15). Granular starch is insoluble in
water and yields a cube with a compressive strength of 1561 psi (10.76 MPa).
However, pregelatinized starches prepared by extrusion were soluble in water and
yielded cubes with greater strength. The compressive strength of the cubes
increased as the cold water solubility of the starch increased. In addition, starting
with a starch having a lower moisture content (about 10%) resulted in greater water
solubility (up to 71%) and yielded a cube with greater compressive strength (1844
psi (12.71 MPa)) .

[00192]    The cold water soluble acid-modified pregelatinized starch and
pregelatinized corn starch were used to prepare cubes according to the procedure of
Example 13. The cubes had a density of 29 lb/ft3 (465 kg/m 3). The extruded starch
imparted greater cube strength than the conventional starch (Table 16). The fluidity
of gypsum foam slurry containing extruded Clinton 277 was increased by 26% and
the compressive strength of foamed cube containing extruded starch was increased
by 19%.

                             PREGELATINIZED STARCH
[00193]    This Example illustrates the cold water solubility of pregelatinized acid
modified starch (Clinton 277) made by bench-scale extrusion under various
conditions.
[00194]    Accordingly, acid-modified starch was subjected to extrusion using a
bench-scale extruder (Micro 18, Leistritz MIC). Starch and required water for
designated moisture content was mixed, sealed in plastic bag, and equilibrated
overnight. After overnight equilibration, the wet starch was fed into the extruder.

                                              60
The effect of the extruder temperature, moisture content of the starch (before
gelatinization), die opening size, and amount of tricalcium phosphate on solubility at
25 0C was examined (see Table 17). At small-scale, additive (tricalcium phosphate)
did not affect starch solubility. Factors increasing material flowability (such as high
moisture content and large die opening) were negatively related to starch solubility.
It was found that large scale tests can require lower moisture content and higher
extrusion temperatures (e.g., Example 14).
