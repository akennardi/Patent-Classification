                                            ABSTRACT
         Excessive or repeated activation of inflammatory and pro-coagulant mechanisms at
the site of tissue injury contributes to the development scar tissue that can lead to intimal
hyperplasia and fibrotic disease. It has been established that inhibition of the LYST protein is
associated with reduced inflammatory responses and reduced platelet activation at the site of
tissue damage. Compositions and methods for inhibition of the expression and function of the
LYST protein are described. The compositions and methods can be useful for the modulation
of immune processes that contribute to formation of neointima and fibroproliferative
disorders by altering macrophage, platelet and natural killer cell function to create a pro
regenerative immune response.

                     STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY
                 SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT
             This invention was made with Government Support under NIH grant
15   RO1 HL098228 awarded to Christopher Breuer by the National Institutes of
     Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention.
                             FIELD OF THE INVENTION
             The field of the invention is generally related to compositions,
     devices, and methods for enhancing vascular tissue regeneration, as well as
20   reducing morbidity and mortality associated with neointimal hyperplasia and
     fibroproliferative disease.
                       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
             Tissue repair is a complex, step-wise process that facilitates the
     ordered removal and replacement of dead or damaged cells in response to
25   stimulatory cytokine signaling from local pro-inflammatory cells at the site
     of injury (Wynn and Baron, Semin Liver Dis., 30(3):245-257 (2010) ; Wynn,
     Clin. Invest. 117:524-529 (2007)). However, when tissue-repair responses
     are inappropriate or persist for an extended period, for example, in response
     to chronic disease or repeated injury, the normal regenerative mechanisms
30   can give rise to pathological states resulting from excessive neotissue growth
     and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components at the site of
     injury.
                                             1

WO 2015/168674                                                          PCT/US2015/029014
              Excessive or repeated activation of inflammatory and pro-coagulant
     mechanisms at the site of vascular injury is thought to contribute
     significantly to the development of intimal hyperplasia. Under pathological
     conditions, vascular injury causes denudation of the endothelial layer and
 5   triggers a series of acute and chronic inflammatory responses characterized
     by production of various growth factors and inflammatory cytokines
     (Murakami, et al., Am JPhysiolLung Cell Mol Physiol., 272: L197-L202
     (1997); Cotran, et al., J Am Soc Nephrol., 1:225-235 (1990)). Intimal
     hyperplasia occurring after surgical procedures such as angioplasty and
10   stenting, surgical bypasses or endarterectomy for coronary and/or peripheral
     arterial disease can cause restenosis of blood vessels in up to 80% of patients
     (Seedial, et al., J Vasc Surg., 57(5):1403-1414 (2013); Glagov, Circulation,
     89:2888-2891 (1994)). It has been shown that neointima formation can be
     accelerated by the presence of foreign material such as prostheses within
15   blood vessels, and uncontrolled neointimal hyperplasia is a major obstacle
     limiting the long-term clinical efficiency of cardiovascular intervention
     (Frank, et al., Curr. Opin. Lipidol., 15:523 (2004)). In addition, neointima
     formation is associated with the development and progression of several
     proliferative cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension,
20   and diabetic vascular complications.
              Regeneration of the endothelial layer inhibits the development of
     neointima and facilitates vascular repair (Bauters, et al., Prog.Cardiovasc.
     Dis., 40:107-116 (1997); Kinlay, et al., Curr.Opin. Lipidol., 12:383 (2001)).
     However, currently available anti-neointimal drugs indiscriminately block
25   the proliferation of both endothelial cells (EC) and smooth muscle cells
     (SMC) resulting in impaired re-endothelialization and prolonging the wound
     healing process. There remains a need to develop an anti-proliferation
      strategy that is SMC-sensitive.
              Unregulated inflammatory responses to repeated tissue damage can
30    also give rise to pathological fibrosis of tissue and organs such as the skin,
      liver, heart and lung (Huang and Ogawa, Connect Tissue Res., 53(3):187-196
      (2012)). Chronic damage and inflammation of liver tissue leads to the
      accumulation of ECM proteins that cause excessive scar formation and
                                              2

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
     distort the hepatic architecture, which in turn leads to cirrhosis and liver
     failure (Battler and Brenner, JClin Invest., 115:209-218 (2005)). Likewise,
     excessive deposition of fibrotic tissue within the lung gives rise to
     progressive scarring and irreversible destruction of lung architecture that
 5   ultimately leads to organ malfunction, disruption of gas exchange, and death
     from respiratory failure.
              Activated platelets increase leukocyte adhesion to the damaged
     endothelium and promote leukocyte activation through deposition of
     chemokines on the endothelium. This enables leukocytes to firmly attach to
10   the vessel wall and transmigrate into the subendothelial tissue. However, the
     platelet-derived chemokines are also known to play a role in neointimal
     proliferation, restenosis after arterial injury and atherosclerosis
     (Chandrasekar, et al., JAm College Cardiology,Vol 35, No. 3, pp. 555-562
     (2000)). Certain patient groups having abnormal platelet function, including
15   those with renal disease, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, are also at
     increased risk for restenosis.
              Fibroproliferative disorders are a leading cause of morbidity and
     mortality in the United States (Bitterman and Henke, Chest, 99(3):s81-s84
     (1991)). In particular, hepatic and pulmonary fibrotic diseases are typically
20   refractory to treatment and carry a high mortality rate. Established liver
     cirrhosis has a 10-year mortality rate of 3 4-66%, and is responsible for
     approximately 27,000 deaths each year in the United States alone. The
     prevalence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is estimated at between 14
     and 42.7 per 100,000, and this figure has been rising decade after decade for
25   the last 30 years (Olson, et al., Am JRespir Crit Care Med. 176:277-2843
     (2007); Gribbin, et al., Thorax, 61:980-985 (2006)). Currently, the most
     effective treatment for hepatic or pulmonary fibrosis is organ transplantation.
              Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide compositions,
      devices, grafts, and methods of use thereof for modulating immune processes
30   to reduce or prevent neointima formation, stenosis, restenosis or a
      combination thereof in a subject.
              It is also an object of the invention to provide compositions, devices,
      grafts, and methods of use thereof to reduce or prevent inappropriate or

     deleterious platelet activation in a subject.
              It is also an object of the invention to provide compositions, methods,
     and devices for reducing or preventing the immune response to an
     implantable prosthesis in a subject.
 5            It is a further object of the invention to provide compositions,
     methods, and devices to promote healing and inhibit scar formation,
     adhesions and fibroproliferative diseases in a subject.
                             SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
              It has been established that inhibition of the lysosomal trafficking
10   regulator ("LYST") protein is associated with reduced inflammatory
     responses at the site of tissue damage. Compositions and methods for
     inhibition of the expression and function of the LYST protein are described.
     The compositions and methods can be useful for the modulation of immune
     processes that contribute to formation of neointima and fibroproliferative
15   disorders by altering macrophage, platelet and natural killer cell function to
     create a pro-regenerative immune response.
               Compositions including one or more LYST inhibitors in an amount
     effective to reduce or prevent the formation of scar tissue in a subject are
     disclosed. Compositions including one or more LYST inhibitors in an
20    amount effective to reduce or prevent the activation of platelets in a subject
      are also disclosed.
               Typically the compositions include a physiologically acceptable
      carrier. In preferred embodiments, the amount of one or more LYST
      inhibitors does not prevent vascular neotissue formation in the subject.
25    Typically, the compositions include one or more LYST inhibitors in an
      amount between 0.1-1000 mg/kg body weight of a human.
               In one embodiment one or more LYST inhibitors is an antibody.
               In another embodiment one or more LYST inhibitors is a functional
      nucleic acid. Exemplary functional nucleic acids include an antisense
30    molecule, siRNA, miRNA, aptamers, ribozymes, triplex forming molecules,
      RNAi, and external guide sequences. The one or more functional nucleic
      acids can be expressed from an expression vector.

              In some embodiments the compositions of one or more LYST
     inhibitors include a delivery vehicle. Exemplary delivery vehicles include
     nanoparticles, microparticles, micelles, synthetic lipoprotein particles,
     liposomes, and carbon nanotubes. The disclosed compositions can also

     medical devices including one or more LYST inhibitors are disclosed. In
     some embodiments the composition of one or more LYST inhibitors is
     coated onto or incorporated into the graft or device. Exemplary medical
     devices include stents, implants, needles, cannulas, catheters, shunts,
10   balloons, and valves. The medical device can be a stent, such as a drug
     eluting stent that elutes the composition of one or more LYST inhibitors.
     Exemplary vascular grafts include autologous, preserved autologous,
     allogeneic, xenogenic or synthetic grafts.
              Methods for reducing or preventing the formation of scar tissue in a
15   subject, including administering to a subject in need thereof a composition
     including one or more LYST inhibitors are also provided. Methods for
     reducing or preventing the development of venous thrombosis or arterial
     thrombosis in a subject include administering to a subject in need thereof a
     composition including one or more LYST inhibitors. In some embodiments
20   the subject is at risk of developing, or has developed, restenosis or other
     vascular proliferation disorders. In further embodiments the subject has
     undergone, is undergoing, or will undergo vascular trauma, angioplasty,
     vascular surgery, or transplantation arteriopathy. The methods can promote
     healing, reduce or prevent the development of hypertrophic scarring, keloids,
25   or adhesions, reduce or prevent fibrosis of the liver, fibrosis of the lungs,
     fibrosis of the heart or fibrosis of the kidneys, reduces or prevents neointima
     formation, stenosis or restenosis, or any combination thereof in the subject
     relative to an untreated control subject. The methods can promote
     integration but block encapsulation of one or more prosthetic devices such as
30   pacemakers, nerve stimulators, pacemaker leads, replacement heart valves
     and artificial joints or components thereof. The methods can be effective to
     treat or prevent neointima formation at a site of implantation of a vascular
     implant, a site of vascular injury, or a site of surgery in the subject, relative
                                               5

     to an untreated control subject. The methods can be effective to reduce or
     prevent the expression of platelet derived growth factor, transforming growth
     factor beta, or any combination thereof in a subject relative to an untreated

                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 5   I.      Definitions
             Theterm "stenosis" refers to an abnormal narrowing in a blood vessel
     that occurs following an injury to the vessel wall (endothelium). In some
     embodiments, stenosis involves a reduction in the circumference of a lumen
     of 50% or more. The term "restenosis" refers to stenosis at a previously
10   stenotic site or narrowing of the lumen of a blood vessel or synthetic graft
     following an interventional procedure. Restenosis, as used herein,
     encompasses occlusion. Exemplary injuries that result in stenosis or
     restenosis include trauma to an atherosclerotic lesion (as seen with
     angioplasty or stent), a resection of a lesion (as seen with endarterectomy),
15   an external trauma (e.g., a cross-clamping injury), or a surgical anastomosis.
             The term "neointimal stenosis" refers to abnormal narrowing in a
     blood vessel resulting from neointimal formation.
             The term "neointima" refers to a renewed or thickened layer of intima
     (inner lining) formed in a blood vessel in response to signals from injured
20   endothelial cells.
             The terms "scar tissue" and "scarring" refer to the fibrous tissue that
     is produced to replace damaged tissue following injury.
             The terms "fibroproliferative disorders", "FPD" and "fibrotic diseases
     are used interchangeably and include benign and malignant diseases or
25   conditions that result from the abnormal and excessive deposition of
     connective tissue.
             The term "Platelet Activation" is the step-wise physiological process
     that gives rise to adherence and aggregation of circulating platelets in
     response to tissue injury, such as damage or interruption of the endothelium.
30   Platelet activation gives rise to expression and secretion of chemotactic
     agents such as platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming
     growth factor beta (TGFp).

             "Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" encompasses any of the
     standard pharmaceutical carriers, such as a phosphate buffered saline
     solution, water and emulsions such as an oil/water or water/oil emulsion, and
     various types of wetting agents.
 5           "Inhibit" or other forms of the word such as "inhibiting" or
     "inhibition" means to hinder or restrain a particular characteristic. It is
     understood that this is typically in relation to some standard or expected
     value, i.e., it is relative, but that it is not always necessary for the standard or
     relative value to be referred to. For example, "inhibits LYST" means
10   hindering, interfering with or restraining the activity of the LYST gene
     relative to a standard or a control. "Inhibits LYST" can also mean to hinder
     or restrain the synthesis, expression or function of the LYST protein relative
     to a standard or control.
             "Treatment" or "treating" means to administer a composition to a
15   subject or a system with an undesired condition (e.g., restenosis or a
     fibroproliferative disorder). The condition can include a disease.
     "Prevention" or "preventing" means to administer a composition to a subject
     or a system at risk for the condition. The condition can be a predisposition to
     a disease. The effect of the administration of the composition to the subject
20   (either treating and/or preventing) can be, but is not limited to, the cessation
     of a particular symptom of a condition, a reduction or prevention of the
     symptoms of a condition, a reduction in the severity of the condition, the
     complete ablation of the condition, a stabilization or delay of the
     development or progression of a particular event or characteristic, or
25   minimization of the chances that a particular event or characteristic will
     occur.
             As used herein, the term "antibody" is used in the broadest sense
     unless clearly indicated otherwise. Therefore, an "antibody" can be naturally
      occurring or man-made, such as monoclonal antibodies produced by
30    conventional hybridoma technology. Antibodies include monoclonal and
     polyclonal antibodies as well as fragments containing the antigen-binding
      domain and/or one or more complementarity determining regions of these
      antibodies. "Antibody" refers to any form of antibody or antigen binding
                                                   8

     I.       Compositions
 5            It has been established that the processes of tissue repair can be
     mediated by manipulation of the expression and function of the LYST gene.
     Specifically, the loss of function of the LYST gene product gives rise to
     abnormal function in certain immune cells, resulting in immune dis-function
     and an associated reduction in proliferative disorders. Immune cells that can
10   be influenced by modulation of the LYST gene or LYST protein include
     innate immune cells, macrophages and platelets.
                      Innate Immune Cells
              Innate immune processes including inflammation, removal of
     damaged cells and debris, as well as the development of neotissue and other
15   wound repair mechanisms are an important component of the physiological
     responses to injury. Tissue repair has four distinct stages, including: a)
     clotting/coagulation; b) inflammation; c) fibroblast migration/proliferation;
     and d) a final remodeling phase where normal tissue architecture is restored.
     In the earliest stages after tissue damage, epithelial cells and/or endothelial
20   cells release inflammatory mediators that initiate an antifibrinolytic
     coagulation cascade that triggers clotting and development of a provisional
     extracellular matrix (ECM). Aggregation and subsequent degranulation of
     platelets promotes blood vessel dilation and increased permeability, allowing
     efficient recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, macrophages,
25   lymphocytes, and eosinophils to the damaged tissue. Neutrophils are the
     most abundant inflammatory cell at the earliest stages of wound healing, but
     are quickly replaced by macrophages after neutrophil degranulation.
     Activated macrophages and neutrophils debride the wound, eliminate any
     invading organisms and produce a variety of cytokines and chemokines that
30   amplify the inflammatory response as well as trigger fibroblast proliferation
     and recruitment. Upon activation, fibroblasts transform into myofibroblasts

     temporary matrix to regenerate the damaged tissue. Thus, healing and
     neotissue generation is a finely regulated process that balances the need to

 5                    Macrophages
              It has been shown that the presence of circulating monocytes and
     infiltrating macrophages is critical for wound healing and neotissue
     development (Arras, et al., J Clin Invest, 101(1): 40-50 (1998)). However,
     the extent of macrophage infiltration at a site of tissue damage has also been
10   correlated with proliferative dysregulation and neointima formation (Hibino,
     et al., FASEB J. 25(12):4253-63 (2011)). Further, numerous studies have
     indicated that macrophages and fibroblasts are the main effector cells
     involved in the pathogenesis of fibrosis (reviewed in Wynn, Nat Rev
     Immunol. 4(8):583-94 (2004)).
15            Following vascular damage, inflammatory monocyte cells (CD 16-hi,
     CD64-hi and CD14-hi in humans; CD 115+, CD1 lb+ and Ly6c-hi in mice)
     are recruited to the damaged tissue and differentiate into activated
     macrophages (Emrl-hi in humans; F4/80-hi in mice) upon exposure to local
      growth factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines and microbial compounds
20    (Geissmann et al., Science 327: 656-661 (2010)). Excessive macrophage
     infiltration results in stenosis, whilst complete inhibition of macrophage
     infiltration prevents neotissue formation (Hibino, et al., FASEB J.
     25(12):4253-63 (2011).
              Two distinct states of polarized activation for macrophages have been
25    defined: the classically activated (Ml) macrophage phenotype and the
      alternatively activated (M2) macrophage phenotype (Gordon and Taylor,
     Nat. Rev. Immunol. 5: 953-964 (2005); Mantovani et al., Trends Immunol.
      23: 549-555 (2002)). The role of the classically activated (M1) macrophage
      is an effector cell in TH1 cellular immune responses, whereas the
30    alternatively activated (M2) macrophage appears to be involved in
      immunosuppression and wound healing/tissue repair. M1 and M2
      macrophages have distinct chemokine and chemokine receptor profiles, with
      M1 secreting the TH1 cell-attracting chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, and
                                               10

WO 2015/168674                                                          PCT/US2015/029014
     with M2 macrophages expressing chemokines CCL 17, CCL22 and CCL24.
              The presence of M2 macrophages has been associated with neo
     intima development and stenosis (Hibino, et al., FASEB J. 25(12):4253-63
     (2011)). The correlation between the extent of macrophage infiltration,
 5   neotissue formation and stenosis at certain time points following tissue graft
     implantation provides means to prevent stenosis through modulation of
     macrophage activity.
              Further, macrophages are typically located close to collagen
     producing myofibroblast cells, and it has been shown that monocyte-derived
10   macrophages critically perpetuate inflammatory responses after injury as a
     prerequisite for fibrosis (Wynn and Barron, Semin Liver Dis., 30(3):245-257
     (2010)). Macrophages produce pro-fibrotic mediators that activate
     fibroblasts, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent
     chemotactic agent, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B).
15   Specifically, a marked increase of the non-classical M2 (CD14+, CD16+)
     subset of macrophages has been correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines
     and clinical progression in patients suffering from chronic liver disease.
     During fibrosis progression, monocyte-derived macrophages release
     cytokines perpetuating chronic inflammation as well as directly activate
20   hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), resulting in their proliferation and trans
     differentiation into collagen-producing myofibroblasts (Zimmermann, et al.,
     PLOS One, 5(6):e11049 (2010)).
                      Platelets
              Aggregated platelets assist the repair of blood vessels by secreting
25   chemicals that attract fibroblasts from surrounding connective tissue into the
     wounded area to heal the wound or, in the case of dysregulated inflammatory
     responses, form scar tissue. In response to tissue injury, platelets become
     activated and release a multitude of growth factors which stimulate the
     deposition of extracellular matrix, such as platelet-derived growth factor
30    (PDGF), a potent chemotactic agent, as well as transforming growth factor
     beta (TGF-$). Both of these growth factors have been shown to play a
      significant role in the repair and regeneration of connective tissues. PDGF
      functions as a primary mitogen and chemo-attractant which significantly
                                              11

WO 2015/168674                                                          PCT/US2015/029014
     augments the influx of fibroblasts and inflammatory cells, as well as
     stimulating cell proliferation and gene expression. PDGF enables leukocytes
     to firmly attach to the vessel wall and finally to transmigrate into the
     subendothelial tissue. However, the platelet-derived chemokines are also
 5   known to induce smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and play a role in
     neointimal proliferation and organ fibrosis (Chandrasekar, et al., JAm
     College Cardiology,Vol 35, No. 3, pp. 555-562 (2000)). Increased
     expression of PDGF and its receptors is associated with scleroderma lung
     and skin tissue. Specifically, there is evidence for an autocrine PDGF
10   receptor mediated signaling loop in scleroderma lung and skin fibroblasts,
     implicating both TGF-p and PDGF pathways in chronic fibrosis in
     scleroderma (Trojanowska, Rheumatology;47:v2-v4 (2008)). In addition,
     deregulation of PDGF signaling is associated with cardiovascular indications
     such as pulmonary hypertension, and atherosclerosis.
15           Media layer smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration in
     response to injury-induced PDGF are essential events contributing to
     neointimal thickening (Fingerle, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci., 86:8412 (1989);
     Clowes, et al., Circ. Res., 56:139-145 (1985)) which eventually leads to
     blood vessel narrowing and stenosis.
20           Other healing-associated growth factors released by platelets include
     basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, platelet-derived
     epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor.
             Thus, inhibitors of the LYST gene and LYST protein can create a
     pro-regenerative immune environment that enhances wound healing and
25   prevents proliferative disorders such as intimal hyperplasia, development of
      excessive scar tissue and fibrotic disease. Modulation of LYST can also
     modulate platelet activity and function. Thus, inhibitors of the LYST gene
      and/or LYST protein can be used to reduce or prevent the biological
      functions of platelets, such as platelet aggregation and the
30   production/expression of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF).
             Compositions for promoting tissue regeneration and preventing or
      reducing diseases characterized by the formation of excessive scar tissue by
      blockade of expression and/or function of the LYST protein are disclosed.

             A.      LYST
             The lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene product is an
     ubiquitous protein associated with the transport of intracellular material to
     the lysosome. It has been established that mutations which reduce or inhibit
  5  the function of the LYST protein interfere with the normal functions of
     macrophages and also impact the biological activities of natural killer (NK)
     cells and platelets. It is believed that modulation of the LYST protein
     provides a means to modulate immune processes that give rise to vascular
     proliferative disorders, neointima formation, fibrosis and excessive scarring.
 10                  1.        The LYST Gene
             The human LYST gene is located at chromosome 1, (segment
      1q42.1-q42.2; base pairs 235,661,030 to 235,883,707) (Barrat, et al., Am. J
     Hum. Genet, 59:625-632 (1996)). Nucleic acid sequences for the LYST gene
     product are known in the art. See, for example, NCBI Reference Sequence:
 15  NM_000081.3, Homo sapiens lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST),
     transcript variant 1, mRNA, which provides the nucleic acid sequence:

                     2.    The LYST Protein
             The LYST polypeptide is a 3,801 amino acid cytoplasmic protein
     (also known as lysosomal trafficking regulator, CHS protein, CHS 1 or LYST
40   protein) with a molecular weight of approximately 429 kDa (Barbosa, et al.,
     Nature, 382(6588): 262-265 (1996)).

     The LYST protein exists as one of three isoforms and is predicted to adopt a
     helical structure (Barbosa, et al., Nature, 382(6588): 262-265 (1996)).
             The LYST protein is highly conserved across mammalian species and
     is expressed at low levels in all cell types, but is abundantly expressed in
 5   adult and fetal thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, bone marrow and
     several regions of adult brain (see review by Dotta, et al., OrphanetJournal
     ofRare Diseases, 8:168 (2013), and references therein).
             Amino acid sequences of the human LYST protein are known in the
     art. See, for example, GenBank Accession No. U67615:

     (SEQ ID NO: 2)
             LYST polypeptides that have at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or
     100% amino acid sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 2 are disclosed.
             Although the LYST protein has been associated with many diverse
10   cellular activities, particularly in intracellular protein trafficking in
     endosomes and lysosomes, the biological function of the LYST protein has
     remained largely unknown.
             Abnormal expression and function of the LYST gene product has
     been implicated in numerous pathological disorders, including autoimmune
15   diseases, hyperproliferative disorders and platelet dysfunction. Specifically,
     mutations in the LYST gene are associated with the human disease Chediak
     Higashi syndrome (CHS) (Barrat, et al., Am. J Hum. Genet, 59:625-632
     (1996)). In the CHS patient, the LYST gene contains a frame-shift mutation
     at nucleotides 117-118 of the coding domain.
20           CHS is a rare lysosomal storage disorder characterized by
     hypopigmentation, severe immunologic deficiency, a bleeding tendency,
     neurologic abnormalities, abnormal intracellular transport to and from the
     lysosome and giant inclusion bodies in a variety of cell types. At least 30
     mutations in the LYST gene have been identified in people with Chediak
25   Higashi syndrome. These mutations impair the normal function of the
     lysosomal trafficking regulator protein, which disrupts the size, structure,
     and function of Iysosomes and related structures within cells. People with
     LYST mutations have abnormally large lysosomes and related structures in
     cells throughout the body. These enlarged structures interfere with normal
30   cell functions. Enlarged lysosomes in immune system cells, such as
     macrophages, prevent these cells from responding appropriately to bacteria
     and other foreign invaders; large perinuclear lysosomes are arranged in a
     tubular fashion within the macrophage cells of persons with CHS. Affected
     neutrophils and monocytes have a chemotactic and migratory capacity that is
                                               27

WO 2015/168674                                                         PCT/US2015/029014
      about 40% that of normal cells. Affected patients also have a tendency to
      bleeding due to platelet dysfunction. As a result of decreased responsiveness
      to chemotactic stimuli, the malfunctioning immune system cannot protect the
      body from severe, recurrent infections. CHS is often fatal because patients
 5    are immunocompromised and are incapable of mounting an effective
      immune response to infection.
              In the Beige (Bg) mouse strain the mouse homologue of LYST
      ("Lyst") is disrupted by a deletion that precludes the expression of functional
     Lyst protein. Bg mice were found to exhibit reduced proliferative diseases,
10    including a lower rate of stenosis following implantation of vascular tissue
      grafts, as compared to wild-type mice. The effect of the dysfunctional Lyst
     protein in Bg mice is highly macrophage-specific, as determined by bone
     marrow transplant experiments (see Examples).
              C.       Inhibitors of LYST
15            It has been established that blockade of the LYST protein can reduce
     or prevent immune processes that give rise to vascular proliferative
     disorders, fibroproliferative disease and excessive scar tissue following
     injury. Immuno-modulatory agents that inhibit or reduce the transcription,
     translation or function of the LYST protein are disclosed.
20            Inhibitors of LYST can bind to the LYST gene or to LYST protein
     and directly or indirectly block the biological function of LYST protein.
     Inhibitors can also block the biological function of one or more signaling
     pathways that constitute the down-stream biological function of LYST. In
     some embodiments, inhibitors of LYST act by preventing endogenous
25   ligands of the LYST protein from interacting with or binding directly to the
     LYST protein. The inhibitors can block protein-protein interactions
     involving the LYST protein, or they can prevent or reduce the functional
     activity of a complex of the LYST protein and a ligand. Inhibitors that bind
     directly to the LYST protein may act by direct occlusion of an active site on
30   the LYST protein, or through indirect occlusion, such as by stearic blockade
     of LYST interactions. For example, in some embodiments the inhibitor
     obstructs or occludes the function of a protein interaction domain, such as
     the solenoid protein domain formed by tandem copies of the WD40 repeat
                                              28

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
     motif. In other embodiments, inhibitors bind to a location that is spatially
     distinct from an active site.
             Inhibitors that bind to the LYST protein can prevent LYST function
     by mechanisms including, but not limited to, inducing dimerization, inducing
 5   oligomerization, inducing conformational changes, preventing catalytic
     functions, inducing degradation, inducing uptake by immune cells,
     preventing uptake by target cells, preventing ligand binding, preventing
     phosphorylation, inducing denaturation, preventing one or more post
     translational modifications or otherwise altering the native tertiary structure
10   of the LYST protein.
             It is understood that initiation or transduction of cellular signaling
     pathways by LYST can require binding of a ligand to the LYST protein.
     Therefore, proteins, antibodies or small molecules that block signal
     transduction pathways involving LYST and optionally prevent co-ligation of
15   LYST and its receptors are useful immune-modulatory agents. Classes of
     LYST inhibitors discussed below include antibodies and functional nucleic
     acids.
                      1.      Antibodies
             Antibodies that inhibit the function of LYST by binding directly to
20   the LYST protein, its ligands or its accessory molecules are disclosed. Any
     specific antibody can be used in the methods and compositions provided
     herein. Antibodies can include an antigen binding site that binds to an
     epitope on the LYST protein. Binding of an antibody to LYST can inhibit or
     reduce the function of the LYST protein via one or more distinct
25   mechanisms.
             In some embodiments, the antibody or antigen binding fragment
     binds specifically to an epitope within the protein encoded by the amino acid
      sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. The epitope can be a linear epitope and can
      include one or more consecutive amino acids of the primary sequence of
30    SEQ ID NO: 2. In other embodiments, the antibody or antigen binding
      fragment thereof can bind a conformational epitope that includes a 3-D
      surface feature, shape, or tertiary structure of the LYST protein. In some
      embodiments, a 3-D surface feature can include any number of amino acids
                                              29

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
     from SEQ ID NO: 2, or the corresponding residues in a homolog, ortholog,
     paralog, or variant thereof.
              In some embodiments, the antibody or antigen binding fragment that
     binds specifically to an epitope within the protein encoded by the amino acid
  5  sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 can only bind if the protein encoded by the
     amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 is not bound by a ligand or small
     molecule.
              Various types of antibodies and antibody fragments can be used in the
     disclosed compositions and methods, including whole immunoglobulin of
10   any class, fragments thereof, and synthetic proteins containing at least the
     antigen binding variable domain of an antibody. The antibody can be an IgG
     antibody, such as IgG1, IgG2 , IgG 3 , or IgG 4 . An antibody can be in the form
     of an antigen binding fragment including a Fab fragment, F(ab')2 fragment, a
     single chain variable region, and the like. Antibodies can be polyclonal or
15   monoclonal (mAb). Monoclonal antibodies include "chimeric" antibodies in
     which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or
     homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a
     particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass,
     while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to
20   corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or
     belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such
     antibodies, so long as they specifically bind the target antigen and/or exhibit
     the desired biological activity (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; and Morrison, et
     al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81: 6851-6855 (1984)). The disclosed
25   antibodies can also be modified by recombinant means, for example by
     deletions, additions or substitutions of amino acids, to increase efficacy of
     the antibody in mediating the desired function. Substitutions can be
     conservative substitutions. For example, at least one amino acid in the
      constant region of the antibody can be replaced with a different residue (see,
 30   e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,624,821; U.S. Patent No. 6,194,551; WO 9958572;
      and Angal, et al., Mol. Immunol. 30:105-08 (1993)). In some cases changes
      are made to reduce undesired activities, e.g., complement-dependent
      cytotoxicity. The antibody can be a bi-specific antibody having binding
                                              30

WO 2015/168674                                                            PCT/US2015/029014
     specificities for at least two different antigenic epitopes. In one embodiment,
     the epitopes are from the same antigen. In another embodiment, the epitopes
     are from two different antigens. Bi-specific antibodies can include bi-specific
     antibody fragments (see, e.g., Hollinger, et al., Proc.Nat. Acad Sci. US.A.,
 5   90:6444-48 (1993); Gruber, et al., J Immunol., 152:5368 (1994)).
              A variety of antibodies that bind the human LYST protein are
     commercially available from multiple sources, for example, Santa Cruz
     Biotechnology, CA, USA, Cat. No. sc-136746). Antibodies can be generated
     by any means known in the art. Exemplary descriptions means for antibody
10   generation and production include Delves, Antibody Production: Essential
     Techniques (Wiley, 1997); Shephard, et al., Monoclonal Antibodies (Oxford
     University Press, 2000); Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles And
     Practice (Academic Press, 1993); and Current Protocols In Immunology
     (John Wiley & Sons, most recent edition). Fragments of intact Ig molecules
15   can be generated using methods well known in the art, including enzymatic
     digestion and recombinant means.
                      2.       Functional Nucleic Acids
              Functional nucleic acids that inhibit the transcription, translation or
     function of LYST gene products are disclosed. Functional nucleic acids are
20   nucleic acid molecules that have a specific function, such as binding a target
     molecule or catalyzing a specific reaction. As discussed in more detail
     below, functional nucleic acid molecules can be divided into the following
     non-limiting categories: antisense molecules, siRNA, miRNA, aptamers,
     ribozymes, triplex forming molecules, RNAi, and external guide sequences.
25    The functional nucleic acid molecules can act as effectors, inhibitors,
     modulators, and stimulators of a specific activity possessed by a target
     molecule, or the functional nucleic acid molecules can possess a de novo
      activity independent of any other molecules.
              Functional nucleic acid molecules can interact with any
30    macromolecule, such as DNA, RNA, polypeptides, or carbohydrate chains.
      Thus, functional nucleic acids can interact with the mRNA or the genomic
      DNA of the LYST polypeptide or they can interact with the LYST
      polypeptide itself. Functional nucleic acids are often designed to interact
                                               31

WO 2015/168674                                                          PCT/US2015/029014
     with other nucleic acids based on sequence homology between the target
     molecule and the functional nucleic acid molecule. In other situations, the
     specific recognition between the functional nucleic acid molecule and the
     target molecule is not based on sequence homology between the functional
 5   nucleic acid molecule and the target molecule, but rather is based on the
     formation of tertiary structure that allows specific recognition to take place.
     Therefore the disclosed compositions can include one or more functional
     nucleic acids designed to reduce expression or function of the LYST protein.
              In some embodiments, the composition includes a functional nucleic
10   acid or polypeptide designed to target and reduce or inhibit expression or
     translation of LYST mRNA; or to reduce or inhibit expression, reduce
     activity, or increase degradation of LYST protein. In some embodiments,
     the composition includes a vector suitable for in vivo expression of the
     functional nucleic acid.
15            In some embodiments, a functional nucleic acid or polypeptide is

               In other embodiments, a functional nucleic acid or polypeptide is
      designed to target a segment of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1,
      or the complement thereof, or variants thereof having a nucleic acid

WO 2015/168674                                                            PCT/US2015/029014
              Methods of making and using vectors for in vivo expression of the
     disclosed functional nucleic acids such as antisense oligonucleotides, siRNA,
     shRNA, miRNA, EGSs, ribozymes, and aptamers are known in the art.
                              i.     Antisense Molecules
 5            The functional nucleic acids can be antisense molecules. Antisense
     molecules are designed to interact with a target nucleic acid molecule
     through either canonical or non-canonical base pairing. The interaction of the
     antisense molecule and the target molecule is designed to promote the
     destruction of the target molecule through, for example, RNAse H mediated
10   RNA-DNA hybrid degradation. Alternatively the antisense molecule is
     designed to interrupt a processing function that normally would take place on
     the target molecule, such as transcription or replication. Antisense molecules
     can be designed based on the sequence of the target molecule. There are
     numerous methods for optimization of antisense efficiency by finding the
15   most accessible regions of the target molecule. Exemplary methods include
      in vitro selection experiments and DNA modification studies using DMS and
     DEPC. It is preferred that antisense molecules bind the LYST target
     molecule with a dissociation constant (Kd) less than or equal to 10-6, 10-1,
      10-", or 10-2.
20                            ii.     Aptamers
               The functional nucleic acids can be aptamers. Aptamers are
      molecules that interact with a target molecule, preferably in a specific way.
      Typically aptamers are small nucleic acids ranging from 15-50 bases in
      length that fold into defined secondary and tertiary structures, such as stem
25    loops or G-quartets. Aptamers can bind small molecules, such as ATP and
      theophiline, as well as large molecules, such as reverse transcriptase and
      thrombin. Aptamers can bind very tightly with Kd's from the target molecule
      of less than 10-1 M. It is preferred that the aptamers bind the LYST target
      molecule with a Kd less than 10-6,    10~8, 1044, or 10~1. Aptamers can bind
30    the target molecule with a very high degree of specificity. For example,
      aptamers have been isolated that have greater than a 10,000 fold difference
      in binding affinities between the target molecule and another molecule that
      differ at only a single position on the molecule. It is preferred that the
                                              33

WO 2015/168674                                                              PCT/US2015/029014
     aptamer have a Kd with the LYST target molecule at least 10, 100, 1000,
     10,000, or 100,000 fold lower than the Kd with a background binding
     molecule. It is preferred when doing the comparison for a molecule such as a
     polypeptide, that the background molecule be a different polypeptide.
  5                           iii.     Ribozymes
              The functional nucleic acids can be ribozymes. Ribozymes are
     nucleic acid molecules that are capable of catalyzing a chemical reaction,
     either intra-molecularly or inter-molecularly. It is preferred that the
     ribozymes catalyze intermolecular reactions. Different types of ribozymes
10   that catalyze nuclease or nucleic acid polymerase-type reactions which are
     based on ribozymes found in natural systems, such as hammerhead
     ribozymes are disclosed. Ribozymes that are not found in natural systems,
     but which have been engineered to catalyze specific reactions de novo are
     also disclosed. Preferred ribozymes cleave RNA or DNA substrates, and
15   more preferably cleave RNA substrates. Ribozymes typically cleave nucleic
      acid substrates through recognition and binding of the target substrate with
      subsequent cleavage. This recognition is often based mostly on canonical or
     non-canonical base pair interactions. This property makes ribozymes
     particularly good candidates for targeting specific cleavage of nucleic acids
20   because recognition of the target substrate is based on the target substrates
      sequence.
                              iv.      Triplex Forming Oligonucleotides
              The functional nucleic acids can be triplex forming oligonucleotide
      molecules. Triplex forming functional nucleic acid molecules are molecules
25    that can interact with either double-stranded or single-stranded nucleic acid.
      When triplex molecules interact with a target region, a structure called a
      triplex is formed in which there are three strands of DNA forming a complex
      dependent on both Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen base-pairing. Triplex
      molecules are preferred because they can bind target regions with high
 30   affinity and specificity. It is preferred that the triplex forming molecules bind
      the target molecule with a Kd less than 10-', 10-', 10      , or 10-.
                                                34

WO 2015/168674                                                        PCT/US2015/029014
                             v.      External Guide Sequences
              The functional nucleic acids can be external guide sequences.
     External guide sequences (EGSs) are molecules that bind a target nucleic
     acid molecule forming a complex, which is recognized by RNase P, which
  5  then cleaves the target molecule. EGSs can be designed to specifically target
     a RNA molecule of choice. RNAse P aids in processing transfer RNA
     (tRNA) within a cell. Bacterial RNAse P can be recruited to cleave virtually
     any RNA sequence by using an EGS that causes the target RNA:EGS
     complex to mimic the natural tRNA substrate. Similarly, eukaryotic
10   EGS/RNAse P-directed cleavage of RNA can be utilized to cleave desired
     targets within eukaryotic cells. Representative examples of how to make and
     use EGS molecules to facilitate cleavage of a variety of different target
     molecules are known in the art.
                             vi.     RNA Interference
15            In some embodiments, the functional nucleic acids induce gene
      silencing through RNA interference (siRNA). Expression of the LYST gene
      can be effectively silenced in a highly specific manner through RNA
      interference.
              Gene silencing was originally observed with the addition of double
20    stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Fire, et al. (1998) Nature, 391:806-11; Napoli, et
      al. (1990) Plant Cell 2:279-89; Hannon, (2002) Nature, 418:244-51). Once
      dsRNA enters a cell, it is cleaved by an RNase III-like enzyme called Dicer,
      into double stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNA) 21-23 nucleotides in
      length that contain 2 nucleotide overhangs on the 3' ends (Elbashir, et al.,
25    Genes Dev., 15:188-200 (2001); Bernstein, et al., Nature, 409:363-6 (2001);
      Hammond, et al., Nature, 404:293-6 (2000); Nykanen, et al., Cell, 107:309
      21 (2001); Martinez, et al., Cell, 110:563-74 (2002)). The effect of iRNA or
      siRNA or their use is not limited to any type of mechanism.
              In one embodiment, a siRNA triggers the specific degradation of
 30   homologous LYST RNA molecules, such as LYST mRNAs, within the
      region of sequence identity between both the siRNA and the target LYST
      RNA.
                                             35

WO 2015/168674                                                          PCT/US2015/029014
               Sequence specific gene silencing can be achieved in mammalian cells
     using synthetic, short double-stranded RNAs that mimic the siRNAs
     produced by the enzyme dicer (Elbashir, et al., Nature, 411:494-498 (2001))
     (Ui-Tei, et al., FEBS Lett, 479:79-82 (2000)).
  5            siRNA can be chemically or in vitro-synthesized or can be the result
     of short double-stranded hairpin-like RNAs (shRNAs) that are processed into
     siRNAs inside the cell. For example, WO 02/44321 discloses siRNAs
     capable of sequence-specific degradation of target mRNAs when base-paired
     with 3' overhanging ends, herein incorporated by reference for the method of
10   making these siRNAs. Synthetic siRNAs are generally designed using
     algorithms and a conventional DNA/RNA synthesizer. Suppliers include
     Ambion (Austin, Texas), ChemGenes (Ashland, Massachusetts), Dharmacon
     (Lafayette, Colorado), Glen Research (Sterling, Virginia), MWB Biotech
     (Esbersberg, Germany), Proligo (Boulder, Colorado), and Qiagen (Vento,
15   The Netherlands). siRNA can also be synthesized in vitro using kits such as
     Ambion's SILENCER siRNA Construction Kit. In some embodiments, the
     composition includes a vector expressing the functional nucleic acid. The
     production of siRNA from a vector is more commonly done through the
     transcription of a short hairpin RNAse (shRNAs). Kits for the production of
20   vectors including shRNA are available, such as, for example, Imgenex's
      GENESUPPRESSORTM Construction Kits and Invitrogen's BLOCK-ITTM
      inducible RNAi plasmid and lentivirus vectors. In some embodiments, the
      functional nucleic acid is siRNA, shRNA, or miRNA.
               B.      Excipients, Delivery Vehicles and Devices
25             LYST inhibitors can be administered and taken up into the cells of a
      subject with or without the aid of a delivery vehicle. Appropriate delivery
      vehicles for the disclosed inhibitors are known in the art and can be selected
      to suit the particular inhibitor. In a preferred embodiment, the inhibitor is
      delivered by injection intravenously, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, or
 30   locally. Typical carriers are saline, phosphate buffered saline, and other
      injectable carriers.
               Formulations including one or more LYST inhibitors with or without
      delivery vehicles are disclosed. The disclosed LYST inhibitors can be
                                               36

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
     formulated into pharmaceutical compositions including one or more
     pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Pharmaceutical compositions can be
     formulated for different mechanisms of administration, according to the
     inhibitor and the intended use. Pharmaceutical compositions formulated for
  5  administration by parenteral (intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous (IV)
     or subcutaneous injection), topical or transdermal (either passively or using
     iontophoresis or electroporation) routes of administration or using
     bioerodible inserts are disclosed.
                       1.     Parenteral Administration
10            In some embodiments, one or more LYST inhibitors and optionally a
      delivery vehicle are formulated for administration in an aqueous solution, by
     parenteral injection. The formulation may also be in the form of a suspension
      or emulsion. In general, pharmaceutical compositions are provided
      including effective amounts of an active agent, targeting moiety, and
 15   optional a delivery vehicle and optionally include pharmaceutically
      acceptable diluents, preservatives, solubilizers, emulsifiers, adjuvants and/or
      carriers. Such compositions include the diluents sterile water, buffered
      saline of various buffer content (e.g., Tris-HCl, acetate, phosphate), pH and
      ionic strength and optionally additives such as detergents and solubilizing
20    agents (e.g., TWEEN@ 20, TWEEN@ 80 also referred to as polysorbate 20
      or 80), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite), and
      preservatives (e.g., Thimersol, benzyl alcohol) and bulking substances (e.g.,
      lactose, mannitol). Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles are
      propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and
 25   corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. The
      formulations may be lyophilized and redissolved/resuspended immediately
      before use. The formulation may be sterilized by, for example, filtration
      through a bacteria retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the
      compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the
 30   compositions.
                       2.      Pulmonary and Mucosal Administration
               In further embodiments, one or more LYST inhibitors and optionally
       a delivery vehicle are formulated for administration to the mucosa, such as
                                              37

WO 2015/168674                                                          PCT/US2015/029014
     the mouth, eyes, lungs, nasal, oral (sublingual, buccal), vaginal, or rectal
     mucosa.
              Formulations for administration to the mucosa will typically be spray
     dried drug particles, which may be incorporated into a tablet, gel, capsule,
  5  suspension or emulsion. Standard pharmaceutical excipients are available
     from any formulator.
              In one embodiment, the compounds are formulated for pulmonary
     delivery, such as intranasal administration or oral inhalation. The respiratory
     tract is the structure involved in the exchange of gases between the
10   atmosphere and the blood stream. The upper and lower airways are called the
     conducting airways. The terminal bronchioli divide into respiratory
     bronchiole, which then lead to the ultimate respiratory zone, the alveoli, or
     deep lung. The deep lung, or alveoli, is the primary target of inhaled
     therapeutic aerosols for systemic drug delivery. Therapeutic agents that are
 15  active in the lungs can be administered systemically and targeted via
     pulmonary absorption. The term aerosol as used herein refers to any
     preparation of a fine mist of particles, which can be in solution or a
     suspension, whether or not it is produced using a propellant. Aerosols can be
     produced using standard techniques, such as ultra-sonication or high
20   pressure treatment.
               Carriers for pulmonary formulations can be divided into those for dry
     powder formulations and for administration as solutions. Aerosols for the
     delivery of therapeutic agents to the respiratory tract are known in the art.
     For administration via the upper respiratory tract, the formulation can be
25   formulated into a solution, e.g., water or isotonic saline, buffered or un
     buffered, or as a suspension, for intranasal administration as drops or as a
      spray. Preferably, such solutions or suspensions are isotonic relative to nasal
      secretions and of about the same pH, ranging e.g., from about pH 4.0 to
      about pH 7.4 or, from pH 6.0 to pH 7.0. Buffers should be physiologically
 30   compatible and include, simply by way of example, phosphate buffers. One
      skilled in the art can readily determine a suitable saline content and pH for an
      innocuous aqueous solution for nasal and/or upper respiratory
      administration.
                                              38

WO 2015/168674                                                          PCT/US2015/029014
              Compositions can be delivered to the lungs while inhaling and
     traverse across the lung epithelial lining to the blood stream when delivered
     either as an aerosol or spray dried particles having an aerodynamic diameter
     of less than about 5 microns.
 5            Dry powder formulations ("DPFs") with large particle size have
     improved flowability characteristics, such as less aggregation, easier
     aerosolization, and potentially less phagocytosis. Dry powder aerosols for
     inhalation therapy are generally produced with mean diameters primarily in
     the range of less than 5 microns, although a preferred range is between one
10   and ten microns in aerodynamic diameter. Large "carrier" particles
     (containing no drug) have been co-delivered with therapeutic aerosols to aid
     in achieving efficient aerosolization among other possible benefits.
     Formulations for pulmonary delivery include unilamellar phospholipid
     vesicles, liposomes, or lipoprotein particles. Formulations and methods of
15   making such formulations containing nucleic acid are well known to one of
      ordinary skill in the art. A wide range of mechanical devices designed for
     pulmonary delivery of therapeutic products can be used, including but not
      limited to nebulizers, metered dose inhalers, and powder inhalers, all of
     which are familiar to those skilled in the art.
20                    3.       Topical and Transdermal Administration
              The active agent and optional delivery vehicle can be applied
      topically. Topical administration can include application directly to the
      vasculature or to tissues or prostheses, for example during surgery, or by
      direct administration to the skin.
25            Transdermal formulations may also be prepared. These will typically
      be ointments, lotions, sprays, or patches, all of which can be prepared using
      standard technology. Transdermal formulations can include penetration
      enhancers. Standard pharmaceutical excipients for topical or transdermal
      administration are available from any formulator.
30                    4.       Controlled Delivery Matrices
              Controlled release polymeric devices can be made for long term
      release systemically following implantation of a polymeric device (rod,
      cylinder, film, disk) or injection (microparticles). The matrix can be in the
                                             39

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
     form of microparticles such as microspheres, where LYST inhibitors are
     dispersed within a solid polymeric matrix or microcapsules, where the core is
     of a different material than the polymeric shell, and one or more LYST
     inhibitor(s) is dispersed or suspended in the core, which may be liquid or
 5   solid in nature. Unless specifically defined herein, microparticles,
     microspheres, and microcapsules are used interchangeably. Alternatively, the
     polymer may be cast as a thin slab or film, ranging from nanometers to four
     centimeters, a powder produced by grinding or other standard techniques, or
     even a gel such as a hydrogel.
10            Either non-biodegradable or biodegradable matrices can be used for
     delivery of disclosed inhibitors of LYST, although biodegradable matrices
     are preferred. These may be natural or synthetic polymers, although
      synthetic polymers are preferred due to the better characterization of
     degradation and release profiles. The polymer is selected based on the
15   period over which release is desired. In some cases linear release may be
     most useful, although in others a pulse release or "bulk release" may provide
     more effective results. The polymer may be in the form of a hydrogel
      (typically in absorbing up to about 90% by weight of water), and can
      optionally be cross-linked with multivalent ions or polymers.
20            The matrices can be formed by solvent evaporation, spray drying,
      solvent extraction and other methods known to those skilled in the art.
      Bioerodible microspheres can be prepared using any of the methods
      developed for making microspheres for drug delivery, for example, as
      described by Mathiowitz and Langer, J ControlledRelease 5:13-22 (1987);
25    Mathiowitz, et al., Reactive Polymers 6:275-283 (1987); and Mathiowitz, et
      al., J Appl. Polymer Sci. 35:755-774 (1988). The devices can be formulated
      for local release to treat the area of implantation or injection, which will
      typically deliver a dosage that is much less than the dosage for treatment of
      an entire body. The devices can also be formulated for local or systemic
30    delivery.
              Micro and nanoparticles designed to deliver cargo such as drugs and
      antibodies to the vasculature, to vascular smooth muscle cells, or sites or
      clots or thrombosis are known in the art. See, for example, Wickline, et al.,
                                               40

               For example, perfluorocarbon nanoparticles, previously considered as
      artificial blood substitutes, have been developed into a platform technology
      for molecular imaging and targeted drug delivery, i.e., a so-called
10    "theranostic" technology. These lipid-encapsulated particles, which are
      nominally 250 nm in diameter, can be administered intravenously and are
      typically constrained by size to the intact vasculature.
               In some embodiments the delivery vehicle is a liposome. If the LYST
      inhibitor is an antibody, protein or small molecule, the preferred delivery
15    vehicle can be a liposome. Liposomes are disclosed for the delivery of the
      disclosed LYST inhibitors directly to a certain cell type, for example
      macrophage cells. Macrophage cells can internalize liposomes, leading to the
      delivery of the one or more inhibitors to the intracellular compartments of
      the macrophage. Suitable methods, materials and lipids for making
20    liposomes are known in the art. Liposome delivery vehicles are
      commercially available from multiple sources. Liposomes can be formed
      from a single lipid bilayer (i.e., the liposome can be unilamellar) or several
      concentric lipid bilayers (i.e., the liposome can be multilamellar). The
      liposome may be formed from a single lipid; however, in some
25    embodiments, the liposome is formed from a combination of more than one
      lipid. The lipids can be neutral, anionic or cationic at physiologic pH.
               Suitable neutral and anionic lipids include sterols and lipids such as
      cholesterol, phospholipids, lysolipids, lysophospholipids, and sphingolipids.
      Neutral and anionic lipids include, but are not limited to,
30    phosphatidylcholine (PC) (such as egg PC, soy PC), including 1,2-diacyl
      glycero-3-phosphocholines; phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol,
      phosphatidylinositol (PI); glycolipids; sphingophospholipids, such as
      sphingomyelin, sphingoglycolipids (also known as 1-ceramidyl glucosides),

     such as ceramide galactopyranoside, gangliosides and cerebrosides; fatty
     acids, sterols containing a carboxylic acid group such as cholesterol or
     derivatives thereof; and 1 ,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamines,
     including 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-Glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine or 1,2
 5   dioleolylglyceryl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), 1 ,2
     dihexadecylphosphoethanolamine (DHPE), 1,2
     distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine
     (DPPC), and 1,2-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC).
     Trimethyl ammonium salts, also referred to as TAP lipids, for example as a
10   methylsulfate salt. Suitable TAP lipids include, but are not limited to,
     DOTAP (dioleoyl-), DMTAP (dimyristoyl-), DPTAP (dipalmitoyl-), and
     DSTAP (distearoyl-). Other suitable cationic lipids include
     dimethyldioctadecyl ammonium bromide (DDAB), 1 ,2-diacyloxy-3
     trimethylammonium propanes, N-[1 -(2,3 -dioloyloxy)propyl] -NN-dimethyl
15   amine (DODAP), Other suitable lipids include PEGylated derivatives of the
     neutral, anionic, and cationic lipids described above. Incorporation of one or
     more PEGylated lipid derivatives can result in a liposome which displays
     polyethylene glycol chains on its surface. The resulting liposomes may
     possess increased stability and circulation time in vivo as compared to
20   liposomes lacking PEG chains on their surfaces.
             If the LYST inhibitor is a nucleic acid or vector, the delivery vehicle
     can be a viral vector, for example, a commercially available preparation,
     such as an adenovirus vector (Quantum Biotechnologies, Inc. (Laval,
     Quebec, Canada). The viral vector delivery can be via a viral system, such as
25   a retroviral vector system which can package a recombinant retroviral
     genome (see e.g., Pastan et al., (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U.S.A. 85:4486;
     Miller et al., (1986) Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:2895). The recombinant retrovirus can
     then be used to infect and thereby deliver to the infected cells nucleic acid
     encoding the LYST inhibitor. The exact method of introducing the altered
30   nucleic acid into mammalian cells is, of course, not limited to the use of
     retroviral vectors. Other techniques are widely available for this procedure
     including the use of adenoviral vectors (Mitani et al., Hum. Gene Ther.
     5:941-948 (1994)), adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors (Goodman et al.,
                                             42

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
     Blood 84:1492-1500 (1994)), lentiviral vectors (Naidini et al., Science
     272:263-267 (1996)), pseudotyped retroviral vectors (Agrawal et al., Exper.
     Hematol. 24:738-747 (1996)).
              Physical transduction techniques can also be used, such as liposome
  5  delivery and receptor-mediated and other endocytosis mechanisms (see, for
     example, Schwartzenberger et al., Blood 87:472-478 (1996)). Commercially
     available liposome preparations such as LIPOFECTIN, LIPOFECTAMINE
     (GIBCO-BRL, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.), SUPERFECT (Qiagen, Inc. Hilden,
     Germany) and TRANSFECTAM (Promega Biotec, Inc., Madison, Wis.), as
 10  well as other liposomes developed according to procedures standard in the
     art are well known. In addition, the disclosed nucleic acid or vector can be
      delivered in vivo by electroporation, the technology for which is available
     from Genetronics, Inc. (San Diego, Calif.) as well as by means of a
      sonoporation or sonication machine (ImaRx Pharmaceutical Corp., Tucson,
 15   Ariz.). The disclosed compositions and methods can be used in conjunction
     with any of these or other commonly used gene transfer methods.
                      5.      Grafts and Medical Devices
              The disclosed compositions for immunomodulation by inhibition of
      LYST can be coated onto or incorporated into medical devices, or can be
20    used to pre-treat implantable vascular grafts ex vivo.
                              Grafts
              LYST inhibitors can be used to pre-treat vascular grafts ex vivo prior
      to implantation in a subject. Compositions including one or more LYST
      inhibitors and optionally a delivery vehicle can be applied to the tissue by
 25   methods to insure that they adhere and are distributed throughout the tissue
      or graft in optimal locations for drug treatment. In some embodiments, one
      or more LYST inhibitor(s) is delivered using nanoparticles, microparticles,
      liposomes, micelles, emulsions, gels or coatings that are designed to adhere
      to the regions of interest, to carry sufficient drug load to provide local
 30   treatment for prolonged periods, to release the LYST inhibitors at a desired
      rate or schedule, to penetrate into tissue or graft to an optimal extent, or a
      combination thereof.

WO 2015/168674                                                         PCT/US2015/029014
             Grafts for use in surgery can also be formed by seeding cells ex-vivo
     onto a biodegradable scaffold. The grafts can be autologous, for example,
     saphenous vein or radial artery; preserved autologous, for example,
     cryopreserved vein; allogeneic; xenogenic; or synthetic, for example, woven
 5   polyester, polyurethane (LYCRA@), polytetraflouroethylene (PTFE),
     GORE-TEX@, or polyethelene terephthalate (DACRON). Arterial
     homografts using internal mammary, radial or hypogastric arteries are
     examples of useful and durable vascular conduits. Exemplary grafts are
     discussed below.
10                           Tissue Engineering Vascular Graft
             Tissue engineering vascular grafts (TEVG) including one or more
     inhibitors of LYST are disclosed. Tissue-engineered vascular grafts
     (TEVGs) hold great promise for advancing the field of congenital heart
     surgery, where their growth capacity can be used to its fullest potential. For
15   example, TEVGs can be designed for use as a vascular conduit connecting
     the inferior vena cava to the pulmonary artery in patients undergoing
     modified Fontan surgery. Long-term (>10 years) results of a pilot study
     evaluating the use of the TEVG in 25 patients with single ventricle cardiac
     anomalies demonstrated no graft related deaths or graft failures. It also
20   confirmed the growth capacity of the TEVG making it the first man made
     graft with growth capacity. The primary graft-related complication was
     stenosis, effecting approximately 30% of patients with 16% (4/25) requiring
     angioplasty to treat critical stenosis.
             In one embodiment, a TEVG is formed from a biodegradable tubular
25   scaffold fabricated from a polyglycolic acid-fiber tube. The tube can be
     coated with a copolymer such as a 50:50 ratio of poly lactic acid (PLA) and
     poly-caprolactone. The scaffold can be seeded with cells prior to implanting
     into a subject. In some embodiments the cells are autologous cells from the
     intended recipient.
30           It has been established that excessive infiltration of macrophages to
     tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) promoted scarring, resulting in
     vessel thickening, occlusion and stenosis. Therefore, the compositions and
     methods described herein can be used to deliver one or more LYST
                                             44

WO 2015/168674                                                            PCT/US2015/029014
     inhibitors locally and in a controlled fashion to a TEVG to prevent or inhibit
     infiltration by macrophages.
                              Bypass Graft
              Bypass grafts including one or more inhibitors of LYST are
 5   disclosed. A common form of bypass surgery involves resecting the
     saphenous vein from the leg for auto-transplantation to the coronary artery.
     In a significant number of cases these grafts fail, largely due to restenosis
     caused by neointimal hyperplasia. The compositions and methods described
     herein can be used to deliver one or more LYST inhibitors locally and in a
10   controlled fashion, to the autologous graft. The inhibitor can be administered
     prior to, at the time of and/or immediately following surgery. After resection
     of the saphenous vein the tissue can be (and is often) for hours suspended in
     saline during chest opening and preparation for graft implantation.
     Compositions including one or more LYST inhibitors and optional a
15   targeting signal, delivery vehicle or combination thereof can be incubated
     with the saphenous vein during this time period.
                              Arteriovenous Graft
              Arteriovenous grafts including one or more inhibitors of LYST are
     disclosed. End stage renal disease is increasing in the United States.
20   Morbidity of hemodialysis access remains a major quality of life issue for
     patients; it also represents a significant cost to society. A native
     arteriovenous fistula (AVF) remains the conduit of choice to provide access
     for hemodialysis and provides superior results when compared with other
     options such as a prosthetic AVG. Unfortunately each individual is limited in
25   the number of native AVF that can be created due to the limited number of
     suitable sites and vessels. Access sites are limited as patients with end stage
     renal disease usually have severe comorbidity, requiring extensive
     venipuncture for diagnosis and therapy for life. In patients who have
     exhausted all options for primary AVF, new access sites must use AV grafts.
30   These grafts are susceptible to restenosis by neointimal hyperplasia limiting
     their effectiveness. Incubation of a composition including one or more LYST
     inhibitors, and optionally including a targeting signal, a delivery vehicle, or a
     combination thereof onto the graft can be done at the time of surgery.

WO 2015/168674                                                            PCT/US2015/029014
                               Medical Devices
              In some embodiments, a composition including one or more LYST
     inhibitors is coated onto, or incorporated into, a medical device or
     component thereof (such as into polymeric reservoirs in vascular stents) to
 5   reduce or inhibit vascular proliferation disorders such as neointima formation
     in a subject. The device can be a device that is inserted into the subject
     transiently, or a device that is implanted permanently. In some embodiments,
     the device is a surgical device.
              Examples of medical devices include, but are not limited to, needles,
10   cannulas, catheters, shunts, balloons, and implants such as stents and valves.
               In some embodiments, the LYST inhibitor or pharmaceutical
     composition can be formulated to permit its incorporation onto the medical
     device, which can apply the inhibitor directly to the site to prevent or treat
     conditions such restenosis or other vascular proliferation disorders. The
15   LYST inhibitor or pharmaceutical composition thereof can be formulated by
     including it within a coating on the medical device. There are various
     coatings that can be utilized such as, for example, polymer coatings that can
     release the inhibitor over a prescribed time period. The inhibitor, or a
     pharmaceutical composition thereof, can be embedded directly within the
20   medical device. In some embodiments, the LYST inhibitor is coated onto or
     within the device in a delivery vehicle such as a microparticle or liposome
     that facilitates its release and delivery.
                               Stents
               In some embodiments, the medical device is a vascular implant such
25    as a stent. Stents are utilized in medicine to prevent or eliminate vascular
      restrictions. Stents can be inserted into a restricted vessel so that the
      restricted vessel is widened. The experience with such vascular implants
      indicates that excessive growth of the adjacent cells results again in a
      restriction of the vessel particularly at the ends of the implants which results
30    in reduced effectiveness of the implants. If a stent is inserted into a human
      artery for the elimination of an arteriosclerotic stenosis, intimal hyperplasia
      can occur within a year at the ends of the vascular implant and results in
      renewed stenosis.
                                               46

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
              Accordingly, in some embodiments, the stents are coated or loaded
     with a composition including a LYST inhibitor and optionally a delivery
     vehicle.
              Many stents are commercially available or otherwise know in the art.
  5  Stents can be formed, i.e., etched or cut, from a thin tube of suitable material,
     or from a thin plate of suitable material and rolled into a tube.
              Suitable materials for the stent include but are not limited to stainless
     steel, iridium, platinum, gold, tungsten, tantalum, palladium, silver, niobium,
     zirconium, aluminum, copper, indium, ruthenium, molybdenum, niobium,
10   tin, cobalt, nickel, zinc, iron, gallium, manganese, chromium, titanium,
     aluminum, vanadium, and carbon, as well as combinations, alloys, and/or
     laminations thereof. For example, the stent may be formed from a cobalt
     alloy, such as L605 or MP35N, Nitinol (nickel-titanium shape memory
     alloy), ABI (palladium-silver alloy), Elgiloy (cobalt-chromium-nickel
15   alloy), etc. It is also contemplated that the stent may be formed from two or
     more materials that are laminated together, such as tantalum that is laminated
     with MP35N@. The stents may also be formed from wires having concentric
      layers of different metals, alloys, or other materials. Embodiments of the
      stent may also be formed from hollow tubes, or tubes that have been filled
20    with other materials. The aforementioned materials and laminations are
      intended to be examples and are not intended to be limiting in any way.
              Stents can be drug-eluting stents. Various drug eluting stents that
      simultaneously deliver a therapeutic substance to the treatment site while
      providing artificial radial support to the wall tissue are known in the art.
25    Endo-luminal devices including stents can be coated on their outer surfaces
      with a substance such as a drug releasing agent, growth factor, antibody, or
      the like. Stents have also been developed having a hollow tubular structure
      with holes or ports cut through the sidewall to allow drug elution from a
      central lumen. Although the hollow nature of the stent allows the central
 30   lumen to be loaded with a drug solution that is delivered via the ports or
      holes in the sidewall of the stent, the hollow tubular structure may not have
      suitable mechanical strength to provide adequate scaffolding in the vessel.

              Multiple other prosthetic devices can include one or more inhibitors
     of LYST, including but not limited to heart valves, artificial joints,
20   pacemakers, indwelling catheters and cosmetic implants.
              It is believed that the disclosed LYST inhibitors can reduce or prevent
     inflammatory responses and fibroproliferative disorders associated with the
     presence of a bioprosthesis. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the
     bioprostheses are coated or loaded with a composition including a LYST
25   inhibitor and optionally a delivery vehicle.
     IV.      Methods of Use
              Methods of using the disclosed LYST inhibitors are provided. The
     methods can include administering to a subject an effective amount of a
      composition including one or more LYST inhibitors to prevent, reduce, or
 30   inhibit the expression or function of LYST in the subject; pretreating a
      medical device or vascular graft with an effective amount of a composition
      including a LYST inhibitor to prevent, reduce, or inhibit neointima formation

WO 2015/168674                                                          PCT/US2015/029014
     following insertion or implantation of the device or graft into the subject; or
     a combination thereof.
              A.      Disorders and Diseases to be Treated
              LYST inhibitors can be used to alter immune functions, including,
 5   but not limited to, macrophage, platelet, and natural killer cell function,
     creating a pro-regenerative immune environment. Methods of using LYST
     inhibitors including, but not limited to, methods designed to inhibit or block
     transcription, translation, or function of the LYST protein can be used to
     modulate the immune response. In some embodiments, the methods promote
10   vascular neotissue formation, inhibit the formation of neointima and improve
     vascular patency, for example, following vascular surgery. Methods of using
     LYST inhibitors for preventing intimal and neointimal hyperplasia in both
     biological and synthetic vascular conduits are provided. The methods can
     reduce or prevent TEVG stenosis and improve TFVG function.
15            Additionally, LYST inhibitors can have broader implications for
     promoting tissue regeneration, improving wound healing, and modulating the
     foreign body response. Thus, methods of using LYST inhibitors as an
     adjunct to regenerative medicine applications are also described. In some
     embodiments, the methods of using LYST inhibitors can promote healing
20   and prevent scar formation, for example, promoting healing and preventing
     adhesions after abdominal surgery.
               The methods can modulate the amount of Platelet Derived Growth
     Factor (PDGF) produced as a result of tissue injury. Therefore, the methods
     can treat diseases associated with excessive or undesirable expression of
25   PDGF.
               The methods can also prevent or treat diseases resulting from
     excessive fibrosis, for example fibrotic diseases of the liver, lung or heart.
     Finally, methods of anti-LYST therapy can result in immune modulation that
      alters the foreign body reaction and promotes integration but blocks
30    encapsulation of bio-prostheses, thus improving function and longevity of
      devices such as pacemaker or nerve stimulators or integration of replacement
     heart valves or artificial joints.

              In preferred embodiments, one or more LYST inhibitors are effective
     to reduce, inhibit, or delay one or more symptoms of a disease, disorder or
     condition in a subject. The disclosed LYST inhibitors have a wide variety of
     therapeutic and prophylactic uses, for example, they can be used to treat or
 5   prevent vascular proliferative disorders following injury or various surgical
     procedures, scarring and fibrotic diseases. Methods of using one or more
     inhibitors of LYST for treating a disease characterized by the presence of
     excessive scar or fibrotic tissue are described. Methods of using one or more
     LYST inhibitors for anti-platelet therapy, for example, for treating diseases
10   resulting from aberrant, excessive or otherwise undesirable platelet activity
     or PDGF signaling are also provided.
              Vascular Proliferative Disorders
             In some embodiments, the disclosed LYST inhibitors can be used to
     treat or prevent vascular proliferative disorders. Examples of such disorders
15   include, but are not limited to, vascular proliferation involved in
     atherosclerosis, vascular proliferation following intravascular device
     implantation, vascular proliferation at the site of vascular anastamosis as
     generally occurs following revascularization procedure or A-V shunting,
     vascular proliferation following carotid endarterectomy, and transplant
20   vasculopathy.
              Methods of treating or preventing vascular proliferative disorders by
      administration of one or more LYST inhibitors are provided. The methods
     typically reduce or inhibit the infiltration of macrophage cells, or the
      conversion of macrophage cells from M1 to M2 phenotype, or both,
25    compared to a control. In some embodiments, the methods reduce or inhibit
     proliferation of macrophage cells without reducing or inhibiting vascular
     neotissue development. A subject can have stenosis, restenosis or other
     vascular proliferation disorders, or be identified as being at risk for restenosis
      or other vascular proliferation disorders, for example subjects who have
30    undergone, are undergoing, or will undergo a vascular trauma, angioplasty,
      surgery, or transplantation arteriopathy, etc. Diseases, disorders and
      conditions that can be treated using the disclosed compositions are discussed
      in more detail below.

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
                                       Vascular Injury
              In some embodiments, one or more LYST inhibitors can be applied
     before, at the time of or following a vascular trauma.
              Vascular injury triggers a cascade of events that includes endothelial
 5   denudation or dysfunction, inflammation, as well as activation and
     proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Multiple growth
     factors and cytokines are released by dysfunctional endothelial cells,
     inflammatory cells, platelets and VSMCs. These growth factors and
     cytokines mediate chemo-attraction, cell migration, proliferation, apoptosis
10   and matrix modulation, and are implicated in a number of vascular
     proliferative disorders.
              Vascular proliferative diseases and disorders can be initiated by
     mechanical, biochemical or immunological injury to blood vessel walls.
     Typical vascular trauma include those associated with both blunt and
15   penetrating injuries including, but not limited to, lacerations, puncture
     wounds, crush injuries, gunshot wounds, knife wounds, occupational
     injuries, falls, and motor vehicle accidents, as well as medical interventions,
     such as surgery or angioplasty.
              In some embodiments, the subject has undergone, is undergoing, or
20   will undergo a surgery. Surgeries can include invasive, minimally invasive,
     or percutaneous surgery. For example, in some embodiments the subject is
     having surgery to treat or repair abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid stenosis,
     varicose veins, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, acute limb ischemia, or
      aortic dissection. Common vascular surgeries include, but are not limited to,
25    open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, endovascular aneurysm repair
      (EVAR), carotid endarterectomy, carotid stenting, vein stripping,
      sclerotherapy and foam selerotherapy, endo-venous laser treatment,
     radiofrequency vein ablation, ambulatory phlebectomy, angioplasty with/out
      stenting, bypass surgery endarterectomy atherectomy, balloon embolectomy,
30   thrombectomy, bypass surgery, open repair, thoracic endovascular aneurysm
     repair (TEVAR). A surgeon can apply one or more LYST inhibitors to the
      surgical site at the time of surgery, prior to surgery or following surgery, to
      enhance the process of wound healing, or to prevent the development of
                                              51

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
     vascular proliferative disorders, such as those that give rise to stenosis or
     restenosis.
                                     Intimal Hyperplasia
             Intimal hyperplasia is a physiological healing response to injury of
 5   the endothelia of blood vessels. Injury to the endothelial layer triggers a
     series of acute and chronic inflammatory responses that trigger the
     aggregation of platelets, the deposition of fibrin and attracts leukocytes to the
     area (Murakami, et al., Am JPhysiol., 272:L197-L202 (1997); Cotran, et al.,
     JAm Soc Nephrol., 1:225-235 (1990)). Thus, regenerative processes that
10   give rise to neovessel formation and intimal hyperplasia appear to be
     immune-mediated phenomena, similar to the proposed role for monocytes
     macrophages in other human vascular biological processes, such as vein
     graft adaptation (Ratliff and Myles, Arch. Pathol.Lab. Med. 113:772-776
     (1989); Motwani and Topol, Circulation 97:916-931 (1998)).
15                                            Stenosis
              Intimal hyperplasia can lead to thickening of the Tunica intima of a
     blood vessel, leading to a complication of stenosis of the blood vessel.
     Activation of inflammatory and pro-coagulant mechanisms is thought to
     contribute significantly to the initiation and development of stenosis. Over a
20   period of time ranging from a few weeks to months, smooth muscle cells
     from the medial region of an injured blood vessel relocate to the intimal
     region. These cells proliferate and deposit extracellular matrix to form a neo
     intima at the site of the injury in a process analogous to scar formation
      (Fingerle, et al., ProcNatlAcad Sci., 86:8412 (1989); Clowes, et al., Circ.
25   Res., 56:139-145 (1985)). Thus, a robust healing response leads to an
      internal thickening of the vessel wall (intimal hyperplasia) and eventually
     reduces the vessel lumen, causing stenosis. The formation of intimal
     hyperplasia can be accelerated by the presence of foreign material such as
      prosthesis within the vessel, and can result from endovascular intervention
30    including angioplasty, bypass, and transplantation arteriopathy, etc. (Glagov,
      Circulation,89:2888-2891 (1994)).
              Therefore, methods of using the disclosed LYST inhibitors
      preventing intimal hyperplasia and stenosis are provided.
                                              52

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
                                              Restenosis
             Methods to prevent or reduce restenosis of the coronary vasculature
     or the peripheral circulatory system are provided. Restenosis of blood vessels
     is typically due to intimal hyperplasia. A surgical device, such as a stent,
 5   may be inserted to open the stenosed vessel, however this is also problematic
     because the stent itself can stimulate further intimal hyperplasia. In addition,
     hyperplastic intimal tissue can grow through the interstices of a bare stent
     and re-stenose the vessel. Whilst covered stents may prevent this from
     happening, intimal hyperplasia can still occur at the ends of the stent where
10   there is most irritation of the vessel wall. Patients with in-stent restenosis are
     at risk of serious complications, as stenosis from intimal hyperplasia is often
     difficult to treat. Unlike soft atheromatous plaques, these stenoses are firm
     and require prolonged high inflation pressures to dilate with a balloon. The
     stenoses often recur and repeated dilatation of the vessel leads to repeated
15   intimal injury and perpetuates the intimal healing response.
             Accordingly, the disclosed compositions, devices, or grafts can be
     administered to a subject to reduce or inhibit smooth muscle cell
     proliferation, migration, and a combination thereof in an amount effective to
     reduce or inhibit neointima formation and thereby treat or prevent restenosis
20   and other vascular proliferation disorders in the subject. In some
     embodiments, the patency of grafts and devices can be increased using a
     composition containing a LYST inhibitor. Therefore, methods for
     administering a composition containing a LYST inhibitor to devices and
     grafts or to the subject prior to or after implantation are provided.
25                                    Atherosclerosis
             Atherosclerosis involves multiple processes, including inflammation,
     vascular proliferation and matrix alteration (reviewed in Dzau, et al., Nat
     Med,. 8(11) (2002)). In atherosclerosis, VSMC give rise to inflammation, the
     retention of lipoproteins from the blood, as well as the development of a
30   fibrous deposit that constitute a plaque. Inflammation has been shown to
     mediate all stages of atherosclerosis: in the development of an atheroma
     plaque, VSMCs produce pro-inflammatory mediators such as monocyte
     chemo-attractant proteins, and synthesize matrix molecules that give rise to
                                              53

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
     the retention of lipoproteins from the blood; and following the development
     of a plaque, local inflammatory milieu can induce collagenase expression
     and inhibit expression of proteolytic inhibitors, rendering the fibrous cap
     weak and susceptible to rupture. Therefore, in some embodiments, the
 5   disclosed LYST inhibitors are used to treat, reduce, inhibit, or prevent
     vascular proliferation disorders in a subject.
                                     Angioplasty
              In some embodiments, the subject has undergone, is undergoing, or
     will undergo angioplasty. Angioplasty is the technique of mechanically
10   widening narrowed or obstructed arteries, such as those obstructed as a result
     of atherosclerosis. Generally, angioplasty includes inserting into a subject's
     vasculature an empty and collapsed balloon on a guide wire, known as a
     balloon catheter, which is passed into the narrowed locations and then
     inflated to a fixed size. The balloon forces expansion of the inner white
15   blood cell/clot plaque deposits and the surrounding muscular wall, opening
     up the blood vessel for improved flow, and the balloon is then deflated and
     withdrawn. A stent may or may not be inserted at the time of ballooning to
     ensure the vessel remains open. Angioplasty includes peripheral angioplasty
     (i.e., blood vessels outside the coronary arteries, such as in the abdomen, or
20   legs), coronary angioplasty, renal artery angioplasty, carotid angioplasty, and
     cerebral arteries angioplasty.
              In some embodiments, the subject has undergone, is undergoing, or
     will undergo percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The
     use of PTCA has greatly reduced the number of fatalities in patients who
25    suffer myocardial infarction (Fischman, et al., NEngl JMed., 331:496-501
      (1994); Elezi, et al., Circulation98:1875-1880 (1998); Bennett and
      O'Sullivan, PharmacolTher., 91:149-166 (2001)). During PTCA, the artery
      walls are expanded by several times their original diameter in an attempt to
      increase lumen diameter and improve flow. Unfortunately, this technique is
30    plagued by a high incidence of vessel re-narrowing or restenosis, occurring
      in 30-40% of patients within 6 months of the procedure (Anderson et al., J
      Interv. Cardiol.,6:187-202 (1993); Fischman et al., NEngl JMed, 331:496
      501 (1994); Elezi et al., Circulation98:1875-1880 (1998); Bennett and
                                             54

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
     O'Sullivan, PharmacolTher, 91:149-166 (2001); Heckenkamp et al., J
     Cardiovasc.Surg. (Torino), 43:349-357 (2002)).
             Prevention of restenosis after successful PTCA remains one of the
     most challenging tasks in the treatment of obstructive coronary artery
 5   disease. Attempts to ameliorate this proliferative response involve the use
     coronary stents, which have significantly improved both short term and long
     term outcome following interventional coronary revascularization
     procedures. Despite a reduction in restenosis rate with stent deployment,
     restenosis still occurs in 15-30% of patients within 6 months (Fischman et
10   al., NEngl JMed, 331:496-501 (1994); Elezi et al., Circulation,98:1875
     1880 (1998)). This incidence of in-stent restenosis is expected to increase as
     coronary stenting is becoming more frequent and is used in less ideal lesions.
     The disclosed LYST inhibitors can be used to treat or prevent restenosis,
     abdominal adhesions and scarring following angioplasty.
15                                    TransplantArteriopathy
              In some embodiments, the subject has undergone, is undergoing, or
     will undergo a transplant. Chronic transplant arteriopathy (CTA) is a major
     cause of late allograft loss after heart or kidney transplantation (Taylor, et al.,
     J HeartLung Transplant., 24:945-955 (2005), Burke, et al.,
20   Transplantation,60:1413-1417 (1995); Cornell and Colvin, Curr. Opin.
     Nephrol Hypertens., 14:229-234 (2005)). Therefore, in some embodiments,
     the disclosed LYST inhibitors are used to reduce, inhibit, or prevent
     transplant arteriopathy in a transplant recipient.
                              Excessive Scarring
25             The disclosed LYST inhibitors can be used to treat, retard or prevent
     scarring, including the formation of keloids and abdominal adhesions, for
     example, following injury, disease or surgical procedures.
               Methods of using one or more LYST inhibitors to decrease the
      amount of blood vessel growth at the site of an injury or surgery are
30   provided. In some embodiments the methods prevent or decrease the
      formation of high density cellular and connective tissue that give rise to
      scarring, keloids or adhesions. Preferably, the amount of one or more LYST
      inhibitors does not prevent wound healing.
                                              55

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
                                      Hypertrophic Scarring
               In some embodiments, the disclosed LYST inhibitors are used to
     treat, reduce, inhibit, or prevent development of hypertrophic scars.
     Excessive scarring can occur when the tissue response is out of proportion
 5   with the amount of scar tissue required for normal repair and healing. When
     a deep wound involves significant loss of dermis, hypertrophic scar tissue
     can be deposited at the wound site. The scar tissue contains a high density of
     cells, increased volume of connective tissue and an increased vascular supply
     resulting from increased number of blood vessels. Hypertrophic scars can
10   occur as a result of defects in the remodeling phase of tissue repair (Ehrlich
     and Kelley, PlastReconstr Surg., 90:993-998 (1992)).
               The disclosed LYST inhibitors can be used to diminish or prevent the
     development of blood vessels in the area of a wound to reduce, retard or
     prevent the development of hypertrophic scarring.
15                                    Keloids
               In some embodiments, the disclosed LYST inhibitors are used to
     treat, reduce, inhibit, or prevent development of Keloid scars. A keloid scar
      is a raised or thickened scar that exceeds the boundary of the injury and can
      continue to develop and enlarge over a prolonged period of time. During
20    development of a keloid growth, collagen, used in wound repair overgrows
     producing a lump many times larger than that of the original scar.
                LYST inhibitors can be used to prevent Keloid development
      associated with skin injuries, for example, ear piercing, laceration, bums,
      vaccination or inflammatory processes. LYST inhibitors can be applied
25    locally or topically as needed.
                                      Adhesions
                Adhesions are fibrous bands that form between tissues and organs,
      often as a result of injury during surgery. They may be thought of as internal
      scar tissues that connect tissues not normally connected, usually across a
30    virtual space such as the peritoneal cavity. Following abdominal surgery or
      trauma, the production or activity of fibrinolytic enzymes can be
      compromised because of injury, and fibrinous adhesion develops. If this is
      allowed to happen, tissue repair cells such as macrophages, fibroblasts and
                                              56

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
     other blood vessel cells penetrate the fibrinous adhesion to deposit collagen
     and other matrix substances to form a permanent fibrous adhesion.
              Exemplary adhesions that can be treated, reduced or prevented by the
     disclosed LYST inhibitors include abdominal adhesions, pelvic adhesions,
 5   including pelvic adhesions that result from endometriosis, pericardial
     adhesions, peridural adhesions and peritendinous adhesions. Symptoms of
     adhesions can include abdominal pain, blockages, chronic pelvic pain,
     cramping, nausea, limited flexibility and inflammation or swelling at the site
     of the adhesion.
10                             Other Fibroproliferative Diseases
              In some embodiments, one or more LYST inhibitors can be applied to
     treat a fibroproliferative disease.
              Fibrosis is the deposition of excess fibrous connective tissue in an
     organ or tissue in response to inflammation and/or damage (Wynn, Nat Rev
15   Immunol., 4(8): 583-594 (2004)). The repair of damaged tissues involves the
     production of extracellular matrix components at the site of tissue injury.
     Macrophages and damaged tissues release cytokines and TGF beta which
     stimulate cells to lay down connective tissue, including collagen and
     glycosaminoglycans. However, dysregulation of this process can lead to
20   excessive deposition of this connective tissue, which can obliterate the
     structure and function of underlying organs, leading to the pathology of
     fibrotic disease. Fibrosis can occur in many tissues within the body,
     including the liver, lungs, heart and kidney. Methods of treating major-organ
     fibrosis and fibroproliferative disorders are provided.
25                                     Liver Cirrhosis
              Fibrosis of the liver leads to liver damage as hepatocytes are replaced
     by non-functional scar tissue in a process known as cirrhosis (Masuoka, et al.
     Ann NYAcad. Sci., 1281:106-122 (2013)). Liver fibrosis and the resulting
     cirrhosis represent the final common pathway of virtually all chronic liver
30   diseases and can lead to liver failure, liver cancer, and liver-related death.
     Liver cirrhosis occurs as scar tissue replaces normal parenchyma. Following
     acute liver injury (e.g., viral hepatitis), parenchymal cells regenerate and
     replace necrotic or apoptotic cells in a process associated with an
                                               57

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
     inflammatory response. If hepatic injury persists, the liver regeneration
     process eventually fails and hepatocytes are substituted with abundant
     extracellular matrix, including fibrillar collagen. Advanced fibrosis is
     characterized by an accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins rich in
 5   fibrillar collagens (predominantly collagen I and collagen III) (reviewed in
     Iredale, J Clin Invest., 117(3):529-548 (2007); Bataller and Brenner, J Clin
     Invest, 115(2):209-218 (2005)). Inflammatory cells which activate hepatic
     stellate cells (HSC) to secrete collagen are an important factor in fibrotic
     liver disease. Increasing monocyte numbers have been associated with
10   disease progression, specifically with the progression from non-cirrhotic to
     cirrhotic disease.
              Methods of treating liver fibrosis in a subject, including administering
     to the subject an effective amount of one or more LYST inhibitors to reduce,
     decrease, limit or prevent one or more symptoms of liver disease relative to
15   an untreated control subject are provided. Typical symptoms of liver diseases
     include, but are not limited to increased abdominal mass, fatigue, abdominal
     pain, cachexia, jaundice, obstructive syndromes including lymphatic
     blockage and accumulation of ascites, anemia and back pain (Sun, et al., Clin
     J Oncol. Nurs., 12:759-766 (2008)). In some embodiments, one or more
20   LYST inhibitors improve liver function, reduce inflammation, reduce
     fibrosis, or a combination thereof in a subject with liver disease relative to an
     untreated control subject.
                                     Pulmonary Fibrosis
              Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by the deposition of excess
25   fibrous tissue in the lungs that causes marked architectural distortion and loss
     of alveolar spaces, leading to organ failure and ultimately death from
     respiratory failure. Pulmonary fibrosis involves gradual exchange of normal
     lung parenchyma with fibrotic tissue, causing irreversible decrease in oxygen
     diffusion capacity.
30            Pulmonary fibrosis (also known as cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis) is
     associated with interstitial lung diseases (ILD) such as connective tissue
     diseases or chronic inflammatory disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis),
     infections, idiopathic lung disease and malignancies. Environmental

     exposure to inhaled toxins, medications and radiation therapy has also been
     associated with pulmonary fibrosis.
              Methods of treating or preventing pulmonary fibrosis in a subject,
     including administering to the subject an effective amount of one or more
 5   LYST inhibitors to reduce, decrease, limit or prevent one or more symptoms
     of pulmonary fibrosis relative to an untreated control subject are provided.
     Typical symptoms include chronic dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue
     and weakness, chest discomfort, loss of appetite and weight loss. In some
     embodiments, one or more LYST inhibitors improve respiratory function,
10   reduce inflammation, reduce fibrosis, or a combination thereof in a subject
     with pulmonary fibrosis relative to an untreated control subject.
                                     Other Fibrotic Diseases
              Methods of treating or preventing diseases characterized by excessive
     fibrosis in a subject, including administering to the subject an effective
15   amount of one or more LYST inhibitors to reduce, decrease, limit or prevent
     one or more symptoms of excessive fibrosis relative to an untreated control
     subject are provided. Exemplary disease and disorders that can be treated by
     the disclosed methods include nephrosclerosis, scleroderma, Sharp's
     syndrome, Neurofibromatosis, myelofibrosis, systemic sclerosis,
20   Dupuytren's contracture and macular degeneration. In addition, methods for
     the treatment of scarring and fibrosis associated with surgical complications,
     chemotherapeutic, or other drug-induced fibrosis, radiation-induced fibrosis,
     fibrosis resulting from injury and burns are provided.
                              Diseases associated with platelet function
25            Methods of treating or preventing diseases characterized by excessive
     or deleterious platelet activation and/or platelet derived growth factor
      (PDGF) mediated signaling are provided. Because platelets play a critical
     role in the blood clotting process, therapies directed against platelets are
      some of the most important in the battle against vascular diseases of the heart
30    and brain. Inappropriate or excessive activation of platelets can give rise to
      clot formation within an intact vessel (thrombosis). A clot that breaks free
      and begins to travel around the body (thromboembolism) can cause vessel
      obstruction or occlusion, blood stasis, ischemia, stroke and/or death.
                                             59

WO 2015/168674                                                          PCT/US2015/029014
              It has been established that reduced LYST leads to reduced platelet
     activation and reduced expression of PDGF (see Example 7). Accordingly,
     LYST-inhibitors can be used as anti-platelet drugs, to reduce or prevent
     deleterious platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Methods of
 5   treating or preventing diseases characterized by deleterious or excessive
     platelet activation in a subject, including administering to the subject an
     effective amount of one or more LYST inhibitors to reduce, decrease, limit
     or prevent one or more symptoms of deleterious or excessive platelet
     aggregation relative to an untreated control subject are provided. Thus,
10   LYST inhibitors can be used to treat or prevent diseases or disorders
     associated with undesirable or deleterious platelet function. Examples of
     disorders resulting from inappropriate/deleterious activation of platelets
     include platelet hyper-aggregation or increased mean platelet volume (MPV)
     and thrombocytosisl arterial thrombosis; venous thrombosis (Budd-Chiari
15    syndrome; Cavernous sinus thrombosis; Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis;
      deep vein thrombosis; Paget-Schroetter disease; portal vein thrombosis;
     jugular vein thrombosis; renal vein thrombosis); and microcirculatory
     thrombosis. Arterial thrombosis can partially or completely obstruct the
      flow of blood causing downstream ischemia, stroke or myocardial infarction.
20             Increased or uncontrolled over-expression of platelet derived growth
      factor (PDGF) and uncontrolled PDGF signaling has been implicated in the
      growth, angiogenesis and metastasis of cancer cells as well as diseases
      associated with such as development, survival and metastasis of tumors
      (reviewed in Andrae, et al., Genes Dev., 22:ppl276-1312 (2008)). Inhibition
25    of PDGF has been shown to reduce glioma cell growth. Several inhibitors of
      PDGFR-mediated signaling, such as imatinib, have entered clinical trials for
      treatment of a variety of malignancies. Accordingly, one or more LYST
      inhibitors can be used to treat or prevent any disease associated with
      increased or up-regulated expression of PDGF and/or uncontrolled PDGF
30    signaling. Exemplary diseases include cancers such as glioblastomas (e.g.,
      anaplastic oligodendrogliomas) and sarcomas (e.g., dermal sarcoma;
      esophageal squamous cell sarcomas), as well as retinal vascular disease (e.g.,
      ischemic retinopathies).

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
              B.       Methods of Treatment
              Inhibition of LYST can be used as a therapeutic mechanism through
     either local or systemic delivery. In some embodiments, the compositions
     are administered systemically. Delivery vehicles can be selected and used to
 5   target the inhibitors to a particular location or cell type. In other
     embodiments, the inhibitors are directly administered to the vasculature
     using a device or graft, such as those discussed above. In further
     embodiments, the route of administration targets the inhibitors directly to a
     specific organ or to the local site of injury.
10             It has been established that the processes of vascular proliferation and
     inflammation are linked. It is believed that LYST moderates immune
     processes that contribute to proliferative disorders, such as the restenosis
     process. Early pharmacological intervention can preclude chronic therapy
     and any potentially adverse side effects associated with chronic therapy. For
15   example, the compositions disclosed herein can reduce or prevent neointima
     formation, but allow neo-tissue growth to occur. Methods of treatment and
     prevention of diseases and disorders using the disclosed LYST inhibitors
     optionally including a delivery vehicle are discussed in more detail below.
                               Controls
20             The effect of a LYST inhibitor can be compared to a control. Suitable
     controls are known in the art and include, for example, untreated cells or an
     untreated subject. In some embodiments, the control is untreated tissue from
     the subject that is treated, or from an untreated subject. Preferably the cells
      or tissue of the control are derived from the same tissue as the treated cells or
25   tissue. In some embodiments, an untreated control subject suffers from the
      same disease or condition as the treated subject. For example, in some
      embodiments, one or more of the pharmacological or physiological markers
      or pathways affected by anti-LYST treatment is compared to the same
     pharmacological or physiological marker or pathway in untreated control
30    cells or untreated control subjects. For example, anti-LYST treated subjects
      can be compared to subjects treated with other inhibitors of neointima
      formation, such as rapamycin. The subjects treated with other inhibitors of
      neointima formation can have a greater incidence of in post-operative
                                               61

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
     stenosis, or a reduced formation of neo-vascular tissue than do subjects
     treated with the LYST inhibitors.
              Pharmaceutical compositions including one or more LYST inhibitors
     can be administered in a variety of manners, depending on whether local or
 5   systemic treatment is desired, and depending on the area to be treated. For
     example, the disclosed compositions can be administered intravenously,
     intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracavity, or
     transdermally. The compositions may be administered parenterally (e.g.,
     intravenously), by intramuscular injection, by intraperitoneal injection,
10   transdermally, extracorporeally, topically or the like, including topical
     intranasal administration or administration by inhalation.
              Parenteral administration of the composition, if used, is generally
     characterized by injection. Injectable formulations can be prepared in
     conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms
15   suitable for solution of suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as
     emulsions. Administration involving use of a slow release or sustained
     release system, such that a constant dosage is maintained, is also discussed.
              In certain embodiments, the compositions are administered locally,
     for example, by injection directly into a site to be treated. Local delivery of
20   drugs can reduce side effects or toxicity associated with systemic delivery
     and can result in enhanced treatment outcome due to an increased localized
     dose.
               Methods of administering the disclosed inhibitors of LYST locally
     (i.e., via local drug delivery, LDD) are provided. In certain embodiments,
25   LYST inhibitors can be administered directly to a treated tissue, such as an
     artery or vein, without engendering adverse systemic effects. In further
      embodiments, the compositions are injected or otherwise administered
      directly to one or more surgical sites. Typically, local injection causes an
      increased localized concentration of the compositions which is greater than
30   that which can be achieved by systemic administration. In preferred
      embodiments, the compositions are delivered directly to tissue, prostheses,
      grafts or medical devices by local injection or topical administration. In some
      embodiments LYST inhibitors delivered locally result in concentrations that
                                              62

WO 2015/168674                                                             PCT/US2015/029014
     are twice, 10 times, 100 times, 500 times, 1000 times or more than 1000
     times greater than that achieved by systemic administration of the same
     compound. In some embodiments the locally administered LYST inhibitors
     are steadily released at the site of delivery at a constant rate over a period of
 5   time. Preferably, the steady release maintains a desired concentration of the
     LYST inhibitor at the site of delivery.
             The disclosed LYST inhibitors can be administered during a period
     before, during, or after onset of disease symptoms, or any combination of
     periods before, during or after onset of one or more disease symptoms. For
10   example, the subject can be administered one or more doses of the
     composition every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, or 48 days prior to onset
     of disease symptoms. The subject can be administered one or more doses of
     the composition every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, or 48 days after the
     onset of disease symptoms. In some embodiments, the multiple doses of the
15   compositions are administered before an improvement in disease condition is
     evident. For example, in some embodiments, the subject receives 1, 2, 3, 4,
     5, 6 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, or 48, over a period of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 7, 14, 21, 28, 35,
     or 48 days or weeks before an improvement in the disease or condition is
     evident.
20            Thus, the disclosed compositions including one or more LYST
     inhibitors can be administered at different times in relation to a diagnosis,
     prognosis, surgery or injury depending on the disease or disorder to be
     treated. The timing of commencement of anti-LYST therapy should be
     determined based upon the needs of the subject, and can vary from at the
25   time of surgery or injury, to one or more days, weeks or months after surgery
     or injury. Methods for using formulations for delayed release of LYST
     inhibitors are provided. In some embodiments, therapy using inhibitors of
     LYST can be discontinued once vascular neo-tissue growth has occurred.
              In some embodiments a single dose of one or more inhibitors of
30   LYST is delivered to a subject as one or more bolus doses to raise the blood
      concentration of the one or more inhibitors to a desired level. The bolus can
     be given by any means, such as via injection. The placement of the bolus
      dose can be varied depending upon the desired effect and the target organ or
                                              63

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
     tissue to be treated. In a particular embodiment, a bolus is given prior to the
     administration of other dosage forms, such as pulsatile release dosages
     forms. Thus, the desired blood concentration of one or more LYST inhibitors
     can be maintained for a desired period of time using a combination of
 5   formulations for immediate, delayed or pulsatile release.
             In the case of adhesions, the deposition of connective tissue between
     normal anatomical structures is unnecessary and, thus, preventing the
     development of vascular tissue is not detrimental. Thus, for prevention and
     reduction of adhesions, LYST inhibitors would typically be applied at the
10   time of surgery or shortly thereafter, for example, within one week. In the
     case of surgical procedures at risk of neointima formation, for example,
     stenosis, or restenosis of tissue grafts or stents, one or more LYST inhibitors
     can be administered at the time of surgery. In the case of injury or surgery
     involving the skin, the LYST inhibitors can be applied following re
15   epithelialization of the skin's surface.
                                      Coating onto Grafts and Devices
              One or more LYST inhibitors can be delivered locally by
      incorporating the one or more inhibitors into a medical device such as a stent
      or other prosthesis, by loading the inhibitor(s) into or onto a structural or
20    sealing material of the device. The rate of release of the inhibitor(s) may be
      controlled by a number of methods including varying one or more of the
      ratio of the absorbable material to the agent, the molecular weight of: the
      absorbable material, the composition of the inhibitor(s), the composition of
      the absorbable polymer, the coating thickness, the number of coating layers
25    and their relative thicknesses, the inhibitor concentration, and/or physical or
      chemical binding or linking of the inhibitor(s) to the device or sealing
      material. Top coats of polymers and other materials, including absorbable
      polymers may also be applied to control the rate of release of the one or
      more inhibitors.
30            In some embodiments, the amount of LYST inhibitor present on a
      device or graft tissue can be adjusted by changing the delivery vehicle. The
      penetration of the inhibitor throughout the tissue can also be adjusted. In this
      way the amount of drug locally released at the site of implantation can be
                                              64

WO 2015/168674                                                          PCT/US2015/029014
     carefully controlled. Typically, the LYST inhibitor or a delivery vehicle
     carrying the inhibitor is contacted with a device or graft material ex vivo. The
     contacting can occur in the absence or presence of mild agitation, or other
     methods known in the art to insure that inhibitor attaches to or penetrates the
 5   device or graft tissue. Agitation may be accomplished, for example, by
     incubation on an orbital shaker, or by vertical rotation, such as by incubation
     in a vertical carousel of a hybridization oven. The incubation protocol can be
     varied to affect the positioning of the particles on the device or graft. The
     amount and localization of attachment of delivery vehicles such as particles
10   to the device or graft can also be varied by varying the type and density of
     attachment and targeting ligands, such as those described, presented on the
     vehicle. Exemplary compositions and methods for delivering drugs to
     vascular grafts ex vivo are discussed in U.S. Published Application Nos.
     2006/0002971, 2010/0151436, and U.S. Patent No. 7,534,448.
15           The compositions and methods can be used to locally deliver LYST
     inhibitors to grafts with, or without the requirement for further invasive
     procedures, such as placement of a vascular graft or stent.
              C.      Dosages and Effective Amounts
             In some in vivo approaches, the compositions of LYST inhibitors are
20   administered to a subject in a therapeutically effective amount. As used
     herein the term "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount"
     means a dosage sufficient to treat, inhibit, or alleviate one or more symptoms
     of the disorder being treated or to otherwise provide a desired pharmacologic
     and/or physiologic effect. The precise dosage will vary according to a
25   variety of factors such as subject-dependent variables (e.g., age, immune
     system health, etc.), the disease or disorder, and the treatment being effected.
             For all of the disclosed compounds, as further studies are conducted,
     information will emerge regarding appropriate dosage levels for treatment of
     various conditions in various patients, and the ordinary skilled worker,
30   considering the therapeutic context, age, and general health of the recipient,
     will be able to ascertain proper dosing. The selected dosage depends upon
     the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, and on the
      duration of the treatment desired. Generally dosage levels of between 0.001
                                             65

WO 2015/168674                                                           PCT/US2015/029014
     and 100 mg/kg of body weight daily are administered to mammals, most
     preferably, humans. Generally, for intravenous injection or infusion, dosage
     may be lower. Preferably, the compositions are formulated to achieve a
     LYST inhibitor serum level of between about 1 and about 1000 pLM at the
 5   site where treatment is desired.
              In some embodiments, the LYST inhibitors are effective to prevent
     the normal biological activities of immune cells, such as macrophages,
     platelets and NK cells. For example, one or more inhibitors can be in an
     amount effective to reduce or prevent the migratory or chemotactic activity
10   of macrophages.
              In one embodiment the one or more LYST inhibitors are in an
     amount effective to prevent or reduce neointima formation in a subject. In a
     preferred embodiment the amount of one or more LYST inhibitors does not
     prevent wound healing or the formation of neotissue in a subject compared to
15   an untreated control. Preferably, the amount of one or more LYST inhibitors
     is effective to prevent or reduce neointima formation and enhance wound
     healing in a subject compared to an untreated control.
              In another embodiment, the one or more LYST inhibitors are in an
     amount effective to decrease the amount of blood vessel growth at the site of
20   an injury or surgery, to prevent or decrease the formation of high density
     cellular and connective tissue that give rise to fibrosis, scarring, keloids or
     adhesions. Preferably the amount of one or more LYST inhibitors does not
     prevent wound healing.
              In another embodiment, one or more LYST inhibitors are in an
25    amount effective to decrease or inhibit platelet activation. For example,
     LYST inhibitors can be in an amount effective to prevent or inhibit
      inappropriate platelet aggregation and secretion of chemokines at the site of
      an injury or surgery. In a further embodiment, the one or more LYST
      inhibitors are in an amount effective to decrease the amount of Platelet
30    Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) and/or Transforming Growth Factor Beta
      (TGFp) produced or secreted by cells in response to activation by thrombin
      at a the site of an injury or surgery. One or more LYST inhibitors can be
      effective to reduce the production or secretion of PDGF-A, PDGF-B,
                                             66

WO 2015/168674                                                          PCT/US2015/029014
     PDGF-C, or PDGF-D. Thus, one or more LYST inhibitors can be effective
     to reduce the amount of biologically active PDGF in the serum. For
     example, the amount of PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, PDGF-CC, PDGF-DD or
     PGDF-AB can be reduced relative to the amount in an untreated control.
 5   Accordingly, one or more LYST inhibitors can be effective to reduce or
     prevent one or more biological activities that occur as a result of PDGF, or as
     a result of downstream signaling events controlled by PDGF. For example,
     one or more LYST inhibitors can be effective to reduce or prevent the
     activation of one or more tyrosine kinase receptors, such as PDGF Receptor
10   a (PDGFRa); PDGF Receptor        P (PDGFRp); and/or PDGF Receptor as
     (PDGFup). By reducing or preventing the activity of one or more PDGFs,
     the LYST inhibitors can reduce or prevent PDGF-mediated induction of
     several signaling pathways controlling cellular activities including cellular
     proliferation, chemotaxis and actin reorganization.
15            In another embodiment, the one or more LYST inhibitors are in an
     amount effective to prevent or decrease the formation of high density cellular
     and connective tissue that give rise to fibrosis, scarring, keloids or adhesions.
     Preferably the amount of one or more LYST inhibitors does not prevent
     wound healing.
20           D.       Combination Therapies
              The disclosed compositions, devices, and grafts including LYST
     inhibitors can be administered alone, or in combination with one or more
     additional active agent(s), as part of a therapeutic or prophylactic treatment
     regime. For example, the composition can be administered on the first,
25   second, third, or fourth day, or combinations thereof. The composition can
     be administered on the same day, or a different day than the second active
     agent.
             The term "combination" or "combined" is used to refer to either
     concomitant, simultaneous, or sequential administration of two or more
30   agents. Therefore, the combinations can be administered either
     concomitantly (e.g., as an admixture), separately but simultaneously (e.g.,
     via separate intravenous lines into the same subject), or sequentially (e.g.,
     one of the compounds or agents is given first followed by the second).

      Example 1: The beige mutation reduces stenosis in tissue grafts
               Methods and Materials
               Tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVG) were developed by seeding
                                              69

WO 2015/168674                                                         PCT/US2015/029014
     autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells onto a biodegradable
     tubular scaffold fabricated from a polyglycolic acid-fiber tube coated with a
     50:50 copolymer of poly lactic acid and polycaprolactone.
              A murine model for evaluating TEVG function was developed in an
 5   effort to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the
     formation of TEVG. The inferior vena cava (IVC) interposition graft model
     is a validated model for investigating the use of vascular grafts in a low
     pressure, high flow circulatory system similar to the Fontan circulation. This
     model was used extensively to study neotissue formation in the TEVG.
10            A biodegradable conduit graft composed of PGA-PCL/LA was
     implanted into the inferior vena cava of wild-type mice and beige mutant
     mice, respectively, without cell seeding. Grafts were explanted 2 weeks after
     surgery, sectioned and measured for the diameter of the vessel and assessed
     for patency.
15            Results
              Significant variation in the stenosis rates was observed when TEVG
     were implanted as IVC interposition grafts, depending on the strain of the
     mouse. Specifically, it was noted that TEVG implanted in mice with a beige
     mutation had exceptionally low rates of stenosis. The patency and luminal
20   diameter of TEVG implanted as IVC interposition grafts were compared in
     both C57B6 (wild-type mice) (N=25) and beige mutants (N=10) (Table 1).
      The wild-type mice exhibited a 80% stenosis with luminal diameters
     measuring 0.33 mm whereas the beige mice exhibited a 10% stenosis rate
     with luminal diameters measuring 0.71 mm (T-test <0.001 and Chi-square
25    0.0002) (Figure 1).

     Example 2: The beige mutation reduces macrophage infiltration into
     tissue grafts
              Methods and Materials
              It has previously been demonstrated using the murine model that
 5   vascular neotissue formation arises from cells derived from the host and that
     the process of vascular neotissue formation is orchestrated by the immune
     system, specifically host-derived macrophages. Excessive macrophage
     infiltration leads to stenosis, while inhibition of macrophage infiltration
     prevents neotissue formation.
10            The number of macrophages in the explanted grafts described above
     in Example 1 was measured for both beige and wild type mice.
     Immunohistochemistry was carried out on tissue sections of each graft to
     characterize the number and morphology of endothelial cells in each group,
     using an antibody specific for the CD31 cell marker.
15            Results
              The TEVG implanted in the beige mice exhibited significantly less
     macrophage infiltration than TEVG implanted in the wild type mice at 2
     weeks after surgery. See Figure 2. Notably, immunohistochemistry for
     endothelial cells (using an antibody specific for CD 31) did not show any
20   difference between graft sections from wild-type and beige mice, indicating
     that neotissue formation was similar in both groups.
     Example 3: The beige phenotype arises from a mutation in the LYST
     gene
              Methods and Materials
25             The beige mutation arises from a spontaneous mutation of the LYST
     gene (Figure 3). For analysis of protein expression, 6 different primers,
     designated LYSTI, LYST3, LYST4, LYST5 and LYST6, respectively, were
      designed to cover the complete LYST gene region. The LYST-5 primer
      covered the area of exon 52 that included the amino acid mutation identified
30    in the beige mouse genotype. Raw cells were used as a standard to calculate
     relative mRNA levels.
               Results
               The specific mutation responsible for the beige phenotype in Beige
                                              71

WO 2015/168674                                                         PCT/US2015/029014
     mice was identified. The full length LYST gene encodes a 3801 amino acid
     polypeptide. The mutation of LYST occurred on exon 52 resulting in
     deletion of the Amino acid isoleucine (ile3741 del) (Figure 3).
              Molecular analyses demonstrated that there was no significant
  5  difference in expression of mRNA between both groups. Despite equivalent
     levels of transcription of the wild-type and mutant proteins, there was no
     translation of the mutant protein.
              Further, LYST protein expression was depleted in beige mutant
     mouse by immunohistochemistry and western blotting (Figure 4). These
10   results indicated that LYST gene mutation in beige mouse affect protein
     modification level after translation from gene.
     Example 4: The beige mutation in the LYST gene alters immune
     processes
              Methods and Materials
15            The hypothesis that the beige mutation inhibits the formation of
      TEVG stenosis by modulating the immune system was tested. Bone marrow
     was transplanted from C57B6 (wild-type) mice into beige mutant mice, and
      vice versa. FACS analyses were carried out to determine the percentage of
      LYST monocytes in Beige and wild-type mice. In addition, the ability of
20    platelet activation upon stimulation with fibrin was reduced in beige mutant
      mice compared with wild-type.
              Results
              Significant inhibition of TEVG stenosis was demonstrated in wild
      type mice transplanted with bone marrow from the beige mice. Similarly,
25    when TEVG were implanted in beige mice transplanted with the bone
      marrow from wild-type mice they exhibited high rates of TEVG stenosis.
      These findings indicated the beige mutation inhibits TEVG stenosis via its
      effect on the immune system. FACS analysis of monocytes and
      macrophages from Wt and Beige mice, respectively, demonstrated difference
 30   in the phenotype population. A series of scatter dot plots showing
      representative results of analytical flow cytometry show the proportion of
      monocyte cells stained for CD 115 (Y-axis) and CD1 lb (X-axis) from WT3,
      WT4, bg3 and bg4 mice, respectively. The distribution of cells that are
                                              72

     stained for LYC6 and F4/80 from WT3, WT4, bg3 and bg4 mice,
     respectively, were also determined.. The percentage of cells designated as
     LYC6 "Hi" and LYC6 "lo" was calculated. Results are representative of
     peritoneal macrophages 3 days after stimulation with thioglycolate, gated to
  5  exclude dead cells and debris.
              Scatter dot plots showed representative results of analytical flow
     cytometry, plotting cells stained for PE-A (Y-axis) against FITC-A
     fluorescence (X-axis) from WT mice and Beige mice, respectively. Cells
     were gated to exclude dead cells and debris following platelet activation
10   following stimulation with fibrin. The number of LY6C "hi" monocytes was
     higher in wild type group (WT3, WT4), whereas the number of Ly6C "low"
     monocytes was higher in beige group (bg 3, bg) in peritoneal macrophage at
     3 days after stimulation with thioglycolate.
              FACS analysis also demonstrated that the ability of platelet activation
 15  upon stimulation of cells with fibrin was reduced in beige mutant mice, as
     compared with wild-type mice.
     Example 5: LYST-mediated immunomodulation can be achieved using
      an antibody to the LYST protein
              Methods and Materials
20            The effects of blocking the LYST protein were investigated using an
      anti-LYST antibody. C57B6 mice were treated with the anti-LYST antibody
      and then implanted with TEVG. Anti- LYST antibody was injected into
     peritoneum of wild type mouse in each of three different treatment groups (0
      mg/kg (control), 10 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg) at 1 day before surgery, as well as 1
25    week after surgery. Mice were sacrificed and graft and spleen was explanted
      at 2 weeks after surgery. Histology was carried out using Hematoxylin and
      eosin staining (HE stain) of the graft. Spleen tissue was analyzed by Western
      blotting using an antibody specific for the LYST protein to determine the
      relative effective amount of LYST protein in each treatment group.
 30           Results
              The systemic injection of anti- LYST antibody showed improvement
      of graft patency in dose dependent fashion. A noted inhibition of
      macrophage infiltration and decreased TEVG stenosis was observed. This
                                              73

WO 2015/168674                                                         PCT/US2015/029014
     dose-dependent increase in patency was accompanied by a dose-dependent
     reduction in the presence of the LYST protein within spleen tissue, as
     determined by immunohistochemistry. Thus, a method of
     immunomodulation that results in improved neotissue formation and
 5   inhibition of the formation of TEVG stenosis has been established.
     Example 6: Transgenic mice lacking a functional Lyst gene do not
     exhibit stenosis of TEVG
             Methods and Materials
              C57BL/6 transgenic mice lacking a functional LYST protein were
10   generated. These mice were designated C57BL/6 Lysttmlb. The technology
     used to generate this knockout strain uses a LacZ reporter. PCR for LacZ
     confirmed the knockout model.
              To determine whether C57BL/6Lysttmlb knockout mice would
     develop stenosis following TEVG implantation, 5 C57BL/6 Lystimib mice
15   and 5 C57BL/6 wild type mice were implanted with unseeded TEVG. The
     TEVG were explanted and examined 2 weeks following implantation.
              Results
              100% of unseeded tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVG)
     implanted in Lystimlb knockout mice (n=5) were patent after 2-week
20   implantation (see Figure 5; Table 1). In contrast, C57BL/6 wild type mice
     exhibited approximately 90% incidence of stenosis.
     Example 7: Lyst modulates platelet function in response to activation
              Methods and Materials
              The Lyst protein is understood to be involved in platelet function, and
25    Chediak Higashi Syndrome, the human correlate, is characterized as a
      "platelet storage pool deficiency." Platelet rich plasma (PRP) was obtained
      from Beige (Bg) and Wild Type (WT) mice. Samples were activated by
     thrombin and total concentrations of secreted PDGF (platelet derived growth
      factor) from each group (n=7) were compared to resting, non-activated
30    controls (n=5).
              Results
              In both the activated and resting groups, thrombin activation resulted
      in significantly greater concentrations of PDGF. However, the PDGF
                                             74

WO 2015/168674                                                        PCT/US2015/029014
     secretion from activated platelets was significantly decreased in the Beige
     group when compared to Wild Type (see Figure 6). Thus, reduction of Lyst
     activity also reduced PDGF, indicating that agents which reduce Lyst
     activity can also function as anti-platelet agents.
