   Abstract
   A clip for fixing a cladding sheet to an underlying
   support structure includes a base  (5),  a pair of side
 5 walls  (7) extending from the base and converging towards
   each other, and a pair of flanges  (9) extending outwardly
   and downwardly from the side walls.    The flanges define
   retaining members for engaging re-entrant portions of ribs
   of cladding sheets.   The side walls do not contact each
10 other in the as-manufactured form of the clip and are
   forced inwardly towards each other or into contact with
   each other when a cladding sheet is positioned on the
   clip.   The flanges define part of an arch when a cladding
   sheet is positioned on the clip with the side walls forced
15 together.   The flanges have sharp outwardly facing ends
   that engage the re-entrant portion of one of the ribs of a
   cladding sheet when the cladding sheet is positioned on
   the clip.

                               A CLIP
              The present invention relates to a clip for
   fixing a roof or other cladding sheet to an underlying
 5 support structure.
              The present invention relates particularly,
   although by no means exclusively, to a clip for fixing a
   roof cladding sheet to an underlying roof support
10 structure.
              Typically, roof cladding sheets are roll-formed
   from painted or unpainted steel strip and include one or
   more parallel ribs with opposed sides, pan sections, and
15 side edge formations that enable the sheets to be
   positioned side by side in overlapping relationship.
              It is known to secure cladding sheets to an
   underlying roof support structure, such as roof purlins,
20 by fastening the sheets directly to the underlying
   structure using fasteners, such as roofing nails and
   screws, that pierce the sheets and penetrate the
   underlying structure.
25            It is also known to secure cladding sheets to an
   underlying structure by using clips that are secured to
   the structure by fasteners and are formed to extend into
   the ribs and include retaining members or tabs that can
   engage re-entrant portions of the ribs and thereby retain
30 the sheets to the clips.   These clip assemblies are often
   preferred over nails because they enable concealed fixing
   of cladding sheets to an underlying structure.
              In use, the concealed fixing retaining clips are
35 secured to an underlying structure at spaced intervals
   related to the spacing between the ribs of the cladding
   sheets.  Thereafter, cladding sheets are positioned on the
                                             7934926_1 (GHMatters) P46748.AU.60 4 / 07 /16

                               -  2
   clips in overlapping relationship by successively pressing
   the sheets down onto the clips so that the sides of the
   ribs are initially forced outwardly to allow the re
   entrant portions of the ribs to pass over the retaining
 5 members and then snap inwardly into engagement with the
   retaining members.
             There are a number of known concealed fixing
   retaining clips.   The clips include a series of clips
10 disclosed in International application PCT/GB91/00450                       (WO
   91/12392) in the name of Stramit Industries Limited, a
   clip disclosed in Australian patent 685102 and other
   Australian patents and patent applications in the name of
   Stramit Corporation, and a clip disclosed in International
15 application PCT/AU01/00818    (WO 01/02666) in the name of
   the applicant. The clip disclosed in International
   application PCT/AU01/00818 is marketed in Australia under
   the trade mark KLIPLOK.
20           An object of the present invention is to provide
   an alternative concealed fixing retaining clip to the
   above-mentioned clips that has advantages over one or more
   of these clips.
25           The applicant has developed a new form of
   concealed fixing retaining clip that is a relatively
   straightforward construction compared to the above
   mentioned clips and has at least comparable performance to
   one or more of these known clips.
30
             The present invention provides a concealed fixing
   retaining clip for fixing a roof or other cladding sheet
   to an underlying support structure of the general type
   that includes:
35
    (a)      a base;
                                               7934926_1 (GHMatters) P46748.AU.60 4 / 07 /16

                              - 3
    (b)      a pair of side walls that extend from the base,
             with the side walls of the clip being formed so
             that they do not contact each other in the as
             manufactured form of the clip and are forced
 5           inwardly towards each other or into contact with
             each other when, in use, a cladding sheet is
             positioned on the clip;  and
    (c)      a pair of flanges that define retaining members
10           for engaging re-entrant portions in the sides of
             ribs of cladding sheets, with one flange
             extending from an upper end of one side wall and
             the other flange extending from an upper end of
             the other  side wall.
15
             Preferably the clip is formed from a resilient
   material so that each side wall of the clip applies an
   outwardly directed force in response to the side walls
   being forced together when, in use, a cladding sheet is
20 positioned on the clip.  This feature contributes to
   ensuring engagement of the flanges and the re-entrant
   portions of the ribs of the cladding sheet.         Specifically,
   the resultant outward force forces the flanges against the
   cladding sheet.
25
             Preferably the flanges are a mirror image of
   each other about a centre-line plane that passes
   perpendicularly through the base of the clip.
30           Preferably the side walls and the base are
   straight sides so that the side walls and the base define
   a triangular structure when viewed from a side of the
   clip.  This feature contributes to the overall strength
   and stiffness of the clip.   More particularly, the
35 triangular structure contributes to the capacity of the
   clip to withstand downward loading of the clip, for
   example when a person presses down on a rib of a cladding
                                             7934926_1 (GHMatters) P46748.AU.60 4 / 07 /16

                              - 4
   sheet to force the rib over the clip.   In addition, the
   triangular structure can accommodate off-centre downward
   loading that may be applied to the clip when a cladding
   sheet is forced down onto the clip.   Specifically, the
 5 side walls of the clip can slide relative to each other in
   response to off-centre downward loading and return to the
   original profile.  In addition, the triangular structure
   contributes to the resistance of the side walls to outward
   movement of the side walls beyond the as-manufactured
10 positions of the side walls and therefore is a factor in
   the clip being able to resist uplift forces on a cladding
   sheet.
             Preferably each side wall includes one or more
15 than one reinforcing rib to improve the strength and
   stiffness of the side wall.
             Preferably at least one edge of each side wall
   includes an inwardly turned flange to improve the strength
20 and stiffness of the side wall.
             Preferably the flanges define at least part of an
   arch when, in use, a cladding sheet is positioned on the
   clip with the side walls forced together. This feature
25 contributes to the capacity of the clip to resist uplift
   forces acting on the cladding sheet.   Specifically, this
   feature takes advantage of a characteristic of an arch
   that it is a structure that can translate uplift forces to
   outward forces.
30
             Preferably the side walls contact each other or
   are in close proximity to each other at or in the vicinity
   of the upper ends of the clip when, in use, a cladding
   sheet is positioned on the clip and forces the side walls
35 together. This feature ensures that there is clip material
   as close as possible to the apex of the arch and thereby
   contributes to concentrating as much clip material as
                                             7934926_1 (GHMatters) P46748.AU.60 4 / 07 /16

                              -  5
   possible in the upper section of the clip and thereby
   optimising the strength of the clip in this section of the
   clip.
 5           Preferably the flanges extend outwardly and
   downwardly relative to each other as viewed when the clip
   is positioned with the clip base on a horizontal surface.
             The flanges may describe a relatively steep
10 approach angle relative to a rib of a cladding sheet so
   that there is gradual rather than sudden outward
   deflection of the sides of the rib of the cladding sheet
   when, in use, the cladding sheet is forced downwardly onto
   the clip to position the sheet on the clip.        This feature
15 contributes to minimising denting of the sheet.
             With this arrangement, preferably the flanges are
   relatively long, preferably at least 25% of the height of
   the clip.
20
             Preferably the approach angle, described by each
   flange and the base of the clip, is between      40* and 75*.
             Alternatively, the flanges may describe a
25 relatively gentle approach angle relative to a rib of a
   cladding sheet so that there is sudden rather than a
   gradual outward deflection of the sides of the rib of the
   cladding sheet when, in use, the cladding sheet is forced
   downwardly onto the clip to position the sheet on the
30 clip.
             With this arrangement, preferably the flanges are
   relatively short, preferably less than 25% of the height
   of the clip.
35
             Preferably the approach angle, described by each
   flange and the base of the clip, is less than 40*.
                                            7934926_1 (GHMatters) P46748.AU.60 4 / 07 /16

                              - 6
             Preferably each flange has a sharp outer end that
   contacts and thereby engages securely the re-entrant
   portion of one of the ribs of a cladding sheet when, in
 5 use, the cladding sheet is positioned on the clip.
             Preferably the outer end of each flange is
   outwardly directed.  In other words, preferably the outer
   end of each flange is not inwardly turned towards the side
10 walls of the clip.
             Preferably each flange includes the two corner
   sections that are folded inwardly and form surfaces that
   extend transversely to the outer end of the flange and
15 contact and thereby engage a re-entrant portion of one of
   the ribs of a cladding sheet when, in use, the cladding
   sheet is positioned on the clip.  This feature increases
   the surface area of contact between the flanges and the
   re-entrant portions and thereby makes it possible to
20 minimise damage to the sheet when it is necessary to
   remove the sheet from the clip.
             Preferably the transitions between the side walls
   and the flanges are tight radius curves in order to
25 concentrate as much clip material as possible in the upper
   section of the clip to optimise the strength and stiffness
   of this section of the clip.
             Preferably the upper ends of the side walls are
30 shaped to define a generally circular opening in the as
   manufactured clip to facilitate insertion of a screw
   driver to secure the clip to an underlying structure.
             According to the present invention there is also
35 provided a clip assembly which includes:
              (a) an elongate strap; and
                                            7934926_1 (GHMatters) P46748.AU.60 4 / 07 /16

                              - 7
             (b)  a plurality of the concealed fixing
                  retaining clips described above mounted to
                  an upper surface of the strap.

             Figures 1 to 5 illustrate one preferred
   embodiment of a clip 3 formed in accordance with the
   present invention.   Figure 6 illustrates the interaction
20 between the clip and a cladding sheet 29 as the cladding
   sheet is being positioned onto the clip. Figure 7
   illustrates the interaction between the clip and a
   cladding sheet as the cladding sheet is being removed from
   the clip.
25
             The clip 3 is formed by folding a flat metal,
   preferably steel  (but not necessarily spring steel),                  blank
   into the configuration shown the figures.
30           The clip 3 includes:
    (a)      a base 5;
    (b)      a pair of side walls 7 that extend from the base
35           and converge towards each other;     and
    (c)      a pair of flanges 9 that define retaining
                                             7934926_1 (GHMatters) P46748.AU.60 4 / 07 /16

                              -  9
             members for engaging re-entrant portions of ribs
             of cladding sheets, with one flange 9 extending
             from an upper end of one side wall 7 and the
             other flange 9 extending from an upper end of
 5           the other side wall 7.
             The base 5 includes a pair of outwardly extending
   tabs 15 to facilitate locating a plurality of the clips 3
   onto a strap (see Figure 8 embodiment )
10
             With reference to Figure 1, in addition, each
   side wall 7 includes a relatively narrow strap section 7a
   that extends upwardly from the base 5 and a relatively
   wider upper section 7b that extends from the strap section
15 7a.  The upper section 7b is symmetrically positioned with
   respect to the strap section 7a so that the side wall 7
   has 2 downwardly facing shoulders 73.   These shoulders 73
   further facilitate locating the clip 3 onto a strap                  (see
   Figure 8 embodiment).
20
             The base 5 includes an opening 63 to facilitate
   securing the clip 3 to an underlying roof structure, such
   as a roof purlin  (not shown).
25           The side walls 7 and the base 5 are straight
   walls and define a substantially triangular structure in
   side view shown in Figure 2.
             In the as-manufactured form shown in Figures 1 to
30 5 the side walls 7, whilst converging towards each other,
   do not actually contact each other and there is a gap G
   between the side walls 7 at the upper end of the side
   walls.  However, as is shown in Figure 6c, in use, the
   side walls 7 are forced into contact with each other at
35 the upper ends of the side walls when a cladding sheet is
   positioned on the sides walls.
                                             7934926_1 (GHMatters) P46748.AU.60 4 / 07 /16

                              - 10
             Each side wall 7 includes a reinforcing rib 11 to
   improve the stiffness of the side wall 7.
             The upper ends of the side walls 7 are shaped to
 5 define a generally circular opening 13 that facilitates
   insertion of a screw-driver  (not shown) to install the
   clip to an underlying structure.
             The flanges 9 are shaped to form at least part
10 of an arch.
             The transitions between the side walls 7 and the
   flanges 9 are tight radius curves in order to concentrate
   as much clip material as possible in the upper section of
15 the clip 3 to optimise the strength and stiffness of this
   section of the clip.
             Each flange 9 has a relatively steep approach
   angle of the order of between 40* and 75* described by the
20 flange and the base 5.   With reference to Figure 2, the
   approach angle is described by the 2 dotted lines in the
   Figure and the angle between the lines is indicated to be
   40*.
25           Each flange 9 terminates in a sharp lower
   outwardly facing  (as opposed to inwardly turned) end that
   forms a contact surface 25 for engaging a re-entrant
   portion of one of the ribs of a cladding sheet.
30           Each flange 9 includes in-turned sections 17 at
   the two corners at the lower ends of the flange 9.                  The
   corner sections 17 form contact surfaces 21 that extend
   transversely to the contact surface 25 of the outer end of
   the flange.
35
             With reference to Figures 6 and 7, each cladding
   sheet 29 is roll-formed from sheet steel and includes a
                                             7934926_1 (GHMatters) P46748.AU.60 4 / 07 /16

                              - 11
   leading edge  (not shown), a trailing edge    (not shown),                 a
   central lengthwise extending rib, generally identified by
   the numeral 31, and pair of lengthwise extending pans 51
   on opposite sides of the rib 31.
 5
             The cladding sheet 29 may be of any suitable
   length and width and may include any suitable number of
   ribs separated by pans.
10           The rib 31 of the cladding sheet 29 includes two
   sides, generally identified by the numeral 35, that are
   separated by a flat upper section 33.   Each side 35
   includes a section 41 that extends outwardly and
   downwardly from the upper section 33, a section 43 that
15 extends downwardly and inwardly from the lower edge of the
   section 41, and a section 45 that extends downwardly and
   outwardly from the section 43, and a downwardly and
   outwardly shoulder 45 that merges with a pan 51.
20           The sections 43 of each upper retaining clip
   section 15 define opposed re-entrant portions of the rib
   13 and are hereinafter referred to as "re-entrant portions
   43".
25           The leading and trailing edges   (not shown) of the
   cladding sheet 29 are formed as partially-completed ribs
   in order to facilitate interlocking of successive cladding
   sheets.  These partially-completed ribs are hereinafter
   referred to as "leading edge formations" and "trailing
30 edge formations".
             In use, a plurality of the clips 3 are fastened
   to purlins at spaced intervals along the length of the
   purlins using screws.
35
             Thereafter, cladding sheets 29 are successively
   placed over the purlins in overlapping relationship.
                                             7934926_1 (GHMatters) P46748.AU.604/07/16

                             - 12
             The cladding sheets 29 are then progressively
   engaged with the clips 3 as the sheets are successively
   placed over the purlins.
 5
             This is achieved by successively pressing the
   leading edge formations, the ribs 31, and the trailing
   edge formations of the sheets 29 onto the clips 3 so that
   the leading edge formations, the ribs 31, and the trailing
10 edge formations deflect outwardly and the flanges 9 of the
   clips 3 deflect inwardly.
             This movement allows the leading edge formations
   8, the ribs 11, and the trailing edge formations 10 to be
15 positioned on the clips 3 with the surfaces 25 at the
   lower ends of the flanges 9 and the surfaces 21 of the in
   turned corner sections 17 of the flanges 9 engaging the
   re-entrant portions 43 of the ribs 31 so that the cladding
   sheets 29 are secured to the clips 3.
20
             This movement is illustrated in Figure 6 in
   relation to locating the rib 31 of one cladding sheet 29
   onto one clip 3.  It is noted that the steep approach
   angle of the flanges 9 and the inward movement of the side
25 walls 7 illustrated in the Figures minimises the
   possibility of denting of the sections of the cladding
   sheet that contact and slide over the flanges 9.                It is
   also noted that in the installed position shown in Figure
   6c the upper ends of the side walls 7 are in contact with
30 each other.
             Figure 7 illustrates the interaction between the
   clip 3 and the cladding sheet 29 as the cladding sheet is
   being removed from the clip -  as may be necessary in order
35 to gain access to the roof cavity.
             With reference to Figure 7a, the first step of
                                             7934926_1 (GHMatters) P46748.AU.604/07/16

                             - 13
   removing the cladding sheet 29 from the clip 3 involves
   lifting the right hand side of the cladding sheet 29, as
   viewed in the figure, outwardly so that the cladding sheet
   is moved clear of the flange 9 on that side of the clip 3
 5 and the section 45 of that side of the rib 31 is brought
   into contact with and rests on the outer surface of the
   flange 9 on that side of the clip -  as shown in Figure 7b.
             With reference to Figure 7b, the second step of
10 removing the cladding sheet 29 from the clip 3 involves
   moving the left hand side of the cladding sheet 29, as
   viewed in the figure, outwardly so that the cladding sheet
   is moved clear of the flange 9 on that side of the clip 3.
   It can be appreciated that the contact surfaces 21 of the
15 in-turned corner sections 17 of the flanges 9 on that side
   of the clip prevent the contact surfaces 25 formed on the
   lower end of the flange 9 digging into and damaging the
   rear-entrant portion 43 of the cladding sheet on that side
   of the cladding sheet.

             Figure 8 is a perspective view of one preferred
   embodiment of a clip assembly in accordance with the
   present invention which includes a strap 81 and two clips
   83 that are similar to the clip 3 shown in Figures 1 to 7
25 in an as-manufactured form mounted to the strap 81.
             As is indicated above and is apparent from the
   drawings, the clips 3 and 81 are similar and the same
   reference numerals are used to describe the same
30 structural features.
             The strap 81 is a convenient means of fastening a
   plurality of the clips 81 to purlins   (not shown) at
   required spaced intervals along the length of the purlins.
35
             The strap 81 includes a flat base 87 and raised
   lengthwise extending sides 89.  The sides 89 are in the
                                             7934926_1 (GHMatters) P46748.AU.60 4 / 07 /16

                              - 14
   form of downwardly opening channels.    The inwardly facing
   walls  (see Figure 8) of the sides 89 have spaced apart
   slots  (not shown) for receiving the outwardly extending
   tabs 15 of the base 5 of each clip 83.    In addition, the
 5 width of the flat base 87 and the height of the sides 89
   of the strap 81 are selected so that the clips 83 fit
   snugly on the flat base 87 and the downwardly facing
   shoulders 73 of the clips 81   (see the shoulders 73 of the
   Figure 1 embodiment) rest on the top walls 93 of the sides
10 89 of the strap 81.
              The main differences between the clips 3 and 83
   are as follows.
15            1. The flanges 9 of the clip 83 have a relatively
   steep angle of approach and the length of the flanges is
   relatively short compared to the angle of approach and
   length of the flanges of the clip 3.
20            2. The clip 83 does not have inwardly turned
   corners on the flanges.
              3. The clip 83 has inwardly turned flanges 97
   along the edges of the side walls 7 to improve the
25 stiffness of the side walls.
              Many modifications may be made to the preferred
   embodiment of the roofing system described above without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the present
30 invention.
