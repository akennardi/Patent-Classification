                                          BACKGROUND
              Many potential lignocellulosic feedstocks are available today, including
 20  agricultural residues, woody biomass, municipal waste, oilseeds/cakes and seaweed, to
     name a few. At present, these materials are often under-utilized, being used, for
     example, as animal feed, biocompost materials, burned in a co-generation facility or even
     landfilled.
              Lignocellulosic biomass includes crystalline cellulose fibrils embedded in a
 25  hemicellulose matrix, surrounded by lignin. This produces a compact matrix that is
     difficult to access by enzymes and other chemical, biochemical and/or biological
     processes. Cellulosic biomass materials (e.g., biomass material from which the lignin
     has been removed) is more accessible to enzymes and other conversion processes, but
     even so, naturally-occurring cellulosic materials often have low yields (relative to
 30  theoretical yields) when contacted with hydrolyzing enzymes. Lignocellulosic biomass
                                                   1

WO 2014/138551                                                               PCT/US2014/021634
     is even more recalcitrant to enzyme attack. Furthermore, each type of lignocellulosic
     biomass has its own specific composition of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.
  5                                            SUMMARY
             Many processes are disclosed herein for saccharifying or liquifying a biomass
     material, e.g., cellulosic, lignocellulosic and/or starchy feedstocks, by converting
     biomass material to low molecular weight sugars, e.g., saccharifying the feedstock using
 10  an enzyme, e.g., one or more cellulase and/or amylase. The invention also relates to
     converting a feedstock to a product, e.g., by bioprocessing, such as fermentation. The
     processes include utilizing residues from one or more stages of the process for energy
     generation.
             In one aspect the invention relates to a method of generating energy including
 15  combusting a saccharified biomass material to produce energy. Optionally, the energy
     can be in the form of electric energy, heat energy or combinations of these. The
     saccharified material can include cells, such as cells selected from the group consisting
     of yeast cells, bacterial cells, fungal cells and mixtures of these cells. The cells can
     include whole cells (e.g., living, dormant and/or dead) or parts of cells (e.g., lysed and/or
 20  otherwise dead and destroyed cells). In addition or alternatively the saccharified material
     can include protein material (e.g., an enzyme material, a denatured enzyme material,
     peptides and/or amino acids). In addition or alternatively, the saccharified material can
     include inorganic solids, such as inorganic materials selected from the group consisting
     of diatomaceous earth, celite, silica, pumice, perlite, alumina, zeolites, sand and mixtures
 25  of any of these.
             In some instances, the saccharified biomass material comprises lignocellulosic
     residue from lignocellulosic material that has been treated, for example with accelerated
     electrons from an electron accelerator, to reduce its recalcitrance prior to
     saccharification. For example, when treated with electrons, the electrons can have an
 30  average energy between about 0.3 MeV and about 5 MeV, such as between about 0.5
     MeV and about 3.5 MeV or between about 0.8 MeV and about 2 MeV. The
     lignocellulosic biomass can be treated to a total dose between about 10 Mrad and about
     100 Mrad, such as between about 15 Mrad and about 50 Mrad, between about 20 Mrad
     and about 45 Mrad, or between about 25 Mrad and about 40 Mrad. Optionally, the
                                                     2

WO 2014/138551                                                               PCT/US2014/021634
     saccharified biomass is collected utilizing a rotary drum filter and/or a centrifuge, such
     as a decanter centrifuge, prior to combustion.
              In some instances, the saccharified biomass material includes less than 60 percent
     moisture prior to it being combusted, such as less than about 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25,
  5  20, 15 or even less than about 5 percent moisture. For example, the biomass can be dried
     so that is has less than about 60 percent moisture prior to combustion (e.g., dried to have
     less than 55, 50, 45, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15 or even less than 5 percent moisture). Optionally,
     the saccharified biomass material includes less than 35 percent by weight carbohydrates,
     such as less than 33, 30, 25, 20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10 or even less than 8 percent on a dry
 10  basis. The saccharified material can be combusted and the combustion can produce
     greater than about 3500 BTU per pound, such as greater than about 4000, 4500, 5000,
     greater than 6000 or even greater than about 7000 BTU per pound. Optionally, the
     saccharified biomass material has less than 50 percent moisture, such as less than 45 or
     40 percent, and the combustion produces greater than about 4000 BTU per pound of the
 15  material. The saccharified biomass material can include less than 5 percent ash after
     combustion, such as less than 4, 3, 2.5, 2.0 or even less than 1.5 percent. In addition or
     alternatively, the saccharified biomass material includes less than 0.5 percent sulfur, such
     as less than 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 or even less than 0.075 or less than 0.05 percent sulfur.
              In some other instances, a boiler is utilized during the combustion, for example, a
 20  boiler selected from the group consisting of a stoker grate boiler, a fluidized bed boiler
     and a co-fired boiler. For example, a co-fired boiler used for co-firing natural gas or coal
     can be utilized with the biomass. Alternatively, during combustion, a gasifier is utilized,
     such as a fixed bed or a fluidized bed gasifier.
              In another aspect the invention relates to a method of processing a biomass
 25  material. The method includes processing a first portion of lignocellulosic material into a
     product and a solid residue and combusting the solid residue in a boiler to produce
     steam. The method can include coupling the steam with a turbine to produce electricity.
     The energy produced (e.g., the heat from the steam and/or the electricity from the steam
     turbine) can be utilized to process a second portion of lignocellulosic material into a
 30  product. The processing of the biomass can include irradiating the biomass (e.g., with an
     electron beam) and optionally, saccharifying the irradiated biomass, for example with an
     enzyme. The saccharification can produce sugars, for example glucose and/or xylose.
     Optionally the processing of the lignocellulosic material can include fermentation.
                                                     3

WO 2014/138551                                                               PCT/US2014/021634
              In some instances, the solid residue is dried prior to being combusted, for
     example, such that the moisture content is reduced to less than about 25 wt.% water, e.g.,
     less than about 20 wt.%, less than 15 wt.%, less than about 10 wt.%, less than about 5
     wt.%, less than about 1 wt.% or even less than about 0.01 wt.%. The residue, when in
  5  dry form with less than about 5 wt.% water, can have an energy content of at least 4000
     BTU per pound of residue. Optionally, the solid residue is dried using a screw dryer
     (e.g., a screw conveyor with a heated flights, shaft and/or trough). Optionally, the residue
     is combined with a drying agent, for example, a fine biomass material. For example, a
     dry biomass can be mixed in with the solid residue, wherein the content of dry biomass
 10  in the mixture is at least 1 wt.%, at least 2 wt.%, at least 3 wt.%, at least 4 wt.%, at least
     5 wt.%, at least 6 wt.%, at least 7 wt.%, at least 8 wt.%, at least 9 wt.%, at least 10 wt.%,
     at least 15 wt.%, at least 20 wt.% or even between about 20 wt.% and about 30 wt.%.
     For example, the dry biomass can have a moisture content of less than about 25, 20, 15,
     10, 5 or even less than about 1 percent moisture. For example, a fine biomass material
 15  can have a medium particle size less than about 1 mm, less than about 500 pm or less
     than about 100 pm. The combination of the residue with the dry biomass (e.g., fine
     biomass material) can dry or further dry the material. The amount can be added, in
     addition to, or alternatively to, drying to provide a dry material, such that the moisture
     content is reduced to less than about 25 wt.% water, e.g., less than about 20 wt.%, less
 20  than 15 wt.%, less than about 10 wt.%, less than about 5 wt.%, less than about 1 wt.% or
     even less than about 0.01 wt.%. The residue can be formed into a cake, pellet, densified
     shape, powder or combinations of these prior to being combusted (e.g., optionally under
     pressure, and/or while drying). The residue can include at least 0.1% (e.g., at least 0.2%,
     at least 0.5% or even at least 1%) nitrogen in the form of a nitrogen(III) compound, for
 25  example, the nitrogen compound can be or derived from the group consisting of proteins,
     denatured proteins, protein residues, amino acids, amino acid residues, urea, ammonia
     and combinations of these.
              The biomass materials used can, for example, be selected from the group
     consisting of wood, particle board, sawdust, agricultural waste, sewage, silage, grasses,
 30  rice hulls, bagasse, cotton, jute, hemp, flax, bamboo, sisal, abaca, straw, corn cobs, corn
     stover, switchgrass, alfalfa, hay, coconut hair, seaweed, algae, and combinations and of
     these.
              By utilizing the residues from many of the processes disclosed herein to provide
     energy (e.g., for co-generation), the cost of the feedstock conversion process can be
                                                    4

WO 2014/138551                                                             PCT/US2014/021634
     significantly reduced, both by reducing energy costs and minimizing the need for waste
     disposal. In addition, since the residues are biomass derived, the net carbon emissions
     for the entire process are close to zero. As a result, the economic viability and
     profitability of the feedstock conversion process can be markedly enhanced. In addition,
  5  the residues from the processes have a high heat content since there can be a high lignin
     content in the residue e.g., higher than the feedstock such as a lignocellulosic material.
     Another advantage of some of the methods described herein is that the residues require
     little or even no drying since they can be combined with dry biomass such as fines
     produced in the processing of the biomass. In addition to providing a dryer material to
 10  combust, the dried material can be easier to convey. Finally, the methods can be
     advantageous because in some instances the residues can include organic nitrogen (III)
     compounds that during combustion can react to reduce NOx emissions.
              Implementations of the invention can optionally include one or more of the
     following summarized features. In some implementations, the selected features can be
 15  applied or utilized in any order while in other implementations a specific selected
     sequence is applied or utilized. Individual features can be applied or utilized more than
     once in any sequence and even continuously. In addition, an entire sequence, or a portion
     of a sequence, of applied or utilized features can be applied or utilized once, repeatedly
     or continuously in any order. In some optional implementations, the features can be
 20  applied or utilized with different, or where applicable the same, set or varied,
     quantitative or qualitative parameters as determined by a person skilled in the art. For
     example, parameters of the features such as size, individual dimensions (e.g., length,
     width, height), location of, degree (e.g., to what extent such as the degree of
     recalcitrance), duration, frequency of use, density, concentration, intensity and speed can
 25  be varied or set, where applicable, as determined by a person of skill in the art.

                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
              Using the systems, equipment and methods described herein, biomass (e.g., plant
 10  biomass, animal biomass, paper, and municipal waste biomass) can be processed to
     produce useful intermediates, products and energy, for example by cogeneration..
              Cogeneration, also known as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is the
     simultaneous production of electricity and heat from a single fuel source, or multiple fuel
     sources in the case of co-firing. Some biomass processing methods and systems are
 15  described in Biomass Technology Review, October 21, 2010, pages I to 52 by McHale
     and Associates, Inc. and Biomass Conversion Technologies, by the EPA Combined Heat
     and Power Partnership accessed by internet on Feb 27, 2013 pages 30 to 61 at
     www.epa.gov; the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by attachment in
     the appendix. Any process, equipment or system described in this document, attached in
 20  the appendix, can be used in/with any process, equipment or system described anywhere
     herein. For example, Stoker grate underfired stoker boilers can be used to burn
     saccharified biomass.
              FIG. 1 shows an example of a cogeneration process. Initially, boiler feed water
     10 and fuel sources 20 are fed to one or more boilers 30. The fuel sources include the
 25  solid residues discussed herein, and may optionally include other fuels such as natural
     gas, waste gases generated by the feedstock conversion process, and/or a portion of the
     feedstock used in the feedstock conversion process. Steam is generated in the boilers,
     which is input to one or more super heaters 40, which super heat the steam, e.g., to 500
     PSIG and 650 DEG F. This steam is then injected into one or more turbines 50, where it
 30  turns discs or other turbine elements, which in turn rotate a shaft generating mechanical
     energy. This mechanical energy is then input to a generator, where it is converted to
     electricity 70. Meanwhile, cooled steam exhausted from the turbines, which is still at
     elevated temperature and pressure (e.g., 80 PSIG and 310 DEG F), can be utilized in the
     feedstock conversion plant for heating or other purposes 60. Electrical energy from the
                                                    10

WO 2014/138551                                                              PCT/US2014/021634
     generator (e.g., at 4160 Volts) is passed to transformers, e.g., two transformers, where it
     is stepped down to allow its use in the plant 80 (e.g., to 480 Volts) and/or stepped up for
     export to the grid 90 (e.g., to 113,000 Volts).
              Details of these and other steps in a cogeneration process according to one
  5  implementation will now be described.
              In some embodiments the materials to be used are dried. The solid residues from
     the various stages of the feedstock conversion process may in some cases have a
     moisture content of from about 10% to 50% or more. This relatively high moisture
     content can impact the operation of the boiler, in that some of the energy in the boiler
 10  will be consumed in vaporizing the moisture, thus reducing the temperature and
     efficiency of the boiler. Thus, in some implementations, the solid residue is dried prior
     to being combusted, for example to a moisture content of less than about 60 wt.%, ( e.g.,
     less than about 55 wt.%, less than about 50 wt.%, less than about 45 wt.%, less than,
     about 40 wt.%, less than about 35 wt.%, less than about 30 wt.%, less than about 25
 15  wt%, less than about 20 wt%, less than about 15 wt.%, less than about 10 wt.%, or even
     less than about 5 wt.%.
              In some implementations the cogeneration system is equipped with a screw type
     dryer that is used to heat dry the wet residue. For example an indirect heat exchanger
     may be used to heat bulk biomass solids, filter cakes, paste and/or sludge.
 20           The dryer may be, for example, a Hollow Flite Screw Dryer. In this type of dryer
     individual particles are heated as they come in contact with the outer surfaces of hollow
     flights, shaft and trough which contain a heat transfer material, e.g., a thermal oil. There
     is no contamination of the material being dried, as it does not come in contact with the
     heat transfer material. The product is continuously conveyed in an axial direction by
 25  rotating screw flights along a jacketed trough. The dryer uses indirect heat exchange,
     providing excellent product temperature control. The heat transfer material is also
     recycled, minimizing heat losses and increasing efficiency. The thermal energy used to
     heat the heat transfer fluid is preferably provided by the power produced by the
     cogeneration process.
 30           In other implementations, the wet residue may be dried by utilizing heat from
     anywhere and including the boiler and the heating stack. For example hot gases from the
     boiler can be used, or heat from a stack (e.g., utilizing a heat exchanger).
              In addition or alternatively to drying of the residues as described above, the
     residues can be combined with a drying agent such as a dry biomass. For example, a dry
                                                    11

WO 2014/138551                                                              PCT/US2014/021634
     biomass can have less water content than the residues, to adjust the total average water
     content. For example, the dry biomass can, have a moisture content of less than about 25,
     20, 15, 10, 5 or even less than about 1 percent moisture. The dry biomass can be sourced,
     for example, from incoming un-processed biomass as well as any biomass that has been
  5  processed by the methods described herein (e.g., fines from the comminution step). For
     example, a dry biomass can be mixed in with a wet residue from processing described
     herein, wherein the content of dry biomass in the mixture is at least 1 wt.%, at least 2
     wt.%, at least 3 wt.%, at least 4 wt.%, at least 5 wt.%, at least 6 wt.%, at least 7 wt.%, at
     least 8 wt.%, at least 9 wt.%, at least 10 wt.%, at least 15 wt.%, at least 20 wt.% or even
 10  between about 20 wt.% and about 30 wt.%. For example, a residue derived from
     saccharified biomass can be combined with non-saccharified biomass. The fine biomass
     material can have a medium particle size less than about 1mm (e.g., 500 pm or 100 pm).
     Preferably the drying agent has moisture content lower than that of the wet residue.
              Optionally dried material is conveyed to the boiler operations. In some
 15  implementations, solid residues are delivered to the boiler via conveyors that initially
     deliver the residues into a storage area near the boiler room. In the storage area the
     biomass is optionally blended with other unused raw biomass and then loaded into a
     storage bin. The storage bin is fitted with hydraulically driven pusher plates that
     constantly transport solid fuel to a through-chain conveyor, which supplies fuel to the in
 20  feed section of the boiler. The hydraulically driven in-feed conveyor is also fitted with a
     pusher plate that pushes the fuel into metering "dump bins." The metering bins dump
     the fuel into the combustion chamber in the boiler. These dump bins are helpful in
     delivering wet residues, which may be difficult to feed using a hopper or other typical
     feeding technique due to their possible agglomeration and poor flow properties.
 25           Once the fuel is in the combustion chambers, the biomass is subjected to a
     thermochemical combustion process under oxygen deficit conditions, leading to the
     production of hot (>1800 DEG F) gases and the degradation of the biomass. The biomass
     (e.g., saccharified biomass) can produce greater than 3500 BTU per pound, such as
     greater than 4000, 4500, 5000, greater than 6000 or even greater than 7000 BTU per
 30  pound. The biomass is converted to ash. The ash content of the biomass can be less than
     5 wt.%, (e.g., less than about 4 wt.%, less than about 3 wt.%, less than about 2.5 wt.%,
     less than about 2.0 wt.%, less than about 1.5 w.t.%). The sulfur content of the
     saccharified biomass can be less than about 0.5 % (e.g., less than about 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1,
     0.075 or even less than about 0.05). The resulting hot gases travel to an upper drum in
                                                   12

WO 2014/138551                                                             PCT/US2014/021634
     the boiler where the water is vaporized to steam. The steam then passes to the super
     heater where it is heated further by the hot flue gases. The resulting steam rate from both
     boilers may be, for example, 103,000 PPH (pounds per hour), at 500 PSIG and 650 DEG
     F.
  5           To maintain proper operation of the boilers, in some implementations each boiler
     is fitted with an economizer and a recuperater to capture all the waste heat from the flue
     gas. The economizer heats up the boiler feed water before it enters the upper drum where
     a water level is always maintained to continuously supply steam; the recuperater also
     heats up fresh air, which is supplied by a forced draft fan to maintain combustion in the
 10  boiler.
              The boiler feed water travels around the perimeter of the boiler through inner
     tubes, and loops around between the upper drum and a lower drum as it is further heated.
              Occasionally, a boiler blow down may be performed, during which water from
     the lower drum is dumped and replaced with fresh boiler feed water. This operation may
 15  be done either manually or automatically and is used to remove the dissolved solids and
     particles entering the boiler through the make-up water.
              If the dissolved solids are not removed they will build up and finally the
     concentration will reach a level where the boiler operation becomes impossible.
     In addition, if solids are not purged from the boiler they can lead to scale formation,
 20  carryover, corrosion, and/or embrittlement
              In some embodiments, the flue gas is directed from the super heater, the
     economizer, and the recuperator to an Electrostatic Precipitator by an induced draft. The
     Electrostatic Precipitator, discussed below, removes particulate material from the flue
     gas and may in some cases be more effective than a bag house.
 25           The Electrostatic Precipitator contains six major components: discharge
     electrodes, collection electrodes, rappers, hoppers, outer shell, and an electric system.
              The discharge electrodes release an electric charge, usually negative, to pollutant
     particles in the gas stream. The collection electrodes, which may be, for example, tubes
     or plates, collect the charged particles and have a charge opposite to that of the discharge
 30  electrodes which causes the particles to migrate toward them.
              The particles are removed from the electrodes by the rappers, which provide
     vibration or shock to both the collection and discharge electrodes causing the particles to
     fall into the hoppers where they are temporarily stored.
                                                   13

WO 2014/138551                                                                PCT/US2014/021634
              The outer shell encloses the electrodes and supports the precipitator components.
     The shell is covered with insulation to conserve heat and prevent corrosion. The outer
     shell and be made of steel.
              The electric system, also called the transformer-rectifier, controls the strength of
  5  the electric field between the discharge and collection electrodes. The electric system
     used standard current 480 volts and steps it up to as high as 70,000 volts. The rectifier
     part of the electric system converts the current from alternating to direct current.
              The flue gas exiting the electrostatic precipitator is free or substantially free of
     particles but can contain NOx compounds. NOx is a generic term for mono-nitrogen
 10  oxides (e.g., NO and NO 2 ). These oxides are produced during combustion, especially
     combustion at high temperatures. The removal technology of NOx is used universally by
     the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technique. The NOx reduction process includes
     the injection of ammonia (NH 3) into flue gas stream in the presence of catalyst where the
     NOx reacts selectivity with NH 3 and is converted into nitrogen (N 2) and water (H 20).
 15  The main reaction is expressed as follows.
              4NO + 4NH 3 + 02-> 4N2 + 6H 20
              The flue gas is then passed through continuous monitoring equipment (CEM)
     before it is discharged to the atmosphere. CEM is a technique for the continuous
     measurement of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere in exhaust gases from
 20  combustion or industrial processes. The EPA has established requirements for the
     continuous monitoring of SO2 , volumetric flow, NOx, diluent gas, and opacity, for
     facilities regulated under the Acid Rain Program. In addition, CEM is instrumental in
     ensuring that procedures for the mandated reductions of SO2 and NOx are followed.
     After it is monitored by CEM the exhaust gas is then allowed to exit to the atmosphere
 25  through an exhaust stack at temperature between 300F - 400 DEG F range.
              High pressure steam at 500 PSIG and 650 DEG F is fed to an extraction
     condensing steam turbine at a rate of 100,000 PPH. As it passes through the turbine
     discs or blades, the steam is then extracted at 80 PSIG saturated steam for the use in the
     feedstock conversion plant. In the condensing cycle, the steam leaves the turbine and
 30  flows toward a condenser where it is re-converted into water and directed to a hot well
     and then to the boiler as feed water.
              Meanwhile, the steam energy causes the turbine shaft to spin, which drives an
     electrical generator. The potential electric power generated may be, for example,
     between about 4 to 7 Megawatts.

              The electric generator works on the principle of electromagnetic induction, which
     creates a voltage difference between the two ends of a wire or electrical conductor,
     which in turn causes electric charges to flow, thus generating electric current.
              The electric current is fed to electric station switchgear backed up by an
  5  uninterruptible power supply, the electric current approx. 4000 volts is stepped-down
     through a transformer to 480 volts for use in the feedstock conversion plant. Excess
     electric current at 4000 volts is stepped-up via step-up transformer to 113,000 V for grid
     export.
              An example of flow of fuel (e.g. residues, co-products, waste, impurities from
 10  various processes) to a cogeneration facility 200 and flow of energy generated from these
     fuels into a feedstock conversion process is shown in FIG. 2. The figure shows a co
     generation plant 200 (e.g., part of a larger bioprocessing plan) surrounded by various
     processes. The double arrows indicate movement of energy from the co-generation plant
     to the various processes, and material from the processes to the co-generation plant.
 15  Single arrows indicate a possible flow for the processes in the biomass processing plant.
              In biomass processing, a comminution step may be advantageous, and can be an
     initial step in the biomass conversion plant. Comminuting biomass 210, e.g., with one or
     more of the mechanical treatments discussed herein, can result in fine particles that are
     difficult to process in subsequent processing steps. Rather than discarding these fines,
 20  these can be input into the cogeneration process, for example, as a drying agent.
     Comminution also requires a considerable input of energy, some or all of which can be
     obtained from the cogeneration process.
              Other pre-processing steps, e.g., steps used to reduce the recalcitrance of the
     biomass material 220, may also generate residues that are unusable for the primary
 25  processes (e.g., Process 1, 230 or Process 2, 240) but that can be input into the
     cogeneration process. For example, pre-processing can produce lignin, feedstock that has
     been deleteriously affected by the preprocessing (e.g., decomposed, made toxic,
     contaminated) and/or fines (e.g., produced during pneumatic/vibratory conveying and
     collected by a bag house or by other screening). The pre-processing also require energy,
 30  e.g., steam heat and/or electricity (e.g., for various power sources such as irradiation
     equipment and conveying equipment).
              Primary Process 1, 230 (e.g., saccharification) produce a significant amount of
     solid residues, containing for example lignin, minerals, proteins, fats, enzymes,
     denatured enzymes, and other components. In addition to being used, for example, as
                                                     15

WO 2014/138551                                                               PCT/US2014/021634
     feed or nutrients for animals, plants or organisms, these residues, or a subset or portion
     of these residues, can be input to the cogeneration process. The energy from the
     cogeneration process can be used in the saccharification process. For example, steam or
     heat generated from resistive heating can be used to maintain a desired temperature of a
  5  saccharifying mixture during saccharification. The energy can also be used for
     mechanical mixing, e.g., using jet mixers and/or other mixers as described herein.
               Primary Process 2, 240 (e.g., fermentation) generates solid residues containing,
     for example, in addition to the materials found in saccharified residues, yeast cells,
     bacterial cells, fungal cells or mixtures of these cells. In addition to uses as, for example
 10  nutrients for animals and organisms, the residues can be input to the cogeneration
     process and the energy utilized to maintain the desired fermentation temperature.
              The saccharified and optionally fermented biomass material as described above
     can include less than 35 percent by weight carbohydrates, such as less than 33, 30, 25,
     20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10 or even less than 8 percent on a dry basis. Carbohydrate depleted
 15  biomass can have a high heat content. For example, as described below dry lignin can
     have an energy content of between about 11,000 and 12,500 BTU per pound, compared
     to 7,000 an 8,000 BTU per pound of holocellulose.
              Further processing, including isolation/concentration and or purification 250 of
     products and or intermediates can also generate by by-products (e.g., waste) that can be
 20  used as fuel for the co-generation plant. For example, steps such as by distillation,
     filtration and centrifugation (e.g., a decanter centrifuge, a continuous centrifuge) can all
     generate solids with high energy contents. These processes also require energy, for
     example heating for distillation, and electricity for centrifugation, that can be tapped
     from the co-generation plant.
 25           Post processing 260 (e.g., packaging, distribution and/or storage) require energy
     for various processes. For example electricity may be needed for packing equipment,
     conveyors (e.g., for distribution), and climate control (e.g., for storage). These processes
     can also generate some waste, for example expired products, packaging waste that can
     used as a contribution to fuel the co-generation plant.
 30           The isolated solids/residues can include inorganic materials, for example
     including diatomaceous earth, such as celite, a glass, such as a silica glass, such as

 10
              Processes for conversion of a feedstock to sugars and other products, in which the
     methods discussed above may be used (e.g., wherein the feedstock for co-generation can
     be produced and/or wherein the energy produced by co-gen can be utilized), can include,
     for example, optionally physically pre-treating the feedstock, e.g., to reduce its size,
 15  before and/or after this treatment, optionally treating the feedstock to reduce its
     recalcitrance (e.g., by irradiation), and saccharifying the feedstock to form a sugar
     solution. Saccharification can be performed by mixing a dispersion of the feedstock in a
     liquid medium, e.g., water with an enzyme, as will be discussed in detail below. During
     or after saccharification, the mixture (if saccharification is to be partially or completely
 20  performed en route) or solution can be transported, e.g., by pipeline, railcar, truck or
     barge, to a manufacturing plant. At the plant, the solution can be bioprocessed, e.g.,
     fermented, to produce a desired product or intermediate, which can then be processed
     further, e.g., by distillation. The individual processing steps, materials used and
     examples of products and intermediates that may be formed will be described in detail

                                     RADIATION TREATMENT
              The feedstock can be treated with radiation to modify its structure to reduce its
 30  recalcitrance. Such treatment can, for example, reduce the average molecular weight of
     the feedstock, change the crystalline structure of the feedstock, and/or increase the
     surface area and/or porosity of the feedstock. Radiation can be by, for example electron
     beam, ion beam, 100 nm to 280 nm ultraviolet (UV) light, gamma or X-ray radiation.
     Radiation treatments and systems for treatments are discussed in U.S. Patent 8,142,620,

WO 2014/138551                                                               PCT/US2014/021634
     and U.S. Patent Application Series No. 12/417,73 1, the entire disclosures of which are
     incorporated herein by reference.
             Each form of radiation ionizes the biomass via particular interactions, as
     determined by the energy of the radiation. Heavy charged particles primarily ionize
  5  matter via Coulomb scattering; furthermore, these interactions produce energetic
     electrons that may further ionize matter. Alpha particles are identical to the nucleus of a
     helium atom and are produced by the alpha decay of various radioactive nuclei, such as
     isotopes of bismuth, polonium, astatine, radon, francium, radium, several actinides, such
     as actinium, thorium, uranium, neptunium, curium, californium, americium, and
 10  plutonium. Electrons interact via Coulomb scattering and bremsstrahlung radiation
     produced by changes in the velocity of electrons.
             When particles are utilized, they can be neutral (uncharged), positively charged
     or negatively charged. When charged, the charged particles can bear a single positive or
     negative charge, or multiple charges, e.g., one, two, three or even four or more charges.
 15  In instances in which chain scission is desired to change the molecular structure of the
     carbohydrate containing material, positively charged particles may be desirable, in part,
     due to their acidic nature. When particles are utilized, the particles can have the mass of
     a resting electron, or greater, e.g., 500, 1000, 1500, or 2000 or more times the mass of a
     resting electron. For example, the particles can have a mass of from about 1 atomic unit
 20  to about 150 atomic units, e.g., from about 1 atomic unit to about 50 atomic units, or
     from about I to about 25, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12 or 15 atomic units.
             Gamma radiation has the advantage of a significant penetration depth into a
     variety of material in the sample.
             In embodiments in which the irradiating is performed with electromagnetic
 25  radiation, the electromagnetic radiation can have, e.g., energy per photon (in electron
     volts) of greater than 102 eV, e.g., greater than 103, 104, 105, 106, or even greater than 107
     eV. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation has energy per photon of
     between 104 and 107, e.g., between 105 and 106 eV. The electromagnetic radiation can
     have a frequency of, e.g., greater than 1016 Hz, greater than 1017 Hz, 1018, 1019, 1020, or
 30  even greater than 1021 Hz. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation has a
     frequency of between 1018 and 1022 Hz, e.g., between 1019 to 1021 Hz.
             Electron bombardment may be performed using an electron beam device that has
     a nominal energy of less than 10 MeV, e.g., less than 7 MeV, less than 5 MeV, or less
                                                    18

WO 2014/138551                                                                PCT/US2014/021634
     than 2 MeV, e.g., from about 0.5 to 1.5 MeV, from about 0.8 to 1.8 MeV, or from about
     0.7 to 1 MeV. In some implementations the nominal energy is about 500 to 800 keV.
             The electron beam may have a relatively high total beam power (the combined
     beam power of all accelerating heads, or, if multiple accelerators are used, of all
  5  accelerators and all heads), e.g., at least 25 kW, e.g., at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 65, 70, 80,
     100, 125, or 150 kW. In some cases, the power is even as high as 500 kW, 750 kW, or
     even 1000 kW or more. In some cases the electron beam has a beam power of 1200 kW
     or more, e.g., 1400, 1600, 1800, or even 3000 kW.
             This high total beam power is usually achieved by utilizing multiple accelerating
 10  heads. For example, the electron beam device may include two, four, or more
     accelerating heads. The use of multiple heads, each of which has a relatively low beam
     power, prevents excessive temperature rise in the material, thereby preventing burning of
     the material, and also increases the uniformity of the dose through the thickness of the
     layer of material.
 15          It is generally preferred that the bed of biomass material has a relatively uniform
     thickness. In some embodiments the thickness is less than about 1 inch (e.g., less than
     about 0.75 inches, less than about 0.5 inches, less than about 0.25 inches, less than about
     0.1 inches, between about 0.1 and 1 inch, between about 0.2 and 0.3 inches).
             It is desirable to treat the material as quickly as possible. In general, it is
 20  preferred that treatment be performed at a dose rate of greater than about 0.25 Mrad per
     second, e.g., greater than about 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, or even greater than
     about 20 Mrad per second, e.g., about 0.25 to 2 Mrad per second. Higher dose rates
     allow a higher throughput for a target (e.g., the desired) dose. Higher dose rates generally
     require higher line speeds, to avoid thermal decomposition of the material. In one
 25  implementation, the accelerator is set for 3 MeV, 50 mA beam current, and the line
     speed is 24 feet/minute, for a sample thickness of about 20 mm (e.g., comminuted corn
     cob material with a bulk density of 0.5 g/cm 3).
             In some embodiments, electron bombardment is performed until the material
     receives a total dose of at least 0.1 Mrad, 0.25 Mrad, 1 Mrad, 5 Mrad, e.g., at least 10,
 30  20, 30 or at least 40 Mrad. In some embodiments, the treatment is performed until the
     material receives a dose of from about 10 Mrad to about 50 Mrad, e.g., from about 20
     Mrad to about 40 Mrad, or from about 25 Mrad to about 30 Mrad. In some
     implementations, a total dose of 25 to 35 Mrad is preferred, applied ideally over a couple
     of passes, e.g., at 5 Mrad/pass with each pass being applied for about one second.
                                                     19

WO 2014/138551                                                              PCT/US2014/021634
     Cooling methods, systems and equipment can be used before, during, after and in
     between radiations, for example utilizing a cooling screw conveyor and/or a cooled
     vibratory conveyor.
              Using multiple heads as discussed above, the material can be treated in multiple
  5  passes, for example, two passes at 10 to 20 Mrad/pass, e.g., 12 to 18 Mrad/pass,
     separated by a few seconds of cool-down, or three passes of 7 to 12 Mrad/pass, e.g., 5 to
     20 Mrad/pass, 10 to 40 Mrad/pass, 9 to 11 Mrad/pass. As discussed herein, treating the
     material with several relatively low doses, rather than one high dose, tends to prevent
     overheating of the material and also increases dose uniformity through the thickness of
 10  the material. In some implementations, the material is stirred or otherwise mixed during
     or after each pass and then smoothed into a uniform layer again before the next pass, to
     further enhance treatment uniformity.
              In some embodiments, electrons are accelerated to, for example, a speed of
     greater than 75 percent of the speed of light, e.g., greater than 85, 90, 95, or 99 percent of
 15  the speed of light.
              In some embodiments, any processing described herein occurs on lignocellulosic
     material that remains dry as acquired or that has been dried, e.g., using heat and/or
     reduced pressure. For example, in some embodiments, the cellulosic and/or
     lignocellulosic material has less than about 25 wt. % retained water, measured at 250 C
 20  and at fifty percent relative humidity (e.g., less than about 20 wt.%, less than about 15
     wt.%, less than about 14 wt.%, less than about 13 wt.%, less than about 12 wt.%, less
     than about 10 wt.%, less than about 9 wt.%, less than about 8 wt.%, less than about 7
     wt.%, less than about 6 wt.%, less than about 5 wt.%, less than about 4 wt.%, less than
     about 3 wt.%, less than about 2 wt.%, less than about 1 wt.%, or less than about 0.5
 25  wt.%.
              In some embodiments, two or more ionizing sources can be used, such as two or
     more electron sources. For example, samples can be treated, in any order, with a beam
     of electrons, followed by gamma radiation and UV light having wavelengths from about
     100 nm to about 280 nm. In some embodiments, samples are treated with three ionizing
 30  radiation sources, such as a beam of electrons, gamma radiation, and energetic UV light.
     The biomass is conveyed through the treatment zone where it can be bombarded with
     electrons.
              It may be advantageous to repeat the treatment to more thoroughly reduce the
     recalcitrance of the biomass and/or further modify the biomass. In particular the process
                                                    20

WO 2014/138551                                                                 PCT/US2014/021634
     parameters can be adjusted after a first (e.g., second, third, fourth or more) pass
     depending on the recalcitrance of the material. In some embodiments, a conveyor can be
     used which includes a circular system where the biomass is conveyed multiple times
     through the various processes described above. In some other embodiments, multiple
  5  treatment devices (e.g., electron beam generators) are used to treat the biomass multiple
     (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more) times. In yet other embodiments, a single electron beam generator
     may be the source of multiple beams (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more beams) that can be used for
     treatment of the biomass.
              The effectiveness in changing the molecular/supermolecular structure and/or
 10  reducing the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing biomass depends on the
     electron energy used and the dose applied, while exposure time depends on the power
     and dose. In some embodiments, the dose rate and total dose are adjusted so as not to
     destroy (e.g., char or bum) the biomass material. For example, the carbohydrates should
     not be damaged in the processing so that they can be released from the biomass intact,
 15  e.g. as monomeric sugars.
              In some embodiments, the treatment (with any electron source or a combination
     of sources) is performed until the material receives a dose of at least about 0.05 Mrad,
     e.g., at least about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60,
     70, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 175, or 200 Mrad. In some embodiments, the treatment is
 20  performed until the material receives a dose of between 0.1-100 Mrad, 1-200, 5-200, 10
     200, 5-150, 50-150 Mrad, 5-100, 5-50, 5-40, 10-50, 10-75, 15-50, 20-35 Mrad.
              In some embodiments, relatively low doses of radiation are utilized, e.g., to
     increase the molecular weight of a cellulosic or lignocellulosic material (with any
     radiation source or a combination of sources described herein). For example, a dose of at
 25  least about 0.05 Mrad, e.g., at least about 0.1 Mrad or at least about 0.25, 0.5, 0.75. 1.0,
     1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, or at least about 5.0 Mrad. In some embodiments, the
     irradiation is performed until the material receives a dose of between 0. 1Mrad and 2.0
     Mrad, e.g., between 0.5rad and 4.0 Mrad or between 1.0 Mrad and 3.0 Mrad.
              It also can be desirable to irradiate from multiple directions, simultaneously or
 30  sequentially, in order to achieve a desired degree of penetration of radiation into the
     material. For example, depending on the density and moisture content of the material,
     such as wood, and the type of radiation source used (e.g., gamma or electron beam), the
     maximum penetration of radiation into the material may be only about 0.75 inch. In such
     a cases, a thicker section (up to 1.5 inch) can be irradiated by first irradiating the material
                                                      21

WO 2014/138551                                                               PCT/US2014/021634
     from one side, and then turning the material over and irradiating from the other side.
     Irradiation from multiple directions can be particularly useful with electron beam
     radiation, which irradiates faster than gamma radiation but typically does not achieve as
     great a penetration depth.
  5
                                RADIATION OPAQUE MATERIALS
              The invention can include processing the material (e.g., for some of the
 10  processing steps) in a vault and/or bunker that is constructed using radiation opaque
     materials. In some implementations, the radiation opaque materials are selected to be
     capable of shielding the components from X-rays with high energy (short wavelength),
     which can penetrate many materials. One important factor in designing a radiation
     shielding enclosure is the attenuation length of the materials used, which will determine
 15  the required thickness for a particular material, blend of materials, or layered structure.
     The attenuation length is the penetration distance at which the radiation is reduced to
     approximately 1/e (e = Euler's number) times that of the incident radiation. Although
     virtually all materials are radiation opaque if thick enough, materials containing a high
     compositional percentage (e.g., density) of elements that have a high Z value (atomic
 20  number) have a shorter radiation attenuation length and thus if such materials are used a
     thinner, lighter shielding can be provided. Examples of high Z value materials that are
     used in radiation shielding are tantalum and lead. Another important parameter in
     radiation shielding is the halving distance, which is the thickness of a particular material
     that will reduce gamma ray intensity by 50%. As an example for X-ray radiation with
 25  an energy of 0.1 MeV the halving thickness is about 15.1 mm for concrete and about 2.7
     mm for lead, while with an X-ray energy of 1 MeV the halving thickness for concrete is
     about 44.45 mm and for lead is about 7.9 mm. Radiation opaque materials can be
     materials that are thick or thin so long as they can reduce the radiation that passes
     through to the other side. Thus, if it is desired that a particular enclosure have a low wall
 30  thickness, e.g., for light weight or due to size constraints, the material chosen should
     have a sufficient Z value and/or attenuation length so that its halving length is less than
     or equal to the desired wall thickness of the enclosure.
              In some cases, the radiation opaque material may be a layered material, for
     example having a layer of a higher Z value material, to provide good shielding, and a
                                                    22

WO 2014/138551                                                              PCT/US2014/021634
     layer of a lower Z value material to provide other properties (e.g., structural integrity,
     impact resistance, etc.). In some cases, the layered material may be a "graded-Z"
     laminate, e.g., including a laminate in which the layers provide a gradient from high-Z
     through successively lower-Z elements. In some cases the radiation opaque materials can
  5  be interlocking blocks, for example, lead and/or concrete blocks can be supplied by
     NELCO Worldwide (Burlington, MA), and reconfigurable vaults can be utilized.
              A radiation opaque material can reduce the radiation passing through a structure
     (e.g., a wall, door, ceiling, enclosure, a series of these or combinations of these) formed
     of the material by about at least about 10 %, (e.g., at least about 20%, at least about 30%,
 10  at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least
     about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about
     97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, at least about 99.9%, at least about 99.99%,
     at least about 99.999%) as compared to the incident radiation. Therefore, an enclosure
     made of a radiation opaque material can reduce the exposure of
 15  equipment/system/components by the same amount. Radiation opaque materials can
     include stainless steel, metals with Z values above 25 (e.g., lead, iron), concrete, dirt,
     sand and combinations thereof. Radiation opaque materials can include a barrier in the
     direction of the incident radiation of at least about 1mm (e.g., 5 mm, 10mm, 5 cm, 10
     cm, 100cm, im, 10m).

             Electrons may be produced by radioactive nuclei that undergo beta decay, such as
     isotopes of iodine, cesium, technetium, and iridium. Alternatively, an electron gun can
     be used as an electron source via thermionic emission and accelerated through an
     accelerating potential. An electron gun generates electrons, which are then accelerated
  5  through a large potential (e.g., greater than about 500 thousand, greater than about
     Million, greater than about 2 million, greater than about 5 million, greater than about 6
     million, greater than about 7 million, greater than about 8 million, greater than about 9
     million, or even greater than 10 million volts) and then scanned magnetically in the x-y
     plane, where the electrons are initially accelerated in the z direction down the accelerator
 10  tube and extracted through a foil window. Scanning the electron beams is useful for
     increasing the irradiation surface when irradiating materials, e.g., a biomass, that is
     conveyed through the scanned beam. Scanning the electron beam also distributes the
     thermal load homogenously on the window and helps reduce the foil window rupture due
     to local heating by the electron beam. Window foil rupture is a cause of significant
 15  down-time due to subsequent necessary repairs and re-starting the electron gun.
             Various other irradiating devices may be used in the methods disclosed herein,
     including field ionization sources, electrostatic ion separators, field ionization generators,
     thermionic emission sources, microwave discharge ion sources, recirculating or static
     accelerators, dynamic linear accelerators, van de Graaff accelerators, and folded tandem
 20  accelerators. Such devices are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,931,784 to
     Medoff, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
             A beam of electrons can be used as the radiation source. A beam of electrons has
     the advantages of high dose rates (e.g., 1, 5, or even 10 Mrad per second), high
     throughput, less containment, and less confinement equipment. Electron beams can also
 25  have high electrical efficiency (e.g., 80%), allowing for lower energy usage relative to
     other radiation methods, which can translate into a lower cost of operation and lower
     greenhouse gas emissions corresponding to the smaller amount of energy used. Electron
     beams can be generated, e.g., by electrostatic generators, cascade generators, transformer
     generators, low energy accelerators with a scanning system, low energy accelerators with
 30  a linear cathode, linear accelerators, and pulsed accelerators.
             Electrons can also be more efficient at causing changes in the molecular structure
     of carbohydrate-containing materials, for example, by the mechanism of chain scission.
     In addition, electrons having energies of 0.5-10 MeV can penetrate low density
     materials, such as the biomass materials described herein, e.g., materials having a bulk

     density of less than 0.5 g/cm3 , and a depth of 0.3-10 cm. Electrons as an ionizing
     radiation source can be useful, e.g., for relatively thin piles, layers or beds of materials,
     e.g., less than about 0.5 inch, e.g., less than about 0.4 inch, 0.3 inch, 0.25 inch, or less
     than about 0.1 inch. In some embodiments, the energy of each electron of the electron
  5  beam is from about 0.3 MeV to about 2.0 MeV (million electron volts), e.g., from about
     0.5 MeV to about 1.5 MeV, or from about 0.7 MeV to about 1.25 MeV. Methods of
     irradiating materials are discussed in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2012/0100577 AL, filed

     Typical electron energies can be 0.5 MeV, 1 MeV, 2 MeV, 4.5 MeV, 7.5 MeV, or 10

     beam current), EPS-800 (e.g., 800 kV accelerator voltage and 65 or 100 mA beam
 25  current), or EPS-1000 (e.g., 1000 kV accelerator voltage and 65 or 100 mA beam
     current). Also, accelerators from NHV's high energy series can be used such as EPS
     1500 (e.g., 1500 kV accelerator voltage and 65 mA beam current), EPS-2000 (e.g., 2000
     kV accelerator voltage and 50 mA beam current), EPS-3000 (e.g., 3000 kV accelerator
     voltage and 50 mA beam current) and EPS-5000 (e.g., 5000 and 30 mA beam current).
 30           Tradeoffs in considering electron beam irradiation device power specifications
     include cost to operate, capital costs, depreciation, and device footprint. Tradeoffs in
     considering exposure dose levels of electron beam irradiation would be energy costs and
     environment, safety, and health (ESH) concerns. Typically, generators are housed in a

     in the process. Tradeoffs in considering electron energies include energy costs.
             The electron beam irradiation device can produce either a fixed beam or a
     scanning beam. A scanning beam may be advantageous with large scan sweep length
  5  and high scan speeds, as this would effectively replace a large, fixed beam width.
     Further, available sweep widths of 0.5 m, 1 m, 2 m or more are available. The scanning
     beam is preferred in most embodiments described herein because of the larger scan width
     and reduced possibility of local heating and failure of the windows.

             The extraction system for an electron accelerator can include two window foils.
     The cooling gas in the two foil window extraction system can be a purge gas or a
     mixture, for example air, or a pure gas. In one embodiment the gas is an inert gas such
 15  as nitrogen, argon, helium and or carbon dioxide. It is preferred to use a gas rather than a
     liquid since energy losses to the electron beam are minimized. Mixtures of pure gas can
     also be used, either pre-mixed or mixed in line prior to impinging on the windows or in
     the space between the windows. The cooling gas can be cooled, for example, by using a
     heat exchange system (e.g., a chiller) and/or by using boil off from a condensed gas (e.g.,
 20  liquid nitrogen, liquid helium). Window foils are described in PCT/US2013/64332 filed

           HEATING AND THROUGHPUT DURING RADIATION TREATMENT
 25          Several processes can occur in biomass when electrons from an electron beam
     interact with matter in inelastic collisions. For example, ionization of the material, chain
     scission of polymers in the material, cross linking of polymers in the material, oxidation
     of the material, generation of X-rays ("Bremsstrahlung") and vibrational excitation of
     molecules (e.g., phonon generation). Without being bound to a particular mechanism, the
 30  reduction in recalcitrance can be due to several of these inelastic collision effects, for
     example ionization, chain scission of polymers, oxidation and phonon generation. Some
     of the effects (e.g., especially X-ray generation), necessitate shielding and engineering
     barriers, for example, enclosing the irradiation processes in a concrete (or other radiation
     opaque material) vault. Another effect of irradiation, vibrational excitation, is equivalent
                                                    27

WO 2014/138551                                                             PCT/US2014/021634
     to heating up the sample. Heating the sample by irradiation can help in recalcitrance
     reduction, but excessive heating can destroy the material, as will be explained below.
              The adiabatic temperature rise (AT) from adsorption of ionizing radiation is given
     by the equation: AT = D/Cp: where D is the average dose in kGy, Cp is the heat capacity
  5  in J/g 0 C, and AT is the change in temperature in 0C. A typical dry biomass material will
     have a heat capacity close to 2. Wet biomass will have a higher heat capacity dependent
     on the amount of water since the heat capacity of water is very high (4.19 J/g 0 C). Metals
     have much lower heat capacities, for example 304 stainless steel has a heat capacity of
     0.5 J/g 0C. The temperature change due to the instant adsorption of radiation in a
 10  biomass and stainless steel for various doses of radiation is shown in Table 1. In practice,
     the higher temperatures cause decomposition of the biomass leading to extreme deviation
     from theory.

              High temperatures can destroy and or modify the biopolymers in biomass so that
     the polymers (e.g., cellulose) are unsuitable for further processing. A biomass subjected
     to high temperatures can become dark, sticky and give off odors indicating
     decomposition. The stickiness can even make the material hard to convey. The odors can
 20  be unpleasant and be a safety issue. In fact, keeping the biomass below about 200 0 C has
     been found to be beneficial in the processes described herein (e.g., below about 190 0 C,
     below about 180 0 C, below about 170 0 C, below about 160 0 C, below about 150 0 C, below
     about 140 0 C, below about 130 0 C, below about 120 0 C, below about 1 100 C, between
     about 60 0 C and 180 0 C, between about 60 0 C and 160 0 C, between about 60 0 C and 150 0 C,

WO 2014/138551                                                             PCT/US2014/021634
              It has been found that irradiation above about 10 Mrad is desirable for the
     processes described herein (e.g., reduction of recalcitrance). A high throughput is also
     desirable so that the irradiation does not become a bottle neck in processing the biomass.
     The treatment is governed by a Dose rate equation: M = FP/D-time, where M is the mass
  5  of irradiated material (Kg), F is the fraction of power that is adsorbed (unit less), P is the
     emitted power (kW=Voltage in MeV x Current in mA), time is the treatment time (sec)
     and D is the adsorbed dose (kGy). In an exemplary process where the fraction of
     adsorbed power is fixed, the Power emitted is constant and a set dosage is desired, the
     throughput (e.g., M, the biomass processed) can be increased by increasing the
 10  irradiation time. However, increasing the irradiation time without allowing the material
     to cool, can excessively heat the material as exemplified by the calculations shown
     above. Since biomass has a low thermal conductivity (less than about 0.1 Wm-1K-1),
     heat dissipation is slow, unlike, for example metals (greater than about 10 Wm-1K-1)
     which can dissipate energy quickly as long as there is a heat sink to transfer the energy
 15  to.
                                ELECTRON GUNS - BEAM STOPS
              In some embodiments the systems and methods include a beam stop (e.g., a
 20  shutter). For example, the beam stop can be used to quickly stop or reduce the
     irradiation of material without powering down the electron beam device. Alternatively
     the beam stop can be used while powering up the electron beam, e.g., the beam stop can
     stop the electron beam until a beam current of a desired level is achieved. The beam stop
     can be placed between the primary foil window and a secondary foil window. For
 25  example the beam stop can be mounted so that it is movable, that is, so that it can be
     moved into and out of the beam path. Even partial coverage of the beam can be used, for
     example, to control the dose of irradiation. The beam stop can be mounted to the floor,
     to a conveyor for the biomass, to a wall, to the radiation device (e.g., at the scan horn), or
     to any structural support. Preferably the beam stop is fixed in relation to the scan horn so
 30  that the beam can be effectively controlled by the beam stop. The beam stop can
     incorporate a hinge, a rail, wheels, slots, or other means allowing for its operation in
     moving into and out of the beam. The beam stop can be made of any material that will
     stop at least 5% of the electrons, e.g., at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, at

     least 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or even about
     100% of the electrons.
              The beam stop can be made of a metal including, but not limited to, stainless
     steel, lead, iron, molybdenum, silver, gold, titanium, aluminum, tin, or alloys of these, or
  5  laminates (layered materials) made with such metals (e.g., metal-coated ceramic, metal
     coated polymer, metal-coated composite, multilayered metal materials).
              The beam stop can be cooled, for example, with a cooling fluid such as an
     aqueous solution or a gas. The beam stop can be partially or completely hollow, for
     example, with cavities. Interior spaces of the beam stop can be used for cooling fluids
 10  and gases. The beam stop can be of any shape, including flat, curved, round, oval,
     square, rectangular, beveled and wedged shapes.
              The beam stop can have perforations so as to allow some electrons through, thus
     controlling (e.g., reducing) the levels of radiation across the whole area of the window,
     or in specific regions of the window. The beam stop can be a mesh formed, for example,
 15  from fibers or wires. Multiple beam stops can be used, together or independently, to
     control the irradiation. The beam stop can be remotely controlled, e.g., by radio signal or
     hard wired to a motor for moving the beam into or out of position.
                                                BEAM DUMPS
 20
              The embodiments disclosed herein can also include a beam dump when utilizing
     a radiation treatment. A beam dump's purpose is to safely absorb a beam of charged
     particles. Like a beam stop, a beam dump can be used to block the beam of charged
     particles. However, a beam dump is much more robust than a beam stop, and is intended
 25  to block the full power of the electron beam for an extended period of time. They are
     often used to block the beam as the accelerator is powering up.
              Beam dumps are also designed to accommodate the heat generated by such
     beams, and are usually made from materials such as copper, aluminum, carbon,
     beryllium, tungsten, or mercury. Beam dumps can be cooled, for example, using a
 30  cooling fluid that can be in thermal contact with the beam dump.

              Lignocellulosic materials, such as can be used in the methods and equipment
     described herein include, but are not limited to, wood, particle board, forestry wastes
  5  (e.g., sawdust, aspen wood, wood chips), grasses, (e.g., switchgrass, miscanthus, cord
     grass, reed canary grass), grain residues, (e.g., rice hulls, oat hulls, wheat chaff, barley
     hulls), agricultural waste (e.g., silage, canola straw, wheat straw, barley straw, oat straw,
     rice straw, jute, hemp, flax, bamboo, sisal, abaca, corn cobs, corn stover, soybean stover,
     corn fiber, alfalfa, hay, coconut hair), sugar processing residues (e.g., bagasse, beet pulp,
 10  agave bagasse), algae, seaweed, manure, sewage, and mixtures of any of these.
              In some cases, the lignocellulosic material includes corncobs. Ground or
     hammermilled corncobs can be spread in a layer of relatively uniform thickness for
     irradiation, and after irradiation are easy to disperse in the medium for further
     processing. To facilitate harvest and collection, in some cases the entire corn plant is
 15  used, including the corn stalk, corn kernels, and in some cases even the root system of
     the plant.
              Advantageously, no additional nutrients (other than a nitrogen source, e.g., urea
     or ammonia) are required during fermentation of corncobs or cellulosic or lignocellulosic
     materials containing significant amounts of corncobs.
 20           Corncobs, before and after comminution, are also easier to convey and disperse,
     and have a lesser tendency to form explosive mixtures in air than other cellulosic or
     lignocellulosic materials such as hay and grasses.
              Cellulosic materials include, for example, paper, paper products, paper waste,
     paper pulp, pigmented papers, loaded papers, coated papers, filled papers, magazines,
 25  printed matter (e.g., books, catalogs, manuals, labels, calendars, greeting cards,
     brochures, prospectuses, newsprint), printer paper, polycoated paper, card stock,
     cardboard, paperboard, materials having a high a-cellulose content such as cotton, and

     materials. Starchy materials include starch itself, e.g., corn starch, wheat starch, potato
     starch or rice starch, a derivative of starch, or a material that includes starch, such as an
     edible food product or a crop. For example, the starchy material can be arracacha,
  5  buckwheat, banana, barley, cassava, kudzu, ocra, sago, sorghum, regular household
     potatoes, sweet potato, taro, yams, or one or more beans, such as favas, lentils or peas.
     Blends of any two or more starchy materials are also starchy materials. Mixtures of
     starchy, cellulosic and or lignocellulosic materials can also be used. For example, a
     biomass can be an entire plant, a part of a plant or different parts of a plant, e.g., a wheat
 10  plant, cotton plant, a corn plant, rice plant or a tree. The starchy materials can be treated
     by any of the methods described herein.
              Microbial materials that can be used as feedstock can include, but are not limited
     to, any naturally occurring or genetically modified microorganism or organism that
     contains or is capable of providing a source of carbohydrates (e.g., cellulose), for
 15  example, protists, e.g., animal protists (e.g., protozoa such as flagellates, amoeboids,
     ciliates, and sporozoa) and plant protists (e.g., algae such alveolates,
     chlorarachniophytes, cryptomonads, euglenids, glaucophytes, haptophytes, red algae,
     stramenopiles, and viridaeplantae). Other examples include seaweed, plankton (e.g.,
     macroplankton, mesoplankton, microplankton, nanoplankton, picoplankton, and
 20  femptoplankton), phytoplankton, bacteria (e.g., gram positive bacteria, gram negative
     bacteria, and extremophiles), yeast and/or mixtures of these. In some instances,
     microbial biomass can be obtained from natural sources, e.g., the ocean, lakes, bodies of
     water, e.g., salt water or fresh water, or on land. Alternatively or in addition, microbial
     biomass can be obtained from culture systems, e.g., large scale dry and wet culture and
 25  fermentation systems.
              In other embodiments, the biomass materials, such as cellulosic, starchy and
     lignocellulosic feedstock materials, can be obtained from transgenic microorganisms and
     plants that have been modified with respect to a wild type variety. Such modifications
     may be, for example, through the iterative steps of selection and breeding to obtain
 30  desired traits in a plant. Furthermore, the plants can have had genetic material removed,
     modified, silenced and/or added with respect to the wild type variety. For example,
     genetically modified plants can be produced by recombinant DNA methods, where
     genetic modifications include introducing or modifying specific genes from parental
     varieties, or, for example, by using transgenic breeding wherein a specific gene or genes
                                                    32

     are introduced to a plant from a different species of plant and/or bacteria. Another way
     to create genetic variation is through mutation breeding wherein new alleles are
     artificially created from endogenous genes. The artificial genes can be created by a
     variety of ways including treating the plant or seeds with, for example, chemical
  5  mutagens (e.g., using alkylating agents, epoxides, alkaloids, peroxides, formaldehyde),
     irradiation (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, beta particles, alpha particles, protons,
     deuterons, UV radiation) and temperature shocking or other external stressing and
     subsequent selection techniques. Other methods of providing modified genes is through
     error prone PCR and DNA shuffling followed by insertion of the desired modified DNA
 10  into the desired plant or seed. Methods of introducing the desired genetic variation in the
     seed or plant include, for example, the use of a bacterial carrier, biolistics, calcium
     phosphate precipitation, electroporation, gene splicing, gene silencing, lipofection,
     microinjection and viral carriers. Additional genetically modified materials have been
     described in U.S. Application Serial No 13/396,369 filed February 14, 2012 the full

              Any of the methods described herein can be practiced with mixtures of any
     biomass materials described herein.

     polymerization, metathesis polymerization, ring opening polymerization, graft
     polymerization, addition polymerization. In some cases the treatments disclosed herein
     can be used, for example, for radically initiated graft polymerization and cross linking.
     Composites of polymers, for example with glass, metals, biomass (e.g., fibers, particles),
 10  ceramics can also be treated and/or made.
              Other materials that can be treated by using the methods, systems and equipment
     disclosed herein are ceramic materials, minerals, metals, inorganic compounds. For
     example, silicon and germanium crystals, silicon nitrides, metal oxides, semiconductors,

     pipes, boards, enclosures, integrated semiconductor chips, circuit boards, wires, tires,
     windows, laminated materials, gears, belts, machines, combinations of these. For
     example, treating a material by the methods described herein can modify the surfaces, for
 20  example, making them susceptible to further functionalization, combinations (e.g.,
     welding) and/or treatment can cross link the materials.
         BIOMASS MATERIAL PREPARATION - MECHANICAL TREATMENTS
 25           The biomass can be in a dry form (e.g., as described previously), for example
     with less than about 35% moisture content (e.g., less than about 20 %, less than about 15
     %, less than about 10 % less than about 5 %, less than about 4%, less than about 3 %,
     less than about 2 % or even less than about 1 %). The biomass can also be delivered in
     a wet state, for example as a wet solid, a slurry or a suspension with at least about 10
 30  wt% solids (e.g., at least about 20 wt.%, at least about 30 wt. %, at least about 40 wt.%,
     at least about 50 wt.%, at least about 60 wt.%, at least about 70 wt.%).
              The processes disclosed herein can utilize low bulk density materials, for
     example cellulosic or lignocellulosic feedstocks that have been physically pretreated to
     have a bulk density of less than about 0.75 g/cm3, e.g., less than about 0.7, 0.65, 0.60,
                                                   34

WO 2014/138551                                                               PCT/US2014/021634
     0.50, 0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05 or less, e.g., less than about 0.025 g/cm 3. Bulk
     density is determined using ASTM D1895B. Briefly, the method involves filling a
     measuring cylinder of known volume with a sample and obtaining a weight of the
     sample. The bulk density is calculated by dividing the weight of the sample in grams by
  5  the known volume of the cylinder in cubic centimeters. If desired, low bulk density
     materials can be densified, for example, by methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,971,809
     published July 5, 2011, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by
     reference.
             In some cases, the pre-treatment processing includes screening of the biomass
 10  material. Screening can be through a mesh or perforated plate with a desired opening
     size, for example, less than about 6.35 mm (1/4 inch, 0.25 inch), (e.g., less than about
     3.18 mm (1/8 inch, 0.125 inch), less than about 1.59 mm (1/16 inch, 0.0625 inch), is less
     than about 0.79 mm (1/32 inch, 0.03125 inch), e.g., less than about 0.51 mm (1/50 inch,
     0.02000 inch), less than about 0.40 mm (1/64 inch, 0.015625 inch), less than about 0.23
 15  mm (0.009 inch), less than about 0.20 mm (1/128 inch, 0.0078125 inch), less than about
     0.18 mm (0.007 inch), less than about 0.13 mm (0.005 inch), or even less than about 0.10
     mm (1/256 inch, 0.00390625 inch)). In one configuration the desired biomass falls
     through the perforations or screen and thus biomass larger than the perforations or screen
     are not irradiated. These larger materials can be re-processed, for example, by
 20  comminuting, or they can simply be removed from processing. In another configuration
     material that is larger than the perforations is irradiated and the smaller material is
     removed by the screening process or recycled. In this kind of a configuration, the
     conveyor, such as a vibratory conveyor, itself (for example, a part of the conveyor) can
     be perforated or made with a mesh. For example, in one particular embodiment the
 25  biomass material may be wet and the perforations or mesh allow water to drain away
     from the biomass before irradiation.
             Screening of material can also be by a manual method, for example by an
     operator or mechanoid (e.g., a robot equipped with a color, reflectivity or other sensor)
     that removes unwanted material. Screening can also be by magnetic screening wherein a
 30  magnet is disposed near the conveyed material and the magnetic material is removed
     magnetically.
             Optional pre-treatment processing can include heating the material (e.g., in
     addition to for drying or for the purpose of drying the material). For example, a portion
     of a conveyor conveying the biomass or other material can be sent through a heated
                                                    35

WO 2014/138551                                                              PCT/US2014/021634
     zone. The heated zone can be created, for example, by IR radiation, microwaves,
     combustion (e.g., gas, coal, oil, biomass), resistive heating and/or inductive coils. The
     heat can be applied from at least one side or more than one side, can be continuous or
     periodic and can be for only a portion of the material or all the material. For example, a
  5  portion of the conveying trough can be heated by use of a heating jacket. Heating can
     be, for example, for the purpose of drying the material. In the case of drying the
     material, this can also be facilitated, with or without heating, by the movement of a gas
     (e.g., air, oxygen, nitrogen, He, C02, Argon) over and/or through the biomass as it is
     being conveyed.
 10           Optionally, pre-treatment processing can include cooling the material. Cooling
     material is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,900,857 published March 8, 2011, the disclosure
     of which in incorporated herein by reference. For example, cooling can be by supplying
     a cooling fluid, for example, water (e.g., with glycerol), or nitrogen (e.g., liquid nitrogen)
     to the bottom of the conveying trough. Alternatively, a cooling gas, for example, chilled
 15  nitrogen can be blown over the biomass materials or under the conveying system.
              Another optional pre-treatment processing method can include adding a material
     to the biomass or other feedstocks. The additional material can be added by, for
     example, by showering, sprinkling and or pouring the material onto the biomass as it is
     conveyed. Materials that can be added include, for example, metals, ceramics and/or
 20  ions as described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2010/0105119 Al (filed October 26, 2009) and
     U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2010/0159569 Al (filed December 16, 2009), the entire disclosures
     of which are incorporated herein by reference. Optional materials that can be added
     include acids and bases. Other materials that can be added are oxidants (e.g., peroxides,
     chlorates), polymers, polymerizable monomers (e.g., containing unsaturated bonds),
 25  water, catalysts, enzymes and/or organisms. Materials can be added, for example, in
     pure form, as a solution in a solvent (e.g., water or an organic solvent) and/or as a
     solution. In some cases the solvent is volatile and can be made to evaporate e.g., by
     heating and/or blowing gas as previously described. The added material may form a
     uniform coating on the biomass or be a homogeneous mixture of different components
 30  (e.g., biomass and additional material). The added material can modulate the subsequent
     irradiation step by increasing the efficiency of the irradiation, damping the irradiation or
     changing the effect of the irradiation (e.g., from electron beams to X-rays or heat). The
     method may have no impact on the irradiation but may be useful for further downstream
                                                    36

WO 2014/138551                                                                   PCT/US2014/021634
     processing. The added material may help in conveying the material, for example, by
     lowering dust levels.
             Biomass can be delivered to conveyor (e.g., vibratory conveyors that can be used
     in the vaults herein described) by a belt conveyor, a pneumatic conveyor, a screw
  5  conveyor, a hopper, a pipe, manually or by a combination of these. The biomass can, for
     example, be dropped, poured and/or placed onto the conveyor by any of these methods.
     In some embodiments the material is delivered to the conveyor using an enclosed
     material distribution system to help maintain a low oxygen atmosphere and/or control
     dust and fines. Lofted or air suspended biomass fines and dust are undesirable because
 10  these can form an explosion hazard or damage the window foils of an electron gun (if
     such a device is used for treating the material).
             The material can be leveled to form a uniform thickness between about 0.0312
     and 5 inches (e.g., between about 0.0625 and 2.000 inches, between about 0.125 and 1
     inches, between about 0.125 and 0.5 inches, between about 0.3 and 0.9 inches, between
 15  about 0.2 and 0.5 inches between about 0.25 and 1.0 inches, between about 0.25 and 0.5
     inches, 0.100 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.150 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.200 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.250+/
     0.025 inches, 0.300 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.350 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.400 +/- 0.025 inches,
     0.450 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.500 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.550 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.600 +/- 0.025
     inches, 0.700 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.750 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.800 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.850 +/
 20  0.025 inches, 0.900 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.900 +/- 0.025 inches.
             Generally, it is preferred to convey the material as quickly as possible through the
     electron beam to maximize throughput. For example the material can be conveyed at
     rates of at least 1 ft/min, e.g., at least 2 ft/min, at least 3 ft/min, at least 4 ft/min, at least 5
     ft/min, at least 10 ft/min, at least 15 ft/min, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 ft/min. The rate of
 25  conveying is related to the beam current, for example, for a          inch thick biomass and
     100 mA, the conveyor can move at about 20 ft/min to provide a useful irradiation
     dosage, at 50 mA the conveyor can move at about 10 ft/min to provide approximately the
     same irradiation dosage.
             After the biomass material has been conveyed through the radiation zone,
 30  optional post-treatment processing can be done. The optional post-treatment processing
     can, for example, be a process described with respect to the pre-irradiation processing.
     For example, the biomass can be screened, heated, cooled, and/or combined with
     additives. Uniquely to post-irradiation, quenching of the radicals can occur, for example,
     quenching of radicals by the addition of fluids or gases (e.g., oxygen, nitrous oxide,
                                                      37

WO 2014/138551                                                               PCT/US2014/021634
     ammonia, liquids), using pressure, heat, and/or the addition of radical scavengers. For
     example, the biomass can be conveyed out of the enclosed conveyor and exposed to a
     gas (e.g., oxygen) where it is quenched, forming carboxylated groups. In one
     embodiment the biomass is exposed during irradiation to the reactive gas or fluid.
  5  Quenching of biomass that has been irradiated is described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,083,906
     published Dec 27, 2011, the entire disclosure of which is incorporate herein by reference.
              If desired, one or more mechanical treatments can be used in addition to
     irradiation to further reduce the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing material.
     These processes can be applied before, during and or after irradiation.
 10           In some cases, the mechanical treatment may include an initial preparation of the
     feedstock as received, e.g., size reduction of materials, such as by comminution, e.g.,
     cutting, grinding, shearing, pulverizing or chopping. For example, in some cases, loose
     feedstock (e.g., recycled paper, starchy materials, or switchgrass) is prepared by shearing
     or shredding. Mechanical treatment may reduce the bulk density of the carbohydrate
 15  containing material, increase the surface area of the carbohydrate-containing material
     and/or decrease one or more dimensions of the carbohydrate-containing material.
              Alternatively, or in addition, the feedstock material can be treated with another
     treatment, for example chemical treatments, such as with an acid (HCl, H2 SO 4 , H3 PO4), a
     base (e.g., KOH and NaOH), a chemical oxidant (e.g., peroxides, chlorates, ozone),
 20  irradiation, steam explosion, pyrolysis, sonication, oxidation, chemical treatment. The
     treatments can be in any order and in any sequence and combinations. For example, the
     feedstock material can first be physically treated by one or more treatment methods, e.g.,
     chemical treatment including and in combination with acid hydrolysis (e.g., utilizing
     HCl, H 2 SO 4 , H3 PO4), radiation, sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis or steam explosion, and
 25  then mechanically treated. This sequence can be advantageous since materials treated by
     one or more of the other treatments, e.g., irradiation or pyrolysis, tend to be more brittle
     and, therefore, it may be easier to further change the structure of the material by
     mechanical treatment. As another example, a feedstock material can be conveyed
     through ionizing radiation using a conveyor as described herein and then mechanically
 30  treated. Chemical treatment can remove some or all of the lignin (for example chemical
     pulping) and can partially or completely hydrolyze the material. The methods also can
     be used with pre-hydrolyzed material. The methods also can be used with material that
     has not been pre hydrolyzed The methods can be used with mixtures of hydrolyzed and
     non-hydrolyzed materials, for example with about 50% or more non-hydrolyzed
                                                     38

WO 2014/138551                                                              PCT/US2014/021634
     material, with about 60% or more non- hydrolyzed material, with about 70% or more
     non-hydrolyzed material, with about 80% or more non-hydrolyzed material or even with
     90% or more non-hydrolyzed material.
              In addition to size reduction, which can be performed initially and/or later in
  5  processing, mechanical treatment can also be advantageous for "opening up,"
     "stressing," breaking or shattering the carbohydrate-containing materials, making the
     cellulose of the materials more susceptible to chain scission and/or disruption of
     crystalline structure during the physical treatment.
              Methods of mechanically treating the carbohydrate-containing material include,
 10  for example, milling or grinding. Milling may be performed using, for example, a
     hammer mill, ball mill, colloid mill, conical or cone mill, disk mill, edge mill, Wiley
     mill, grist mill or other mill. Grinding may be performed using, for example, a
     cutting/impact type grinder. Some exemplary grinders include stone grinders, pin
     grinders, coffee grinders, and burr grinders. Grinding or milling may be provided, for
 15  example, by a reciprocating pin or other element, as is the case in a pin mill. Other
     mechanical treatment methods include mechanical ripping or tearing, other methods that
     apply pressure to the fibers, and air attrition milling. Suitable mechanical treatments
     further include any other technique that continues the disruption of the internal structure
     of the material that was initiated by the previous processing steps.
 20           Mechanical feed preparation systems can be configured to produce streams with
     specific characteristics such as, for example, specific maximum sizes, specific length-to
     width, or specific surface areas ratios. Physical preparation can increase the rate of
     reactions, improve the movement of material on a conveyor, improve the irradiation
     profile of the material, improve the radiation uniformity of the material, or reduce the
 25  processing time required by opening up the materials and making them more accessible
     to processes and/or reagents, such as reagents in a solution.
              The bulk density of feedstocks can be controlled (e.g., increased). In some
     situations, it can be desirable to prepare a low bulk density material, e.g., by densifying
     the material (e.g., densification can make it easier and less costly to transport to another
 30  site) and then reverting the material to a lower bulk density state (e.g., after transport).
     The material can be densified, for example from less than about 0.2 g/cc to more than
     about 0.9 g/cc (e.g., less than about 0.3 to more than about 0.5 g/cc, less than about 0.3 to
     more than about 0.9 g/cc, less than about 0.5 to more than about 0.9 g/cc, less than about
     0.3 to more than about 0.8 g/cc, less than about 0.2 to more than about 0.5 g/cc). For

     example, the material can be densified by the methods and equipment disclosed in U.S.
     Pat. No. 7,932,065 to Medoff and International Publication No. WO 2008/073186
     (which was filed October 26, 2007, was published in English, and which designated the
     United States), the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
  5  Densified materials can be processed by any of the methods described herein, or any
     material processed by any of the methods described herein can be subsequently
     densified.
              In some embodiments, the material to be processed is in the form of a fibrous
     material that includes fibers provided by shearing a fiber source. For example, the
 10  shearing can be performed with a rotary knife cutter.
              For example, a fiber source, e.g., that is recalcitrant or that has had its
     recalcitrance level reduced, can be sheared, e.g., in a rotary knife cutter, to provide a first
     fibrous material. The first fibrous material is passed through a first screen, e.g., having
     an average opening size of 1.59 mm or less (1/16 inch, 0.0625 inch), provide a second
 15  fibrous material. If desired, the fiber source can be cut prior to the shearing, e.g., with a
     shredder. For example, when a paper is used as the fiber source, the paper can be first
     cut into strips that are, e.g., 1/4- to 1/2-inch wide, using a shredder, e.g., a counter
     rotating screw shredder, such as those manufactured by Munson (Utica, N.Y.). As an
     alternative to shredding, the paper can be reduced in size by cutting to a desired size
 20  using a guillotine cutter. For example, the guillotine cutter can be used to cut the paper
     into sheets that are, e.g., 10 inches wide by 12 inches long.
              In some embodiments, the shearing of the fiber source and the passing of the
     resulting first fibrous material through a first screen are performed concurrently. The
     shearing and the passing can also be performed in a batch-type process.
 25           For example, a rotary knife cutter can be used to concurrently shear the fiber
     source and screen the first fibrous material. A rotary knife cutter includes a hopper that
     can be loaded with a shredded fiber source prepared by shredding a fiber source.
              In some implementations, the feedstock is physically treated prior to
     saccharification and/or fermentation. Physical treatment processes can include one or
 30  more of any of those described herein, such as mechanical treatment, chemical treatment,
     irradiation, sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis or steam explosion. Treatment methods can
     be used in combinations of two, three, four, or even all of these technologies (in any
     order). When more than one treatment method is used, the methods can be applied at the
     same time or at different times. Other processes that change a molecular structure of a

     biomass feedstock may also be used, alone or in combination with the processes
     disclosed herein.
              Mechanical treatments that may be used, and the characteristics of the
     mechanically treated carbohydrate-containing materials, are described in further detail in
  5  U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2012/0100577 A1, filed October 18, 2011, the full disclosure of
     which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
               SONICATION, PYROLYSIS, OXIDATION, STEAM EXPLOSION
 10           If desired, one or more sonication, pyrolysis, oxidative, or steam explosion
     processes can be used instead of or in addition to irradiation to reduce or further reduce
     the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing material. For example, these processes
     can be applied before, during and or after irradiation. These processes are described in
     detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,932,065 to Medoff, the full disclosure of which is incorporated
 15  herein by reference.
                               INTERMEDIATES AND PRODUCTS
              Using the processes described herein, the biomass material can be converted to
 20  one or more products, such as energy (e.g., in addition to co-generation as described
     herein), fuels, foods and materials. For example, intermediates and products such as
     organic acids, salts of organic acids, anhydrides, esters of organic acids and fuels, e.g.,
     fuels for internal combustion engines or feedstocks for fuel cells can be produced.
     Systems and processes are described herein that can use as feedstock cellulosic and/or
 25  lignocellulosic materials that are readily available, but often can be difficult to process,
     e.g., municipal waste streams and waste paper streams, such as streams that include
     newspaper, Kraft paper, corrugated paper or mixtures of these.
              Specific examples of products include, but are not limited to, hydrogen, sugars
     (e.g., glucose, xylose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, fructose, disaccharides,
 30  oligosaccharides and polysaccharides), alcohols (e.g., monohydric alcohols or dihydric
     alcohols, such as ethanol, n-propanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol or n-butanol),
     hydrated or hydrous alcohols (e.g., containing greater than 10%, 20%, 30% or even
     greater than 40% water), biodiesel, organic acids, hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane,
     propane, isobutene, pentane, n-hexane, biodiesel, bio-gasoline and mixtures thereof), co

     products (e.g., proteins, such as cellulolytic proteins (enzymes) or single cell proteins),
     and mixtures of any of these in any combination or relative concentration, and optionally
     in combination with any additives (e.g., fuel additives). Other examples include
     carboxylic acids, salts of a carboxylic acid, a mixture of carboxylic acids and salts of
  5  carboxylic acids and esters of carboxylic acids (e.g., methyl, ethyl and n-propyl esters),
     ketones (e.g., acetone), aldehydes (e.g., acetaldehyde), alpha and beta unsaturated acids
     (e.g., acrylic acid) and olefins (e.g., ethylene). Other alcohols and alcohol derivatives
     include propanol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-propanediol, sugar alcohols (e.g.,
     erythritol, glycol, glycerol, sorbitol threitol, arabitol, ribitol, mannitol, dulcitol, fucitol,
 10  iditol, isomalt, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol and other polyols), and methyl or ethyl esters of
     any of these alcohols. Other products include methyl acrylate, methylmethacrylate, D
     lactic acid, L-lactic acid, pyruvic acid, poly lactic acid, citric acid, formic acid, acetic
     acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, succinic acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, 3
     hydroxypropionic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, glutaric
 15  acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, glycolic acid, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, and mixtures
     thereof, salts of any of these acids, mixtures of any of the acids and their respective salts.
              Any combination of the above products with each other, and/or of the above
     products with other products, which other products may be made by the processes
     described herein or otherwise, may be packaged together and sold as products. The
 20  products may be combined, e.g., mixed, blended or co-dissolved, or may simply be
     packaged or sold together.
              Any of the products or combinations of products described herein may be
     sanitized or sterilized prior to selling the products, e.g., after purification or isolation or
     even after packaging, to neutralize one or more potentially undesirable contaminants that
 25  could be present in the product(s). Such sanitation can be done with electron
     bombardment, for example, by at a dosage of less than about 20 Mrad, e.g., from about
     0.1 to 15 Mrad, from about 0.5 to 7 Mrad, or from about I to 3 Mrad.
              The processes described herein can produce various by-product streams useful
     for generating steam and electricity to be used in other parts of the plant (co-generation)
 30  or sold on the open market (e.g., as previously described herein). For example, steam
     generated from burning by-product streams can be used in a distillation process. As
     another example, electricity generated from burning by-product streams can be used to
     power electron beam generators used in pretreatment.

             The by-products used to generate steam and electricity are derived from a number
     of sources throughout the process. For example, anaerobic digestion of wastewater can
     produce a biogas high in methane and a small amount of waste biomass (sludge). As
     another example, post-saccharification and/or post-distillate solids (e.g., unconverted
  5  lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose remaining from the pretreatment and primary
     processes) can be used, e.g., burned, as a fuel.
             Other intermediates and products, including food and pharmaceutical products,
     are described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2010/0124583 Al, published May 20, 2010, to

 10
                                   LIGNIN DERIVED PRODUCTS
             The spent biomass (e.g., spent lignocellulosic material) from lignocellulosic
     processing by the methods described are expected to have a high lignin content and in
 15  addition to being useful for producing energy through combustion in a Co-Generation
     plant, may have uses as other valuable products. For example, the lignin can be used as
     captured as a plastic, or it can be synthetically upgraded to other plastics. In some
     instances, it can also be converted to lignosulfonates, which can be utilized as binders,
     dispersants, emulsifiers or sequestrants.
 20          When used as a binder, the lignin or a lignosulfonate can, e.g., be utilized in coal
     briquettes, in ceramics, for binding carbon black, for binding fertilizers and herbicides,
     as a dust suppressant, in the making of plywood and particle board, for binding animal
     feeds, as a binder for fiberglass, as a binder in linoleum paste and as a soil stabilizer.
             When used as a dispersant, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g.,
 25  concrete mixes, clay and ceramics, dyes and pigments, leather tanning and in gypsum
     board.
             When used as an emulsifier, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g., in
     asphalt, pigments and dyes, pesticides and wax emulsions.
             When used as a sequestrant, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g., in
 30  micro-nutrient systems, cleaning compounds and water treatment systems, e.g., for boiler
     and cooling systems.
             For energy production lignin generally has a higher energy content than
     holocellulose (cellulose and hemicellulose) since it contains more carbon than
     homocellulose. For example, dry lignin can have an energy content of between about
                                                   43

WO 2014/138551                                                              PCT/US2014/021634
     11,000 and 12,500 BTU per pound, compared to 7,000 an 8,000 BTU per pound of
     holocellulose. As such, lignin can be densified and converted into briquettes and pellets
     for burning. For example, the lignin can be converted into pellets by any method
     described herein. For a slower burning pellet or briquette, the lignin can be crosslinked,
  5  such as applying a radiation dose of between about 0.5 Mrad and 5 Mrad. Crosslinking
     can make a slower burning form factor. The form factor, such as a pellet or briquette,
     can be converted to a "synthetic coal" or charcoal by pyrolyzing in the absence of air,
     e.g., at between 400 and 950 DEG C. Prior to pyrolyzing, it can be desirable to crosslink
     the lignin to maintain structural integrity.
 10
                                       SACCHARIFICATION
              As previously described, in order to convert the feedstock to a form that can be
     readily processed the glucan- or xylan-containing cellulose in the feedstock can be
 15  hydrolyzed to low molecular weight carbohydrates, such as sugars, by a saccharifying
     agent, e.g., an enzyme or acid, a process referred to as saccharification. The low
     molecular weight carbohydrates can then be used, for example, in an existing
     manufacturing plant, such as a single cell protein plant, an enzyme manufacturing plant,
     or a fuel plant, e.g., an ethanol manufacturing facility.
 20           As previously disclosed, the feedstock can be hydrolyzed using an enzyme, e.g.,
     by combining the materials and the enzyme in a solvent, e.g., in an aqueous solution.
              Alternatively, the enzymes can be supplied by organisms that break down
     biomass, such as the cellulose and/or the lignin portions of the biomass, contain or
     manufacture various cellulolytic enzymes (cellulases), ligninases or various small
 25  molecule biomass-degrading metabolites. These enzymes may be a complex of enzymes
     that act synergistically to degrade crystalline cellulose or the lignin portions of biomass.
     Examples of cellulolytic enzymes include: endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and
     cellobiases (beta-glucosidases).
              During saccharification a cellulosic substrate can be initially hydrolyzed by
 30  endoglucanases at random locations producing oligomeric intermediates. These
     intermediates are then substrates for exo-splitting glucanases such as cellobiohydrolase
     to produce cellobiose from the ends of the cellulose polymer. Cellobiose is a water
     soluble 1,4-linked dimer of glucose. Finally, cellobiase cleaves cellobiose to yield
                                                   44

WO 2014/138551                                                               PCT/US2014/021634
     glucose. The efficiency (e.g., time to hydrolyze and/or completeness of hydrolysis) of
     this process depends on the recalcitrance of the cellulosic material.
              Therefore, the treated biomass materials can be saccharified, by combining the
     material and a cellulase enzyme in a fluid medium, e.g., an aqueous solution. In some
  5  cases, the material is boiled, steeped, or cooked in hot water prior to saccharification, as
     described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2012/0100577 Al by Medoff and Masterman, published
     on April 26, 2012, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein.
              The saccharification process can be partially or completely performed in a tank
     (e.g., a tank having a volume of at least 4000, 40,000, or 500,000 L) in a manufacturing
 10  plant, and/or can be partially or completely performed in transit, e.g., in a rail car, tanker
     truck, or in a supertanker or the hold of a ship. The time required for complete
     saccharification will depend on the process conditions and the carbohydrate-containing
     material and enzyme used. If saccharification is performed in a manufacturing plant
     under controlled conditions, the cellulose may be substantially entirely converted to
 15  sugar, e.g., glucose in about 12-96 hours. If saccharification is performed partially or
     completely in transit, saccharification may take longer.
              It is generally preferred that the tank contents be mixed during saccharification,
     e.g., using jet mixing as described in International App. No. PCT/US2010/035331, filed
     May 18, 2010, which was published in English as WO 2010/135380 and designated the
 20  United States, the full disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.
              The addition of surfactants can enhance the rate of saccharification. Examples of
     surfactants include non-ionic surfactants, such as a TWEEN@ 20 or TWEEN@ 80
     polyethylene glycol surfactants, ionic surfactants, or amphoteric surfactants.
              It is generally preferred that the concentration of the sugar solution resulting from
 25  saccharification be relatively high, e.g., greater than 40%, or greater than 50, 60, 70, 80,
     90 or even greater than 95% by weight. Water may be removed, e.g., by evaporation, to
     increase the concentration of the sugar solution. This reduces the volume to be shipped,
     and also inhibits microbial growth in the solution.
              Alternatively, sugar solutions of lower concentrations may be used, in which case
 30  it may be desirable to add an antimicrobial additive, e.g., a broad spectrum antibiotic, in
     a low concentration, e.g., 50 to 150 ppm. Other suitable antibiotics include amphotericin
     B, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, hygromycin B, kanamycin,
     neomycin, penicillin, puromycin, streptomycin. Antibiotics will inhibit growth of
     microorganisms during transport and storage, and can be used at appropriate
                                                     45

WO 2014/138551                                                            PCT/US2014/021634
     concentrations, e.g., between 15 and 1000 ppm by weight, e.g., between 25 and 500 ppm,
     or between 50 and 150 ppm. If desired, an antibiotic can be included even if the sugar
     concentration is relatively high. Alternatively, other additives with anti-microbial of
     preservative properties may be used. Preferably the antimicrobial additive(s) are food
  5  grade.
              A relatively high concentration solution can be obtained by limiting the amount
     of water added to the carbohydrate-containing material with the enzyme. The
     concentration can be controlled, e.g., by controlling how much saccharification takes
     place. For example, concentration can be increased by adding more carbohydrate
 10  containing material to the solution. In order to keep the sugar that is being produced in
     solution, a surfactant can be added, e.g., one of those discussed above. Solubility can
     also be increased by increasing the temperature of the solution. For example, the
     solution can be maintained at a temperature of 40-50 DEG C, 60-80 DEG C, or even
     higher.

     Cellulolytic enzymes may also be obtained from Chrysosporium, preferably a strain of
     Chrysosporium lucknowense. Additional strains that can be used include, but are not
     limited to, Trichoderma (particularly T. viride, T. reesei, and T. koningii), alkalophilic

               In addition to or in combination to enzymes, acids, bases and other chemicals
     (e.g., oxidants) can be utilized to saccharify lignocellulosic and cellulosic materials.

                                                  SUGARS
               In the processes described herein, for example after saccharification, sugars (e.g.,
 15  glucose and xylose) can be isolated and/or purified. For example sugars can be isolated
     and/or purified by precipitation, crystallization, chromatography (e.g., simulated moving
     bed chromatography, high pressure chromatography), electrodialysis, centrifugation,
     extraction, any other isolation method known in the art, and combinations thereof.
 20        HYDROGENATION AND OTHER CHEMICAL TRANSFORMATIONS
               The processes described herein can include hydrogenation. For example glucose
     and xylose can be hydrogenated to sorbitol and xylitol respectively. Hydrogenation can
     be accomplished by use of a catalyst (e.g., Pt/gamma-A1203, Ru/C, Raney Nickel, or
 25  other catalysts know in the art) in combination with H2 under high pressure (e.g., 10 to
     12000 psi). Other types of chemical transformation of the products from the processes
     described herein can be used, for example production of organic sugar derived products
     (e.g., furfural and furfural-derived products). Chemical transformations of sugar derived
     products are described in USSN 13/934,704 filed July 3, 2013, the entire disclosure of

                                         FERMENTATION
              Yeast and Zymomonas bacteria, for example, can be used for fermentation or
     conversion of sugar(s) to alcohol(s). Other microorganisms are discussed below. The
  5  optimum pH for fermentations is about pH 4 to 7. For example, the optimum pH for
     yeast is from about pH 4 to 5, while the optimum pH for Zymomonas is from about pH 5
     to 6. Typical fermentation times are about 24 to 168 hours (e.g., 24 to 96 hrs) with
     temperatures in the range of 20'C to 40'C (e.g., 260 C to 40'C), however thermophilic
     microorganisms prefer higher temperatures.
 10           In some embodiments, e.g., when anaerobic organisms are used, at least a portion
     of the fermentation is conducted in the absence of oxygen, e.g., under a blanket of an
     inert gas such as N2, Ar, He, C02 or mixtures thereof. Additionally, the mixture may
     have a constant purge of an inert gas flowing through the tank during part of or all of the
     fermentation. In some cases, anaerobic condition, can be achieved or maintained by
 15  carbon dioxide production during the fermentation and no additional inert gas is needed.
              In some embodiments, all or a portion of the fermentation process can be
     interrupted before the low molecular weight sugar is completely converted to a product
     (e.g., ethanol). The intermediate fermentation products include sugar and carbohydrates
     in high concentrations. The sugars and carbohydrates can be isolated via any means
 20  known in the art. These intermediate fermentation products can be used in preparation of
     food for human or animal consumption. Additionally or alternatively, the intermediate
     fermentation products can be ground to a fine particle size in a stainless-steel laboratory
     mill to produce a flour-like substance. Jet mixing may be used during fermentation, and
     in some cases saccharification and fermentation are performed in the same tank.
 25           Nutrients for the microorganisms may be added during saccharification and/or
     fermentation, for example the food-based nutrient packages described in U.S. Pat. App.

  5                                          DISTILLATION
             As previously described, after fermentation, the resulting fluids can be distilled
     using, for example, a "beer column" to separate ethanol and other alcohols from the
     majority of water and residual solids. The vapor exiting the beer column can be, e.g.,
 10  35% by weight ethanol and can be fed to a rectification column. A mixture of nearly
     azeotropic (92.5%) ethanol and water from the rectification column can be purified to
     pure (99.5%) ethanol using vapor-phase molecular sieves. The beer column bottoms can
     be sent to the first effect of a three-effect evaporator. The rectification column reflux
     condenser can provide heat for this first effect. After the first effect, solids can be
 15  separated using a centrifuge and dried in a rotary dryer. A portion (25%) of the
     centrifuge effluent can be recycled to fermentation and the rest sent to the second and
     third evaporator effects. Most of the evaporator condensate can be returned to the
     process as fairly clean condensate with a small portion split off to waste water treatment
     to prevent build-up of low-boiling compounds.

                                       CONVEYING SYSTEMS
  5
              Various conveying systems can be used to convey the biomass material, for
     example, as discussed, to a vault, and under an electron beam in a vault. Exemplary
     conveyors are belt conveyors, pneumatic conveyors, screw conveyors, carts, trains, trains
     or carts on rails, elevators, front loaders, backhoes, cranes, various scrapers and shovels,
 10  trucks, and throwing devices can be used. For example, vibratory conveyors can be used
     in various processes described herein. Vibratory conveyors are described in
     PCT/US2013/64289 filed October 10, 2013 the full disclosure of which is incorporated
     by reference herein.
              Vibratory conveyors are particularly useful for spreading the material and
 15  producing a uniform layer on the conveyor trough surface. For example the initial
     feedstock can form a pile of material that can be at least four feet high (e.g., at least
     about 3 feet, at least about 2 feet, at least about 1 foot, at least about 6 inches, at least
     about 5 inches, at least about, 4 inches, at least about 3 inches, at least about 2 inches, at
     least about 1 inch, at least about     inch) and spans less than the width of the conveyor
 20  (e.g., less than about 10%, less than about 20%, less than about 30%, less than about
     40%, less than about 50%, less than about 60%, less than about 70%, less than about
     80%, less than about 90%, less than about 95%, less than about 99%). The vibratory
     conveyor can spread the material to span the entire width of the conveyor trough and
     have a uniform thickness, preferably as discussed above. In some cases, an additional
 25  spreading method can be useful. For example, a spreader such as a broadcast spreader, a
     drop spreader (e.g., a CHRISTY SPREADER') or combinations thereof can be used to
     drop (e.g., place, pour, spill and/or sprinkle) the feedstock over a wide area. Optionally,
     the spreader can deliver the biomass as a wide shower or curtain onto the vibratory
     conveyor. Additionally, a second conveyor, upstream from the first conveyor (e.g., the
 30  first conveyor is used in the irradiation of the feedstock), can drop biomass onto the first
     conveyor, where the second conveyor can have a width transverse to the direction of
     conveying smaller than the first conveyor. In particular, when the second conveyor is a
     vibratory conveyor, the feedstock is spread by the action of the second and first
     conveyor. In some optional embodiments, the second conveyor ends in a bias cross cut
                                                     52

WO 2014/138551                                                                   PCT/US2014/021634
     discharge (e.g., a bias cut with a ratio of 4:1) so that the material can be dropped as a
     wide curtain (e.g., wider than the width of the second conveyor) onto the first conveyor.
     The initial drop area of the biomass by the spreader (e.g., broadcast spreader, drop
     spreader, conveyor, or cross cut vibratory conveyor) can span the entire width of the first
  5  vibratory conveyor, or it can span part of this width. Once dropped onto the conveyor,
     the material is spread even more uniformly by the vibrations of the conveyor so that,
     preferably, the entire width of the conveyor is covered with a uniform layer of biomass.
     In some embodiments combinations of spreaders can be used. Some methods of
     spreading a feed stock are described in U.S. Patent No. 7,153,533, filed July 23, 2002
 10  and published December 26, 2006, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein
     by reference.
              Generally, it is preferred to convey the material as quickly as possible through an
     electron beam to maximize throughput. For example, the material can be conveyed at
     rates of at least 1 ft/min, e.g., at least 2 ft/min, at least 3 ft/min, at least 4 ft/min, at least 5
 15  ft/min, at least 10 ft/min, at least 15 ft/min, at least 20 ft/min, at least 25 ft/min, at least
     30 ft/min, at least 40 ft/min, at least 50 ft/min, at least 60 ft/min, at least 70 ft/min, at
     least 80 ft/min, at least 90 ft/min. The rate of conveying is related to the beam current
     and targeted irradiation dose, for example, for a         inch thick biomass spread over a 5.5
     foot wide conveyor and 100 mA, the conveyor can move at about 20 ft/min to provide a
 20  useful irradiation dosage (e.g. about 10 Mrad for a single pass), at 50 mA the conveyor
     can move at about 10 ft/min to provide approximately the same irradiation dosage.
              The rate at which material can be conveyed depends on the shape and mass of the
     material being conveyed, and the desired treatment. Flowing materials e.g., particulate
     materials, are particularly amenable to conveying with vibratory conveyors. Conveying
 25  speeds can, for example be, at least 100 lb/hr (e.g., at least 500 lb/hr, at least 1000 lb/hr,
     at least 2000 lb/hr, at least 3000 lb/hr, at least 4000 lb/hr, at least 5000 lb/hr, at least
     10,000 lb/hr, at least 15, 000 lb/hr, or even at least 25,000 lb/hr). Some typical conveying
     speeds can be between about 1000 and 10,000 lb/hr, (e.g., between about 1000 lb/hr and
     8000 lb/hr, between about 2000 and 7000 lb/hr, between about 2000 and 6000 lb/hr,
 30  between about 2000 and 50001b/hr, between about 2000 and 4500 lb/hr, between about
     1500 and 5000 lb/hr, between about 3000 and 7000 lb/hr, between about 3000 and 6000
     lb/hr, between about 4000 and 6000 lb/hr and between about 4000 and 5000 lb/hr).
     Typical conveying speeds depend on the density of the material. For example, for a
     biomass with a density of about 35 lb/ft 3, and a conveying speed of about 5000 lb/hr, the
                                                      53

WO 2014/138551                                                                PCT/US2014/021634
     material is conveyed at a rate of about 143 ft3/hr, if the material is     " thick and is in a
     trough 5.5 ft wide, the material is conveyed at a rate of about 1250 ft/hr (about 21
     ft/min). Rates of conveying the material can therefore vary greatly. Preferably, for
     example, a     " thick layer of biomass, is conveyed at speeds of between about 5 and 100
  5  ft/min (e.g. between about 5 and 100 ft/min, between about 6 and 100 ft/min, between
     about 7 and 100 ft/min, between about 8 and 100 ft/min, between about 9 and 100 ft/min,
     between about 10 and 100 ft/min, between about 11 and 100 ft/min, between about 12
     and 100 ft/min, between about 13 and 100 ft/min, between about 14 and 100 ft/min,
     between about 15 and 100 ft/min, between about 20 and 100 ft/min, between about 30
 10  and 100 ft/min, between about 40 and 100 ft/min, between about 2 and 60 ft/min,
     between about 3 and 60 ft/min, between about 5 and 60 ft/min, between about 6 and 60
     ft/min, between about 7 and 60 ft/min, between about 8 and 60 ft/min, between about 9
     and 60 ft/min, between about 10 and 60 ft/min, between about 15 and 60 ft/min, between
     about 20 and 60 ft/min, between about 30 and 60 ft/min, between about 40 and 60 ft/min,
 15  between about 2 and 50 ft/min, between about 3 and 50 ft/min, between about 5 and 50
     ft/min, between about 6 and 50 ft/min, between about 7 and 50 ft/min, between about 8
     and 50 ft/min, between about 9 and 50 ft/min, between about 10 and 50 ft/min, between
     about 15 and 50 ft/min, between about 20 and 50 ft/min, between about 30 and 50 ft/min,
     between about 40 and 50 ft/min). It is preferable that the material be conveyed at a
 20  constant rate, for example, to help maintain a constant irradiation of the material as it
     passes under the electron beam (e.g., shower, field).
             The vibratory conveyors described can include screens used for sieving and
     sorting materials. Port openings on the side or bottom of the troughs can be used for
     sorting, selecting or removing specific materials, for example, by size or shape. Some
 25  conveyors have counterbalances to reduce the dynamic forces on the support structure.
     Some vibratory conveyors are configured as spiral elevators, are designed to curve
     around surfaces and/or are designed to drop material from one conveyor to another (e.g.,
     in a step, cascade or as a series of steps or a stair). Along with conveying materials
     conveyors can be used, by themselves or coupled with other equipment or systems, for
 30  screening, separating, sorting, classifying, distributing, sizing, inspection, picking, metal
     removing, freezing, blending, mixing, orienting, heating, cooking, drying, dewatering,
     cleaning, washing, leaching, quenching, coating, de-dusting and/or feeding. The
     conveyors can also include covers (e.g., dust-tight covers), side discharge gates, bottom
     discharge gates, special liners (e.g., anti-stick, stainless steel, rubber, custom steal, and or
                                                     54

     grooved), divided troughs, quench pools, screens, perforated plates, detectors (e.g., metal
     detectors), high temperature designs, food grade designs, heaters, dryers and or coolers.
     In addition, the trough can be of various shapes, for example, flat bottomed, vee shaped
     bottom, flanged at the top, curved bottom, flat with ridges in any direction, tubular, half
  5  pipe, covered or any combinations of these. In particular, the conveyors can be coupled
     with an irradiation systems and/or equipment.
             The conveyors (e.g., vibratory conveyor) can be made of corrosion resistant
     materials. The conveyors can utilize structural materials that include stainless steel (e.g.,
     304, 316 stainless steel, HASTELLOY@ ALLOYS and INCONEL@ Alloys). For
 10  example, HASTELLOY@ Corrosion-Resistant alloys from Hynes (Kokomo, Indiana,
     USA) such as HASTELLOY@ B-3@ ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ HYBRID-BC1@
     ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ C-4 ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ C-22@ ALLOY,
     HASTELLOY@ C-22HS@ ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ C-276 ALLOY, HASTELLOY@
     C-2000@ ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ G-30@ ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ G-35@ ALLOY,
 15  HASTELLOY@ N ALLOY and HASTELLOY@ ULTIMET@ alloy.
             The vibratory conveyors can include non-stick release coatings, for example,
     TUFFLONTM (Dupont, Delaware, USA). The vibratory conveyors can also include
     corrosion resistant coatings. For example, coatings that can be supplied from Metal
     Coatings Corp (Houston, Texas, USA) and others such as Fluoropolymer, XYLAN@,
 20  Molybdenum Disulfide, Epoxy Phenolic, Phosphate- ferrous metal coating,
     Polyurethane- high gloss topcoat for epoxy, inorganic zinc, Poly Tetrafluoro ethylene,
     PPS/RYTON@, fluorinated ethylene propylene, PVDF/DYKOR@, ECTFE/HALAR@
     and Ceramic Epoxy Coating. The coatings can improve resistance to process gases (e.g.,
     ozone), chemical corrosion, pitting corrosion, galling corrosion and oxidation.
 25          Optionally, in addition to the conveying systems described herein, one or more
     other conveying systems can be enclosed. When using an enclosure, the enclosed
     conveyor can also be purged with an inert gas so as to maintain an atmosphere at a
     reduced oxygen level. Keeping oxygen levels low avoids the formation of ozone which
     in some instances is undesirable due to its reactive and toxic nature. For example, the
 30  oxygen can be less than about 20% (e.g., less than about 10%, less than about 1%, less
     than about 0.1%, less than about 0.01%, or even less than about 0.001% oxygen).
     Purging can be done with an inert gas including, but not limited to, nitrogen, argon,
     helium or carbon dioxide. This can be supplied, for example, from a boil off of a liquid
     source (e.g., liquid nitrogen or helium), generated or separated from air in situ, or
                                                  55

WO 2014/138551                                                               PCT/US2014/021634
     supplied from tanks. The inert gas can be recirculated and any residual oxygen can be
     removed using a catalyst, such as a copper catalyst bed. Alternatively, combinations of
     purging, recirculating and oxygen removal can be done to keep the oxygen levels low.
              The enclosed conveyor can also be purged with a reactive gas that can react with
  5  the biomass. This can be done before, during or after the irradiation process. The
     reactive gas can be, but is not limited to, nitrous oxide, ammonia, oxygen, ozone,
     hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds, amides, peroxides, azides, halides, oxyhalides,
     phosphides, phosphines, arsines, sulfides, thiols, boranes and/or hydrides. The reactive
     gas can be activated in the enclosure, e.g., by irradiation (e.g., electron beam, UV
 10  irradiation, microwave irradiation, heating, IR radiation), so that it reacts with the
     biomass. The biomass itself can be activated, for example by irradiation. Preferably the
     biomass is activated by the electron beam, to produce radicals which then react with the
     activated or unactivated reactive gas, e.g., by radical coupling or quenching.
              Purging gases supplied to an enclosed conveyor can also be cooled, for example
 15  below about 25'C, below about 00 C, below about -40'C, below about -80'C, below
     about -120'C. For example, the gas can be boiled off from a compressed gas such as
     liquid nitrogen or sublimed from solid carbon dioxide. As an alternative example, the
     gas can be cooled by a chiller or part of or the entire conveyor can be cooled.
 20                                   OTHER EMBODIMENTS
              Any material, processes or processed materials discussed herein can be used to
     make products and/or intermediates such as composites, fillers, binders, plastic additives,
     adsorbents and controlled release agents. The methods can include densification, for
 25  example, by applying pressure and heat to the materials. For example composites can be
     made by combining fibrous materials with a resin or polymer. For example radiation
     cross-linkable resin, e.g., a thermoplastic resin can be combined with a fibrous material
     to provide a fibrous material/cross-linkable resin combination. Such materials can be, for
     example, useful as building materials, protective sheets, containers and other structural
 30  materials (e.g., molded and/or extruded products). Absorbents can be, for example, in the
     form of pellets, chips, fibers and/or sheets. Adsorbents can be used, for example, as pet
     bedding, packaging material or in pollution control systems. Controlled release matrices
     can also be the form of, for example, pellets, chips, fibers and or sheets. The controlled
     release matrices can, for example, be used to release drugs, biocides, fragrances. For
                                                    56

     example, composites, absorbents and control release agents and their uses are described
     in International Serial No. PCT/US2006/010648, filed March 23, 2006, and US Patent
     No. 8,074,910 filed November 22, 2011, the entire disclosures of which are herein
     incorporated by reference.
  5           In some instances the biomass material is treated at a first level to reduce
     recalcitrance, e.g., utilizing accelerated electrons, to selectively release one or more
     sugars (e.g., xylose). The biomass can then be treated to a second level to release one or
     more other sugars (e.g., glucose). Optionally the biomass can be dried between
     treatments. The treatments can include applying chemical and biochemical treatments to
 10  release the sugars. For example, a biomass material can be treated to a level of less than
     about 20 Mrad (e.g., less than about 15 Mrad, less than about 10 Mrad, less than about 5
     Mrad, less than about 2 Mrad) and then treated with a solution of sulfuric acid,
     containing less than 10% sulfuric acid (e.g., less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less
     than about 7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than
 15  about 3%, less than about 2%, less than about 1%, less than about 0.75%, less than about
     0.50 %, less than about 0.25%) to release xylose. Xylose, for example that is released
     into solution, can be separated from solids and optionally the solids washed with a
     solvent/solution (e.g., with water and/or acidified water). Optionally, the solids can be
     dried, for example in air and/or under vacuum optionally with heating (e.g., below about
 20  150 deg C, below about 120 deg C) to a water content below about 25 wt% (below about
     20 wt.%, below about 15 wt.%, below about 10 wt.%, below about 5 wt.%). The solids
     can then be treated with a level of less than about 30 Mrad (e.g., less than about 25 Mrad,
     less than about 20 Mrad, less than about 15 Mrad, less than about 10 Mrad, less than
     about 5 Mrad, less than about 1 Mrad or even not at all) and then treated with an enzyme
 25  (e.g., a cellulase) to release glucose. The glucose (e.g., glucose in solution) can be
     separated from the remaining solids. The solids can then be further processed, for
     example utilized to make energy or other products (e.g., lignin derived products).
                          FLAVORS, FRAGRANCES AND COLORANTS
 30
              Any of the products and/or intermediates described herein, for example, produced
     by the processes, systems and/or equipment described herein, can be combined with
     flavors, fragrances, colorants and/or mixtures of these. For example, any one or more of
     (optionally along with flavors, fragrances and/or colorants) sugars, organic acids, fuels,
                                                    57

     polyols, such as sugar alcohols, biomass, fibers and composites can be combined with
     (e.g., formulated, mixed or reacted) or used to make other products. For example, one or
     more such product can be used to make soaps, detergents, candies, drinks (e.g., cola,
     wine, beer, liquors such as gin or vodka, sports drinks, coffees, teas), syrups
  5  pharmaceuticals, adhesives, sheets (e.g., woven, none woven, filters, tissues) and/or
     composites (e.g., boards). For example, one or more such product can be combined with
     herbs, flowers, petals, spices, vitamins, potpourri, or candles. For example, the
     formulated, mixed or reacted combinations can have flavors/fragrances of grapefruit,
     orange, apple, raspberry, banana, lettuce, celery, cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla,
 10  peppermint, mint, onion, garlic, pepper, saffron, ginger, milk, wine, beer, tea, lean beef,
     fish, clams, olive oil, coconut fat, pork fat, butter fat, beef bouillon, legume, potatoes,
     marmalade, ham, coffee and cheeses.
              Flavors, fragrances and colorants can be added in any amount, such as between
     about 0.001 wt.% to about 30 wt.%, e.g., between about 0.01 to about 20, between about
 15  0.05 to about 10, or between about 0.1 wt.% to about 5 wt.%. These can be formulated,
     mixed and or reacted (e.g., with any one of more product or intermediate described
     herein) by any means and in any order or sequence (e.g., agitated, mixed, emulsified,
     gelled, infused, heated, sonicated, and/or suspended). Fillers, binders, emulsifier,
     antioxidants can also be utilized, for example protein gels, starches and silica.
 20            In one embodiment the flavors, fragrances and colorants can be added to the
     biomass immediately after the biomass is irradiated such that the reactive sites created by
     the irradiation may react with reactive compatible sites of the flavors, fragrances, and
     colorants.
              The flavors, fragrances and colorants can be natural and/or synthetic materials.
 25  These materials can be one or more of a compound, a composition or mixtures of these
     (e.g., a formulated or natural composition of several compounds). Optionally the flavors,
     fragrances, antioxidants and colorants can be derived biologically, for example, from a
     fermentation process (e.g., fermentation of saccharified materials as described herein).
     Alternatively, or additionally these flavors, fragrances and colorants can be harvested
 30  from a whole organism (e.g., plant, fungus, animal, bacteria or yeast) or a part of an
     organism. The organism can be collected and or extracted to provide color, flavors,
     fragrances and/or antioxidant by any means including utilizing the methods, systems and
     equipment described herein, hot water extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, chemical
     extraction (e.g., solvent or reactive extraction including acids and bases), mechanical
                                                    58

     extraction (e.g., pressing, comminuting, filtering), utilizing an enzyme, utilizing a
     bacteria such as to break down a starting material, and combinations of these methods.
     The compounds can be derived by a chemical reaction, for example, the combination of
     a sugar (e.g., as produced as described herein) with an amino acid (Maillard reaction).
  5  The flavor, fragrance, antioxidant and/or colorant can be an intermediate and or product
     produced by the methods, equipment or systems described herein, for example and ester
     and a lignin derived product.
             Some examples of flavor, fragrances or colorants are polyphenols. Polyphenols
     are pigments responsible for the red, purple and blue colorants of many fruits,
 10  vegetables, cereal grains, and flowers. Polyphenols also can have antioxidant properties
     and often have a bitter taste. The antioxidant properties make these important
     preservatives. On class of polyphenols are the flavonoids, such as Anthocyanidines,
     flavanonols, flavan-3-ols, s, flavanones and flavanonols.     Other phenolic compounds
     that can be used include phenolic acids and their esters, such as chlorogenic acid and
 15  polymeric tannins.
             Among the colorants inorganic compounds, minerals or organic compounds can
     be used, for example titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, aluminum oxide, cadmium yellow
     (E.g., CdS), cadmium orange (e.g., CdS with some Se), alizarin crimson (e.g., synthetic
     or non-synthetic rose madder), ultramarine (e.g., synthetic ultramarine, natural
 20  ultramarine, synthetic ultramarine violet ), cobalt blue, cobalt yellow, cobalt green,
     viridian (e.g., hydrated chromium(III)oxide), chalcophylite, conichalcite, cornubite,
     cornwallite and liroconite. Black pigments such as carbon black and self-dispersed
     blacks may be used.

               5.       Biomass Conversion Technologies
                        In the context of this document, biomass conversion refers to the process of converting biomass
               into energy that will in turn be used to generate electricity and/or heat. The principal categories of
               biomass conversion technologies for power and heat production are direct-fired and gasification systems.
               Within the direct-fired category, specific technologies include stoker boilers, fluidized bed boilers, and
               cofiring. Within the gasification category, specific technologies include fixed bed gasifiers and fluidized
               bed gasifiers. Anaerobic digesters are also considered a biomass conversion technology; however,
               extensive information about digesters is readily available from EPA's AgSTAR Program
               <www.epa.gov/agstar> and therefore, will not be discussed within this chapter.
                        Biomass power systems are typically below 50 MW in size, compared to coal-fired plants, which
               are in the 100- to 1,000-MW range. Most of today's biomass power plants are direct-firedsystems. The
               biomass fuel is burned in a boiler to produce high-pressure steam that is used to power a steam turbine
               driven power generator. In many applications, steam is extracted from the turbine at medium pressures
               and temperatures and is used for process heat, space heating, or space cooling. Cofiring involves
               substituting biomass for a portion of the coal in an existing power plant boiler. It is the most economic
               near-term option for introducing new biomass power generation. Because much of the existing power
               plant equipment can be used without major modifications, cofiring is far less expensive than building a
               new biomass power plant. Compared to the coal it replaces, biomass reduces SO 2 , NOx, C0 2 , and other
               air emissions.
                        Biomass gasificationsystems operate by heating biomass in an environment where the solid
               biomass breaks down to form a flammable gas. The gas produced-synthesis gas, or syngas-can be
               cleaned, filtered, and then burned in a gas turbine in simple or combined-cycle mode, comparable to LFG
               or biogas produced from an anaerobic digester. In smaller systems, the syngas can be fired in
               reciprocating engines, microturbines, Stirling engines, or fuel cells. Gasification technologies using
               biomass byproducts are popular in the pulp and paper industry where they improve chemical recovery and
               generate process steam and electricity at higher efficiencies and with lower capital costs than
               conventional technologies. Pulp and paper industry byproducts that can be gasified include hogged wood,
               bark, and spent black liquor.
                        Table 5-1 provides a summary of biomass conversion technologies for producing heat and power.

                         Modular systems employ some of the same technologies mentioned above, but on a smaller scale
               that is more applicable to farms, institutional buildings, and small industry. A number of modular systems
               are now under development and could be most useful in remote areas where biomass is abundant and
               electricity is scarce.
               5.1       Direct-FiredSystems
                         The most common utilization of solid fuel biomass is direct combustion with the resulting hot
               flue gases producing steam in a boiler-a technology that goes back to the 19" century. Boilers today
               bum a variety of fuels and continue to play a major role in industrial process heating, commercial and
               institutional heating, and electricity generation. Boilers are differentiated by their configuration, size, and
               the quality of the steam or hot water produced. Boiler size is most often measured by the fuel input in
               MMBtu per hour (MMBtu/hr), but it may also be measured by output in pounds of steam per hour.
               Because large boilers are often used to generate electricity, it can also be useful to relate boiler size to
               power output in electric generating applications. Using typical boiler and steam turbine generating
               efficiencies, 100 IVMBtu/hr heat input provides about 10 MW electric output.
                         The two most commonly used types of boilers for biomass firing are stoker boilers and fluidized
               bed boilers. Either of these can be fueled entirely by biomass fuel or cofired with a combination of
               biomass and coal. The efficiency, availability, operating issues, equipment and installed costs, O&M
               requirements and costs, and commercial status of each of these options are discussed below.
               5.1.1     Boilers
               Characterization
                         Stoker Boilers
                         Stoker boilers employ direct fire combustion of solid fuels with excess air, producing hot flue
               gases, which then produce steam in the heat exchange section of the boiler. The steam is used directly for

               boilers were first introduced in the 1920s for coal; in the late 1940s the Detroit Stoker Company installed
               the first traveling grate spreader stoker boiler for wood. Mechanical stokers are the traditional technology
               that has been used to automatically supply solid fuels to a boiler. All stokers are designed to feed fuel
               onto a grate where it bums with air passing up through it. The stoker is located within the furnace section
               of the boiler and is designed to remove the ash residue after combustion. Stoker units use mechanical
               means to shift and add fuel to the fire that bums on and above the grate located near the base of the boiler.
               Heat is transferred from the fire and combustion gases to water tubes on the walls of the boiler.
                         Modem mechanical stokers consist of four elements, 1) a fuel admission system, 2) a stationary
               or moving grate assembly that supports the burning fuel and provides a pathway for the primary
               combustion air, 3) an overfire air system that supplies additional air to complete combustion and
               minimize atmospheric emissions, and 4) an ash discharge system. Figure 5-1 illustrates the different
               sections of a stoker boiler.
                         A successful stoker installation requires selecting the correct size and type of stoker for the fuel
               being used and for the load conditions and capacity being served. Stoker boilers are typically described by
               their method of adding and distributing fuel. There are two general types of systems-underfeed and
               overfeed. Underfeed stokers supply both the fuel and air from under the grate, while overfeed stokers
               supply fuel from above the grate and air from below. Overfeed stokers are further divided into two
               types-massfeed and spreader. In the mass feed stoker, fuel is continuously fed onto one end of the grate

               fired, fixed bed, shaker hearth, tangential-fired, and wall-fired. Practical considerations limit stoker size
               and, consequently, the maximum steam generation rates. For coal firing, this maximum is about 350,000
               pounds per hour (lb/hr); for wood or other biomass firing it is about 700,000 lb/hr.
                         Underfeed Stokers
                         Underfeed stokers supply both fuel and primary combustion air from beneath the grate so that the
               top of the fuel pile is not cooled by cold and moist fuel or cold air. The fuel is moved into a hopper and
               onto the grate by either a screw- or ram-driven mechanism. Underfeed stokers push the fuel into the
               bottom of the bed of fuel while heat causes volatilization and complete combustion of the fuel by the time
               it rises to the top of the bed as ash and is discharged. As the fuel moves out over the grate where it is
               exposed to air and radiant heat, it            Figure 5-2. Cross Section of Underfeed, Side-Ash

               combustion process, ash ac cumulates
               as the fuel, is burned. The two basic
               types of underfeed stokers are: 1) the
               horizontal-feed, side-ash discharge
               type and 2) the gravity-feed, rear-ash
               discharge type. A cross-section of an
               underfeed, side-ash discharge stoker
               is shown in Figure 5-2. The demand
               for underfeed stokers has diminished
               due to cost and environmental
               considerations. Underfeed stokes are
               best suited for relatively dry fuel
               (under 40 to 45 percent moisture.)

                        Overfeed Stokers
                        Overfeed stokers are generally classified by the way the fuel is distributed and burned within the
               boiler. The primary designations are mass-feed or spreader stokers. Mass-feed stokers introduce fuel
               continuously at one end of a grate. As the fuel moves into the boiler, it falls onto the grate by gravity. To
               control the amount of fuel that enters the boiler, a gate can be moved up or down, or the speed at which
               the fuel moves beneath the gate can be adjusted. Inside the boiler, the fuel burns as it travels along the
               grate. Primary combustion air
               flows upward from beneath the          Figure 5-3. Cross Section of Overfeed, Water-Cooled,

               complete combustion. Any ash
               that remains on the grate is
               then discharged at the opposite
               end of the system. The two
               primary mass-feed stokers are
               1) water-c ooled vibrating grate*
               and 2) moving (chain and

                        Spreader Stokers
                        Spreader stokers are the most commonly used stokers because of their versatility. They are
               capable of distributing fuel evenly and to a uniform depth over the entire grate surface by using a device
               that propels the individual fuel particles into the air above the grate. Methods used to propel the fuel
               particles include air injection and underthrow and overthrow rotors. As the fuel is thrown into the boiler,
               fine particles ignite and bum while suspended in the combustion air. Due to suspension burning, response
               times of spreader stokes are better than for mass feed or underfeed stokes. The coarser particles that fall
               onto the grate end up burning in a thin bed of fuel on the grate. Primary combustion air is supplied from
               beneath the grate. Because the fuel is evenly distributed across the active grate area, the combustion air is
               uniformly distributed under and through the grate. A portion of the total combustion air is admitted
               through ports above the grate as overfire air, completing the combustion process. Grates for spreader
               stokers are generally designed to move rather than remain stationary. Therefore, traveling grates, air
               cooled vibrating grates, and water-cooled vibrating grates are designs that have been used effectively.

                        Along with the fuel feed system and furnace section geometry, air system design plays an
               important role in efficient and complete combustion of biomass fuels in stoker boilers. Excess air for
               bark, wood, and most biomass fuels is set at 25 percent or above for stoker firing. Because biomass fuels
               are typically highly volatile on a dry basis, are heterogeneous in size, and more often burn in suspension
               compared to coal, biomass combustion air systems are designed to provide more overfire air than those
               used for coal. Modem designs use undergrate and overfire quantities of 40 and 60 percent, respectively.
                        Fluidized Bed Boilers
                        Fluidized bed boilers are the most recent type of boiler developed for solid fuel combustion. The
               primary driving force for development of fluidized bed combustion is reduced SO 2 and NO, emissions
               from coal combustion. As the technology developed, it became apparent that the process could efficiently
               bum biomass and other low-grade fuels that are difficult or impractical to bum with conventional
               methods.
                        In this method of combustion, fuel is burned in a bed of hot inert, or incombustible, particles
               suspended by an upward flow of combustion air that is injected from the bottom of the combustor to keep
               the bed in a floating or "fluidized' state. The scrubbing action of the bed material on the fuel enhances the
               combustion process by stripping away
               the CO 2 and solids residue (char) that           Figure 5-4. Cut-Away View of a Fluidized Bed
               normally forms around the fuel particles.         Combustion Boiler
               This process allows oxygen to reach the
               combustible material more readily and
               increases the rate and efficiency ofthe
               combustion process. One advantage of
               mixing in the fluidized bed is that it
               allows a more compact design than in
               conventional water tube boiler designs.
               Natural gas or fuel oil can also be used as
               a start-up fuel to preheat the fluidized
               bed or as an auxiliary fuel when
               additional heat is required. The effective
               mixing of the bed makes fluidized bed
               boilers well-suited to burn solid refuse,
               wood waste, waste coals, and other non
               standard fuels. Figur e 5-4 shows the
               components of a fluidized bed                   Source: Babcock &Wilcox, 2005.
               combustion boiler.
                         The fluidized bed combustion process provides a means for efficiently mixing fuel with air for
               combustion. When fuel is introduced to the bed, it is quickly heated above its ignition temperature,
               ignites, and becomes part of the burning mass. The flow of air and fuel to the dense bed is controlled so
               that the desired amount of heat is released to the furnace section on a continuous basis. Typically,
               biomass is burned with 20 percent or higher excess air. Only a small fraction of the bed is combustible
               material; the remainder is comprised of inert material, such as sand. This inet material provides a large
               inventory of heat in the furnace section, dampening the effect of brief fluctuations in fuel supply or
               heating value on boiler steam output.
                         Fuels that contain a high concentration of ash, sulfur, and nitrogen can be burned efficiently in
               fluidized bed boilers while meeting stringent emission limitations. Due to long residence time and high
               intensity of mass transfer, fuel can be efficiently burned in a fluidized bed combustor at temperatures

               considerably lower than in conventional combustion processes (1,400 to 1,6000 F compared to 2,200 F
               for a spreader stoker boiler). The lower temperatures produce less NO., a significant benefit with high
               nitrogen-content wood and biomass fuels. SO 2 emissions from wood waste and biomass are generally
               insignificant, but where sulfur contamination of the fuel is an issue, limestone can be added to the fluid
               bed to achieve a high degree of sulfur capture. Fuels that are typically contaminated with sulfur include
               construction debris and some paper mill sludges.
                         Fluidized bed boilers are categorized as either atmospheric or pressurized units. Atmospheric
               fluidized bed boilers are further divided into bubbling-bed and circulating-bed units; the fundamental
               difference between bubbling-bed and circulating-bed boilers is the fluidization velocity (higher for
               circulating). Circulating fluidized bed boilers separate and capture fuel solids entrained in the high
               velocity exhaust gas and return them to the bed for complete combustion. Atmospheric-pressure bubbling
               fluidized bed boilers are most commonly used with biomass fuels. The type of fluid bed selected is a
               function of the as-specified heating value of the biomass fuel. Bubbling bed technology is generally
               selected for fuels with lower heating values. The circulating bed is most suitable for fuels of higher
               heating values.
                        In a pressurized fluidized bed boiler, the entire fluidized bed combustor is encased inside a large
               pressure vessel. Burning solid fuels in a pressurized fluidized bed boiler produces a high-pressure stream
               of combustion gases. After the combustion gases pass through a hot gas cleanup system, they are fed into
               a gas turbine to make electricity, and the heat in the hot exhaust gas stream can be recovered to boil water
               for a steam turbine. Therefore, a pressurized fluidized bed boiler is more efficient, but also more
               complicated and expensive. Capital costs of pressurized fluidized bed combustion technology are higher
               than atmospheric fluidized beds.
               Efficiency
                        Boiler efficiency is defined as the percentage of the fuel energy that is converted to steam energy.
               Major efficiency factors in biomass combustion are moisture content of the fuel, excess air introduced
               into the boiler, and the percentage of uncombusted or partially combusted fuel. According to the Council
               of Industrial Boiler Owners (CIBO), the general efficiency range of stoker and fluidized bed boilers is
               between 65 and 85 percent efficient." Fuel type and availability have a major effect on efficiency because
               fuels with high heating values and low moisture content can yield efficiencies up to 25 percent higher
               than fuels having low heating values and high-moisture contents.
                        Biomass boilers are typically run with a considerable amount of excess air so that they can
               achieve complete combustion, but this has a negative impact on efficiency. A CIBO rule of thumb
                                                                                                                           2
               indicates that boiler efficiency can be increased 1 percent for each 15 percent reduction in excess air.
                        Table 5-2 compares the efficiency of a biomass stoker and a fluidized bed boiler that are operated
               with 50 percent excess air with a final flue gas exit temperature of 350' F. The efficiencies are estimated
               based on the heat-loss method, which is a way of determining boiler efficiency by measuring the
               individual heat losses (expressed as a percent of heat input) and subtracting them from 100 percent. As
               can be seen in the table, the largest energy loss in a boiler is the heat that leaves the stack. This loss could
               amount to as much as 30 to 35 percent of the fuel input in older, poorly maintained boilers. The table
               shows that decreasing fuel moisture content from 30 to 0 percent increases thermal efficiency by about 6
               percentage points. This estimate assumes that the air-fuel ratio is maintained by adjusting air input based

                         The primary difference in efficiency between a stoker boiler and a fluidized bed boiler is the
               amount of fuel that remains unburned. As shown in Table 5-2, the efficiency of fluidized bed boilers
               compares favorably with stoker boilers due to lower combustion losses. Stoker boilers can have 30 to 40
               percent carbon in the ash and additional volatiles and CO in the flue gases, while fluidized bed boiler
               systems typically achieve nearly 100 percent fuel combustion. The turbulence in the combustor combined
               with the thermal inertia of the bed material provide for complete, controlled, and uniform combustion.
               These factors are key to maximizing the thermal efficiency, minimizing char, and controlling emissions.

                         When considering factors that influence boiler performance, it should be noted that efficiency is
               not constant throughout the entire operating range of a boiler. Peak efficiency generally occurs at a
               particular boiler output that is determined by design characteristics. Whenever boiler operations deviate
               from this output, the resulting performance is usually below peak efficiency. Operating continuously at
               peak efficiency is not practical due to seasonal demands, load variations and fuel property variations;
               however, operating at a steady load and avoiding cyclic or on-off operation can improve efficiency.

               availability range.
               OperatingAdvantages and Disadvantages
                        Stoker and fluidized bed boilers have specific operating advantages and disadvantages with
               biomass fuels depending on the fuel characteristics and site requirements. Biomass fuels are extremely
               variable in terms of heating value, moisture content, and other factors that affect combustion. Wood and
               most other biomass fuels are composed primarily of cellulose and moisture. As discussed previously, the
               high proportion of moisture is significant because it acts as a heat sink during the combustion process.
               The latent heat of evaporation depresses flame temperature, taking heat energy away from steam
               production, and contributing to the difficulty of efficiently burning biomass fuels. Cellulose, in addition to
               containing the chemical energy released in combustion, contains fuel-bound oxygen. This oxygen
               decreases the theoretical air requirements for combustion and, accordingly, the amount of nitrogen
               included in the products of combustion. A few general guidelines for direct firing of wood and biomass in
               boilers include:
                        *    Maintain stable combustion, which can be achieved in most water-cooled boilers with fuel
                             moisture contents as high as 65 percent by weight, as received.
                        *    Use of preheated combustion air reduces the time required for fuel drying prior to ignition
                             and is essential to spreader stoker combustion systems. Design air temperatures will vary
                             directly with moisture content.
                        "    A high proportion of the combustible content of wood and other biomass fuels burns in the
                             form of volatile compounds. A large proportion of the combustion air requirement, therefore,
                             is added above the fuel in stoker and other conventional combustion boilers as overfire air.
                        "    Solid chars produced in the initial stages of combustion of biomass fuels are of very low
                             density. Conservative selection of furnace section size is used to reduce gas velocity and keep
                             char entrainment into the flue gases and possibly out the stack at acceptable levels.
                        To ensure smooth fuel feeding, biomass fuels have to be carefully sized and processed. As
               discussed above, the moisture content of wood and other biomass waste can vary over a wide range, from
                10 percent to more than 60 percent. To ensure steady heat input into the boiler using volumetric feeders,
               efficient homogenization of fuel with different moisture contents at the fuel yard is a necessity.
                        Biomass-based fuels can increase the risk of sagging and fouling of heat transfer surfaces and, in
               some cases, the risk of fireside corrosion as well. Potassium ash content is relatively high in fresh wood,
               green particles, and fast-growing biomass, which causes the ash to melt at low temperatures and leads to a
               tendency for fouling and sagging. Additionally, biomass fuels can contain chlorine, which, together with
               alkalis, can induce aggressive corrosion.
                        Table 5-3 provides a comparison of combustion characteristics and fuel issues for stoker and
               fluidized bed boilers. Stoker boilers have been around for a long time and are a relatively basic
               technology, whereas fluidized bed technology is newer and more complex, but offers more flexibility and
               operating control. Fluidized bed systems offer significant operating flexibility because they can operate
               under a wide range of load conditions. The thermal inertia of the bed material allows it to withstand
               changes in moisture and heating content of the fuel without negative impacts. Additionally, the low fuel

               integrated steam system will include the fuel prep-yard and handling equipment, the boiler itself, induced
               and forced air fans, controls, and water treatment systems. Varying levels of emission control equipment
               will normally be needed as well. Most installations will include cyclone separators to capture large fly
               ash, a baghouse for fine particulate matter (PM), and a dry scrubber system. NO, emissions control in
               stoker boilers is provided by a selective non-catalytic reduction system using urea or ammonia that is
               installed in the top of the boiler. Other control equipment includes acid gas removal system, stack, ash

                        As shown in Table 5-4, the prep-yard and fuel handling system represents a significant portion of
               the total steam system costs, ranging from 15 to 25 percent of the total steam system costs for the larger
               sized units and 25 to 50 percent of the total cost of the 100 tons/day steam system. Fluidized bed boiler
               equipment costs are higher than the simpler stoker technology; the fluidized bed boiler itself is more than
               three times as expensive as a stoker boiler in the smallest size shown; in the larger sizes, the fluidized bed
               boiler is 35 to 40 percent more expensive. The unit capital costs ($/lb steam) for a biomass-fueled steam
               plant, including the prep-yard costs, are 20 to 25 percent more expensive for the larger fluidized bed
               systems. A portion of the higher capital cost is offset by the higher output due to higher efficiency.
                        The cost of the boiler is also a function of the steam output conditions as shown in Table 5-5.
               Generating higher pressure and temperature steam requires special and more expensive alloys and thicker
               water tubes. Boilers producing very high pressure steam can be more than twice as expensive as boilers
               generating low pressure steam.

               O&M Costs
                        Estimated non-fuel O&M costs for stoker and fluidized bed boiler systems are provided in Table
               5-6 for the three steam system sizes, based on published data and discussion with manufacturers. The
               O&M costs are evaluated within the context of an integrated plant. Total O&M costs include the labor for
               the prep-yard, and labor, materials, and parts for the boiler system itself. Boiler system O&M estimates
               were based on an annual non-labor component for spare parts and maintenance equipment assumed to be
               2 percent of boiler capital costs. Variable costs for chemicals, water, and electricity needed to ran blowers
               and auxiliary equipment were assumed to be approximately $0.20 to $0.25 per thousand pounds of steam
               output.

                        As shown in Table 5-6, the two boiler types are assumed to have the identical prep-yard labor
               requirement for the same output. The 100 tons/day plant uses a less automated system, so the labor
               requirement is higher than for the larger plants using an automated prep-yard. On a unit cost basis, O&M
               costs are higher for the fluidized bed boiler in the 100 tons/day size, but equal to the stoker boiler O&M
               costs for the two larger sizes.

               by a number of manufacturers. Fluidized bed boilers are a more recent technology, but are also
               commercially available through a number of manufacturers. Until recently, however, fluidized bed boiler
               use has been more widespread in Europe than the United States, and many of the suppliers are European
               based.
                         As shown in Table 5-6, when evaluated within the context of an integrated plant on a unit cost
               basis, O&M costs are higher for a smaller circulating fluidized bed processing 100 tons/day, but lower
               than the stoker boiler for the two larger sizes evaluated in this study.

               5.1.2    Coffring
                        One of the most cost effective and easily implemented biomass energy technologies is cofiring
               with coal in existing coal-fired boilers. Cofiring refers to the practice of mixing biomass with afossil fuel
               in high-efficiency boilers as a supplementary energy source. Inbiomass cofiing, biomass can substitute
               forup to 20percent ofthe coal used in the boiler. Cofiringis typically used when either the supply of
               biomass is intenittent or when the moisture content of the biomass is high. At large plants, biomass is
               cofired with coal, and more coal is typically used than biomass. At small plants, biomass is cofired with
               natural gas, and more biomass is typically used than natural gas because the natural gas is used to
               stabilize combustion when biomass with high-moisture content is fed into the b oiler.
               Characterization
                        Figure 5-5 shows a process diagram for a standard coal-based cofiring plant. Bi omass has been
               cofired with coal economi cally in commerci al plants, which is princip ally viewed as a fuel co st reduction
               strategy. In certain situations, co firing has provided opportunities for utilities to get fuel from wo od
               manufacturing and other businesses at zero or negative cost. Overall production cost savings can also be
               achieved by replacing coal with inexpensive biomass fuel sources such as woodwaste and waste paper.
               Typically, biomass fuel supplies should cost at least 20 percent less, on a thermal basis, than coal supplies
               before a cofiring project can be economically attractive.

                        Biomass cofring is mainly a retrofit application. A b asic principle of co firing is that significant
               changes to the boiler are not required beyond some minor burner mo difications or additions necessary to
               introduce and bum the supplemental fuel. To meet this objective, cofiring biomass fuels is usually done
               on a limited basis, with the amount ofbiomass ranging from 5 to 15 percent of the total heatinput to the
                     5
               boiler. Biomass fuels that have been successfully cofired include wood and pelletized waste paper.
               Interest is growing in cofiring biomass among electric utilities and other users of coal boilers, chiefly due
               to the need to improve air emissions from coal-burning facilities, as well as to diversify fuel supplies.
                        Table 5-S gives a sense of the size of typical utility cofiring p ower plants, the percentage of
               biomass fuel used (generally about 10 percent but up to 50 percent), and the types ofbiomass feedsto ck
               used (wood, woo d waste, woo d residues, and sawdust).

                Efficiency
                         Usually, no major changes in boiler efficiency result from cofiring. However, some design and
                operational changes might be needed to maximize boiler efficiency while maintaining acceptable opacity,
                baghouse performance, and other operating requirements. Without these adjustments, boiler efficiency
                and performance can decrease. For example, at a biomass heat input level of 10 percent, boiler efficiency
                losses of 2 percent were measured during cofiring tests at a facility with a pulverized coal boiler when no
                adjustments were made." Numerous cofiring projects have demonstrated that efficiency and performance
                losses can be minimized with proper awareness of operational issues.
                OperatingAvailability
                         The availability of biomass and coal cofired boilers is similar to that of regular coal boilers, if
                proper modifications are made to the system. If some of the potential operating issues mentioned in the
                next section manifest, then availability might be negatively affected.
                OperatingAdvantages and Disadvantages
                         Typically, cofiring biomass in an existing coal boiler requires modifications or additions to fuel
                handling, processing, storage, and feed systems. Slight modifications to existing operational procedures,
                such as increasing overfire air, might also be necessary, as well as increasing fuel feeder rates to
                compensate for the lower density and heating value of biomass.
                         As covered in Chapter 4, fuel characteristics and processing can greatly affect the ability to use
                biomass as a fuel in boilers. Wood chips are preferable to mulch-like material for cofiring with coal in
                stoker boilers because the chips are similar to stoker coal in terms of size and flow characteristics. This

               similarity minimizes problems with existing coal handling systems. When using a mulch-like material or
               a biomass supply with a high fraction of fine particles (sawdust size or smaller), periodic blockage of fuel
               flow openings in various areas of the conveying, storage, and feed systems can occur. These blockages
               can cause significant maintenance increases and operational problems; therefore, fuel should be processed
               to avoid difficulties with existing fuel feeding systems.
                         Another fuel consideration when dealing with biomass is the potential for problems with
               sagging, fouling, and corrosion. Some biomass fuels have high alkali (principally potassium) or chlorine
               content that can lead to unmanageable ash deposition problems on heat exchange and ash-handling
               surfaces. Chlorine in combustion gases, particularly at high temperatures, can cause accelerated corrosion
               of combustion system and flue gas cleanup components. These problems can be minimized or avoided by
               screening fuel supplies for materials high in chlorine and alkalis, limiting the biomass contribution to
               boiler heat input to 15 percent or less, using fuel additives, or increasing soot-blowing. The most
               troublesome biomass resource tends to be agricultural residues, including grasses and straws, which have
               high alkali and chlorine contents. In contrast, most woody materials and waste papers are relatively low in
               alkali and chlorine and should not present this problem.
                         Currently, about 25 percent of the fly ash from coal-fired power plants is used as a feedstock for
               cement and concrete production, while another 15 percent is used as a feedstock in other applications."
               According to current industry standards," only fly ash from coal combustion qualifies for use in
               cement/concrete applications. Cofiring biomass in a coal power plant would keep the fly ash from
               meeting the current standard. Similarly, coal fly ash will sometimes not meet the current standard when
               certain emissions control techniques are used, such as ammonia injection. Though these restrictions can
               impact the economics of biomass cofiring, the value of finding a productive use for fly ash and other coal
               combustion products is primarily the avoidance of a roughly S20/ton landfill fee. For coal with 10 percent
               ash content, this value would be worth about $2/ton of the input fuel cost. While the current restrictions
               are a barrier to considering cofiring in some applications, other uses of fly ash are not affected, and
               researchers are currently studying the impact of using fly ash from biomass and biomass/coal cofiring on
               concrete characteristics. Early results show that biomass and cofired fuels do not adversely affect the
               usefulness of fly ash in cement and concrete, and in fact might have some advantages.61 It is likely that
               this work will eventually lead to a reevaluation of the standard and inclusion of fly ash from cofiring as an
               acceptable cement/concrete feedstock as has already happened in Europe."
               Equipment and Installed Costs
                         Cofiring typically does not involve added investment for the boiler equipment that is already in
               place for the coal-fired plant. There are additional costs for new fuel handling and processing equipment,
               boiler modifications, controls, engineering fees, and contingency. For blended fuel input systems, in
               which the biomass is added upstream of the coal fuel preparation equipment, the costs for the added feed
               preparation are on the order of 15 to 30 percent of the costs shown in the previous section in Table 5.4 for
               a dedicated biomass system. For systems using a separate fuel feed system, the costs are comparable to
               the costs ($/ton of biomass feed) for a dedicated biomass plant.

               O&M Issues
                        As discussed under capital costs, additional O&M to the boiler section attributable to the addition
               of biomass for cofiring is minimal. Maintenance requirements for boilers cofiring biomass and coal are
               similar to those for coal-only boilers. However, slight changes to previous operational procedures, such as
               increasing overfire air and fuel feeder speeds, might be needed. Increases in O&M costs for biomass
               cofiring with coal are almost entirely for the biomass receiving and feed preparation. For a blended
               system, the adjustments to feed preparation O&M are also on the order of 15 to 30 percent of the cost of a
               dedicated biomass plant.
               CommercializationStatus
                        Organizations such as electric utilities, DOE, and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI),
               have conducted research and field tests on biomass cofiring in small- and large-scale utility boilers for a
               number of years. These tests have shown that cofiring with biomass has been successfully accomplished
               in a wide range of boiler types, including cyclone, stoker, pulverized coal, and bubbling and circulating
               fluidized bed boilers. According to the Federal Energy Management Program, at least 182 separate
               boilers and organizations in the United States have cofired biomass with fossil fuels although this number
               is not comprehensive. Of the 182 cofiring operations, 114 (or 63 percent) have been at industrial facilities,
               32 at utility-owned power plants, 18 at municipal boilers, 10 at educational institutions, and eight at

                        Biomass gasification for power production involves heating solid biomass in an oxygen-starved

               the biomass and the gasifier's properties, the heating value of the syngas, can range anywhere from 100 to
               500 Btu/cubic foot (10 to 50 percent that of natural gas). The heating value of syngas generally comes
               from CO and hydrogen produced by the gasification process. The remaining constituents are primarily
               CO 2 and other incombustible gases. Biomass gasification offers certain advantages over directly burning
               the biomass because the gas can be cleaned and filtered to remove problem chemical compounds before it
               is burned. Gasification can also be accomplished using chemicals or biologic action (e.g., anaerobic
               digestion); however, thermal gasification is currently the only commercial or near commercial option.
                        The fuel output from the gasification process is generally called syngas, though in common usage
               it might be called woodgas, producer gas, or biogas. Syngas can be produced through direct heating in
               an oxygen-starved environment, partial oxidation, or indirect heating in the absence of oxygen. Most
               gasification processes include several steps. The primary conversion process, called pyrolysis, is the
               thermal decomposition of solid biomass (in an oxygen-starved environment) to produce gases, liquids
               (tar), and char. Pyrolysis releases the volatile components of the biomass feed at around 1,100 F through
               a series of complex reactions. Biomass fuels are an ideal choice for pyrolysis because they have so many
               volatile components (70 to 85 percent on dry basis, compared to 30 percent for coal). The next step
               involves a further gasification process that converts the leftover tars and char into CO using steam and/or
               partial combustion. In coal gasification, pure oxygen or oxygen-enriched air is preferred as the oxidant
               because the resulting syngas produced has a higher heating value, and the process is more efficient. In
               biomass gasification, oxygen is generally not used because biomass ash has a lower melting point than
               coal ash, and because the scale of the plants is generally smaller.

                         Very high temperature processes involving passing the biomass through a plasma are have been
               developed and tested primarily for waste remediation, contaminated wastes, and MSW. Plasma processes
               are not discussed in this report.
                         Compared with direct-fired biomass systems, gasification is not yet an established commercial
               technology. There is great interest, however, in the development and demonstration of biomass
               gasification for a number of reasons:
                         A gaseous fuel is more versatile than a solid fuel. It can be used in boilers, process heaters,
                             turbines, engines and fuel cells, distributed in pipelines, and blended with natural gas or other
                             gaseous fuels.
                         Gasification can remove fuel contaminants and reduce emissions compared to direct-fired
                             systems.
                         Gasification can be designed to handle a wide range of biomass feedstocks, from woody residues
                             to agricultural residues to dedicated crops, without major changes in the basic process.
                         Gasification can be used to process waste fuels, providing safe removal of biohazards and
                             entrainment of heavy metals in non-reactive slag.
                         A gaseous fuel can be used in a high-efficiency power generation system, such as a gas turbine
               combined cycle or fuel cells, provided it is cleaned of contaminants. When equipment is added to recover
               the heat from the turbine exhaust, system efficiencies can increase to 80 percent.
                         Like the direct combustion processes described in the previous section, two principal types of
               gasifiers have emerged: fixed bed and fluidized bed. Fixed bed gasifiers are typically simpler, less
               expensive, and produce a lower heat content syngas. Fluidized bed gasifiers are more complicated, more
               expensive, and produce a syngas with a higher heating value.

                         Fixed Bed Gasifiers
                         Fixed bed gasifiers typically have a fixed grate inside a refractory-lined shaft. The fresh biomass
               fuel is typically placed on top of the pile of fuel, char, and ash inside the gasifier. A further distinction is
               based on the direction of air (or oxygen) flow: downdraft (air flows down through the bed and leaves as
               biogas under the grate), updraft (air flows up through the grate and biogas is collected above the bed), or
               crossflow (air flows across the bed, exiting as biogas). Schematics of the primary section of the fixed bed
               gasifier types are shown in Figure 5-6.

                         Fluidized Bed Gasifiers
                         Fluidized bed gasifiers utilize the same gasification processes and offer higher performance than
               fixed bed systems, but with greater complexity and cost. Similar to fluidized bed boilers, the primary
               gasification process takes place in a bed of hot inert materials suspended by an upward motion of oxygen
               deprived gas (Figure 5-7). As the amount of gas is augmented to achieve greater throughput, the bed will
               begin to levitate and become "fluidized." Sand or alumina is often used to further improve the heat
               transfer. Notable benefits of fluidized bed devices are their high productivity (per area of bed) and
               flexibility. Fluidized bed gasifiers can also handle a wider range of biomass feedstocks with moisture
               contents up to 30 percent on average.

                         There are three stages of fluidization that can occur on the gasifier depending on the design:
               bubbling, recirculating, and entrained flow. At the lower end of fluidization, the bed expands and begins
               to act as a fluid. As the velocity is increased, the bed will begin to "bubble." With a further increase in
               airflow, the bed material begins to lift off the bed. This material is typically separated in a cyclone and
               "recirculated" to the bed. With still higher velocities, the bed material is entrained (i.e., picked up and
               carried off in the airflow).
                         Fluidized bed gasifiers can be designed to use a portion of the pyrolysis gases to generate the heat
               to drive the process, or they can be externally fired. Operating the gasifier at higher pressures increases
               the throughput; however, this also increases the gasifier's complexity and cost. In these units, the biomass
               is fully converted after going through the pyrolysis and char conversion processes.
                         By reducing the quantity of air and process temperature, it is possible to operate fluidized bed
               boilers as gasifiers. In this operating mode, the gasifiers produce a gas with a heating value of slightly
               more than 100 Btu/cubic foot (fR). This gas is burned above the bed as additional air supply is injected
               upstream of the boiler tube section.
                         Table 5-11 provides typical physical characteristics of a fluidized bed gasifier. A number of
               advanced-concept fluidized bed gasifiers aiming to produce a syngas with a heating value between 250
               and 400 Btu/ftf are under development. This type of syngas would be more appropriate for use in gas

               Efficiency
                         Both fixed and fluidized bed biomass gasification uses similar types of equipment as direct
               combustion. The biomass fuel is fed into a combustion/reaction vessel with either a fixed, fluidized, or
               moving bed. The thermodynamics of heat loss are similar, but gasification conditions are different from
               direct combustion. In direct combustion, 10 to 14 times the weight of the fuel is introduced as air. In
               gasification, the air entering the reactor, if any, is only one to two times the weight of the fuel. This
               difference reduces heat losses from the reaction zone. On the other hand, the syngas exits the gasification
               reactor at very high temperatures (1,200 to 1,5000 F); some of this heat loss can be recovered either
               directly through the use of heat exchangers in the gas cooling section, or indirectly through the use of heat
               recovery from the combustion of the syngas in the power generation section. To the extent that heat is
               used to preheat incoming air, introduce high-temperature steam, or dry the incoming biomass, the
               efficiency of biomass to syngas conversion will be increased. Heat that is recovered from the hot gas
               cooling section can also be added to the Ct-P heat recovery. In this case, the intermediate efficiency value
               of syngas conversion is not increased but the overall CIP efficiency is. These differences combine to
               produce biomass to syngas efficiencies (heating value of the syngas divided by the heating value of the
               biomass) of 60 to 80 percent. In integrated configurations, however, additional steam can be generated
               from cooling the hot syngas exiting the reactor prior to cleanup.
               OperatingAvailability
                         Due to the fact that commercialization of biomass gasification plants is in its early stages, no
               facility survey information was found on their availability or reliability. Plants are designed for
               continuous operation, and design performance is in the 90+ percent range. Actual experience with
               emerging technology tends to result in lower availability than is experienced during broad commercial
               use, as materials handling problems, control issues, and component failures cause more frequent
               unplanned outages than are seen after accumulating additional operating experience. With a newly
               established support infrastructure, outages also tend to last longer before being fixed or solved. A well

               designed system, however, has a reasonable expectation of operating in the 85 to 95 percent availability
               range.
               OperatingIssues
                         As discussed above, moisture content, gas cleanup, and operating pressure can all affect operation
               of a gasifier. There are a number of operating issues common to the different types of gasification
               systems.
                         Moisture Content
                         Green biomass, defined as freshly harvested plant material, can contain a significant amount of
               water by weight (up to 60 percent). This water does not contribute to the heat content of the syngas while
               consuming a significant amount of energy in gasification. Even though water cannot be burned (oxidized)
               at elevated temperatures, it will dissociate into its elemental components-hydrogen and oxygen. The
               hydrogen will contribute to the calorific value of the syngas. This reaction is very temperature-sensitive,
               and the hydrogen and oxygen will usually recombine into water vapor as the syngas cools. Therefore, the
               moisture content of biomass must be strictly limited. If there is excess moisture, the gasification process
               cannot sustain itself without an external source of heat. As the moisture content of the biomass increases,
               the net energy available in the syngas decreases. Fixed bed gasifiers that use internal combustion of the
               syngas typically utilize biomass with less than 20 percent moisture content. Fluidized bed gasifiers
               typically require less than 30 percent moisture content.
                         Green biomass is the most readily available and inexpensive biomass product. The drying process
               requires a considerable additional capital investment and increases the O&M costs. Unfortunately, the
               cost of the drying equipment (equipment cost and O&M cost) seldom covers the cost savings of using
               green biomass.
                         Gas Cleanup
                         As syngas leaves the gasifier, it contains several types of contaminants that are harmful to
               downstream equipment, ash handling, and emissions. The degree of gas cleanup must be appropriately
               matched to its intended use. For use in reciprocating engines, gas turbines, and especially fuel cells, a
               very clean gas is required. As discussed in Table 5-12, the primary contaminants in syngas are tars,
               particles, alkali compounds, and ammonia. The types of contaminants that are observed depend on the
               biomass feedstock and the gasification process used.

                         Because gasification occurs at an elevated temperature, syngas can have as much as a third ofits
               total energy in sensible heat. Cleaning the gas while it is hot would be advantageous from an energy use
               perspective, but this task is currently difficult to accomplish. Research is ongoing regarding hot gas
               filters, which can be applied in coal gasification, as well as other high-temperature processes. Wet
               scrubbers are currently one of the most reliable and least expensive options for gas cleanup, even though
               they sacrifice a large portion of the sensible heat of the syngas. Cooling the hot syngas can provide a
               source of steam for the cleaning process, power generation, or end-use.
                         Operating Pressure
                         Gasifiers can be operated at either atmospheric or elevated pressures. Air-blown, atmospheric
               gasifiers produce a very low Btu gas 110 to 170 Btu/scf. To introduce this gas into a gas turbine in the
               power generation section of the plant requires considerable compression energy, up to a third of the
               turbine's output. Therefore, it would be advantageous to produce the syngas at a high pressure so that it
               can be introduced directly into the combustion section of a gas turbine without additional compression.
               Pressurized reactors, however, do need to compress any combustion air or oxygen that is introduced into
               the reactor and maintain a pressure seal on the biomass input and ash removal systems.
               Advantages andDisadvantages
                         Fixed bed and fluidized bed gasifiers have specific operating advantages and disadvantages with
               biomass fuels depending on the biomass characteristics and site requirements. Table 5-13 provides a
               qualitative comparison of gasifier characteristics and operating issues for fixed bed and fluidized bed
               systems.

               Equipment and Installed Costs
                         The main cost for the gasification train is the primary gasification reactor itself. Supplementary
               processing can occur in a tar cracker. Indirect gasifiers have separate char combustors to supply heat. The
               next major part is the gas cleanup section, which includes ash removal, quench, bag filter, wet scrubber,
               and heat exchangers to cool the syngas and provide heat to other parts of the process or to contribute to
               the CUP heat utilization. Capital costs for the gasification section and for a biomass-to-syngas plant are
               shown in Table 5-14. These costs are estimated based on published estimates (Antares Group, Inc., 2003)
               and discussions with equipment suppliers. The unit costs do not show a uniform declining trend as a
               function of size, but instead vary depending on the process considered.

               Commercial Status
                        The majority of commercial gasification projects use coal or petroleum coke as a feedstock.
               Biomass gasification technologies have been a subject of commercial interest for several decades. By the
               1990s, CHP had been identified as a potential near-term technology. Research and development
               concentrated on integrated gasification combined cycle and gasification cofiring demonstrations, which
               led to a number of commercial-scale systems. In the United States, projects mostly processed hard-to
               manage feedstocks like bagasse and alfalfa. Low-energy gasifiers are now commercially available, and
               dozens of small-scale facilities are in operation.
                                                                                                        4
                        A review of gasifier manufacturers in Europe, the United States, and Canada" identified 50
               manufacturers offering commercial gasification plants in which 75 percent of the designs were fixed bed
               downdraft type; 20 percent of the designs were fluidized bed systems. The actual number of biomass
               gasification systems in operation worldwide is unknown, but is estimated to be below 50 based on
               literature review and discussions with industry sources. There are only a handful of commercially
               operating biomass gasification systems in the United States at this time, and many of these are partially
               government-funded demonstration units. In comparison, there are currently more than 100 biomass-fueled
               fluidized bed boilers in operation around the world.
                        There is still a considerable amount of development activity underway to address existing
               technical and operational issues:
                        *    Gasification-Some gasification technologies using biomass and black liquor have
                             developed to the point of large-scale demonstration. However, gasifier systems have not
                             reached widespread commercial availability for systems suitable for integration with
                             hydrogen separation technologies for fuel cells or fuel synthesis. This is due in part to areas
                             of fuel chemistry that are not established enough to support the commercial demonstration
                             programs and facilitate the development and scale-up of advanced gasifiers and gas cleanup
                             systems.
                        "    Syngas cleanup and conditioning-The raw gases from biomass systems do not currently
                             meet strict quality standards for downstream fuel, chemical synthesis catalysts, or those for
                             some power technologies. These gases will require cleaning and conditioning to remove
                             contaminants such as tar, particulates, alkali, ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur. Available
                             cleanup technologies do not yet meet the needed cost, performance, or environmental criteria
                             needed to achieve commercial implementation.
                        "    Sensors and controls Development of effective process controls is needed to maintain
                             plant performance and emissions at target levels with varying load, fuel properties, and
                             atmospheric conditions. New sensors and analytical instruments are under development to
                             optimize control systems for thermochemical systems.
                        *    Process integration-As with all new process technologies, demonstrating sustained
                             integrated performance that meets technical, environmental, and safety requirements at
                             sufficiently large scale is essential to supporting commercialization. Applications such as
                             black liquor integration in paper mills has the added complexity of being attached to an
                             existing commercial process where the unit operations associated with steam production,
                             power, pulping, and chemical recovery must all be integrated.

                        *    Containment (materials of construction) Experience with existing gasifiers indicates that
                             gasification reactions are difficult to contain and that materials development for reactor shells
                             and internals, refractory materials to line containment vessels, vessel design, and increased
                             knowledge of bed behavior and agglomeration will improve performance over the long term.
               5.3      Modular Systems
                        Modular biomass-fueled CHP systems are defined as small systems, less than 5 MW, though
               typically smaller, with the main operating components coming in one or more pre-engineered and
               packaged modules for simple installation at the user's site. The systems typically include a fuel processor
               (combustion or gasification), necessary intermediate fuel cleanup, an electric generator, and heat recovery
               from both the power generation and energy conversion sections. An automatic fuel storage and delivery
               system must be added for a complete operating system.
                        Small modular biomass systems can supply electricity to rural areas, farms, businesses, and
               remote villages. These systems use locally available biomass fuels such as wood, crop waste, animal
               manure, and LFG. Development of biomass-fueled modular power systems is of great interest
               internationally as a means to bring power to isolated communities in areas lacking power and fuel
               infrastructure. In the United States, there is interest in small systems to utilize opportunity fuels from a
               local area, such as crop wastes or fire control forest thinnings.
                        A partial listing of specific developer/manufacturer modular systems is provided in Appendix D.
               Characterization
                        Modular systems are essentially scaled down versions of larger systems. There are systems that
               use direct-fired technology with steam power, and systems that use gasification technology and gaseous
               fuel burning power technologies (discussed in Chapter 6) such as internal combustion engines,
               microturbines, and Stirling engines. There are also direct fired systems that use Stirling engines for power
               production, as well as systems that employ gasification, wherein the hot raw gas is combusted to raise
               steam.
                        Modular Gasification Systems
                        Figure 5-8 shows a schematic of a 75-kW modular biomass gasification system that is
               representative of systems under development. The figure shows that there are eight submodules included
               in the basic system and that the storage and feed submodules are not included.

                             recovery equipment to provide additional useable thermal energy for onsite use. Because the
                             gas is of such a low Btu content, propane or natural gas is required on system start-up. After
                             start-up, the system can run on the syngas alone.
                         Systems such as these will require feedstock storage with an in-place delivery system. An in
               ground storage bunker with amoving bed would allow direct delivery of fuel loads into the automated
               system. This can consist of a permanently installed live bottom van into which dump trucks can deliver a
               sized fuel supply.

               other power systems are being developed that are more suitable for small-sized applications. The typical

                        In addition to the four power cycles shown, very small (500 watts to 10 kW) modular systems are
               being developed using Stirling engine technology. The generators will convert various biomass fuels
                                                                                                           7
               (wood, wood pellets, sawdust, chips, or biomass waste) to electricity and useful heat" These systems
               typically convert 10 to 20 percent of the fuel energy to electricity; 60 to 70 percent of fuel energy is then
               available for heating water and spaces. The burner for the prototype system includes a ceramic fire box
               and a fuel hopper with a fuel capacity of 24 hours. It accomplishes complete two-stage combustion with
               comparatively low emissions. The Stirling engine-alternator requires minimal maintenance because its
               gas bearings eliminate contact, friction, and wear. Its projected life is 40,000 hours.
                        Modular Hybrid Gasification/Combustion Systems
                        The modular hybrid gasification/combustion system operates functionally like a direct
               combustion system. Power is derived by a back-pressure steam turbine that also provides steam for onsite
               thermal energy requirements. The difference is that the combustion chamber is actually a gasification

               system thatuses a two-chamber gasifier approach. The systemis similar to atwo-stage combustion boiler
               design. This approach allows the production of gas in a relatively cool chamber at temperatures from
               1,000F to 1,4001F, and then combustion in a relatively hot chamber-the boiler-at temperatures up to
               2,300*F. These temperatures allow the complete removal of carbon from the fuel in the gasifier, and more
               complete oxidation of complex organics in the oxidation zone. The combination of thes e features results
               in a clean-burning, fuel-efficient system. CHP units include small back-pressure steam turbines from 100
               kW up to several megawatts.
                        This approach combines the simplicity and low cost of a combustion system with the gasification
               advantages of more complete carbon conversion and cleaner combustion characteristics. An example of a
               modular gasification/combustion system is shown in Figure 5-10. This system has the capability to use
               fuels with moisture contents ranging from 6 to 55 percent (wet basis). The system also has a 20:1 turn
               down ratio to allow it to idle during periods oflow heat demand.

                        Modular system electric generation efficiencies are typically fairly low as shown in Table 5-17.
               In applications requiring considerable thermal energy, the overall CH-P efficiencies are comparable to gas
               fired systems. However, the electric to thermal ratio for these systems is much lower, so more of the total
               us eful energy is delivered in the form of heat rather than in the form ofhigher value electricity.

               OperatingAdvantages and Disadvantages
                          The main operating advantages today are in the use of opportunity biomass fuels of low value
               such as wood chips or forest thinnings. In addition, many of the systems are targeted at remote
               applications where it would be too costly to connect to grid electricity.
                          The main disadvantage affecting all types of modular systems is the comparatively high capital
               costs associated with all of the required equipment. This equipment also takes up considerable space
               compared to conventional gas-fired CHP systems. The engine generator systems occupy only about 5
               percent of the total space required for the modular biomass system. Another disadvantage is the need for
               maintenance and repairs associated with the many subsystems, particularly the solids handling
               components and filters.
               Equipment and Installed Cost
                          Equipment costs are speculative. Information in this section is as provided by the vendors and
               secondary sources. Figure 5-11 shows a range of costs ($/kW) for different types of direct-fired systems.
               It is not clear that these costs include the costs of feedstock storage and delivery, which would add
               another $600 to 1,000/kW to the overall costs.

                         Modular gasification costs are estimated to be between $2,500 to $4,000/kW for the basic
               equipment with another $600 to $1,000/kW for a biomass storage bunker and $1,000 to $2,000/kW for
               installation.
                         The hybrid gasification/combustion system by itself costs about $300/kW. This component must
               be matched with feedstock storage and delivery ($600 to $1,000/kW), small-scale boiler, small-scale
               steam turbine generator ($900 to $1,200/kW), and other equipment including controls, cyclone fly ash
               recovery system, and exhaust stack. Overall installed capital costs would be $12,000 to $18,000/kW.
               O&M Costs
                         Most modular systems are characterized by continuous operation, automatic ash and char
               extraction, automatic feed, and automatic process control. Maintenance of 0.5 to 3 hours per week is
               required for monitoring feedstock deliveries, ash removal, filter cleaning or replacement, and inspecting
               and fixing problems with the automatic feed system. In addition, prime movers such as internal
               combustion engines or microturbines require similar maintenance attention as for gas-fired systems.
                         The overall costs and reliability of these systems has not yet been established.
               Commercial Status
                         There are a number of small development compaines working on modular biomass heat and
               power systems (listed in Appendix D). Most of the systems that have been installed in the United States
               are part of research, development and demonstration projects funded by a variety of federal and state
               sources. DOE has an active research and development program on modular biomass as does USDA and
               the U.S. Forest Service. The United Nations also has an ongoing program in this area to develop village

               Executive Summary
               This study was performed for the Biomass Power Association to review current technology that
               is available for high efficiency biomass power generation. The available technology is listed
               with a brief description of the technology.
               The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Resources (DOER) has proposed new
               requirements for biomass Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). The minimum standard is a net
               plant efficiency of 40% to receive Wcredit and a net efficiency of 60% to received a full credit.
               This study concludes that such efficiency standards are not achievable by a power generation
               unit currently in operation or by any new unit to be built any time in the foreseeable future.
               Eleven existing plants were in the United States and Canada were reviewed. The average
               efficiency for a biomass power generation project is 23% The heal rate for power generation at
               biomass leaders in the industry is between 11,700 B1u/kWh (29.2%) and 20,000 Btu/kWh
               (17.1%).
               Regarding new facilities, the Report concludes that no new existing, financeable. commercially
               proven technology is available to meet the proposed efficiency standards.
               The proposed efficiency standards can only be met by using cogeneration, or Combined Heat
               and Power (so-called "CHP"), which changes the economics of biomass energy from electricity
               only to providing electricity as a by-product of thermal production. An existing facility that
               currently qualifies under the Massachusetts RPS program is not likely to draw a large industrial
               host to the facility and are unlikely to find financing even if such a host were found. . Even
               assuming that new biomass thermal applications could be economically justified given the price
               of competing fossil fuel sources, the distance from the fuel supply and the number of fuel
               deliveries to the plant each day makes such applications highly unlikely.
               District energy applications are unlikely to be built under the proposed requirement.. The
               reason is that the heating load of a District Energy facility is not constant over the year. The
               heating load in the summer is zero; the average annual heat load is about 44% of the winter
               peak. Plants are likely to run only part of the year. For the periods that they do run and meet
               the efficiency requirements, the power generated is reduced to provide the thermal load, which
               results in reduced REC revenue that is insufficient to run the facility profitably.
               The European biomass experience is not directly applicable to the New England market. Feed
               in tariffs, a mature carbon market, long term stable market incentives, and a much higher power
               cost make CHP and district energy projects attractive. None of those factors exist in New
               England today.
               Finally, it is important to note that the literature describing high efficiency power plants is
               misleading. It is important that common terms and definitions are used. The standard in the
               United States is to use Higher Heating Value (HHV) for solid fuel projects. In Europe, Lower
               Heating Value (LHV) is used for calculation of the fuel heating value and plant efficiency.
               Depending on the fuel, there is a 4%-7% difference in the result. So the reported 35% efficiency
                                                             101

               Biomass Technology Review
               is 33% on a HHV basis. Additionally, the efficiency can be reported on a Gross output basis or
               a Net output basis. The Net output is the Gross less the plant auxiliary load. For a typical plant,
               the auxiliary load is 10% - 12% of the total generation. Assuming the reported 35% efficiency
               was based on gross output, LHV basis, the HHV, net efficiency would be less than 30%.
               In summary, using a high efficiency standard for biomass power production is not reasonable,
               lacks economic viability, and assumes European--style markets and subsidies that are not
               found anywhere inthe United States. The result of the proposed efficiency requirement will be
               to eliminate biomass as a ready, dispatchable, renewable energy power resource from the
               existing Massachusetts portfolio of renewable energy, and create a barrier for new biomass
               electricity anywhere in the Commonwealth or the Region.

               Biomass Technology Review
                   I. Introduction
               This report examines the technologies and project economics for biomass power generation
               and cogeneration in the context of a proposed efficiency standard for the Commonwealth of
               Massachusetts. A background of the biomass market in the United States and specifically in
               New England is discussed. A review of current and emerging biomass technologies is
               discussed. Project economics are presented for existing technology to compare power
               generation and cogeneration schemes.

                                (i)    US Biomass Power Market
               The growth of the renewable biomass power generation industry in the United States was a
               direct result of the passage and implementation of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act
               which opened up power generation to independent power producers. A combination of an
               interest in reducing US energy imports. increased imported fuel prices, and a ban on new
               natural gas generation along with the availability of long term power contracts led to the
               construction of many "merchant" (non utility owned) biomass power plants during the 1980's.
               As the fuel for biomass plants was plentiful and obtained at a low cost in rural areas, small
               capacity electric generation plants were installed in many rural areas where a logging and wood
                                                                6

               Biomass Technology Review
               processing economy existed. Although the fuel supply was plentiful. the Btu content was low
               and the fuel had a low density leading to the need to keep the plants relatively small to reduce
               trucking costs which generally limited a plant size to a 10 to 20 MW output that could be
               supported by harvesting operations in an approximate 60 to 75 mile radius. The economics of
               biomass power generation has never been such that trees are cut solely to supply these plants,
               as the cost to harvest the wood far exceeds the value of the fuel to the generator once
               transportation is included. The sale of wood biomass fuel is generally used as a means of
               partially subsidizing the economics of a logging operation that is producing higher grade wood
               for sawmill and wood pulp production. Large amounts of low grade wood fuel are also
               generated during forest management procedures.
               In addition to the standalone biomass electric power generation plants, the regional pulp, paper
               and wood processing industry long present inthe area installed biomass fired steam plants as
               fuel oil prices rose with some electric power generation capacity to primarily supply process
               steam and power for internal use for their processes. Also present at some pulp producing
               facilities are recovery "boilers" that burn a pulping byproduct, referred to as black liquor, as a
               means of chemical recovery and steam generation. Although black liquor is occasionally
               referred to as biomass fuel, the production of it is kept within one site and is part of the pulping
               cycle and therefore is not a viable biomass fuel with respect to regional electric power demand
               beyond load reduction at the facilities that generate it. These plants typically are not a major
               contributor of biomass generated power to the grid and will not be included in the discussion of
               the merchant fleet of biomass power plants in the region.
               Subsequent to the installation of merchant biomass power plants in New England, continued
               deregulation and the discovery of additional natural gas deposits in North America led to a
               building boom of combined cycle natural gas power plants, which in turn led to an overall drop in
               energy prices below those that could be supported by the biomass industry. With a rise in the
               interest in the potential climate change impact of continued fossil fuel generation, the
               Commonwealth of Massachusetts established incentives to encourage generation of an ever
               increasing percentage of their electric power from renewable power sources leading to the
               Massachusetts Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). Given the lack of significant renewable
               power generation currently available in Massachusetts, a market has developed to supply the
               Commonwealth with renewably generated biomass power. Other New England states have also
               imposed RPS standards, each with differing interpretations and required percentages of
               renewable power. Despite the demand for renewable biomass power. there have been few
               merchant biomass power facilities constructed in the region since the 1980's due to lack of
               availability of long term contracts and low prices for natural gas. Recently, with the potential for
               long term incentives for renewable generation, merchant biomass power plants are again being
               proposed although the Nation's inability to place a "price" on carbon that would differentiate
               biomass from fossil fuels is limiting the actual construction of plants. Figure 1 shows the current
               biomass power facilities located inthe ISO New England market. Facilities that are REC
               qualified for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are labeled.

               to reflect system demand. The addition of emergent power generation adds a third component
               to the system which is intermittent. Although capable of generating power when appropriate
               resources, such as sun and wind are available, suitable dispatchable generation capacity or the
               capability to reduce the regional load must be available in case the resources are not available.
               Typically this dispatchable generation is higher cost fossil fueled generation with lower
               efficiency. The ratio of the rated output of power plant and the amount of power that can be
               expected to be generated on a long term basis is generally referred to as the availability of a
               plant. The mature renewable technologies typically have reliabilities in excess of 90% while the
               emergent technologies generally are regarded as less than 10%.
               To date, both emergent technologies are dependent upon large subsidies of various types to be
               economically viable. Although off shore generated wind has the potential to have a higher
               availability, its current deployment and predicted cost makes it a possible future complement to
               the mature renewable technologies, but will not replace them unless there is a radical change in
               the New England Power Market and its ability to control load based on generation availability
               rather than customer demand.
               Currently the region exhibits a long term electric load demand with two seasonal peaks, one
               seasonal peak roughly corresponding to the peak winter heating load and a second major yearly
               peak corresponding to the maximum summer cooling load.
                                 (ii)    The European Biomass Power Market
               The current European biomass power market demand is a mix of demand for combined heat
               and thermal projects along with a growing demand for imported wood pellets to substitute a
               portion of fuel used in coal baseload power plants. Carbon reduction targets, high fossil fuel
               tariffs and an existing large coal based generation fleet have driven up the demand for
               renewably generated biomass power. Large existing district heating systems in many regions
               along with very generous subsidies for renewably generated power of any type, has led to the
               installation of biomass fired combined heat and power facilities optimized to tie into the district
               heating grids. Although district heating grids enable very high fuel utilization efficiency during
               times of adequate heating demand, the renewable electric power generation is a byproduct of
               the demand for heat. The relative scarcity of local wood fuel and high value for renewable fuel
               has led to a far reaching market of sourcing wood products from around the world. Given the
               economic and regulatory climate of shipping a low grade fuel long distances, the majority of the
               imported wood products are converted at the shippers site to wood pellets that allow the siting
               of biomass power plants in urban areas due to the far lower site footprint and local impact albeit
               at afar higher cost to the ultimate consumer.
                                 (iii)   Power Generation versus Combined Heat and Power Plants
                The New England power grid is supplied by power generation-only biomass plants that are
               optimized to maximize electric power production. An alternative to power generation-only plants
               are Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants, where the production of electrical energy is
               balanced with the production of useful thermal energy. When there is a steady demand for both
                                                                 9

               Biomass Technology Review
               thermal and electrical energy, a CHP plant can have higher overall fuel utilization than a
               comparable power- only plant. The vast majority of CHP plants are installed in industrial
               facilities that can generate electricity for less than the cost of purchasing utility power. The
               downside to a CHP plant is that the overall efficiency only remains high it there is use for the
               thermal power generated by the plant. Although there are several variations of CHP plants, the
               majority are set up to supply a thermal load to industrial facilities with electric power produced
               as a byproduct thus linking the power production to the thermal demand of the facility instead of
               to the regional power demand. Generally, the economics of the industrial sites is to remain a net
               user of power with sales of power to the gird only during unusual operational modes.
               CHP plants are also occasionally installed where a small generation capability is installed on the
               outlet of the boiler to generate small volumes of power while dropping the stream pressure from
               a higher pressure to a lower pressure. This is common where there is a small demand for higher
               pressure steam and a much higher demand for lower pressure steam. In the past, there was
               also some value for onsite generation to allow the healing plant to remain operational when grid
               power was not available, but few small generators are equipped with the required equipment to
               perform this task.
               Newer CHP systems are being installed where power is generated from a renewable feedstock
               and the resultant power is credited with Feed-in Tariffs that reward renewable power generation
               that offsets power previously supplied from the grid. Feed-in Tariffs are generally set at a high
               rate to encourage renewable generation. This method has been used quite successfully in
               Europe, although the overall costs have been quite high and most programs have reduced the
               tariffs recently to far lower levels in an attempt to reduce the subsidy cost. CHP units are
               primarily thermal units that have added equipment to generate power while supplying thermal
               demand rather than power plants intended to supply regional power demand. Therefore small
               CHP plants are not expected to contribute substantially to support the regional power demands
               that tend to occur independent of thermal load, leading to limited or no availability during spring
               summer or fall.
                                 (iv)    Conversion of existing Biomass Power Plants to CHP
                                            facilities
               The conversion of a Biomass power plant to CH P purposes would be not be possible for the
               majority of the existing biomass power facilities in New England as there is no large year round
               thermal demand in close proximity to the plants. The plants, as currently configured, would
               require substantial alterations including replacement of the condensing steam turbine in order to
               export significant volumes of thermal energy to an adjacent host facility if one could be found.
                             III. Plant Efficiencies
               There are numerous definitions for efficiency used for the description of conversion of energy.
               As each definition is targeted for a different audience, it is easy to confuse one definition of
                                                                   10

                        A, Efficiencies
               The comparison of process and plant 'efficiencies" is difficult as there are multiple definitions of
               efficiencies. In the US, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers publishes a series of
               Performance test codes that when properly executed can be used to define the efficiency of a
               given th ermn al process and establish the likely un certainty in the results. Barring access to
               standardized testing and an agreed upon test methodology, efficiency comparisons are at best
               a broad approximation and at worse can be abused to make one type of power conversion
               process look better than another. Listed below are some of the more utilized efficiency
               definitions.
                        Heat Rate - This term is typically used in the electric power industry to describe the
                        amount of energy input required to produce a given amount of electric power. The typical
                        English units are BtulkW. Note of all the efficiency definitions listed below, this definition
                        has the useful work output as a denominator. All others use it as a numerator. Therefore
                        as the heat rate reduces, the plant efficiency increases.

                        Carnot Efficiency - TheGCarnot efficiency is the most efficient cycle to convert

               Biomass Technology Review
                    There are two common methods of stating the heat content (Btu of kJ) of fuels. The
                    Higher Heating Value (HHV) takes into account the condensation of byproducts, while
                    the Lower Heating Value (LHV) does not. This reduces the numerical value of Btus for a
                    fuel expressed on a LHV basis. The difference between the two are dependent upon the
                    constituents of each fuel, range from approximately 5% for coal, 10% for natural gas and
                    a typical range of 6 to 7%for biomass fuels. The US power industry typically uses HHV
                    for fuel input in efficiency calculations while the European industry and combustion
                    turbine equipment manufacturers use LHV for fuel heating value basis.
                    It is important that stated plant efficiencies and equipment efficiencies require units.
                    Typical European plant efficiency quotes will have to be adjusted by the heating value
                    ratio of LHV to HHV to be able to compare values with US plant efficiencies.
                    225 CMR 14 does not state if the fuel input will be stated as HHV or LHV which can
                    introduce a 6 to 7% difference in efficiencies.
                    Location for Measurement of Plant Input and Output values
                    The location and definition of the inputs and outputs of a power cycle must be defined
                    precisely and accurately in order to determine a consistent efficiency calculation. The
                    inlet fuel content can vary from the as received moisture content to the moisture content
                    immediately prior to combustion. Fuel content can also be listed as the bone dry content
                    of the fuel ignoring the loss in heating value due to the moisture in the fuel.
                    Third party testing of power plants usually measure the plant revenue meter output for
                    the power output. This reading includes any losses associated with step up transformers
                    required to raise the plant voltage to the grid voltage. Other efficiency measurements
                    may elect to read the power output at the generator leads thus giving a higher than
                    normal plant efficiency. In extreme cases, the plant may not account fully for energy
                    used for internal station loads artificially raising plant loads.
                    Plant output readings at the generator terminals represent the plant's Gross Output.
                    Subtracting the plant auxiliary loads gives the Net Output. The output and efficiency
                    basis (gross or net) should be identified.
                    Merchantable Bio-products
                    The term merchantable bio-products has been introduced into the required plant
                    efficiency for REC qualification. The proposed regulations definition is "For
                    Merchantable Bio-Productsthe product shall be prescribed an energy content based
                    on its enthalpy of reaction, to be approved by the Department, and those units of
                    energy appropriately converted to MWhs",
                    As the standard combustion process is efficient at converting the chemical energy in
                    the incoming fuel to predominately a mixture of oxygen, C02 and water vapor, any
                                                                14

                      merchantable bio-product removed from the power generation process will lead to a
                      reduced power and thermal output.
                      The use of a direct conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy with no
                      factor to account for the conversion efficiency will drive the power producer to
                      bypass power generation in place of merchantable bio-product production as a way
                      of meeting the DOE efficiency standards.
                      As the standard is written, the contribution for merchantable bio-products is 100%
                      versus the contribution for thermal and power are reduced by the cycle efficiency.
                      The result of this will be to increase the biomass input to a facility to generate an
                      equivalent electric output. Given that the biomass resource is fuel constrained due to
                      the economic distances to transport fuel, the net electrical output for each biomass
                      facility will be less.

                            IV.    Technology Discussion
                               A. Steam Rankine Cycle
               The steam Rankine cycle is generally reported to generate 80% of the electric power in the
               world. The efficiency of the Rankine cycle is a factor of the boiler efficiency and the steam cycle
               efficiency. The design of the cycle accounts for the tradeoff between efficiency, capital cost,
               fuel cost, and plant lifetime. Decisions about pressure. temperature, reheat or regenerative
               heating are based on optimizing the project. All projects have an optimum design that is not
               necessarily the highest efficiency. The cycle has been optimized to generate the maximum
               amount of electric power from a thermal supply within cost constraints.
               The three major components are a boiler, steam turbine and the heat rejection system. The
               boiler converts the fuel into thermal energy resulting in superheated steam vapor being sent to a
               steam turbine. Power plants based on this cycle and typical components are designed for
               baseload or daily cycling load operation with the maximum efficiency point occurring at or
               around 85% load. The equipment used is relatively large with a high mass and is prone to
               differential expansion issues when cycled leading to the desire to maintain the plant warm even
               during periods of low demand. The basic components and flows of major constituents are
               shown in Figure 6.
               Steam Generators or Boilers
               There are numerous variations of boilers used to convert the energy in the fuel to steam. Boiler
               design depends on the fuel considered. A boiler designed for gaseous or liquid fuels are
               unsuitable for solid fuels without extensive conversion. Given the smaller size of biomass boilers
               due to the economics of fuel supply, the biomass industry has used relatively straightforward
               designs that are flexible inthe ability to deal with fuel that varies in particle size and moisture
               content. Although the typical biomass fuel moisture content is 45% by weight, the boilers are
               generally designed to accept wide variations in moisture content. The practical limit for
               combustion is approximately 60% moisture content where the energy required to dry and
               combust the fuel is roughly equal to the Btu content of the entering fuel.
               Biomass power generation is usually based on a low value waste products from another higher
               value wood processing operation. Bark, sawdust, lumber ends, agricultural waste are typical
               fuel supplies and there can be a high level of non-combustible constituents entrained in the fuel
               stream that must be accounted for in fuel handling and combustion.
               Biomass boilers must also be able to handle a high level of non burnable constituents that are
               inherent with a low grade fuel resource. This is typically referred to as bottom "ash" which is
               predominately non carbon containing minerals that can be recycled for beneficial use along with
               inert gravel and rocks.

               from the walls and other burning fuel ignite the particles where the combustible constituent's
               burn and any non combustible materials drop to the base of the boiler.
               Given that a typical biomass fuel as delivered is quite high moisture content, this is not a good
               design for biomass use which usually requires the fuel to be introduced to the combustion zone
               from a drying zone.
               Sawmill facilities use this design on occasion to combust sawdust that is finely ground and is
               relatively dry..
                Hearth Type Boilers
               This design is rarely if ever used for modern boilers. Fuel is deposited on a burning bed of coals
               at the base of the boiler via injection ports or air swept feeders. A portion of the combustion air
               is injected under the bed to support drying, partial combustion and gasification. Fine particles
               are carried upwards for subsequent further combustion, while heavy particles remain in the bed
               until they have broken down into smaller particles. Hearth units are occasionally equipped with
               sloped vibrating grates to attempt to distribute fuel and coals somewhat uniformly and allow
               removal of non burnable solids with a manual or automated system. Other systems of this
               configuration are manually cleaned out on a routine basis. The non uniformity of combustion
               leads to emissions controls issues and the labor required for ash removal have led to a
               reduction in their use.
               Grate Boilers
               Grate boilers are defined as either fixed grate or moving grate boilers. A Fixed grate is similar
               to the hearth type boiler. Fuel is added and burned on the grate. The ash is removed by hand
               raking or by the action of new fuel pushing the ash off of the grate.
               A moving grate added at the base of the boiler automates ash removal. The grate continuously
               moves in one direction to assist in spreading of the burning fuel pile and remove non burnable
               ash and inert solids from the bed. These units are typically equipped with air swept feeders that
               attempt to spread the incoming fuel uniformly across the face of the bed. The operation of the
               unit must be adjusted carefully, as un-combusted carbon (char) can be carried past the
               combustion zone of the boiler into the downstream emission equipment. Unburned char reduces
               the boiler efficiency because it is energy added to the boiler that is not combusted.
               There are also some potential issues with the formation of CO unless careful addition of
               secondary air is applied. This design is a relatively economical to install and operate and many
               of the New England biomass units use this design.

               Biomass Technology Review
               Fluidized Bed Boiler
               Bubbling Fluidized Bed Boiler
               Bubbling Fluid Bed (BFB) boilers utilize a heated sand bed in place of grates at the base of the
               boiler. Combustion air is injected under the sand bed at a velocity adequate to partially suspend
               the sand bed in the air so that it responds in a matter similar to a fluid.
               Solid fuel is distributed onto the sand bed, where it partially combusis after drying and
               gasification. The sand in the bed becomes turbulent and heated which acts to break down the
               fuel into small particles on a rapid basis. Non combustible ash and inert solid objects fall to the
               bottom of the bed and are drained periodically using an automated system. The system
               potentially leads to near complete combustion and minimal char carryover to downstream
               equipment. BFB boilers have a higher efficiency than grate type stoker boilers that is somewhat
               offset by higher auxiliary loads for fan power.
               Circulating Fluidized Bed Boilers
               Circulating Fluid Bed (CFB) boilers use a similar concept to the BFB wherein sand is fluidized
               by the addition of high velocity air. Unlike a bubbling bed system where the sand is retained in a
               specific lower zone of the boiler, a CFB unit circulates the hot sand through the entire range of
               the boiler combustion zone. The fuel is in contact with the sand and effective mixing and
               combustion allows good efficiency and low emissions.
               The entrance to the tube section of the boiler is configured with a cyclone or I-Beams to remove
               the sand and char from the gas stream to be recycled back into the furnace. This leads to near
               complete combustion of all burnable carbon in the fuel stream and is of particular value to for
               hard to burn materials.
               The CFB process also is of great value for fuels with contaminants such as sulfur, as lime can
               be injected into the bed for S02 control. Although this technology is very good for coal and solid
               wastes, it is excessive for small facilities burning clean wood fuel and is very capital and
               operationally expensive due to the high levels of erosive wear and high horsepower
               requirements.
               Steam Turbines
               The steam turbine consists of variously configured internal sections that convert the energy in
               steam to mechanical shaft power. Each individual turbine is assembled out of various internal
               sections and optimized to operate under a given range of inlet and outlet conditions. There are
               two major types of turbines and one major variation
               Condensing Steam Turbine
               A condensing turbine is designed to obtain the maximum amount of shaft work out of a given
               steam input. A standalone steam electric generating plant will typically use a condensing turbine
               to maximize the electric power generation. The condensing turbine is typically the second most
                                                                  22

               costly component of a power plant and is designed to operate within specific operational
               parameters.
               A sealed condenser is connected to the discharge of the turbine and operated at a vacuum.
               The turbine exhaust is a mixture of steam and some water droplets discharged from the turbine
               below atmospheric pressure. The discharge pressure is directly related to temperature that the
               condenser cooling water temperature.
               As the theoretical (and practical) efficiency is controlled by the energy difference between the
               inlet steam to the turbine and the turbine exhaust. the efficiency of the cycle is increased as the
               condenser temperature is lowered. Generally this low temperature is supplied by either a
               cooling tower that is dependent on the ambient wet bulb temperature, or a cooling water source
               such as cooling ponds, rivers or ocean. As there are regulatory limits on thermal discharges into
               water bodies, the use of river and ocean cooling is increasingly rare for small power plants.
               Due to the ambient temperature, there is a seasonal change in the plant output and efficiency
               and the cooling water temperature changes,
               Extraction Steam Turbine
               A variation on a straight condensing turbine is an extraction turbine. The extraction turbine is
               designed to allow a designed range of volumes of steam to be extracted from the turbine at
               intermediate pressures prior to the outlet of the turbine to the condenser.
               The steam extraction can be used to supply industrial or commercial processes. The
               regenerative steam cycle uses steam extraction to heat boiler feedwater to improve the
               efficiency of the overall cycle. Many of the current biomass power plants in operation in New
               England have small extraction stages used for feedwater heating to improve the plant efficiency.
               The number of feedwater healing stages is a function of plant size and the tradeoff between
               cycle efficiency and cost.
               Backpressure Steam Turbine
               Backpressure turbines discharge steam at a higher then ambient pressure and temperature,
               generally for use in an industrial or commercial processes. The units are designed to operate
               on 100% superheated. The efficiency of the unit is still constrained by the Carnot Cycle and due
               to the higher pressure discharge a backpressure steam turbine will produce lower amounts of
               mechanical shaft power at a lower efficiency than an equivalent condensing turbine operated at
               the same inlet temperature. Backpressure turbines are generally physically much smaller than a
               similarly rated condensing turbine.
               Heat Rejection
               The condenser used at the exhaust of the steam turbine is a heat exchanger that operates
               below atmospheric pressure. The condenser can be cooled with either a cooling water flow or a
               by air cooling. The majority of the small biomass plants use water for cooling although there are
               some air cooled units in operation inthe region. Most water based systems use cooling towers

               approach the wet bulb temperature of the ambient air.
               The cooling tower depends on evaporation as part of the cooling process and requires water
               makeup to the plant from outside sources.
               An air cooled condenser uses far less makeup water at a cost of the loss of evaporative cooling
               leading to a higher operating temperature than obtainable with a direct cooling tower.

               reduce the water drift and plume from a wet cooling tower.
               A remaining means of cooling traditionally used on larger power plants with access to water
               bodies is the use of once through cooling water. The use of once through cooling is rare in small
               biomass plants due to thermal regulations in effect for most water bodies.
                               B. Gasification
               Gasification is the conversion of solid fuel to gaseous constituents. There are multiple
               variations on the process dependent upon the source of heat and the relative amount of air
               used inthe process.
               Figure 7 illustrates the major variations in gasification technology and their state of
               commercialization. Commercialization is defined that the equipment is available for sale with
               emission and performance guarantees and currently in commercial operation with an availability
               equivalent to commercial generation equipment by a party, other than the manufacturer or
               developer of the technology.
               Small scale under 250 kW units were excluded from discussion due to their low potential impact
               to regional power.

               Gasification Boilers
               Although fuel drying, gasification, combustion, and heat transfer occurs in any solid fuel boiler,
               the term gasification boiler (or gasifier) typically refers to a low output commercial or institutional
               two stage device where one stage heats the solid fuel in the presence of low oxygen levels to
               drive out gases from solid fuel. The resultant gas stream is routed to a refractory lined vessel
               where additional air is injected into the stream to promote complete combustion.
               The high temperature exhaust is routed through a conventional heat transfer device that either
               generates steam or hot water for either power production or heating purposes. Their major use
               is in small biomass fired heating plants as the added complexity over a conventional wood boiler
               is not economic for commercial power generation. An additional use that has proven popular is
               to install a gasifier section upstream of a conventional gas fired boiler in place of the existing
                                                                                       25

               Biomass Technology Review
               gas burners to allow burning solid fuels without and extensive boiler retrofit. A gasifier
               conversion allows retention of a majority of the boiler structure when switching to wood fuel.
               Synthesis Gas or Liquid Gasifiers
               Although wood fired gasifiers have been in use prior to the 1940's the technology was
               substantially abandoned thereafter. The gaseous fuel stream produced by the earlier design
               direct gasifiers, generally referred to as synthesis gas, had a very low Btu content, high moisture
               levels and contained condensable tars. The condensable tars caused downstream deposits and
               the liquids resulting from the moisture and condensed tars were generally corrosive and would
               now be considered hazardous waste. This technology was developed and used predominately
               in areas where conventional liquid fuels were in short supply and fell out of favor rapidly once
               conventional fuel supplies became available. There are still some third world Use of this
               technology, generally in areas with excess biomass and little or no emission regulations.
               An advanced level of this technology has remained in limited use in South Africa on coal fueled
               plants as a means of generation of various products including chemical feedstocks and fossil
               fuel replacements. By the use of the Fischer Tropsch process. numerous chemical feedstocks
               can be selectively produced, although typically the cost is such that conventional feedstocks are
               less costly. Currently in the research or near commercial category are improved versions for the
               conversion of solid fuel to gaseous or liquid constituents by thermal breakdown. The driver for
               the resurgence is related to the use of renewable resources in place of fossil fuels for a
               feedstock which makes the resultant products qualified for significant incentives.
               Most of the effort on current gasification technology is to improve the gas treatment systems to
               produce a higher energy density fuel, low in moisture without condensable tars and
               contaminants. Small scale units tend to incorporate equipment to sub-cool the synthesis gas
               stream and attempt to filter out the resultant condensables, thus forming liquid hazardous waste
               streams. Larger scale units use high temperature catalysts to convert the tars to gaseous forms
               that will not condense or form deposits.
               This technology is currently pre-commercial, nearing full scale trials for small scale biomass
               fired combined heat and power plants based on internal combustion (IC) engines that are below
               the economical sizing of conventional biomass plants. These units generally require a higher
               grade of wood and sizing criteria compared to conventional biomass facilities. Nexterra Systems
               Corp 'has sold several full scale trial ICbased units and is nearing commercial production.
               Nexterra reports efficiency near 60% but the available published data does not identify whether
               the efficiency is gross or net and whether it is based on LHV or HHV.
               There are pre-commercial attempts at the use of synthesis gas to fire conventional gas turbines.
               To date there are no existing long term commercial applications with publically available
               performance results.
               Although there are multiple uses and configurations for synthesis gas or liquids, the literature,
               indicates a range of conversion efficiencies from solid wood to usable synthesis gas at a 60 to
                                                                 26

               Biomass Technology Review
               80 percent efficiency7 when fed 20% moisture content biomass. Some processes are capable of
               operation at higher moisture content. albeit at a lower cycle efficiency. When used as a
               feedstock for power generation this puts synthesis gas at an upfront disadvantage as the 20 to
               25 percent of the inlet energy which has been used to produce the synthesis gas will lead to
               lower cycle efficiency than obtainable with natural gas or liquid fuels.
               It is important to note that most advanced cycles that use gasifiers require low moisture wood
               and that drying wood to supply the unit is not included in the efficiency quoted.
               Pyrolysis Systems
               A subset of gasification systems are pyrolyzers that use either direct or indirect heal generally at
               a lower temperature range to drive off volatile gases or liquids from the biomass feedstock.
               There are physical differences between a gasification and pyrolysis. In general though,
               processes that operate between 3000 C and 600t are considered pyrolysis. Processes over
               600G are considered gasification. The temperature and time determined the percentage of
               char, liquid, and gas that is produced.
               The volatile gases or liquids from the fuel can be processed to form merchantable bio-products.
               Dependent upon process conditions, a combustible char product can be produced that can
               either be used to heat the process or can be marketed as a constituent of a product called 'bio
               char" or "bio-coal". When Bio-char is mixed with an appropriate blend of organic wastes it is
               means of low cost carbon sequestration and is used as a soil amendment. There is no currently
               viable market for this product beyond the demand for research.
               Another product of pyrolysis can be a product referred to as bio-oil. Bio-oil can be burned
               directly in some industrial or commercial boilers or used as a chemical feedstock for higher
               value products. It is potentially a competitor to rural biomass power plants in that a high value
               product can be processed local to a waste wood source and transported in a denser form to
               other markets. The NH Office of Planning commissioned a study "New Hampshire Bio
               Opportunity Analysis" ' to discuss the commercialization of the technology. Although it is
               promising from a standpoint of biomass utilization, the process is a net energy user and it is not
               likely to be a contributor to the regional renewable power generation market.
               Dynamotive Energy Systems has a full scale pilot fast pyrolysis system that generated
               commercial quantities of char and a liquid fuel referred to as Bio-Oil. The plant was shut down,
               but is reportedly scheduled to restart in the 41hquarter of 2010. Conceivably this plant could
               integrate a power generation cycle, although the company appears to be marketing the products
               of pyrolysis as high value products.
               An alternate merchantable bio-product process that has garnered some regional publicity is
               Maine Bio Products 'QBiofine process which uses a pyrolysis reaction along with other
               technology to produce chemical feedstocks from the lignin component of the biomass. In
               addition to the high value chemical feedstocks, char is produced as a byproduct. Although
                                                                 27

               Biomass Technology Review
               another promising biomass use, the process is a net energy user unlikely to contribute to the
               regional renewable power generation market.
               Both of the prior processes and a host of others do not have commercial facilities in place nor
               are they operational. They are unlikely to be net producers of regional electricity in New
               England.
               Gasifiers for the production of Merchantable Bio-products
               As discussed in the introduction section, given that the combustion process is quite efficient at
               converting the chemical content of the fuel to gaseous byproducts, the removal of merchantable
               bio-products from a power or CHP cycle will reduce the plant output since the energy inthe fuel
               is removed from the process and is not used for power generation. Although the
               Commonwealth's proposed regulation is written to address the generation of renewable power,
               it has the indirect effect of incentivizing the generation of merchantable bio-products at the
               expense of power generation.
                                C. Gasificationfor Gaseous or Liquid Fuel Cycles
               The use of synthesis gas is not yet commercialized for most direct combustion purposes there
               is much discussion of this potential in the literature. Using internal combustion engines with
               biomass gasifiers for CHP is close to commercial production. If the technical and economic
               hurdles are overcome to convert wood synthesis gas into a clean usable gaseous fuel with
               adequate properties for use in direct combustion devices, gas and liquid synthesis streams
               could become the fuel supply for several power generation cycles. Fuel supply limitations and
               capital cost considerations limit the construction potential until there is a substantial, stable, long
               term incentive for the production of renewable power. That said, the technology is not currently
               commercialized.
               Figure 8 shows expected efficiencies and commercialization status of the major gasification
               cycles when operated on biomass synthesis gas.

               Biomass Technology Review
               powered electric and thermal is applied; and incentives are available to offset the initial capital
               cost. There are inherent limitations in the internal design of this type of gasifier that limits the
               efficient output to an internal dimensional limitation and therefore generation of large amounts of
               electrical power must be accomplished in multiple units thereby limiting the economy of scale.
               The best fit for this technology is currently for onsite "behind the fence" generation in one to two
               MW gross electrical output blocks
               Simple Cycle Combustion Gas Turbines
               There currently are no CTG's that could be located in commercial long-term use operating on
               synthesis gas. Although the application is similar in concept to an IC application, CTG systems
               are a better fit for large scale power generation as CTG's are offered in a wide range of sizes
               and have a very small equipment footprint for the equipment electrical output. These systems
               will require the use of a different configuration gasifier in order to operate at the higher CTG fuel
               flow requirements. They are much simpler to operate than a steam Rankine cycle and do not
               require licensed personnel to operate. The limitations to the CTG are the tight internal
               tolerances and fuel quality specifications. CTG's are more susceptible to fuel deposits than IC
               engines.
               Simple Cycle Micro turbines
               A subset of conventional CTG's that compete with IC engines are micro turbines (generally less
               than 1 MW) offered by several manufacturers. These units are typically intended for behind the
               fence applications where there is constant thermal demand. Although there are units rated for
               low Btu syngas, there are no commercial systems offered at this point that integrate a gasifer
               with fuel conditioning and the turbine in one package. Although the units are rated for syngas,
               their fuel quality requirements are considerably more stringent that IC engines.
               Micro turbines are highly susceptible to fuel contamination making operation on synthesis gas
               difficult without extensive upstream conditioning and filtering. Given the low Btu content syngas
               from wood waste and the significant number of processing steps to generate syngas of
               sufficient quality to operate a micro-turbine it is doubtful if the capital and operational costs for
               this technology will be attractive in the near future.
               Heat Recovery from CTG units
               The resultant exhaust heat from the units can be directed through a heat recovery device that
               generates either steam or hot water. The exhaust temperature from either device is in the range
               of 800"F to 10000 F dependent upon actual configuration.
               Combined Cycle Plants
               Natural gas fired Combustion Turbine Combined Cycle (CTCC) plants are a cost effective, high
               efficiency technology for use with natural gas or liquid fuels. The main driver is the development
               of high efficiency CTG's . Given the increase in CTG and CTCC efficiency, the availability and
               pricing of natural gas, and the ability to quickly permit and construct facilities, a large number of
                                                                  30

               Biomass Technology Review
               cycling and baseloaded units have been installed across the country over the last decade. Like
               a simple cycle gas or liquid plant, the fuel is combusted in a CG and the hot CTG exhaust gas
               energy is recovered in a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) to generate high pressure
               steam where h is converted to power with a condensing steam turbine.
               CTG inlet combustion temperatures are combined with the far lower (near ambient) discharge
               temperatures of the steam Rankine cycle leading to a high overall plant electric generation
               capacity. These plants are intended as electric power generation plants, as any thermal energy
               extracted above the steam turbine condenser temperature will lead to a reduced cycle
               efficiency. Typical efficiencies range from 40% to over 60% (LHV).
               The tradeoff for this design is that the plant complexity increases from a simple cycle plant as
               there are two power generation cycles required. The plant size is most economical between
               250 MW and 1500 MW. Although, there are extensive CTG based cogeneration plants located
               in the United States.
               Large 250 MW biomass based CTCC plants would be too large to be fueled economically from
               renewable waste wood supplies, as the radius of required fuel supply area would exceed the
               range where the fuel and resources required to haul the fuel would exceed the fuel value of the
               wood. Smaller plants could be built, but the capital cost per MW increases as the plant
               becomes smaller. Commercial application of the CTCC to biomass will require advances in hot
               gas cleanup to ensure the plant can operate reliably.
                                D. Other Power Generation Cycles
               There are numerous alternative power cycles mentioned inthe literature. Generally, however,
               they are a variation on current cycles. Many are in the early development scale, so published
               actual long term operational and efficiency data is not readily available.
               Sterling Cycle Power Plants
               A technology that is mentioned often in the literature is the Stirling cycle, generally referred to as
               an "external combustion engine" or occasionally a "heat engine". The cycle uses an internal
               working fluid that is heated and cooled externally to generate power. It is a heat engine and
               constrained by the Carnot cycle with similar internal frictional characteristics as IC engines. The
               major advantage to the cycle is the ability to uses a variety of heating and cooling sources to
               generate power. As combustion is external to the engine, the fuel quality should potentially allow
               a lower grade of fuel to be burned to heat the unit. Although long mentioned as a possible
               future power generation cycle due to its theoretical efficiency and fuel flexibility, to date it has
               been notoriously difficult to commercialize. Currently the major use of Stirling generators are for
               solar to electric power generators with one large scale deployment in operation inthe US west
               with another recently approved for California. There have been niche applications being
               developed for microscale CHP use with one commercial unit made by Whispergen" in
               production.

                Biomass Technology Review
               Organic Rankine Cycles
               Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems utilize low boiling point fluids as an alternative to steam
               in a conventional Rankine cycle. By using organic fluids with low boiling points, the ORC system
               can capture waste heat from other sources and generate electric power.
               The ORC unit is a Rankine cycle, and its efficiency is constrained by the Carnot cycle. The
               primary value of an ORG unit is for dealing with relatively low temperature waste heat sources
               that are too low to economically generate power with conventional steam systems. ORC
               equipment, manufactured by Turboden," is currently used in European pellet manufacturing
               processes where large volumes of relatively low temperature heat are required. When matched
               with an appropriate thermal demand, this equipment reportedly has high overall fuel utilization
               efficiency, well above competing technologies. Although capital intensive, the combination of
               high feed-in tariffs and high cycle efficiencies appears to be economically attractive in the
                European market for wood pellet production. In the US, ORC is being used for geothermal
               power plants and is being advocated for use as low temperature heat recovery units. Currently
               the low efficiency and high capital costs of small scale equipment have restricted the use to
               subsidized pilot applications.
               Entropic Cycles
               There is little publically available information on this power cycle. The Entropic Cycle appears
               to be targeted for similar small electrical output applications as Organic Rankine Cycles. The
               claimed thermal conversion efficiency is 71%, with a 194 deg F thermal outlet temperature. It
               appears to be a thermodynamic concept with no reported pilot of commercial installation.
               Fuel Cells
               Although a fuel cell is not a thermal cycle, it is capable of generating energy from a chemical
               fuel stream leading to the technical possibility of the operation of a fuel cell from a biomass
               gasifier stream.
               Current fuel cell technology is oriented towards the use of hydrogen as a fuel source, with
               upstream reformer technology used to separate the hydrogen from the carbon molecules to
               allow use of hydrocarbon fuels. Current systems in use are highly susceptible to catalyst
               "poisoning" requiring careful high levels of contaminant removal upstream of the cell. Dependent
               upon the reformer technology used, either C02 or CO is formed as result of reforming. These
               two compounds generally act as "poisons" in the catalysts used inthe fuel cell and therefore
               high fuel purity is required. The proton exchange and solid oxide fuel cells both operate at
               relatively low temperatures and therefore the thermal output is too low for most applications
               There are research scale fuel cell technologies including Direct Methanol Fuel Cells that can
               burn methanol which can be produced via biomass gasification and reforming. There are two
               variations of fuel cells, Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells and Solid Oxide Fuel cells that have the
               capability of processing CO directly. Both technologies are inthe pre-commercial phase for
                                                                   32

               characteristics that generally require blending of the fuel and extensive processing equipment to
               remove non burnable contaminants and resize fuel to within a range of sizing that can be
               metered successfully into the boiler.
               As the fuel input requirements of the boiler decreases to smaller boiler systems, the fuel
               characteristics must be more uniform. The recommendations for small scale school thermal only
               boiler systems installed in many Vermont school districts14 has led to the recommendation that
               only bole tree chip or residuals from specific manufacturing operations be used for fuel. Ifthis
               experience is applied to potential future installations of small biomass CHP units in
               Massachusetts, this will tend to drive the market for CHP quality chips to a higher grade more
               uniform and costly wood product than the biomass product currently used by the merchant
               plants. As this higher grade wood is in demand for wood pellet manufacturing applications, the
               cost will inevitably increase, and lower grade biomass will be underutilized.
                             VL      CogenerationDiscussion
               Thermal Demands for Waste Heat
                In order to generate electricity in a thermal process, low temperature thermal energy must be
               removed from the power generation process. Ifthere is demand for the thermal energy, the
               temperature and quantity of the thermal demand will establish the lower operating temperature
               of the power generation cycle. There are two options for thermal demand-- industrial processing
               and district Heating and cooling. Thermal demand is directly linked to the power generation of
               the system. If the thermal demand decreases and there is no other way to remove heat from the
               system, power generation will decrease.
               Industrial Processing
               The demand for thermal energy at industrial facilities' is as variable as the industries
               themselves. A broad generalization is that the majority of thermally intensive processes use
               steam to directly heat processes and reactions, with the maximum process temperature
               required generally setting the temperature from the boiler (or turbine extraction).
                Intermediate, heat transfer fluids may be used internal to the process, but generally the heat
               transfer fluids are heated directly by steam from a central boiler. In some processes, gas fired
               infrared radiant heaters or electric resistance heat is used in specialized areas, generally in
               facilities with no central heating plant.

               and cooling demand that is dependent upon the outside temperature. Space heating and
               cooling will be discussed in detail in the district heating section.
               At times, regulatory policies and energy costs have made the installation of cogeneration
               systems at industrial sites attractive and there are many large facilities that have contracted with
               third parties to install these systems as the expected rates of return for power generation does
               not typically match up with the expected rates of returns for industrial processes.
               Building a cogeneration system adjacent to the manufacturing facility presents a power
               developer a long term issue in that the design and operation of the power generation facility is
               dependent upon an external party, the owner of the industrial process. Ifthe industrial process
               shuts down, the power plant project economics may be substantially affected 5 . In general, the
               linkage of a power facility to a specific manufacturer introduces significant long term investment
               risk into the decision to build a cogeneration plant.
               District Heating and Cooling
               Outside of internal use by the power plant for the processing and production of merchantable
               bio-products, the potential use of this thermal energy is generally directed at the space heating
               needs of adjacent structures. The distribution of heating for space thermal demands is generally
               referred to as District Heating (DH) systems. There is also potential to provide cooling in a
               district energy system. generally referred to as District Cooling, although low operating
               efficiencies, high capital cost and the thermal constraints imposed on CHP plants makes this a
               less attractive option in most areas except for high density cooling loads.
               District heating systems are capital intensive and require dense, urban scale applications to be
               cost effective. In less dense applications, heavy infrastructure subsidies are required for DE to
               be cost effective. The capital requirements and location is directly contrary to the fuel needs and
               the operation of a typical biomass power plant which requires significant acreage for fuel
               storage and processing along with extensive truck deliveries. Like many industrial operations,
               operating on a 24 hour per day, 350 day basis, a biomass plant is typically not compatible with
               the residential and light commercial activities in a many cities.
               Implementation of a new district heating system is difficult as there is little incentive for potential
               customers to make use of the service when there is a substantial upfront cost to convert existing
               heating systems to operate with district heating. Infrastructure issues are substantial as the
               systems need to be installed in either public right of ways or on negotiated right of ways over
               private property. There are reliability concerns that must be overcome until multiple combustion
               units are in place and connected to the system to allow some redundancy to cover unexpected
               power outages of thermal sources.
               There are two forms of DE systems in common use, High Temperature and Low Temperature.

               High Temperature District Heating
               District energy systems were developed and still in use in some urban cities in the United
               States. The systems in operation are high temperature systems that use steam. The steam is
               routed to primarily commercial and governmental facilities in city centers, using insulated steam
               and return condensate pipes. Each facility served by the system is connected to the district
               system via two underground pipes, one carrying steam into the building and one carrying
               condensate back to the district energy plant. The underground infrastructure for these systems
               is capital extensive and can be a major issue in the installation or extension of systems in any
               but dense urban areas with access to low cost capital.
               Steam used by the customer is condensed and returned via a smaller diameter pipe back to the
               district heating plant for reuse.
               Building cooling can be provided with additional piping from a central plant or with remote the
               installation of absorption type cooling units, although their economic use is generally restricted
               to high value commercial applications due to absorption chillers low efficiency and capital cost.
               The advantage of absorption chillers is the balanced steam load year round.
               The market for district heating in college campuses is driven by the initial capital cost of the
               system balanced against the reduced need for maintenance of individual building heating
               systems.
               High temperature systems are generally fed by multiple boilers to provide seasonal load
               adjustment and maintain system reliability.
               Low Temperature District Heating
               Low temperature district heating systems use hot water for heat transfer to the district's
               customers. Unlike a high temperature system. the water temp is generally inadequate for use as
               driver for absorption cooling which substantially reduces any opportunities for summer thermal
               load demand. The use of hot water in place of steam requires larger diameter supply and return
               piping for an equivalent heat load. The system temperature is constrained by the use of pre
               insulated engineered thermoplastic piping systems that have lower installation costs and
               installation requirements than steam piping used in high temperature systems. The possible
               lower installation costs are offset by increased pumping costs and the need for either smaller
               heating plants placed close together or the use of hybrid systems, using separate dedicated
               steam lines to reheat the low temperature water systems.
               The development of low temperature district heating is dependent upon a significant amount of
               regulatory incentives, fossil fuel tariffs, carbon reduction incentives and building design
               standards to be cost effective. Combinations of these have been put in place at differing levels
               in the European countries that are actively maintaining and installing these systems. Each
               country uses a different combination of publicly owned or user owned systems. A combination
               of incentives and penalties on the government's part provide support for these systems.
               Although the incentives/penalties vary by country the following issues have to be addressed
                                                                   36

               Biomass Technology Review
               Low temperature district heating system temperatures do not support the use of fin tube
               radiation (typically used in many existing New England homes and commercial properties),
               unless an electric heat pump system is used to raise the water temperature. A combination of
               regulatory requirements, high energy costs and building standards, have been used in Europe
               to encourage/require installation of radiant type heating systems that are capable of operation
               at much lower source temperatures, thus reducing the need for heat pumps. Retrofitting an
               existing structure with radiant type heating is expensive and is a cost born by the building
               owner. Most US commercial systems also require higher temperature source water and will
               require either a heal pump to raise the water temp or the replacement of the heating coils inthe
               HVAC units.
               The overall heating demand per customer needs to be as low as possible to reduce the size of
               the installed district heating infrastructure. High tariffs on fossil heating fuels and building codes
               that require minimal energy usage generally have been used in Europe to drive the heating
               demand down per unit volume. The current regulatory approach inthe US has been limited to
               voluntary incentives to encourage upgraded efficiency. Although building efficiency standards
               are now in place in most New England areas, the majority of new construction tends to be in low
               density rural settings with the core of the housing stock in urban areas consisting of older less
               energy efficient systems.
               Governmental support/ownership of district heating systems is generally required to subsidize
               the high capital costs and low investment returns. Regulatory incentives including "must
               connect" requirements and heating fuel utilization efficiency requirements create an incentive for
               high customer participation.
               Impact of District Heating Thermal Loads on Electric Power Generation
               As shown in Figure 10, a typical central Massachusetts heating and cooling degree days and
               the ISO electric load are plotted for a typical year.
               The thermal heating demand for the Worcester Massachusetts based on the Worcester airport
               data varies widely from a winter peak to a summer period with no heating demand. Worcester
               Mass. was selected as it is near the center of the state and therefore should be representative
               of the typical thermal demand curve for the state. The thermal loads and the ISO NE power
               demand are shown as the percentage of the monthly peak demand for purposes of comparison.
               If the demand for summer time cooling is added to the thermal demand there is some summer
               load, although supplying this summer cooling demand would require the use of a high
               temperature district heating system to supply adequate temperature levels to supply absorption
               type cooling units. The high temperature system increases increase the outlet temperature of
               the accompanying power generation cycle in a CHP plant, and reduces the plant efficiency .
               Given this wide variation in thermal demand, the demand for useful thermal energy from a
               district heating system is very limited during the periods of the highest summer time load
               demand.

               Biomass Technology Review
               In a district heating application The lack of a continuous thermal load demand over the yearly
               makes it financially unattractive to connect a CHP to a district heating network as it will only be
               able to receive REC incentives during times of high thermal demand inthe winter, early spring
               and late fall. It will be unable to receive REC incentives during summer periods when the
               demand for power is the highest.
               As the power demand will remain during summer periods, fossil fueled power generation plants
               will have to generate additional power to compensate for the lack of renewable CHP produced
               power.

               Biomass Technology Review
               Biomass Project Economics
               The project economics for a biomass facility are directly related to size and scale of the biomass
               power plant. The key aspects of biomass power generation are the project size and the fuel
               cost. Fuel cost is largely transport distance dependent. The plant size determines the capital
               that can be directed toward efficiency.
               New England Biomass Plants
               Large biomass power generation facilities have better economies of scale. However, larger
               units are designed to a different standard compared with small units. An optimum size for a
               biomass power generation facility is about 50 MW. Most of the existing biomass power plants in
               New England are 15 MW to 30 MW. A list of biomass power generation facilities is shown in
               Table 1. Note that Boralex Stacyville was not listed in the database.

               The most recent biomass project is Snowflake in Arizona. The project was completed in 2007.
               The project costs are reported to be $2,200/kW with used, reconditioned equipment.
               New, 50 MW projects have reported an EPC cost of over $4,000/kW7
               A comparison of plant costs in 2003 versus 2008 is shown in Figure 11

               Biomass Technology Review
                   -    Biomass is expensive to handle and transport. Coal is an energy dense
                        fuel with a heating value of about 12,500 Btu/lb (AR). Wood has a low
                        heating value of about 4,400 Btu/lb (AR) assuming a 50% moisture
                        content. On a per volume basis wood is about 1/3 the energy density of
                        coal. Moving biomass by truck adds transport cost that makes project
                        economics difficult for long houl distances.
                   -    Large utility sized fossil plants can take advantage of scale. The larger
                        fossil facilities have better economics due to better fuel cost, higher
                        efficiency, and reduced staff.
                   -    Coal plant efficiency is demonstrating incremental efficiency gains with
                        high temperature, high pressure, and double reheat supercritical Rankine
                        cycle designs and advanced Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle
                        (IGCC) designs. The highest reported efficiency for a coal fired ultra
                        supercritical steam generator is 42.5%.
                   -    Improvement of biomass cycle efficiency is in a nascent stage and is not
                        available on a commercial or economic scale. Even if a biomass plant
                        could reach 42% efficiency, advanced cycle design is not economically
                        attractive for small biomass facilities competing with natural gas,
                        combined cycle based power prices in the market.
                   -    Biomass boiler efficiency is limited due to the moisture content of the fuel.
               Biomass Pricing and Delivery
               Biomass power generation is limited to the availability of biomass. A typical facility is based on
               the available wood that can be reasonably harvested within transport range of the plant. A
               typical biomass project is 15 MW to 30 MW in size based on the wood available within a region.
               A typical economic radius for a biomass plant is 75 miles. Beyond 75 miles. the transport costs
               raise the cost of fuel and the resultant cost for electric power produced by the plant. As an
               example the raw wood cost is typically $4.00 to $10.00 per ton. Harvesting is $12/ton to
               $18/ton. Assuming a transport cost of $0.10 per mile (round trip) a 75 mile radius adds $15 per
               ton to the fuel cost. For comparison, the average delivered biomass price is assumed to be
               $30/Ton as Received (AR). Assuming 40% moisture the delivered fuel price is $50/Ton (BDT)
               Large biomass facilities are feasible where substantial biomass resources are available, or
               where transportation such as rail makes additional fuel available, albeit at a higher overall
               handling cost. The optimum plant size is generally considered to be 50 MW. Larger 100 MW
               plants have been proposed where fuel is available. Within the 15 MW to 25 MW size, there is a
               balance between technology cost, fuel cost, and plant cost.
               An additional issue for biomass power plant location is delivery of fuel. Normally, fuel is
               delivered using truck transport. The number of trucks per hour can be an issue in urban areas.
               A 50 MW biomass plant requires about 70 truckloads per day or 140 trips.
                                                                 41

               Biomass Technology Review
               Rail delivery eliminates the truck transport issue but requires multiple fuel handling steps that
               increase the delivered fuel cost.
               Biomass PlantEfficiency
               A survey of biomass plants in the United States indicates that the heat rate for power generation
               at biomass leaders inthe industry was between 11,700 Btu/kWh (29.2%) and 20,000 Btu/kWh
               (17.1%). Eleven plants were reviewed in the United States and Canada. The Average
               efficiency was 14,840 Blu/kWh (23%).
               The actual operating efficiency of a plant is not the same as the design efficiency. Variables
               such as the fuel moisture content and ambient temperature have an effect on the plant
               efficiency. The actual plant efficiency may be +/- 3% from the average.
               The best reported efficiency for a biomass steam plant is 35%. The plant costs are not readily
               available. K6nigs Wusterhausen was placed into operation in year 2003. The facility is a 20
               MW reheat cycle with a reported gross efficiency of 36.4%. This efficiency should be examined
               to ensure that the reported efficiency is on the same basis as used inthe United States.
               Comparing US reported efficiency with European facilities requires adjustment for:
                    -  The US uses Higher Heating Value (HHV) compared with the European Lower Heating
                       Value (LHV). This is typically 6 to 7%difference which leads to a 6 to 7% overstatement
                       of efficiency as compared to US.
                    -  Gross efficiency does not account for the plant electrical load (parasitic load). Net output
                       is the gross output less the plant auxiliary load. This value varies by plant design but a
                       general range is 10% to 15% of gross output is consumed for plant loads.
                    -  The fuel moisture was not reported. Often European designs are based on low moisture
                       content biomass fuel of 20%, compared with New England typical biomass moisture
                       content of 40% to 50%.
               The net efficiency for the Konigs Wusterhausen facility is expected to be 29% % (HHV) or
               (11769 Btu/kWh).
               Cost data for Kbnigs Wusterhausen is not available. However, the plant was partially
               subsidized, received carbon credits, and is in a power market that has a residential rate of E21.1
               ($0.30/kWh). The plant received a E7.71 feed in tariff exclusive of other credits for low carbon
               generation.
               The Biomass IGCC at Varnamo, Sweden (CHRISGAS) is a small 6 MW electric, 9 MW
               thermal pressurized, CFB plant operated and was mothballed in 2000. The unit is not
               commercially operating. It's history is limited to 3,600 hours of operation. The reported electric
               efficiency was 32% (LCV) and would be equivalent to 30% (HHV).
               The major issue with the facility was the hot gas cleanup system. Similar issues were
               experienced with the FERCO gasifier in Burlington, VT.

               Biomass Technology Review
               Project costs were not reported however, it was noted that the facility was shut down due to
               poor economics. The facility is currently used for Research and Development (R&D) for gas
               synthesis projects
               Applying cogeneration or CHP will reduce the plant's electric efficiency but will increase the net
               overall efficiency since the thermal load is fully counted inthe equation. A 25 MW power
               generation plant efficiency is shown in Figure 12. The base plant has an efficiency of 27% with
               a condensing steam turbine. As extraction is increased, the electric efficiency drops because
               the same fuel heat input generates less power. The net efficiency increases to a maximum of
               75% which is equivalent to a backpressure steam turbine. The reduction in output is shown in
               Figure 13.

               Biomass Technology Review
               Each plant isdiscussed below. The evaluation for each plant is based on the following
               assumptions:
                   -   Market power rate is assumed to be $100/MWh.
                   -   Massachusetts REC pricing is assumed to be $20/MWh
                   -   Steam sales price assumed to be $8.5/1000 lb.
                   -   Fuel price is assumed to be $30/Ton (AR)
                   -   Boiler efficiency for the large plant is assumed to be 80%
                   -   Boiler efficiency for the small plant is assumed to be 70%
                   -   Plant auxiliary load is assumed to be 10%.
                   -   Thermal heat for CHP is based on average Worcester, Massachusetts
                       Heating Degree Days. The average annual therma| oad is assumed to be
                       44.5% of the peak thermal load.
                   -   Although absorption chilling can be used, no cooling using thermal plant
                       output is assumed
                   -   Plant availability is assumed to be 90%.
                   -   Calculations are based on single year estimates with comparison before
                       taxes, depreciation, amortization (EBITDA).
                   -   The projects are assumed to be developed with 50% equity and 50% debt.
                       The equity return is 15% over 15 years and the debt is assumed to be 8%
                       over 15 years.
               A summary is shown in Table 3.
               Biomass Power Generating Case
               The power generation case is based on a new 25 MW condensing Steam Turbine Generator
               plant similar to the base case. The project cost is $4,000/kW or $107 million. Project
               development is assumed to be 5% of the EPC cost for the project.
               The EBITDA return for a new biomass power generation facility is -14.4%. This is driven by an
               annual cost of capital of $16 million.
               Biomass Cogeneration Facility
               The same size facility as the base case is assumed to be developed adjacent to a large
               industrial steam customer. The steam turbine is an auto extraction steam turbine with an
               extraction port at 150 psig. An annual average steam load of 140,000 lb/h at 150 psig is
               exported from the facility. The plant electric efficiency drops to 14.8% but the net efficiency
               increases to 61.1%. The electric output from the plant is reduced to 13.9 MW from 26 MW.
               MASS RECs are available for the 15 MW.

               Small Biomass Combined Heat and Power
               A small CHP plant is examined relative to the base case. The boiler size is reduced to 50,000
               lb/h, 450 psig/6000 F with a backpressure STG exhausting to process at 50 psig. The net output
               is 1.6 MW. The electric efficiency is 8.2% and the net efficiency is 39%.
               The EBITDA return is -107.5%
               Thermal Only Plant
               The last case examined is a small thermal only plant. The boiler is the same size as the
               previous case. The plant efficiency is equal to 75%, equal to the boiler efficiency (not including
               the auxiliary electric load needed to run the plant). The EBITDA return for this project is -150%.
               Small Thermal Plant (Heating Plant)
               A small 5,000 lb/h, 10 psig heating plant is assumed for the last case. The steam price remains
               at $8.50 per 1000 lb. Assuming that the boiler efficiency remains at 75%, The EBITDA is
               250%.
               Regulatory Risk
               Project financing can be at risk in an uncertain regulatory environment, Government funding and
               programs can be uncertain or changed. Current federal and State incentives programs such as:
                    -  Production Tax Credits
                    -  BCAP
                    -  Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)
                    -  Accelerated depreciation
                    -  Grants
               dramatically affect the market and project development. In today's capital markets, there is
               scarce private capital beyond the developer's own seed capital, making it a difficult environment
               in which to start and fund a new project.
               Comparisons are often made with European markets and biomass utilization. In addition to the
               differences described above, the absence of carbon credit/tax market is significant. To develop
               a European model one should expect:
                    1. Development of district heating/cooling market through required
                       connection to an urban district energy system. Forcing heating users to
                       connect to the district energy system and mandating equipment design
                       for heating (and cooling).

               Biomass Technology Review
               Conclusions
               Biomass power generation is a dispatchable power supply that uses waste wood to generate
               power. Development of any efficiency standard for Renewable Power Credits should be
               carefully evaluated in light of existing technology and available power markets.
               The proposed 40% minimum efficiency limit, which allows for 50% of the REQ, is well above
               the efficiency of any of the merchant biomass based power plants currently in operation inthe
               regional market. The only possible method of achieving the proposed efficiency standards is by
               installing large industrial steam hosts, which is highly unlikely. Finding a steam host, building an
               industrial facility, and altering the biomass power plant to deliver steam is not a reasonable
               proposition. It is not expected that any of the current facilities could be upgraded in this manner,
               thus leading to the removal from the market of the current biomass renewable fleet currently
               part of theMassachusetts renewable portfolio.
               For new facilities, the proposed requirement is equally unrealistic. The proposed 60% minimum
               efficiency limit for 100% RPS qualified generation does not appear to be based on current
               commercialized technologies. A 60% efficiency criterion is outside of the published limits of
               systems that are in pilot or research scale . Advanced biomass power generation technology will
               not meet even the minimum 40% criteria to receive RECs. . The net effect is that the proposed
               efficiency requirements will eliminate biomass as a renewable energy source for
               Massachusetts.
               . A 60% efficiency requirement can only be achieved by developing new cogeneration. As the
               thermal load is increased to meet the net efficiency requirement, the electrical output is reduced,
               lowering the electric power available to obtain REC's. The reduced incentive will adversely
               impact project economics. Moreover, such opportunities are unlikely to be pursued, given the
               challenges associated with siting large biomass facilities adjacent to industrial locations and
               issues with fuel transport in local communities, and the limited ability to find credit worthy steam
               hosts.
               That leaves smaller CHIP opportunities, which have financial returns that are not attractive, and
               thermal-only applications that are both unattractive and do not generate electricity under the
               RPS.
               In summary, using a high efficiency standard for biomass power production is not reasonable,
               lacks economic viability, and assumes European-style markets and subsidies that are not found
               anywhere inthe United States. The result of the proposed efficiency requirement will be to
               eliminate biomass as a ready, dispatchable, renewable energy power resource.
                                                                 50
