   ABSTRACT
   A lock and latch assembly that is to be installed on a door. The assembly has inner and outer
   actuators, and a latch with a tongue that is movable between an extended position and a
 5 retracted position. The tongue is displaceable by rotation of either inner or outer actuator.
   The assembly has a first lock cylinder with a keyed barrel, and a deadbolt that includes a bolt.
   The first lock cylinder is operable to displace the bolt between an extended position and a
   retracted position. A snibbing mechanism includes an inner portion that includes a manually
   operable snibbing actuator, an outer portion that has a first outer hub that is rotationally fixed
10 to the outer actuator, a second outer hub that is rotationally fixed to the barrel of the first lock
   cylinder, and an outer slide plate.                         The first outer hub and outer slide plate have
   complementary engaging members, wherein the outer slide plate is movable between a free
   position, and a blocking position in which rotation of the outer actuator is prevented. An
   intermediate drive connects the inner portion to the outer slide plate. The snibbing actuator is
15 operable to cause the snibbing mechanism to transfer a movement from the inner portion
   through the intermediate drive to the outer slide plate so as to move the outer slide plate into
   the blocking position. The outer slide plate is movable from the blocking position into the free
   position by a rotation of the barrel of the first lock cylinder that causes the deadbolt
   mechanism to move the bolt from the extended position to the retracted position.

   Field of the invention
 5                   The present invention relates to a lock and latch assembly for a swinging door fitted
   within a doorway of a building.
   Background
                     It is known to fit a lock or latch to a swinging doorwithin a doorway of a building. The
10 lock or latch is used to retained the door in a closed position.
                     A latch has a mechanism that is mounted to, or within, a door, the mechanism
   including a spring-loaded retractable (sliding) tongue that in its rest state protrudes outwardly
   from the side edge of the door that is opposite the door hinges. A strike plate is mounted on
15 the door jamb that surrounds the doorway. When the door is in the closed position,
   engagement of the tongue with a hole (or similar structure) in the strike plate holds the door
   from opening until a user actuates the latch. Typically, the latch also has an actuator on one
   or both of the internal and external sides of the door that a user can operate to cause the
   latch mechanism to withdraw the tongue, which disengages the tongue from the strike plate,
20 such that the door can be opened. The tongue of a latch has a ramped profile such that
   contact on the inclined face causes the tongue to be automatically retracted upon closure and
   contact with the strike plate.
                     In the most simple form of latch, the mechanism is configured such that a user can
25 operate the mechanism to withdraw the tongue at all times by rotation of the actuator on
   either side of the door. In other words, this type of latch cannot be locked to prevent
   actuation of the latch mechanism by one or both actuators. This type of latch is known as a
   "passage set".
30                   In some applications, it is desirable to have a latch that can be placed in a "passage
   mode" in which the latch is operable to retract the tongue by either actuator, and a "privacy
   mode" in which the latch is operable to retract the tongue by the inner actuator but not the
   outer actuator. A latch that can be placed in these two modes is

                                                -2
   known as a "privacy set". A privacy set has a manual turn snib, push button, or the like
   on the inner side of the door that a user operates to place the latch in its privacy mode.
   However, for safety reasons, it is preferable that the latch mechanism is configured such
   that, when in privacy mode, the actuating the inner actuator to retract the tongue causes
 5 the latch to return to its passage mode, so that the outer actuator is released to retract the
   tongue upon actuation.
            Further, it is known to provide a key cylinder on the outer side of a privacy set,
   such that a user with an appropriate key can operate the latch from the outer side to
10 retract the tongue, even when in privacy mode.
            While latches are convenient in domestic / residential applications, they are known
   to have limited security, even when in a privacy mode. To this end, a credit card (or the
   like) can be pushed between the door edge and the door jamb to apply a lateral force
15 against the inclined face of the tongue, which forcibly retracts the tongue and enables the
   door to be opened. This type of forced entry is known as a "credit card attack".
            A higher level of security can be provided to the door by installing a deadbolt, in
   addition to a latch. A deadbolt has a mechanism that is mounted to, or within, a door.
20 The mechanism includes a bolt that can be extended to protrude outwardly from the side
   edge of the door. However, the bolt shape is such that it can only be extended to engage
   its strike plate after the door is closed.   Further, the bolt shape prevents the bolt from
   being retracted by a lateral force, for instance by a credit card attack.           Deadbolt
   mechanisms use a key cylinder on the outer side of the door to extend / retract the bolt.
25
            Providing a door with independent latch and deadbolt mechanisms has the
   benefits of enabling the door to be latched closed, of providing security against a credit
   card attack, and also of minimal cost. As will be apparent, a door with a privacy set, and
   an independent deadbolt is only workable if the privacy set has a key cylinder, and this
30 configuration has two separate key cylinders on the outer side of the door.            This is
   undesirable for cost, complexity, usability and appearance considerations.

                                                 -3
           Accordingly, there is a need to address the above, and/or at least provide a useful
   alternative.

                                                   -4
                     apart such that the outer actuator is rotatable, and a blocking position in
                     which the complementary engaging members engage one another such
                     that the outer slide plate prevents rotation of the outer actuator;
                             an intermediate drive that is connected to the inner portion and to
 5                   the outer slide plate,
            whereby the snibbing actuator is operable to cause the snibbing mechanism to
   transfer a movement from the inner portion through the intermediate drive to the outer
   slide plate so as to move the outer slide plate into the blocking position,
            and whereby the outer slide plate is movable from the blocking position into the
10 free position by a rotation of the barrel of the first lock cylinder that causes the deadbolt
   mechanism to move the bolt from the extended position to the retracted position.
            In at least some embodiments, the inner portion of the snibbing mechanism
   includes an inner hub that is rotationally fixed to the inner actuator, and a transfer member
15 that is connected to the intermediate drive,

   whereby the outer slide plate is movable from the blocking position towards the free
   position by a rotation of the inner actuator that causes the tongue to move towards the
20 retracted position.
            Preferably, the transfer member is an inner slide plate that is connected to the
   intermediate drive,
            wherein movement of one of the inner and outer slide plates is transferred through

30 Detailed description
           Figures 1 and 2 show a lock and latch assembly 10 that is installed on a door D.
   The assembly 10 includes an inner actuator 12 on an inner side of the door D, and an

                                                 -9
   outer actuator 14 on an outer side of the door D. The outer side of the door D is shown in
   Figure 1, and the inner side of the door D is shown in Figure 2.
            The assembly 10 includes a latch 16 that includes a latching mechanism (not
 5 shown), and a tongue 18. The tongue 18 is connected to the latching mechanism within a
   latch housing 20 (shown in Figure 3) of the latch 16. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the
   latch 16 is installed in a latch hole (not shown) that is formed in the edge E of the door D,
   and parallel to the major faces of the door D. The latch 16 has a face plate 22 that retains
   the latch 16 in latch hole. The latch mechanism structure and function will be well known
10 to the person skilled in the art, and is not germane to this disclosure. The tongue 18 is
   movable between an extended position (shown in Figures 1 and 2), and a retracted
   position in which the tongue 18 is approximately flush with the face plate 22. The latching
   mechanism includes a spring (not shown) to bias the tongue 18 towards the extended
   position. In this particular embodiment, each of the inner and outer actuators 12, 14 is
15 each connected to the latching mechanism by a respective spindle (not shown) that
   extends between that actuator and the latch mechanism.           The latching mechanism is
   operable to displace the tongue 18 towards the retracted position by rotation of either
   inner or outer actuator 12, 14.
20          The lock and latch assembly 10 includes an outer sub-assembly that is to be
   installed on an external side of the door D, in the manner shown in Figure 1. Further, the
   lock and latch assembly 10 includes an inner sub-assembly that is to be installed on an
   internal side of the door D, in the manner shown in Figure 2.
25          The assembly 10 also includes a first lock cylinder 24 that is disposed on the outer
   side of the door D. The first lock cylinder 24 has a keyed barrel 26 that is accessible from
   the outer side of the door D. In this particular embodiment, the assembly 10 also includes
   a second lock cylinder 28 that is disposed on an inner side of the door D. The second
   lock cylinder 28 has a keyed barrel 30 that is accessible from the inner side of the door D.
30 It will be appreciated that in some alternative embodiments, the second lock cylinder can
   be omitted.

                                              -10
           The assembly 10 further includes a deadbolt 32 that includes a deadbolt
   mechanism (not shown), and a bolt 34.          The bolt 34 is connected to the deadbolt
   mechanism within a deadbolt housing 36 (shown in Figure 3) of the deadbolt 32. As
   shown in Figures 1 and 2, the deadbolt 32 is installed in a deadbolt hole (not shown) that
 5 is formed in the edge E of the door D. The deadbolt hole is parallel to the major faces of
   the door D, and is also parallel to, but spaced apart from, the latch hole. The deadbolt 32
   has a face plate 38 that retains the deadbolt 32 in deadbolt hole.            The deadbolt
   mechanism structure and function will be well known to the person skilled in the art, and is
   not germane to this disclosure.
10
           The tongue 18 and bolt 34 will each co-operate with a respective strike plate
   mounted in a door jamb surrounding the door D. When one or both of the tongue 18 and
   bolt 34 is in its extended position and also engaged with the respective strike plate, the
   door D is retained in a closed position. Further, when the door D is in a closed position
15 and both the tongue 18 and bolt 34 are in their retracted positions, the door D is free to be
   opened.
           The bolt 34 can be displaced between an extended position (shown in Figure 3),
   and a retracted position (shown in Figures 1 and 2) in which the bolt 34 is approximately
20 flush with the face plate 38 (shown in Figures 1 and 2).         To this end, the deadbolt
   mechanism is connected to the first and second lock cylinders 24, 28 by either a single,
   shared spindle, or an individual spindle (not shown) that extends between the respective
   lock cylinder and the deadbolt mechanism. Rotation of the keyed barrel 26, 30 of either
   first or second lock cylinder 24, 28 displaces the bolt 34 between the extended and
25 retracted positions.
           An outer trim plate 40 is mounted against the major surface of the door D on the
   outer side, and an inner trim plate 42 is mounted against the major surface of the door D
   on the inner side, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Each of the outer and inner
30 trim plates 40, 42 have an actuator aperture 44, and each of the outer and inner actuator
   12, 14 extends through the actuator aperture 44 in the respective outer and inner trim
   plates 40, 42. Further, each of the outer and inner trim plates 40, 42 have a lock cylinder
   aperture 46, and each of the first and second lock cylinders 24, 28 extend through the

                                                - 11
   lock cylinder aperture 46 in the respective outer and inner trim plates 40, 42. The inner
   trim plate 42 includes a button head aperture 48, which will be described in further detail
   below.
 5          The assembly 10 includes a snibbing mechanism 50 (shown in Figure 3) that
   includes an inner portion 52, an outer portion 54, and an intermediate drive 56. An inner
   cover plate 58 retains the inner portion 52 of the snibbing mechanism 50 beneath the
   inner trim plate 42, as shown in Figure 6. To this end, the inner cover plate 58 is secured
   to the internal side of the inner trim plate 42, and the inner trim plate 42 is concave so as
10 to define an internal cavity within which the inner portion 52 of the snibbing mechanism 50
   is disposed. Similarly, an outer cover plate 60 retains the outer portion 54 of the snibbing
   mechanism 50 beneath the outer trim plate 40. The outer portion 54 is also within an
   inner cavity of the outer trim plate 40.
15          The inner portion 52 includes a manually operable snibbing actuator, which in this
   embodiment includes a button head 62 shown in Figure 2. The button head 62 is shaped
   so as to be able to protrude outwardly of the inner trim plate 42, and through the button
   head aperture 48. Thus, the button head 62 is accessible for actuation by a user.
20          The outer portion 54 of the snibbing mechanism 50 has a first outer hub 64 that is
   rotationally fixed to the outer actuator 14. The first outer hub 64 is disposed between the
   outer trim plate 40 and the outer cover plate 60.        Further, the outer portion 54 has a
   second outer hub 66 that is rotationally fixed to the barrel 26 of the outer lock cylinder 24,
   and an outer slide plate 68.        The first outer hub 64 and outer slide plate 68 have
25 complementary engaging members. In this particular embodiment, the first outer hub 64
   has two engaging members that are both in the form of radially projecting tabs 70. The
   engaging member on the outer slide plate 68 is in the form of a keyway 72 formed in an
   upper end of that plate 68. As will be evident from the description that follows, only one of
   the two tabs 70 is used for engagement with the keyway 72 at any one time, depending
30 on the selected handing of the assembly 10.
            The outer slide plate 68 is movable between a free position and a blocking
   position. In this particular embodiment, the outer slide plate 68 is slidable in a direction

                                                 -12
   that is radial with respect to the rotational axis of the first outer hub 64. As will be evident,
   particularly from Figures 10, 15 and 22, the outer trim plate 40 has guides 74 that are
   disposed laterally of the outer slide plate 68, and constrain the movement of the outer
   slide plate 68.    When the outer slide plate 68 is in its free position, the tab 70 is spaced
 5 apart from the keyway 72 and the outer actuator 14 is rotatable. When the outer slide
   plate 68 is in its blocking position, the tab 70 engages the keyway 72, and by this
   engagement the outer slide plate 68 prevents rotation of the outer actuator 14.
            Figures 7, 10, 11 and 22 show the outer slide plate 68 in its free position.
10 Figures 12, 15 and 16 show the outer slide plate 68 in its blocking position, with one of the
   tabs 70 located within the keyway 72. As will be evident, when the outer slide plate 68 is
   in the blocking position, the outer actuator 14 is effectively locked against rotation, so that
   the outer actuator 14 cannot be operated to withdraw the tongue 18 of the latch 16.
15          The intermediate drive 56 connects to the inner portion 52 of the snibbing
   mechanism 50 to the outer slide plate 68.          By virtue of the intermediate drive 56, a
   movement of the snibbing actuator is transferred to the outer slide plate 68 so as to move
   the outer slide plate 68 into the blocking position. In other words, the snibbing actuator is
   operable to cause the snibbing mechanism 50 to transfer a movement from the inner
20 portion through the intermediate drive 56 to the outer slide plate 68. To this end, in this
   particular embodiment, it is the movement of the button head 62 being depressed that
   leads to movement being transferred through the intermediate drive 56 to the outer slide
   plate 68. Thus, depressing the button head 62 initiates movement of the inner portion 52.
   This chain of movements will be described in further detail below.
25
            As will be described in further detail below, the outer slide plate 68 is movable
   from the blocking position into the free position by a rotation of the barrel 26 of the first
   lock cylinder 24 in a direction that causes the deadbolt mechanism to move the bolt 34
   from the extended position to the retracted position. Accordingly, if the outer slide plate
30 68 is in the blocking position, the action of rotating the barrel 26 of the first lock cylinder
   24 in a direction that would cause the deadbolt mechanism to retract the bolt 34
   simultaneously operates the snibbing mechanism 50 so as to move the outer slide plate
   68 away from the blocking position. Sufficient rotation of the barrel 26 causes the outer

                                                -13
   slide plate 68 to move into the free position, thus freeing the first outer hub 68 and the
   outer actuator for rotation. If the bolt 34 is the retracted position and the outer slide plate
   68 is in the blocking position, rotating the barrel 26 of the first lock cylinder 24 in the
   direction that would cause the deadbolt mechanism to retract the bolt 34 will operate the
 5 snibbing mechanism 50 so as to move the outer slide plate 68 away from the blocking
   position.   In this embodiment, in the event that the outer slide plate 68 is in the free
   position, a rotation of the barrel 26 of the first lock cylinder 24 produces no corresponding
   movement in the snibbing mechanism 50.
10          When the outer slide plate 68 is in the free position, both inner and outer actuators
   12, 14 are operable to retract the tongue 18 of the latch 16. In this way, the assembly 10
   is in a passage mode (subject to the bolt 34 being in the retracted position), and a person
   can withdraw the tongue 18 to open the door D. When the outer slide plate 68 is in the
   blocking position and the tongue 18 is within the strike plate, the outer actuator 14 cannot
15 be operated to retract the tongue 18 of the latch 16.
            The inner portion 52 of the snibbing mechanism 50 includes an inner hub 76, and
   a transfer member, which in this embodiment is in the form of an inner slide plate 78.
   The inner hub 76 is rotationally fixed to the inner actuator 12.          The inner hub 76 is
20 disposed between the inner trim plate 42 and the inner cover plate 58.
            The inner slide plate 78 is connected to the intermediate drive 56. By virtue of this
   connection, movement of the inner slide plate 78 is transferred through the intermediate
   drive 56 to the outer slide plate 68. Accordingly, when the outer slide plate 68 is in the
25 free position, the inner slide plate 78 is in a first position. Further, when the outer slide
   plate 68 is in the blocking position, the inner slide plate 78 is in a second position. Thus,
   the inner slide plate 78 is movable between the first and second positions.               In this
   particular embodiment, the inner slide plate 78 is slidable in a direction that is radial with
   respect to the rotational axis of the inner hub 76.        As will be evident, particularly from
30 Figures 4, 9, 14 and 19, the inner trim plate 48 has guides 80 that are disposed laterally of
   the inner slide plate 78, and constrain the movement of the inner slide plate 78.

                                                -14
            Figures 7, 9, 11, 17, 19 and 20 show the inner slide plate 78 in its first position.
   Figures 12, 14 and 16 show the inner slide plate 78 in the second position.
           When the outer slide plate 68 is in the blocking position, the inner slide plate 78 is
 5 in the second position, whereupon the inner slide plate 78 is in contact with the inner hub
   76.   The outer slide plate 68 is movable from the blocking position towards the free
   position by a rotation of the inner actuator 12 that causes the tongue 18 to move towards
   the retracted position. In this embodiment, the inner hub 76 includes a lobe 82 that bears
   against a contact surface 84 of the inner slide plate 78 during a rotation of the inner
10 actuator 12 that moves the inner slide plate 78 from the second position towards the first
   position.
           When the lobe 82 is in contact with the contact surface 84, rotation of the inner
   hub 76 (by rotation of the inner actuator 12) provides a camming effect, which moves the
15 inner slide plate 78 towards the first position. As will be evident from the Figures, at least
   part of the contact surface 84 is convex. This facilitates movement of the inner slide plate
   78 with rotation of the inner hub 76.
            It follows that, when the outer slide plate 68 is in the blocking position (and the
20 inner slide plate 78 is correspondingly in the second position), a user can rotate the inner
   actuator 12, which rotates the inner hub 76 and - by virtue of the contact between the
   lobe 82 and the inner slide plate 78 - causes the inner slide plate 78 to move away from
   the second position.      In turn, the movement of the inner slide plate 78 is transferred
   through the intermediate drive 56 to the outer slide plate 68. Thus, the movement of the
25 inner slide plate 78 away from the second position causes the outer slide plate 68 to
   move away from the blocking position. With sufficient rotation of the inner hub 76, the
   outer slide plate is moved into the free position.
           When the outer slide plate 68 is in the blocking position, the inner actuator 12 is
30 operable to drive the outer slide plate 68 to the free position. Simultaneously with this
   rotation of the inner actuator 12, the latch mechanism is operated to retract the tongue 18.
   Accordingly, the inner actuator 12 remains operable to retract the tongue 18 of the latch
   16, whether the outer slide plate 68 is in the blocking position or the free position. In this

                                               -15
   way, the assembly 10 can be placed in a privacy mode (subject to the bolt 34 being in the
   retracted position), in which a user can withdraw the tongue 18 to open the door D by
   rotation of the inner actuator 12, but the outer actuator 14 cannot be used to withdraw the
   tongue 18.
 5
            In this particular embodiment, the inner hub 76 has two lobes 82. Only one of the
   two lobes 82 is positioned to work against the inner slide plate 78 at any one time,
   depending on the selected handing of the assembly 10.
10          The outer portion 54 of the snibbing mechanism 50 includes a pin 85 with an
   external threaded portion. The pin 85 is to be secured into one of two threaded pin holes
   86 formed in the outer slide plate 68. The necessary pin hole 86 into which the pin 85 is
   secured depends on the handing of the assembly 10 that is selected during installation.
15          The second outer hub 66 includes a radially projecting arm 88. The pin 85 is
   positioned in either pin hole 86 such that rotation of the first (outer) lock cylinder 24 in a
   direction corresponding with the bolt 34 being withdrawn to its retracted position causes
   the arm 88 to rotate towards the pin 85.        If the outer slide plate 68 is in its blocking
   position, the rotation of the second outer hub 66 (by rotation of the barrel 68 of the first
20 lock cylinder 24) brings the arm 88 against the pin 85. Further rotation of the second
   outer hub 66 drives the outer slide plate 68 away from its blocking position.             With
   sufficient rotation of the second outer hub 66, the outer slide plate 68 will be moved into
   its free position. By virtue of the connection through the intermediate drive 56, the inner
   slide plate 78 will be moved into its first position, whereupon the pivot bar 87 pivots to
25 bring the catch 89 into engagement with the shoulder 90 on the inner slide plate 78.
            The inner portion 52 includes a pivot bar 87 that includes the button head 62, and
   a catch 89, which in this embodiment is positioned at the upper end of the pivot bar 87.
   The inner slide plate 78 includes a shoulder 90 and, when the inner slide plate 78 is in the
30 first position, the catch 89 engages the shoulder 90 to hold the inner slide plate 78 in the
   first position.

                                                 -16
            In this embodiment, the pivot bar 87 has the general shape of an inverted "Y". At
   the lower end of the pivot bar 87 and on each leg of the forked portion, the pivot bar 87
   includes a pivot pin 92. Each of the two pivot pins 92 is located in seats 94 formed on the
   internal side of the inner trim plate 42. The inner cover plate 58 retains the pivot pins 92
 5 in their respective seats 94. The button head 62 is positioned intermediate the upper and
   lower ends of the pivot bar 87.
            The pivot bar 87 is biased by a pair of springs 96 such that the catch 89 is urged
   into engagement with the shoulder 90. The springs 96 are positioned between the pivot
10 bar 87 and the inner cover plate 58, and work to bias the pivot bar 87 away from the inner
   cover plate 58. Thus, when the inner slide plate 78 is in the first position, the catch 89
   engages the shoulder 90, and retains the inner slide plate 78 in the first position. When in
   this configuration, the button head 62 sits proud of the inner trim plate 42, as shown in
   Figures 8, 11, 18 and 21. The button head 62 can be manually depressed by a user to
15 release the inner slide plate 78 from engagement with the catch 89.
            The inner portion 52 of the snibbing mechanism 50 further includes a spring 98
   that biases the inner slide plate 78 towards the second position.          The spring 98 is a
   torsion spring, and has one end that works against the inner trim plate 42 and another
20 end that locates in a slot in the inner slide plate 78, so as to generate the biasing force. In
   addition, the spring 98 is Accordingly, when the inner slide plate 78 is in the first position
   and the catch 89 is moved out of engagement with the inner slide plate 78, the spring 98
   drives the inner slide plate 78 out of the first position and towards the second position.
   This movement of the inner slide plate 78 is transferred through the intermediate drive 56
25 to cause a corresponding movement of the outer slide plate 68 from the free position
   towards the blocking position. If the tab 70 of the first outer hub 64 is in the appropriate
   orientation, the outer slide plate 68 will continue to move into the blocking position,
   whereupon the tab 70 is located within the keyway 72 (and the inner slide plate 78 is in its
   second position).
30
            In addition, in this embodiment, the outer portion 54 of the snibbing mechanism 50
   further includes a spring 100 that biases the outer slide plate 68 towards the blocking
   position. The spring 100 is a compression spring that works between the outer trim plate

                                                -17
   40 and the outer slide plate 68 to generate the biasing force. Accordingly, when the outer
   slide plate 68 is in the free position and the catch 89 is moved out of engagement with the
   inner slide plate 78, the spring 100 drives the outer slide plate 68 out of the free position
   and towards the blocking position.
 5
           When the inner slide plate 78 is in its second position, the catch 89 rests against
   the face of the inner slide plate 78 that faces the inner cover plate 58, and is also held in a
   position that is displaced towards inner cover plate 58. Accordingly, the button head 62 is
   held in a depressed position relative to the inner trim plate 42, as shown in Figures 13
10 and 16.
           As will be appreciated, the position of the button head 62 is indicative of whether
   the assembly 10 is in a passage mode or a privacy mode.
15          In this embodiment, the intermediate drive 56 includes an inner cylinder 102, an
   outer cylinder 104, and a connecting bar 106 that extends into each of the cylinders 102,
   104. One end of the inner cylinder 102 is captured between the inner trim plate 42 and
   the inner cover plate 58. In this embodiment, the opposing end of the inner cylinder 102
   protrudes inwardly through an aperture 59 in the inner cover plate 58. The inner trim
20 plate 42 has a boss 43 that protrudes into the inner cylinder 102. Rotation of the inner
   cylinder 102 is constrained by the boss 43 on the inner trim plate 42 and the aperture 59
   formed in the inner cover plate 58.
            In a similar manner, one end of the outer cylinder 104 is captured between the
25 outer trim plate 40 and the outer cover plate 60. In this embodiment, the opposing end of
   the outer cylinder 104 protrudes inwardly through an aperture 61 in the outer cover plate
   60.   The outer trim plate 40 has a boss 41 that protrudes into the outer cylinder 104.
   Rotation of the outer cylinder 104 is constrained by the boss 41 on the outer trim plate 40
   and the aperture 61 formed in the outer cover plate 40.
30
            Each cylinder 102, 104 is hollow, and the apertures (of the cylinders 102, 104) are
   shaped such that the connecting bar 106 rotationally engages with each cylinder 102,
   104. In this way, the cylinders 102, 104 and connecting bar 106 are configured to rotate

                                               -18
   in unison. The connecting bar 106, and the cylinders 102, 104 form a key-and-keyway
   coupling.
           The inner cylinder 102 projects through an elongate hole 108 in the inner slide
 5 plate 78. As shown most clearly in Figure 4, the inner cylinder 102 includes a radially
   spaced arm 110 that locates in a slot 112 formed in the inner slide plate 78. The slot 112
   intersects the elongate hole 108. By this arrangement, rotation of the inner cylinder 102
   causes translation of the inner slide plate 78.
10         Similarly, the outer cylinder 104 projects through an elongate hole 114 in the outer
   slide plate 68.    As shown most clearly in Figure 5, the outer cylinder 102 includes a
   radially spaced arm 116 that locates in a slot 118 formed in the outer slide plate 68. The
   slot 118 intersects the elongate hole 114.       By this arrangement, rotation of the outer
   cylinder 104 causes translation of the outer slide plate 68.
15
           The connecting rod 106 has a head portion 120, and a shaft portion. As shown in
   Figure 11, the head portion 120 is formed on the end of the connecting bar 106 that is
   disposed in the hollow portion of the outer cylinder 104.         The head portion 120 is
   sufficiently broad that it is unable to pass through the aperture formed in the end of the
20 outer cylinder 104. In addition, the intermediate drive includes a compression spring 122
   that extends between the outer trim plate 40 and the head portion 120. The compression
   spring 122 biases the connecting bar 106 away from the outer trim plate 40.           In this
   embodiment, both the head portion 120 and the compression spring 122 are captured
   within the outer cylinder 104. Accordingly, the outer cylinder 104 and connecting bar 106
25 form part of the outer sub-assembly of the assembly 10.
            In this particular embodiment, the shaft portion of the connecting rod 106 has a
   rectangular cross section, in a plane that is perpendicular to the rotational axis of the
   connecting rod 106. The connecting rod 106 has a tip end portion 121 that is formed at
30 the opposing end of the shaft portion to the head portion 120.            In the illustrated
   embodiment, the tip end portion 121 narrows in the width direction of the shaft portion.
   The tip end portion 121 is shown most clearly in Figure 5. Within the outer sub-assembly,
   the tip end portion 121 provides a "free end" of the connecting rod 106.

                                               -19
           In some alternative embodiments, the tip end of the connecting rod may have an
   alternative shape. For example, the tip end may have a flat, or substantially flat, leading
   edge. Alternatively or additionally, the tip end may have chamfered or curved corners
 5 between the leading edge and the narrow side edges of the connecting rod.
           The end face of the inner cylinder 102 in which the aperture is formed is concave.
   During installation of the assembly 10 on the door D, the outer sub-assembly is first
   mounted on the door D, with the connecting bar 106 projecting through a hole formed
10 through the door. The inner sub-assembly is then mounted on the door D, during which
   at least the tip end portion 121 of the connecting rod 106 is to be passed through the
   aperture, and into the inner cylinder 102. The concave end face of the inner cylinder 102
   and the tapered shape of the tip end portion 121 both facilitate movement of the free end
   of the connecting rod 106 towards the aperture, and then into the inner cylinder 102.
15
           The inner and outer cylinders 102, 104 and the connecting rod 106 have lengths
   that facilitate the assembly 10 being mounted on a range of different door thicknesses.
   To this end, the compression spring 122, together with the lengths of the inner and outer
   cylinders 102, 104 facilitate the intermediate drive being self-adjusting to accommodate a
20 door thickness that is within the pre-determined range, and less than the maximum door
   thickness.
           Figures 7 to 11 show the components of the assembly 10 with the outer slide plate
   68 in the free position, and the inner slide plate 78 in the first position.      Hence, the
25 assembly 10 is in the passage mode, because either inner or outer actuators 12, 14 are
   rotatable to withdraw the tongue 18 of the latch 16. As is evident from Figures 7, 9 and
   11, the catch 89 engaged with the shoulder 90 of the inner slide plate 78 to retain the
   inner slide plate 78 in its first position. In this configuration, the pivot bar 87 adopts a
   position that has the button head 62 proud of the inner trim plate 42. Thus, from this
30 configuration of the assembly 10, a user can depress the button head 62 to release the
   assembly 10 from passage mode so as to change the state towards the privacy mode.

                                                 -20
           As shown most clearly in Figure 10, when the outer slide plate 68 is in the free
   position, there is a clearance between the upper end of the outer slide plate 68 (which is
   proximate the first outer hub 64) and the first outer hub 64. Accordingly, if the assembly
   10 is in the passage mode, and the outer actuator 14 is rotated to withdraw the tongue 18
 5 and simultaneously the button head 62 is depressed to release the inner slide plate 78
   from engagement with the catch 89, the outer slide plate 68 will be moved from its free
   position towards its blocking position (by virtue of movement of the inner slide plate 78
   from its first position towards its second position, and the connection between the two
   slide plates 68, 78 through the intermediate drive 56). In this configuration, the projecting
10 tab 70 (which is to engage the keyway 72 in the privacy mode, as determined by the
   selected handing of the assembly 10) may not be aligned with the keyway 72. Should this
   occur, rotation of either the actuator 12, 14 that corresponds with extension of the tongue
   18 from the side edge E of door D may cause the outer slide plate 68 to move towards the
   free position. However, due to the clearance, the outer slide plate 68 will not reach its
15 free position, and also the inner slide plate 78 will not reach its first position. Once the tab
   70 and keyway 72 become aligned, the outer slide plate 68 will be able to move into the
   blocking position with the tab 70 engaged in the keyway 72.
            Figures 12 to 16 show the components of the assembly 10 with the outer slide
20 plate 68 in the blocking position, with the tab 70 engaged within the keyway 72. Further,
   the inner slide plate 78 is its second position. Hence, the assembly 10 is in the privacy
   mode, because the outer actuator 14 cannot be rotated to withdraw the tongue 18 of the
   latch 16. However, the inner actuator 12 is rotatable to withdraw the tongue 18, and also
   to drive the assembly 10 out of the privacy mode and into the passage mode.
25 Alternatively, the first (outer) lock cylinder 24 can be rotated in a direction corresponding
   with the bolt 34 being withdrawn to its retracted position, which will also drive the
   assembly 10 out of the privacy mode and into the passage mode. It will be appreciated
   that the bolt 34 can be in either its extended or retracted position for this rotation to have
   the effect of driving the assembly 10 out of the privacy mode and into the passage mode.
30
            Figure 16 shows a portion of the assembly 10 in vertical cross section, with the
   assembly 10 in the privacy mode. The tip of the catch 89 bears against the inner side of
   the inner slide plate 78, and this causes pivot bar 87 to be pivoted, with the catch 89

                                               -21
   displaced towards the inner cover plate 58. Consequently, the button head 62 is held
   inward of inner trim plate 42.
            Figures 17 to 19 show the components of the assembly 10 in a configuration in
 5 which the inner actuator 12 is rotated to approximately the maximum in a direction that,
   for the illustrated handing of the inner sub-assembly, would cause the latch mechanism to
   retract the tongue 18. Accordingly, the lobe 82 that is in contact with the contact surface
   84 has caused inner slide plate 78 to move to its first position, and the catch 89 is
   engaged with the shoulder 90. As is evident from Figure 17, this rotation of the inner
10 actuator 12 has caused the outer slide plate 68 to move to its free position.
            Figures 20 to 22 show the components of the assembly 10 in a configuration in
   which the keyed barrel 26 of the first (outer) lock cylinder 24 is rotated to approximately
   the maximum in a direction that, for the illustrated handing of the outer sub-assembly,
15 would cause the deadbolt mechanism to retract the bolt 34 to the retracted position. The
   second outer hub 66 has rotated with barrel 26. Accordingly, the arm 88 of the second
   outer hub 66 is in contact with the pin 85, and the rotation has caused outer slide plate 68
   to move to its free position. As is evident from Figure 20, this rotation of the second outer
   hub 66 has also caused the inner slide plate 78 to move to its first position, and the catch
20 89 is engaged with the shoulder 90.
            As previously described, the assembly 10 can accommodate either left- or right
   handed handing so as to suit a desired application.        Each of the inner and outer trim
   plates 42, 40 has the letters "L" and "R" embossed on its internal surface.            In this
25 particular embodiment, each of the inner and outer actuators 12, 14 is lever, or "blade".
   During installation, the handing of the assembly is to be set so that a user presses down
   on the respective actuator 12, 14 to cause the latch mechanism to retract the tongue 18.
            Each of the inner and outer trim plates 42, 40 includes an "L"-shaped lever
30 handing stopping block 124 that is secured to the respective trim plate 42, 40 by a screw
   126. For the inner sub-assembly of the assembly 10, the stopping block 124 provides a
   limit stop for the inner actuator 12 to prevent over-rotation of the inner actuator 12 in the
   direction that would correspond with the tongue 18 being moved towards its extended

                                                - 22
   position. To this end, the lobe 82 of the inner hub 76 that is remote from the inner slide
   plate 78 abuts the stopping block 124 of the inner sub-assembly to prevent this over
   rotation.
 5         Similarly, for the outer sub-assembly of the assembly 10, the stopping block 124
   provides a limit stop for the outer actuator 12 to prevent over-rotation of the outer actuator
   14 in the direction that would correspond with the tongue 18 being moved towards its
   extended position. To this end, the tab 70 of the first outer hub 64 that is remote from the
   outer slide plate 68 abuts the stopping block 124 of the outer sub-assembly to prevent this
10 over-rotation.
           Each of the inner and outer actuators 12, 14 has a neutral position that is taken
   when the tongue 18 of the latch 16 is in its extended position. Figures 1 and 2 show the
   inner and outer actuators 12, 14 in their neutral positions.      It is from this neutral position
15 that the inner and outer actuators 12, 14 rotate to drive the latching mechanism to retract
   the tongue 18. Each of inner and outer sub-assemblies includes an actuator return spring
   128, 132 that is configured to bias the respective inner and outer actuators 12, 14 to their
   neutral positions. To this end, the inner hub 76 has a spring engaging lobe 130 that bears
   against actuator return spring 128. The biasing force of the actuator return spring 128 is
20 arranged so as to urge the inner actuator 12 towards the neutral position by application of
   force on the spring engaging lobe 130.         Similarly, the first outer hub 64 has a spring
   engaging lobe 134 that bears against actuator return spring 132. The biasing force of the
   actuator return spring 132 is arranged so as to urge the inner actuator 12 towards the
   neutral position by application of force on the spring engaging lobe 134.
25
           To change the handing of either sub-assembly, the respective stopping block 124
   is removed, the respective actuator 12, 14 is rotated to the opposite side (by 1800 from
   the positions shown in, for example, Figures 9 or 10), the stopping block 124 is reversed,
   and the screw 126 reinstalled on the trim plate 42, 40. The 1800 rotation to alter the
30 handing of the respective actuator 12, 14 also rotates the respective inner hub 76 or first
   outer hub 64 in the rotational position for operation of the assembly 10.

                                                 -23
            In addition, to ensure that the rotation of the barrel 26 of the first lock cylinder 24 to
   withdraw the bolt 34 of the deadbolt 32 will cause the assembly 10 to move from the
   privacy mode to the passage mode, the pin 85 is removed and reinstalled in the
   previously empty pin hole 86.
 5
            In this particular embodiment, the snibbing mechanism 50 can accommodate a
   misalignment of the inner sub-assembly relative to the outer sub-assembly, in the vertical
   and/or horizontal direction, whilst still being operable to transfer movement of the inner
   and outer slide plates 68, 78 through the intermediate drive 56.              Figure 23 shows a
10 vertical cross section of the assembly 10, in which the outer sub-assembly is positioned
   higher than the inner sub-assembly. The cross-sectional geometric proportions of the
   connecting bar 106, including the head portion 120, are less than those of the aperture
   and the internal cavity of the outer cylinder 104. Accordingly, a degree of misalignment
   can be accommodated without the connecting bar 106 being deflected.
