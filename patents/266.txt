  ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
            A catheter with a variable circular loop responsive to a contraction wire for coiling is
  supported by a member having a tapered distal section that transitions from a circular
  cross-section to a generally rectangular cross-section while maintaining a uniform cross
  sectional area along the entire tapered length for improved coiling characteristics.            A
  radially constrictive sleeve prevents separation of the contraction wire from the support
  member to minimize misshaping of the loop during contraction.

        CATHETER WITH TAPERED SUPPORT MEMBER FOR VARIABLE ARCUATE
                                      DISTAL ASSEMBLY
  FIELD OF INVENTION
  [0001]     This invention relates generally to methods and devices for invasive medical
  treatment, and specifically to catheters, in particular, catheters having distal sections
  adapted for mapping and ablating selected anatomy.
  BACKGROUND
  [0002]     Ablation of myocardial tissue is well known as a treatment for cardiac
  arrhythmias. In radio-frequency (RF) ablation, for example, a catheter is inserted into the
  heart and brought into contact with tissue at a target location. RF energy is then applied
  through an electrode on the catheter in order to create a lesion for the purpose of breaking
  arrhythmogenic current paths in the tissue.
  [0003]     Circumferential ablation of the ostia of the pulmonary vein is now accepted as a
  treatment for atrial arrhythmias, and particularly for atrial fibrillation. For example, U.S.
  Pat. No. 6,064,902, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes a
  catheter for ablating tissue on the inner wall of a blood vessel, such as a pulmonary vein.
  The tip portion of the catheter is deflectable from a first, generally straight, configuration,
  in which the proximal and distal sections are substantially co-linear, to a second, J
  shaped, configuration in which the proximal and distal sections are generally parallel with
  a separation therebetween substantially corresponding to the inside diameter of the blood
5 vessel. The distal end portion of the catheter is rotated about the longitudinal axis of the
  catheter to cause a circumferential displacement of proximal and distal ablation electrodes
  on the catheter along the inner wall of the pulmonary vein. In this way, the electrode
                                                -1
  3457928vl

  catheter may be used to ablate a number of circumferentially-spaced sites on the inner
  wall of the pulmonary vein by ablating one or two sites at each circumferential position.
  [0004]     U.S.  Patent No. 6,973,339, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by
  reference, describes a lasso for pulmonary vein mapping and ablation. A catheter for
  circumferentially mapping a pulmonary vein (PV) includes a curved section shaped to
  generally conform to the shape of the interior surface of the PV. The curved section is
  connected to catheter by a generally straight axial base section that is in an "on edge"
  configuration where the base axial section connects to the curved section on the
  circumference of the curved section. The curved section comprises one or more sensing
  electrodes, and its proximal end is joined at a fixed or generally known angle to a base
  section of the catheter. Position sensors are fixed to the curved section of the catheter
  and to the distal end of the base section. The catheter is inserted into the heart, and the
  curved section is positioned in contact with the wall of the PV, while the base section
  remains within the left atrium, typically positioned such that the joint with the curved
  section is at the ostium of the vein. The information generated by the three position
  sensors is used to calculate the locations and orientations of the sensing electrodes,
  which enables mapping of the surface of the PV. The sensing electrodes may additionally
  perform ablation of selected sites, or the catheter may further comprise ablation elements.
  [0005]     U.S. Pat. No. 7,008,401, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference,
  describes compound steering assemblies, usable in both diagnostic and therapeutic
  applications, for steering the distal section of a catheter in multiple planes or complex
  curves. These assemblies are said to enable a physician to swiftly and accurately position
5 and maintain ablation and/or mapping electrodes in intimate contact with an interior body
  surface. U.S. Pat. No. 5,820,591, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference,
  similarly describes compound steering assemblies of this sort.

  [0006]     U.S.   Patent No. 8,608,735 whose disclosure is incorporated herein by
  reference, describes a medical device, including an insertion shaft, having a longitudinal
  axis and having a distal end adapted for insertion into a body of a patient. A resilient end
  section is fixed to the distal end of the insertion shaft and is formed so as to define, when
  unconstrained, an arc oriented obliquely relative to the axis and having a center of
  curvature on the axis. One or more electrodes are disposed at respective locations along
  the end section.
  [0007]     However, because human anatomy varies between individuals, the shape and
  size of an ostium vary, and the arcuate distal section may not always fit the particular
  target ostium. Moreover, it may be desirable to use the same catheter for a target ostium
  of a certain diameter and also the PV of that ostium which may have a significantly lesser
  diameter.     Additionally, where a lasso catheter may have a variable arcuate distal
  assembly, contraction of the arcuate distal assembly may misshapen the generally
  circular form of the arcuate distal assembly because one or more of the components
  thereof are too stiff for tighter coiling in a desirable manner.
  [0008]     Current circular loop catheters are constructed utilizing a support member, e.g.,
  a nitinol spine, with a constant uniform cross-section that fails to consistently maintain a
  circular configuration during loop contraction. Such current circular loop catheters also
  are limited in its contraction and deflection characteristics in requiring more pound
  contraction wire tensile force for less loop contraction.       Moreover, current circular loop
  catheters may lack reliable attachment between the contraction wire and the support
  member that would eliminate possible breakage or release of the contraction wire from the
5 support member.        Current circular loop catheters have nitinol spines with the same
  uniform area moments of inertia along their entire length and the nitinol spines have the
  same cross-sectional area.

  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
  [0009]     The present invention is directed to a catheter having a variable arcuate distal
  with improved contraction and bending radius characteristics, along with greater durability.
  The variable arcuate distal section includes a variable tapered support member to greatly
  increase the degree of contraction of a generally circular catheter loop while decreasing
  the forces on a contraction wire and all other structural support portions of the loop while
  providing operators of the catheter with a repeatable and more truthful round contraction
  for circular diagnostic and therapeutic catheters. The variable tapered support member
  also increases the stiffness of the catheter loop along the axis of contraction to provide an
  increased and more uniform contact force between ring electrodes carried on the loop and
  the heart tissue.
  [0010]     In some embodiments, a catheter with a variable circular loop is supported by a
  member having a tapered distal section that transitions from a circular cross-section to a
  generally rectangular cross-section while maintaining a uniform cross-sectional area along
  the entire tapered length, where the tapered distal section provides a decreasing area
  moment of inertia along a first centroidal axis and an increasing area moment of inertia
  along a second centroidal axis that is generally orthogonal to the first centroidal axis. As
  such, the tapered section is biased to deflect less along the second centroidal axis with
  the increasing area moment of inertia and to deflect more along the first centroidal axis
  with the decreasing area moment of inertia.
  [0011]     In some embodiments, an electrophysiology catheter includes an elongated
  catheter body, a contraction wire, and    a distal assembly configured for contraction by
5 actuation of the contraction wire.     The distal assembly has a shape-memory support
  member having a 3-D configuration with a distal portion defined by a distal radius. The
  shape-memory support member having a generally rectangular cross-section defined by a
  width and a height. The generally rectangular cross-section is tapered in the distal portion
                                                -4
  3457928vl

  such that a distal location in the distal portion has a greater height and a lesser width and
  a proximal location in the distal portion has a lesser height and greater width.
  [0012]     In more detailed embodiments, the support member has an inner side facing an
  inner circumference of the 3-D configuration, wherein a coextensive portion of the
  contraction wire extending through the distal assembly is aligned with the inner side.
  [0013]     In some detailed embodiments, the distal assembly includes a radially
  constrictive sleeve surrounding the support member and a coextensive portion of the
  contraction wire with the support member.
  [0014]     In some detailed embodiments, the distal assembly includes a laser weld
  coupling of distal ends of the support member and the contraction wire, the distal end of
  the support member having a different cross-section than the generally-rectangular cross
  section.
  [0015]     In other embodiments, an electrophysiology catheter includes an elongated
  catheter body, a contraction wire, and      a 3-D arcuate distal assembly configured for
  contraction by the contraction wire, wherein the distal assembly defines an inner
  circumference and includes a first tubing with a lumen on or near the inner circumference,
  and an elongated support member extending through the lumen, the support member
  having a longitudinal flat side. The contraction wire extends through the lumen and has a
  coextensive segment alongside the one or more flat side surfaces of the support member.
  The distal assembly also includes a sleeve circumferentially surrounding the support
  member and the coextensive segment of the contraction wire.
  [0016]     In some detailed embodiments, the support member and the coextensive
5 segment of the contraction wire jointly define a cross-sectional profile, and the sleeve
  surrounds the support member and the coextensive segment generally in conformity to
  the cross-sectional profile.

  [0017]      In some detailed embodiments, the coextensive portion of the contraction wire
  is aligned with the flat side of the support member and configured to maintain the
  coextensive segment of the contraction wire generally in align the flat side during
  contraction of the distal assembly.
  [0018]      In some detailed embodiments, the support member has a distal tail portion,
  wherein the support member having a generally rectangular cross-section defined by a
  width and a height, the generally rectangular cross-section being tapered in the distal tail
  portion.
  [0019]      In some detailed embodiments, a distal location in the distal tail portion has a
  greater height and a lesser width and a proximal location in the distal tail portion has a
  lesser height and greater width.
  [0020]      In some embodiments, an electrophysiology catheter has an elongated catheter
  body defining a longitudinal axis, a contraction wire, and a 3-D distal assembly movable
  between a neutral configuration and a contracted configuration in response to longitudinal
  movement of the contraction wire. The 3-D distal assembly has an elbow junction and a
  distal portion. The elbow junction is defined by at least a proximal diameter and the distal
  portion defined by a distal diameter. For the neutral configuration, the proximal diameter
  is less than the distal diameter. For the contracted configuration, the distal diameter is
  about equal to or less than the proximal diameter.
  [0021]      In some detailed embodiments, the elbow junction has a twist configured to
  support the distal portion generally transversal to the longitudinal axis such that the
  longitudinal axis extends through a center of the distal portion.
5 [0022]      In some detailed embodiments, the distal assembly has an elongated support
  member having an inner flat side and an opposing flat side, and wherein the contraction
  wire has a distal segment coextensive with the inner flat side along its entire length.

  [0023]      In some detailed embodiments, the inner side of the support member is on or
  near an inner circumference of the distal portion of the 3-D distal assembly.
  [0024]      In some embodiments, the distal assembly further includes a radially
  constrictive sleeve circumferentially surrounding both the elongated support member and
  a friction-reducing tubing surrounding the contraction wire.
  [0025]      In some embodiments, the radially-constrictive sleeve is circumferentially
  constrictive around the support member and the friction-reducing tubing in minimizing
  lateral movement of the contraction wire relative to the support member.

  arcuate form having an elbow junction and a distal portion, the elbow junction defined by
  at least a proximal diameter and the distal portion defined by a distal diameter, and a
  radially constrictive sleeve surrounding the support member and a coextensive portion of
  the contraction wire. For the neutral configuration, the proximal diameter is less than the
  distal diameter. For the contracted configuration, the distal diameter is decreased to a
  diameter about less than the distal diameter.
  [0027]          In some detailed embodiments, the 3-D arcuate form defines an inner
  circumference, the distal assembly includes a tubing with multiple lumens including a
  lumen closest to the inner circumference, and the support member and the coextensive
5 portion of contraction wire are in the lumen closest to the inner circumference.

  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
  [0048]     Embodiments of the present invention that are described hereinbelow provide
  probes, such as catheters, with improved arcuate distal electrode-carrying structures, to
5 facilitate maneuvering and positioning in the heart and especially tubular regions of
  different sizes in a patient's body and different circumferential locations within the tubular
  regions.   Such catheters can be used to produce generally circular or helical ablation
  paths, as well as sensing electrical activity along a generally curve or helical pattern for
                                                 -9

  electrical potential and anatomical mapping.
  [0049]      Referring to FIG. 1, a catheter 10 according to the disclosed embodiments
  comprises an elongated body that may include a flexible insertion shaft or catheter body
   12 having a longitudinal axis 13, and an intermediate section 14 distal of the catheter body
  that can be uni- or bi-directionally deflected off-axis from the longitudinal axis 13. As
  shown in FIG. 2A, extending from the intermediate section 14 is a resilient three
  dimensional (3-D) arcuate distal assembly 17 which is advantageously constructed for
  significantly greater and more uniform loop contraction. As explained below in further
  detail, the distal assembly 17 is responsive to operator manipulation of a control handle 16
  in decreasing its radius and increasing its coiling, as shown in FIG. 2B.
  [0050]      In the depicted embodiment of FIG. 1 and FIG. 3, the catheter body 12
  comprises an elongated tubular construction having a single, axial or central lumen 18.
  The catheter body 12 is flexible, i.e., bendable, but substantially non-compressible along
  its length. The catheter body 12 can be of any suitable construction and made of any
  suitable material. In some embodiments, the construction comprises an outer wall 20
  made of polyurethane or PEBAX. The outer wall 20 comprises an imbedded braided mesh
  of stainless steel or the like, as is generally known in the art, to increase torsional stiffness
  of the catheter body 12 so that, when the control handle 16 is rotated, the intermediate
  section 14 will rotate in a corresponding manner.
  [0051]      The outer diameter of the catheter body 12 is not critical, but in some
  embodiments is no more than about 8 french, more preferably 7 french. Likewise the
  thickness of the outer wall 20 is not critical, but is thin enough so that the central lumen 18
5 can accommodate any desired wires, cables and/or tubes. The inner surface of the outer
  wall 20 is lined with a stiffening tube 22 to provide improved torsional stability. The outer
  diameter of the stiffening tube 22 is about the same as or slightly smaller than the inner
  diameter of the outer wall 20. The stiffening tube 22 can be made of any suitable material,
                                                 -10

  such as polyimide, which provides very good stiffness and does not soften at body
  temperature.
  [0052]      The deflectable intermediate section 14 comprises a shorter section of tubing
  23 having multiple lumens, each occupied by the various components from the catheter
   12 and into the intermediate section 14. In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 4, there are
  six lumens. Coupled to the ring electrodes 19, respective lead wire/thermocouple pairs
  40, 41 pass through a first lumen 31.         A nonconductive protective sheath 39 may be
  provided to surround the wire pairs 40/41. An irrigation tubing 43 for delivering irrigation
  fluid to the distal assembly 17 passes through a second lumen 32. For enabling deflection
  of the intermediate section 14, a deflection puller wire 44 passes through a third lumen 33.
  A position sensor cable assembly 48, including one or more single axis sensors (SAS)
  carried in the distal assembly 17, passes through a fourth lumen 34.             To render an
  arcuate distal portion 15 of the distal assembly 17 variable in shape and size, e.g.,
  curvature radii, in response to manipulation of the control handle by a user, a contraction
  wire 24 passes through a sixth lumen 36. As described below, the contraction wire 24
  acts on a shape-memory support member 50 that provides the 3-D shape of the distal
  assembly 17.
  [0053]      The multi-lumened tubing 23 of the intermediate section 14 is made of a
  suitable non-toxic material that is preferably more flexible than the catheter body 12. A
  suitable material is braided polyurethane or PEBAX, i.e., polyurethane or PEBAX with an
  embedded mesh of braided stainless steel or the like. The plurality and size of the lumens
  are not critical, provided there is sufficient room to house the relevant components. In the
5 illustrated embodiment, the third and sixth lumens 33 and 36 for the deflection puller wire
  44 and contraction wire 24 are off-axis and diametrically opposed to each other, and the
  fifth lumen 35 for the support member 50 is on-axis.
  [0054]      The useful length of the catheter, i.e., that portion that can be inserted into the
                                                  -11
  3457928vl

  body excluding the distal assembly 17, can vary as desired. Preferably the useful length
  ranges from about 110 cm to about 120 cm. The length of the intermediate section 14 is a
  relatively small portion of the useful length, and preferably ranges from about 3.5 cm to
  about 10 cm, more preferably from about 5 cm to about 6.5 cm.
  [0055]      Distal the intermediate section 14 is the distal assembly 17. Extending between
  the intermediate section 14 and the distal assembly 17 is a generally straight connector
  section 30, as shown in FIG. 2A and FIG. 5A, having a tubing of suitable material, e.g.,
  PEEK, with a central lumen 37 that allows the various components extending between the
  intermediate section 14 and the distal assembly 17 to reorient and reposition as needed
  for transitioning therebetween, as shown in FIG. 5B. The components are potted in the
  lumen 37 of the section 30 by a suitable adhesive 112. Supporting the distal assembly 17
  and providing its 3-D dimensional shape, the shape-memory support member 50 extends
  proximally from the distal assembly 17 for a relatively short distance into a distal portion of
  the connector section 30.
  [0056]      As shown in FIG. 2A and FIG. 6, the 3-D distal assembly 17 includes a
  preformed, arcuate distal portion 15, an elbow portion 21, and a proximal linear stem 26.
  The arcuate distal portion 15 carries a plurality of irrigated ring electrodes 19. The elbow
  portion 21 is configured to orient the distal portion 15 obliquely to the longitudinal axis 13
  such that the longitudinal axis extends generally through a center of the distal portion 15,
  as shown in FIG. 7.        As such, an oblique angle    E  (FIG. 2A) is defined between the
  longitudinal axis 13 and a plane P generally defined by the distal assembly 17, wherein
  the oblique angle 8 ranges between about 45 degrees and 135, preferably about 75 and
5  100 degrees, and preferably about 90 degrees.
  [0057]      With reference to FIG. 2A, FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, the elbow portion 21 has a
  proximal curved section 21 P, an elbow junction or "twist" 42, and a distal curved section
  21D. The proximal curved section 21P traces a first arc defined by a first (or proximal)
                                               -12

  radius R1 relative to the longitudinal axis 13. The distal curved section 21D traces a
  second arc defined by a second (or mid) radius R2 relative to an axis 27 oblique to the
  longitudinal axis 13. The first radius R1 is lesser than the second radius R2. However,
  both radii R1 and R2 are lesser than a third (or distal) radius R3 defining a third arc traced
  by the distal portion 15. In some embodiments, the radius R1 ranges between about 0.1"
  and 0.25", the radius R2 ranges between about 0.15" and 0.38", and the radius R3 ranges
  between about 0.4" and 0.6". As such, the 3-D configuration of the distal assembly 17,
  when unconstrained, has a spiral characteristic, with radius R3 being greater than the
  radius R2.     For example, where the oblique angle E is about 90 degrees and the
  longitudinal axis 13 defines a Z axis, the first arc defined by radius R1 may lie in the Y/Z
  plane, and the second and third arcs defined respectively by radii R2 and R3 may both lie
  in the X/Y plane, as shown in FIG. 6. It is understood that the distal assembly 17 is not
  limited to the radii R1, R2 and R3 described above, and may contain more or less radii, as
  needed or desired.
  [0058]      The 3-D configuration of the distal assembly 17, when unconstrained, also has
  a helical characteristic in that the distal assembly 17 extends distally as it spirals such that
  the distal end 25 of the distal assembly 17 is the distal-most portion of the distal assembly
  17, as best shown in FIG. 2A.
  [0059]      Accordingly, the distal assembly 17 has a spiral-helical configuration (or helical
  spiral configuration) such that there are a first separation gap between the distal end 25
  and the distal curved section 21D along the longitudinal axis 13, and a second separation
  gap between the distal end 25 and the distal curved section 21D along the oblique axis
5 27. The spiral-helical configuration of the distal assembly 17 can be described as tracing
  from its proximal end to its distal end an enlarging helix that is on-axis with the longitudinal
  axis, as shown in FIG. 2A.
  [0060]      Depending on the length of the distal portion 15, the distal assembly 17, in its
                                                 -13

  neutral, unconstrained 3-D configuration, may subtend a radial angle a of about 360
  degrees between the twist 42 and the distal end 25. In another embodiment, the distal
  assembly 17 subtends a radial angle a (FIG. 6) greater than 360 degrees, e.g., about 380
  degrees. When the distal assembly 17 is contracted, as shown in FIG. 2B, the spiral
  helical form "coils up" and tightens, with the one or more of radii R1, R2, R3 traced by the
  distal assembly 17 decreasing, and the radial angle a subtended by the distal assembly
   17 increasing, for example, from about 360 or 380 degrees to about 540 degrees or more
  between the twist 42 and the distal end 25.        Accordingly, the distal assembly 17 in its
  neutral, unconstrained configuration may be used for circumferential contact with an
  ostium having a larger radius, and then be adjusted into its contracted configuration for
  circumferential contact within the PV of the ostium with a significantly smaller radius.
  [0061]     As shown in FIG. 8, the distal assembly 17 includes a multi-lumened tubing 56.
  In the disclosed embodiment, the tubing 56 has four off-axis lumens, namely, a first lumen
  51 for the SAS cable assembly 48 (circumferentially surrounded by a friction-reducing
  coating 38, e.g., of TEFLON@), a second lumen 52 for the ring electrode wire pairs 40, 41,
  a third lumen 53 for irrigation fluid delivered through the irrigation tubing 43, and a fourth
  lumen 54 for the support member 50 and the contraction wire 24, a segment of which is
  coextensive with the support member 50 in the lumen 54. Again, position and sizing of
  the lumens are not critical, except the position of the fourth lumen 54 for the contraction
  wire 24 is preferably on or near an inner circumference of the spiral-helical form of the
  distal assembly 17 so that proximal movement of the wire 24 can act more effectively in
  tightening the spiral-helical form and increasing its coiling. The multi-lumened tubing 56
5 can be made of any suitable material, and is preferably made of a biocompatible plastic
  such as polyurethane or PEBAX.
  [0062]     In the depicted embodiment, the pre-formed support member 50 of the distal
  assembly 17 extends through the fourth lumen 54 of the tubing 56 to provide and define
                                                -14

  the 3-D spiral-helical shape of the distal assembly 17, which includes the twist 42 and arcs
  of the proximal section 21 P and the distal section 21 D, and the distal portion 15 defined
  by radii R1, R2 and R3. The support member 50 is made of a material having shape
  memory, i.e., that can be straightened or bent out of its original shape upon exertion of a
  force and is capable of substantially returning to its original shape upon removal of the
  force. In some embodiments, a suitable material for the support member 50 is a
  nickel/titanium alloy. Such alloys typically comprise about 55% nickel and 45% titanium,
  but may comprise from about 54% to about 57% nickel with the balance being titanium.
  One nickel/titanium alloy is Nitinol, which has excellent shape memory, together with
  ductility, strength, corrosion resistance, electrical resistivity and temperature stability.
  [0063]       In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 5A[], the support member 50 has a
  proximal end received and affixed in the connector section 30. In some embodiments, the
  proximal end extends at a depth of about 2-3 mm proximal of the distal end of the
  connector section 30. Alternatively, the support member 50 can extend further proximally
  into the lumen 35 of the intermediate section 14, through the entire length of the
  intermediate section 14, and even into the catheter body 12 via the central lumen 18, as
  desired or appropriate.
  [0064]      Advantageously, the support member 50 has a generally rectangular cross
  sectional shape whose height and width dimensions vary in a predetermined manner
  along the length of the member 50. As shown in FIG. 13B and FIG. 13C, the generally
  rectangular cross-sectional area at any location along the length remains constant
  although its width dimension W and height dimension vary at different locations. There is
5 no reduction or increase in the cross-sectional area at any location along the length in that
  any loss or gain in one dimension is proportionally gained or lost by the other dimension
  between a more proximal location and a more distal location along the length of the
  support member 50. As a tapered portion or "tail" of the support member 50 narrows in
                                                -15
  3457928vl

  one dimension of the cross-sectional area from the proximal end to the distal end of the
  member, the other dimension of the cross-sectional area widens from the proximal end to
  the distal end. The dimension that decreases (for example, the width dimension W along
  the X axis in FIG. 13B and FIG. 13C) decreases its resistance to bending in that
  dimension from the proximal end to the distal end, while the dimension that increases (for
  example, the height dimension H along the Y axis in FIG. 13B and FIG. 13C) increases its
  resistance to bending in that dimension from a proximal end to a distal end of the tapered
  portion.
  [0065]     As shown in FIG. 6, the generally rectangular cross-section of the support
  member 50 at its proximal end has a maximum width W1 and a minimum height H1. For
  minimizing change or deformation in radii R1 and R2 during contraction of the distal
  assembly 17, the width and height dimensions of the cross-sectional area of the support
  member 50 begin to change (or taper) starting at a predetermined location distal of radius
  R2 (e.g., at or around location L2) Distal of the predetermined location, in the tapered tail
  of distal assembly 17, the width begins to decrease to W2 (< W1) while the height begins
  to increase to H2 (>H1). The width further decreases to W3 (<W2<Wl) while the height
  further increases to H3 (>H2 >H1) at distal location L3. These decreases and increases
  are smooth and continuous. This tapered configuration biases the support member 50 to
  have increasing less resistance to coiling toward the distal end 25 such as when
  contracted by the contraction wire 24, while providing increasingly more resistance to
  oblique forces toward the distal end 25 such as when the distal assembly 17 contacts
  tissue surface head on.       Thus, this varied cross-sectional shape allows the distal
5 assembly 17 to exhibit improved contraction characteristics, including the distal portion 15
  being able to contract and coil readily with minimal deformation of the elbow junction 21
  and the elbow junction 21 being better able to withstand the load from an axial force that
  is applied when the distal assembly 17 comes into contact with target tissue. With this
                                              -16
  3457928vl

  varied cross-sectional shape applied to the support member 50, the distal assembly 17
  can be adjusted, upon actuation of the contraction wire 24, to assume a smaller loop size
  (see FIG. 2B), for example, where the distal portion 15 assumes a curvature that is
  generally equal to or even be lesser than the curvature of the distal section 21 D.
  [0066]     As shown in FIG. 6, with a generally rectangular cross-section, the support
  member 50 resembles a "coiled ribbon" having sides/surfaces 62 and 63 defining a height
  dimension of the generally rectangular cross-section, and edges 75 defining a width
  dimension of the generally rectangular cross-section.       Advantageously, the inner flat
  side/surface 62, along its length, continually faces the inner circumference of the spiral
  helical configuration of the distal assembly, and an outer flat side/surface 63 that is
  opposite of the inner flat surface 62 continually faces outwardly, away from the inner
  circumference of the spiral-helical configuration. The tapering of the support member 50
  results in the "tapered tail" of the distal assembly 17 resembling an increasing wider and
  thinner ribbon.
  [0067]      Moreover, the generally rectangular cross-section at the proximal end of the
  support member 50 helps anchor the proximal end in the lumen 35 of the tubing 23 of the
  deflectable section 14 and reduces the risk of the support member rotating about its axis
  where the proximal end is potted by an adhesive, e.g., epoxy (see FIG. 4).
  [0068]      In some embodiments, the support member 50 begins with a round cross
  sectional shape, as shown in FIG. 13A. The support member 50, for example, a round
  wire, is progressively flattened to produce the generally rectangular cross-section and
  tapered tail.   Thus, the two opposed ends of the width dimension between the parallel
5 fattened surfaces of the height dimension carry the residual round shape of the original
  round cross-sectional shape. It is understood that the support member may begin with a
  square/rectangular cross-sectional shape which would then result in flat opposed ends
  instead of round opposed ends. In some embodiments, using a round wire may be more
                                                -17
  3457928vl

  economical to manufacture, and rounded opposed ends may ease the assembly of the
  distal assembly 17, including insertion of the support member into a radially-constrictive
  flexible tubing or sleeve 60, as discussed further below. The rounded opposed ends may
  reduce the insertion force used to insert the support member 50 into the tubing 60 and
  also the risk of the support member 50 tearing and damaging the tubing 60.
  [0069]      In some embodiments, the support member 50, as a round wire, has an initial
  (pre-flattening) diameter of about 0.019 inches and a length of about 4.25 inches. When
  flattened, the support member 50 has a generally rectangular cross-sectional dimensions
  of about 0.021" x 0.015" from its proximal end to the location L2. The tapered tail of the
  support member 50 (distal of location L2 in FIG. 6) is about 2.9 inches long and has a
  generally rectangular cross-sectional dimensions of about 0.035" x 0.008" at or near its
  distal end 25.     In some embodiments, a distal end of the support member 50 has an
  unflattened section 50D which retains its round cross-section, as explained below in
  further detail.
  [0070]      The area moment of inertia for the 0.019 inch diameter support member 50
  (pre-flattening) is the same regardless of centroidal axis orientation, whereas the area
  moment of inertia at or near its distal end for the first centroidal axis is 2.5 times less stiff
  than the moment of inertia at the proximal end. The moment of inertia for the second
  centroidal axis at the distal end is 4.5 times stiffer than the moment of inertia at the
  proximal end. Comparing the two centroidal axis area moments of inertia at the distal end
  with respect to each other, the first centroidal axis is 18.5 times less stiff than the second
  centroidal axis. Since the contraction wire 24 exerts a constant inwardly line of force
5 (neglecting friction) on the support member 50, to obtain a small, generally circular
  contraction, the area moment of inertia of the support member 50 should constantly
  decrease towards the distal end where it is attached to the contraction wire 24.
  [0071]      The contraction wire 24 has a proximal end anchored in the control handle 16
                                               -18

  which provides a rotational control knob 59 (see FIG. 1) for actuating the contraction wire
  24 via manipulation by an operator. The contraction wire 24 extends through the central
  lumen 18 of the catheter body 12 (FIG. 3), the sixth lumen 36 of the intermediate section
   14 (FIG. 4), the central lumen 37 of the connector section 30 (FIG. 5A) and the fourth
  lumen 54 of the tubing 56 of the distal assembly 17 (FIG. 8) alongside the support
  member 50, to the distal end 25 (FIG. 9).
  [0072]      The contraction wire 24 may be covered by a friction-reducing tubing 61 (FIG.
  8), e.g., a TEFLON@ coated inner diameter of a polyimide or PEEK tubing, so that the
  contraction wire 24 is physically separated and isolated from the side 62 of the support
  member 50 and the inside surface of the constrictive tubing 60 that surrounds the
  contraction wire 24 and the support member 50, which is described below in further detail.
  The friction-reducing tubing 61 may have a proximal end in the connector section 30 and
  a distal end at least distal of the radius R2, at or near the location L2, if not closer to the
  distal end of the support member 50.
  [0073]      Advantageously, the support member 50 and the coextensive segment of the
  contraction wire 24 (and its tubing 61) through the lumen 54 of the distal assembly 17 are
  surrounded and bound together by the tight-fitting flexible tubing 60, as shown in FIG. 6.
  In some embodiments, the tight-fitting tubing 60 has an inner diameter 91 composed of a
  friction-reducing material, such as, TEFLON@, (formed as a first extrusion coat or layer),
  which is covered by a stainless steel flat braid 92, which is covered by an outer diameter
  93, such as nylon (formed as a second extrusion coat or layer). The constrictive tubing 60
  is slipped over the support member 50 and the contraction wire 24 (with its friction
5 reducing tubing 61) after their distal ends are affixed together, as described further below.
  The tubing 60 has a distal end at or near a junction of the radii R2 and R3, and a proximal
  end at or near the elbow junction 21. The tubing 60 is fitted to provide circumferential
  constriction around the member 50, the contraction wire 24 with its friction-reducing tubing
                                               -19

  61 (see FIG. 8) so as to secure the tubing 61 against the inner side 62 of the support
  member 50 in keeping the contraction wire 24 aligned with (or on the side of) the inner
  side 62 for improving contraction characteristics of the distal assembly 17, including
  improved circular shape maintenance and significantly tighter contraction and coiling, as
  well as improved durability against the contraction wire 24 cutting into the tubing 56 of the
  distal assembly 17. Such improved contraction characteristics, particularly of the tapered
  tail of the distal assembly, is enabled by keeping the contraction 24 against the inner side
  62 throughout the length of the support member 50. For example, where a radius R3 of
  the arc of distal portion 15 is about 17mm when the distal assembly 17 is unconstrained,
  the distal assembly 17 can be contracted into a tighter coil such that the arcs of the distal
  curve portion 21D and the distal portion 15 are both defined by a radius of about 10 mm,
  for a reduction in the radius R3 of the arc of the distal portion 15 by about 60% or more.
  [0074]      As illustrated in FIG. 6, the contraction wire 24 within its tubing 61 runs along
  the entire length of the inner-facing side 62 of the support member 50 extending between
  the distal end 25 of the distal assembly 17 and the connector section 30. This
  predetermined pattern advantageously minimizes any tendency for the contraction wire 24
  to separate and lift from the support member 50 when the contraction wire 24 is drawn
  proximally. In some embodiments, the contraction wire 24 may also have a rectangular
  cross-section along its length or along one or more segments thereof.
  [0075]      With reference to FIG. 8 and FIG. 9, an assembled structure of the distal ends
  of the support member 50, contraction wire 24 and constrictive tubing 60 is oriented within
  the fourth lumen 54 of the tubing 56 of the distal assembly 17 such that the contraction
5 wire 24 is most adjacent to the inner circumference of the distal assembly 17 to face the
  center of the distal assembly 17. With the fourth lumen 54 positioned closer to the inner
  circumference than the other lumens of the tubing 56, and the contraction wire 24 within
  the lumen 54 also positioned closer to the inner circumference than the support member
                                                -20

  50, the contraction wire 24 can effectively contract the distal assembly 17.
  [0076]      Prior to insertion into the lumen 54, the assembled structure of the distal ends of
  the support member 50, the contraction wire 24 and the constrictive tubing 60 is prepared.
  In some embodiments, a coupling of the distal ends of the contraction wire 24 and support
  member 50 includes a laser welded coupling having a stainless steel ferrule 65 (e.g., 304
  or 316 series) that is placed over the distal end 25D of the support member 50 which is
  not flattened but retains its original round cross-sectional shape.          The ferrule 65 is
  flattened after it is placed over the distal end 25D. The flattened portion of the support
  member 50 acts as a stop preventing any proximal migration or dislocation of the ferrule
  65 when contraction wire tension is applied to the support member 50. The ferrule 65 is
  secured to the round distal end 50D of the support member 50 by a crimp die which has a
  flat portion that is clocked parallel to the surface 62 of the support member 50. The distal
  end of the contraction wire 24 has a crimped ferrule 80 which has a flat portion that is also
  fixed to the flat portion of the ferrule 65. A laser seam weld 101 is made on one common
  (bottom) side of the ferrules 65 and 80 joining the distal ends of the contraction wire 24
  and the support member 50.
  [0077]      In contrast to prior art coupling of the support member and the contraction wire
  which used lead-free solder to join a nitinol support member to the contraction wire, the
  laser welded coupling described herein includes the use of strong acid flux to remove
  oxides from the nitinol and stainless steel before soldering. Moreover, the laser welded
  coupling provides a much stronger attachment compared to the prior art the lead-free
  solder with a low shear and tensile strength (about 4000 psi) which can attribute to puller
5 wire detachment failures from the nitinol support member when the lead-free solder
  contained unexposed voids or was formed as a cold solder joint.
  [0078]      The constrictive tubing 60 is then slid over the contraction wire 24 at its proximal
  end, advanced over the support member 50 at its proximal end, and further advanced until
                                                 -21

  the distal end of the tubing 60 reaches and covers the assembled structure.
  [0079]      When the constrictive tubing 60 has been properly positioned over the
  contraction wire 24 and the support member 50, the constrictive tubing 60 has a proximal
  end near a junction of radii R2 and R3, and it distal end is trimmed or otherwise provided
  with a finished distal end terminating immediately proximal of the stainless steel ferrule 65.
  The finished distal end of the constrictive tubing 60 is then affixed to the friction-reducing
  tubing 61 and the support member 50 by a circumferential application of an adhesive 111,
  e.g., LOCTITE@. Notably, the friction-reducing tubing 61 surrounding the contraction wire
  24 has a distal end that is well proximal of the soldered stainless steel ferrule 65 so that
  the adhesive 101 can bond the distal end of the constrictive tubing 60 directly on to the
  contraction wire 24 and the support member 50.
  [0080]      The assembled structure of the contraction wire 24, the support member 50 and
  the constrictive tubing 60 is then inserted into the lumen 54, where the stainless steel
  ferrule 65 and its contained components are fixed and anchored at the distal end of the
  multi-lumened tubing 56 by an adhesive 64, e.g., polyurethane, which covers the entire
  distal face of the distal end 25 to form a tip dome, as shown in FIG. 9.              With this
  arrangement, the relative positions of the contraction wire 24 and the support member 50
  can be controlled so that the contraction wire 24 is positioned on or near the inner
  circumference of the distal assembly 17, closer to the center of the spiral-helical form, as
  described above. The constrictive tubing 60 protects the multi-lumened tubing 56 from
  the contraction wire 24 cutting into its side wall during contraction of the distal assembly
   17.
5 [0081]      With reference to FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, a compression coil 68 surrounding the
  contraction wire 24 extends from the proximal end of the catheter body 12 and through the
  entire length of the sixth lumen 36 of the intermediate section 14. Thus, the compression
  coil has a distal end at or near a mid-location in the connector section 30.               The
                                               -22
  3457928vl

  compression coil 68 is made of any suitable metal, preferably stainless steel, and is tightly
  wound on itself to provide flexibility, i.e., bending, but to resist compression. The inner
  diameter of the compression coil is preferably slightly larger than the diameter of the
  contraction wire 24. The outer surface of the compression coil is covered by a flexible,
  non-conductive sheath 67, e.g., made of polyimide tubing. The compression coil
  preferably is formed of a wire having a square or rectangular cross-sectional area, which
  makes it less compressible than a compression coil formed from a wire having a circular
  cross-sectional area. As a result, the compression coil 68 keeps the catheter body 12, and
  particularly the intermediate section 14, from deflecting when the contraction wire 24 is
  drawn proximally to contract the distal assembly 17, as the compression coil 68 absorbs
  more of the compression.
  [0082]     The ring electrodes 19 are mounted on predetermined locations on the distal
  portion 15, as shown in FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B. The electrodes can be made of any suitable
  solid conductive material, such as platinum or gold, preferably a combination of platinum
  and iridium or gold and platinum, and mounted onto the tubing with glue or the like. A
  suitable embodiment of an electrode adapted for ablation and irrigation is illustrated in
  FIG. 10. An ablation reservoir ("AR") electrode is generally cylindrical with a length greater
  than its diameter. In one embodiment, the length is about 3.0 mm, the outer diameter is
  about 2.8 mm, and the inner diameter is about 2.33 mm.
  [0083]      In some embodiments, the plurality of AR ring electrodes 19 on the distal
  assembly 17 can ranges from about six to about twenty, more preferably from about eight
  to about twelve. In some embodiments, the distal assembly 17 carries ten AR electrodes.
5 The electrodes can be approximately evenly spaced along the distal portion 15.
  [0084]     The proximal end of each wire of the wire pairs 40, 41 is electrically connected
  to a suitable connector (not shown) distal of the control handle 16.         In the disclosed
  embodiment, wire 40 of a wire pair is a copper wire, e.g. a number "40" copper wire, and

  the other wire 41 of the wire pair is a constantan wire. The wire pairs extend from the
  control handle 16, through the central lumen 18 of the catheter body 12 (FIG. 3), the first
  lumen 31 of the intermediate section 14 (FIG. 4), the central lumen 37 of the connector
  section 30 (FIG. 5A), and the second lumen 52 of the distal assembly 17 (FIG. 8). The
  distal ends of the wire pairs pass through holes 74 (FIG. 9) formed in the side wall of the
  tubing 56 to reach the AR electrodes 19. The wires of each pair are electrically isolated
  from each other except at their distal ends where they are exposed. Exposed distal ends
  of a respective wire pair 40, 41 are sandblasted, and wrapped in and welded to a folded
  metal foil 72     (e.g., copper foil) which is then welded to an inner surface 70 near a
  proximal end 71 of its AR electrode 19, as shown in FIG. 10.
  [0085]     Ablation energy, e.g., RF energy, is delivered to the AR electrodes 19 via the
  wire 40 of the wire pairs. However, the wire pairs inclusive of their respective constantan
  wire 41 can also function as temperature sensors or thermocouples sensing temperature
  of each AR electrode 19.
  [0086]     All of the wire pairs pass through one nonconductive protective sheath 39 (FIG.
  3 and FIG. 4), which can be made of any suitable material, e.g., polyimide, in surrounding
  relationship therewith. The sheath 39 extends with the wire pairs from the control handle
   16, the catheter body 12, the intermediate section 14, the connector section 30 and into
  the second lumen 52 of the distal assembly 17, terminating just distal of the junction
  between the connector section 30 and the distal assembly 17, for example, about 5 mm
  into the second lumen 52. The distal end is anchored in the second lumen 52 by glue, for
  example, polyurethane glue or the like.
5 [0087]     Irrigation fluid is delivered to the distal assembly by the irrigation tubing 43
  whose proximal end is attached to a luer hub 73 (FIG. 1) proximal of the control handle 16
  and receives fluid delivered by a pump (not shown). The irrigation tubing 43 extends
  through the control handle 16, the central lumen 18 of the catheter body 12 (FIG. 3), the
                                                -24

  second lumen 32 of the intermediate section 14 (FIG. 4), the central lumen 37 of the
  connector section 30 (FIG. 5A) and a short distance, e.g., about 5 mm, distally into the
  third lumen 53 of the multi-lumened tubing 56 of the distal assembly 17. The fluid enters
  the third lumen 53 where it exits via openings (not shown) formed in the sidewall of the
  tubing 56 to enter the AR ring electrodes 19 and exits apertures 78 formed in the
  electrode side wall (FIG. 10). It is understood that the distal portion 15 may carry any
  form of electrodes, including the aforementioned AR ring electrodes, impedance ring
  electrodes, and/or combinations thereof, as desired or appropriate.
  [0088]       The deflection puller wire 44 is provided for deflection of the intermediate shaft
   14. The deflection wire 44 extends through the central lumen 18 of the catheter body 12
  (FIG. 3) and the third lumen 33 of the intermediate section 14 (FIG. 4). It is anchored at its
  proximal end in the control handle 16, and at its distal end to a location at or near the
  distal end of the intermediate section 14 by a T-bar 76 (FIG. 4) that is affixed to the
  sidewall of the tubing 15 by suitable material, e.g., polyurethane 69 . The puller wire 54 is
  made of any suitable metal, such as stainless steel or Nitinol, and is preferably coated
  with TEFLON@ or the like. The coating imparts lubricity to the puller wire. The puller wire
  44 may have a diameter ranging from about 0.006 to about 0.010 inch.
  [0089]       A second compression coil 47 is situated within the central lumen 18 of the
  catheter body 12 in surrounding relation to the puller wire 44 (FIG. 3). The second
  compression coil 47 extends from the proximal end of the catheter body 12 to at or near
  the proximal end of the intermediate section 14. The second compression coil 47 is made
  of any suitable metal, preferably stainless steel, and is tightly wound on itself to provide
5 flexibility, i.e., bending, but to resist compression. The inner diameter of the second
  compression coil 47 is preferably slightly larger than the diameter of the puller wire 44. A
  TEFLON@ coating (not shown) on the puller wire allows it to slide freely within the second
  compression coil. Within the catheter body 12, the outer surface of the second

  3457928vl

  compression coil 47 is covered by a flexible, non-conductive sheath 49, e.g., made of
  polyimide tubing. The second compression coil 47 is anchored at its proximal end to the
  outer wall 20 of the catheter body 12 by a proximal glue joint and to the intermediate
  section 14 by a distal glue joint.
  [0090]     Within the third lumen 33 of the intermediate section 14, the puller wire 44
  extends through a plastic sheath (not shown) , preferably of TEFLON@, which prevents
  the puller wire 44 from cutting into the wall of the tubing 23 of the intermediate section 14
  when the intermediate section 14 is deflected.
  [0091]     Longitudinal movement of the contraction wire 24 relative to the catheter body
   12, which results in contraction of the spiral-helical form of the distal assembly 17, is
  accomplished by suitable manipulation of the control handle 16. Similarly, longitudinal
  movement of the deflection wire 44 relative to the catheter body 12, which results in
  deflection of the intermediate section 14, is accomplished by suitable manipulation of the
  control handle 16. Suitable control handles for manipulating more than one wire are
  described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,468,260, 6,500,167, and 6,522,933, the entire
  disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
  [0092]     In one embodiment, the catheter includes a control handle 16 as shown in FIG.
  11 and FIG. 12. The control handle 16 includes a deflection control assembly that has a
  handle body 84 in which a core 86 is fixedly mounted and a piston 87 is slidably mounted
  over a distal region of the core 86. The piston 87 has a distal portion that extends outside
  the handle body. A thumb knob 58 is mounted on the distal portion so that the user can
  more easily move the piston 87 longitudinally relative to the core 86 and handle body 84.
5 The proximal end of the catheter body 12 is fixedly mounted to the distal end of the piston
  87. An axial passage 88 is provided at the distal end of the piston 87, so that various
  components, including lead wires 40, 41, contraction wire 24, deflection wire 44, position
  sensing cable assembly 48 and irrigation tubing 43 that extend through the catheter body
                                                -26

   12 can pass into the control handle. The lead wires 40, 41 can extend out the proximal
  end of the control handle 16 or can be connected to a connector that is incorporated into
  the control handle, as is generally known in the art. The irrigation tubing 43 can also
  extend out the proximal end of the control 16 for connection with an irrigation source (not
  shown) via a luer hub.
  [0093]     The proximal end of the deflection wire 44 enters the control handle 16, and is
  wrapped around a pulley 83 and anchored to the core 86. Longitudinal movement of the
  thumb knob 58 and piston 87 distally relative to the handle body 84 and core 86 draws the
  proximal end of the deflection wire 44 distally. As a result, the deflection wire 44 pulls on
  the side of the intermediate section 14 to which it is anchored, thereby deflecting the
  intermediate section in that direction. To release and straighten the intermediate section
   14, the thumb knob 58 is moved proximally which results in the piston 87 being moved
  proximally back to its original position relative to the handle body 84 and core 86.
  [0094]     The control handle 16 is also used for longitudinal movement of the contraction
  wire 24 via a rotational control assembly. In the illustrated embodiment, the rotational
  control assembly includes a cam handle 81 and a cam receiver 82. By rotating the cam
  handle in one direction, the cam receiver is drawn proximally to draw on the contraction
  wire 24. By rotating the cam handle in the other direction, the cam receiver is advanced
  distally to release the contraction wire 24.       The contraction wire 24 extends from the
  catheter body 12 into the control handle 16, through the axial passage in the piston 88
  and through the core 86 to be anchored in an adjuster 85 by which tension on the
  contraction wire can be adjusted.
5 [0095]     In one embodiment, the position sensor cable assembly 48 including a plurality
  of single axis sensors ("SAS") extends through the first lumen 51 of the distal assembly 17
  (FIG. 8), where each SAS occupies a known or predetermined position on the spiral
  helical form of the distal assembly 17. The cable assembly 48 extends proximally from the
                                                 -27

  distal assembly 17 through the central lumen 37 of the connector section 30, the fourth
  lumen 34 of the intermediate section 14 (FIG. 4), the central lumen 18 of the catheter
  body 12 (FIG. 3), and into the control handle 16. Each SAS can be positioned with a
  known and equal spacing separating adjacent SASs. In the disclosed embodiment, the
  cable carries three SASs that are positioned under the distal-most AR electrode, the
  proximal-most AR electrode, and a mid AR electrode, for sensing location and/or position
  of the distal assembly 17. The SASs enable the spiral-helical form to be viewed under
  mapping systems manufactured and sold by Biosense Webster, Inc., including the
  CARTO, CARTO XP and NOGA mapping systems. Suitable SASs are described in U.S.
  Patent No. 8,792,962, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
