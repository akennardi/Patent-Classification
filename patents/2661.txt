                                         BACKGROUND
[0004]      Consumers often store their calendars electronically. Those who own more than
one electronic device may wish to access their electronic calendars from any device. Access
to calendar information from portable electronic devices is particularly desirable for mobile
users. As portable electronic devices become more portable-        which will increase the desire
for electronic information access-    suitable user interfaces for managing calendar
information will also become increasingly desirable.

[0086]       The following description sets forth exemplary methods, parameters and the like.
It should be recognized, however, that such description is not intended as a limitation on the
scope of the present disclosure but is instead provided as a description of exemplary
embodiments.
[0087]       User interfaces for efficient presentation and management of calendar
information, particularly on portable electronic devices, are described. Below, FIGS. 1, 3, 5,
and 34 provide a description of exemplary devices for managing calendar information on
such devices. FIGS. 6A-6E, 7A-7D, 8A-8E, 9A-9E, 10A-10E, 11, 12A-12B, 13-19, 20A
20B, and 21-23 illustrate exemplary user interfaces. The user interfaces are also used to
illustrate the processes described below, including those in FIGS. 24-33.
[0088]       Although the following description uses terms "first," "second," etc. to describe
various elements, these elements should not be limited by the terms. These terms are only
used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first touch could be termed a
second touch, and, similarly, a second touch could be termed a first touch, without departing
from the scope of the various described embodiments. The first touch and the second touch
are both touches, but they are not the same touch.
[0089]       The terminology used in the description of the various described embodiments
herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be
                                                   10

1002203380
limiting. As used in the description of the various described embodiments and the appended
claims, the singular forms "a", "an," and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as
well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term
"and/or" as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one
or more of the associated listed items. It will be further understood that the terms "includes,"
"including," "comprises," and/or "comprising," when used in this specification, specify the
presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do
not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps,
operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.
[0090]        The term "if" may be construed to mean "when" or "upon" or "in response to
determining" or "in response to detecting," depending on the context. Similarly, the phrase
"if it is determined" or "if [a stated condition or event] is detected" may be construed to mean
"upon determining" or "in response to determining" or "upon detecting [the stated condition
or event]" or "in response to detecting [the stated condition or event]," depending on the
context.
[0091]        Embodiments of electronic devices, user interfaces for such devices, and
associated processes for using such devices are described. In some embodiments, the device
is a portable communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also contains other
functions, such as PDA and/or music player functions. Exemplary embodiments of portable
multifunction devices include, without limitation, the iPhone@, iPod Touch®, and iPad@
devices from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California. Other portable electronic devices, such as
laptops or tablet computers with touch-sensitive surfaces (e.g., touch screen displays and/or
touchpads), are, optionally, used. It should also be understood that, in some embodiments,
the device is not a portable communications device, but is a desktop computer with a touch
sensitive surface (e.g., a touch screen display and/or a touchpad).
[0092]        In the discussion that follows, an electronic device that includes a display and a
touch-sensitive surface is described. It should be understood, however, that the electronic
device optionally includes one or more other physical user-interface devices, such as a
physical keyboard, a mouse, and/or a joystick.
[0093]        The device may support a variety of applications, such as one or more of the
following: a drawing application, a presentation application, a word processing application, a
                                                    11

1002203380
website creation application, a disk authoring application, a spreadsheet application, a gaming
application, a telephone application, a video conferencing application, an e-mail application,
an instant messaging application, a workout support application, a photo management
application, a digital camera application, a digital video camera application, a web browsing
application, a digital music player application, and/or a digital video player application.
[0094]      The various applications that are executed on the device optionally use at least one
common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface. One or more
functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as corresponding information displayed on the
device are, optionally, adjusted and/or varied from one application to the next and/or within a
respective application. In this way, a common physical architecture (such as the touch
sensitive surface) of the device optionally supports the variety of applications with user
interfaces that are intuitive and transparent to the user.
[0095]      Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable devices with touch
sensitive displays. FIG. 1A is a block diagram illustrating portable multifunction device 100
with touch-sensitive display system 112 in accordance with some embodiments. Touch
sensitive display 112 is sometimes called a "touch screen" for convenience and is sometimes
known as or called a "touch-sensitive display system." Device 100 includes memory 102
(which optionally includes one or more computer-readable storage mediums), memory
controller 122, one or more processing units (CPUs) 120, peripherals interface 118, RF
circuitry 108, audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, microphone 113, input/output (I/O)
subsystem 106, other input control devices 116, and external port 124. Device 100 optionally
includes one or more optical sensors 164. Device 100 optionally includes one or more
contact intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of contacts on device 100 (e.g., a touch
sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system 112 of device 100). Device 100
optionally includes one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating tactile outputs on
device 100 (e.g., generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive surface such as touch
sensitive display system 112 of device 100 or touchpad 355 of device 300). These
components optionally communicate over one or more communication buses or signal lines
103.
[0096]      As used in the specification and claims, the term "intensity" of a contact on a
touch-sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area) of a contact (e.g., a
finger contact) on the touch-sensitive surface, or to a substitute (proxy) for the force or
                                                   12

1002203380
pressure of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface. The intensity of a contact has a range of
values that includes at least four distinct values and more typically includes hundreds of
distinct values (e.g., at least 256). Intensity of a contact is, optionally, determined (or
measured) using various approaches and various sensors or combinations of sensors. For
example, one or more force sensors underneath or adjacent to the touch-sensitive surface are,
optionally, used to measure force at various points on the touch-sensitive surface. In some
implementations, force measurements from multiple force sensors are combined (e.g., a
weighted average) to determine an estimated force of a contact. Similarly, a pressure
sensitive tip of a stylus is, optionally, used to determine a pressure of the stylus on the touch
sensitive surface. Alternatively, the size of the contact area detected on the touch-sensitive
surface and/or changes thereto, the capacitance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to
the contact and/or changes thereto, and/or the resistance of the touch-sensitive surface
proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto are, optionally, used as a substitute for the
force or pressure of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, the
substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are used directly to determine whether
an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is described in units
corresponding to the substitute measurements). In some implementations, the substitute
measurements for contact force or pressure are converted to an estimated force or pressure,
and the estimated force or pressure is used to determine whether an intensity threshold has
been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is a pressure threshold measured in units of
pressure). Using the intensity of a contact as an attribute of a user input allows for user
access to additional device functionality that may otherwise not be accessible by the user on a
reduced-size device with limited real estate for displaying affordances (e.g., on a touch
sensitive display) and/or receiving user input (e.g., via a touch-sensitive display, a touch
sensitive surface, or a physical/mechanical control such as a knob or a button).
[0097]       As used in the specification and claims, the term "tactile output" refers to physical
displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical displacement
of a component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to another component
(e.g., housing) of the device, or displacement of the component relative to a center of mass of
the device that will be detected by a user with the user's sense of touch. For example, in
situations where the device or the component of the device is in contact with a surface of a
user that is sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm, or other part of a user's hand), the tactile
output generated by the physical displacement will be interpreted by the user as a tactile
                                                    13

1002203380
sensation corresponding to a perceived change in physical characteristics of the device or the
component of the device. For example, movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch
sensitive display or trackpad) is, optionally, interpreted by the user as a "down click" or "up
click" of a physical actuator button. In some cases, a user will feel a tactile sensation such as
an "down click" or "up click" even when there is no movement of a physical actuator button
associated with the touch-sensitive surface that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the
user's movements. As another example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is,
optionally, interpreted or sensed by the user as "roughness" of the touch-sensitive surface,
even when there is no change in smoothness of the touch-sensitive surface. While such
interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to the individualized sensory perceptions of
the user, there are many sensory perceptions of touch that are common to a large majority of
users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as corresponding to a particular sensory
perception of a user (e.g., an "up click," a "down click," "roughness"), unless otherwise
stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical displacement of the device or a
component thereof that will generate the described sensory perception for a typical (or
average) user.

device to CPU 120 and memory 102. The one or more processors 120 run or execute various
software programs and/or sets of instructions stored in memory 102 to perform various
functions for device 100 and to process data. In some embodiments, peripherals interface

118, CPU 120, and memory controller 122 may be implemented on a single chip, such as
chip 104. In some other embodiments, they may be implemented on separate chips.
[00101]     RF (radio frequency) circuitry 108 receives and sends RF signals, also called
electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 converts electrical signals to/from electromagnetic
signals and communicates with communications networks and other communications devices

[0102]      Audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, and microphone 113 provide an audio interface
between a user and device 100. Audio circuitry 110 receives audio data from peripherals
                                                 15

1002203380
interface 118, converts the audio data to an electrical signal, and transmits the electrical
signal to speaker 111. Speaker 111 converts the electrical signal to human-audible sound
waves. Audio circuitry 110 also receives electrical signals converted by microphone 113
from sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 converts the electrical signal to audio data and
transmits the audio data to peripherals interface 118 for processing. Audio data may be
retrieved from and/or transmitted to memory 102 and/or RF circuitry 108 by peripherals
interface 118. In some embodiments, audio circuitry 110 also includes a headset jack (e.g.,
212, FIG. 2). The headset jack provides an interface between audio circuitry 110 and
removable audio input/output peripherals, such as output-only headphones or a headset with
both output (e.g., a headphone for one or both ears) and input (e.g., a microphone).
[0103]      I/O subsystem 106 couples input/output peripherals on device 100, such as touch
screen 112 and other input control devices 116, to peripherals interface 118. I/O subsystem
106 optionally includes display controller 156, optical sensor controller 158, intensity sensor
controller 159, haptic feedback controller 161, and one or more input controllers 160 for
other input or control devices. The one or more input controllers 160 receive/send electrical
signals from/to other input control devices 116. The other input control devices 116
optionally include physical buttons (e.g., push buttons, rocker buttons, etc.), dials, slider
switches, joysticks, click wheels, and so forth. In some alternate embodiments, input
controller(s) 160 are, optionally, coupled to any (or none) of the following: a keyboard, an
infrared port, a USB port, and a pointer device such as a mouse. The one or more buttons
(e.g., 208, FIG. 2) optionally include an up/down button for volume control of speaker 111
and/or microphone 113. The one or more buttons optionally include a push button (e.g., 206,
FIG. 2).
[0104]      A quick press of the push button may disengage a lock of touch screen 112 or
begin a process that uses gestures on the touch screen to unlock the device, as described in
U.S. Patent Application 11/322,549, "Unlocking a Device by Performing Gestures on an
Unlock Image," filed December 23, 2005, U.S. Pat. No. 7,657,849, which is hereby
incorporated by reference in its entirety. A longer press of the push button (e.g., 206) may
turn power to device 100 on or off. The user may be able to customize a functionality of one
or more of the buttons. Touch screen 112 is used to implement virtual or soft buttons and one
or more soft keyboards.

[0105]      Touch-sensitive display 112 provides an input interface and an output interface
between the device and a user. Display controller 156 receives and/or sends electrical signals
from/to touch screen 112. Touch screen 112 displays visual output to the user. The visual
output may include graphics, text, icons, video, and any combination thereof (collectively
termed "graphics"). In some embodiments, some or all of the visual output may correspond
to user-interface objects.
[0106]      Touch screen 112 has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor, or set of sensors that
accepts input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact. Touch screen 112 and
display controller 156 (along with any associated modules and/or sets of instructions in
memory 102) detect contact (and any movement or breaking of the contact) on touch screen
112 and convert the detected contact into interaction with user-interface objects (e.g., one or
more soft keys, icons, web pages, or images) that are displayed on touch screen 112. In an
exemplary embodiment, a point of contact between touch screen 112 and the user
corresponds to a finger of the user.
[0107]      Touch screen 112 may use LCD (liquid crystal display) technology, LPD (light
emitting polymer display) technology, or LED (light emitting diode) technology, although
other display technologies may be used in other embodiments. Touch screen 112 and display
controller 156 may detect contact and any movement or breaking thereof using any of a
plurality of touch sensing technologies now known or later developed, including but not
limited to capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave technologies, as well as
other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of contact
with touch screen 112. In an exemplary embodiment, projected mutual capacitance sensing
technology is used, such as that found in the iPhone@ and iPod Touch® from Apple Inc. of
Cupertino, California.
[0108]      A touch-sensitive display in some embodiments of touch screen 112 may be
analogous to the multi-touch sensitive touchpads described in the following U.S. Patents:

and/or U.S. Patent Publication 2002/0015024A1, each of which is hereby incorporated by
reference in its entirety. However, touch screen 112 displays visual output from device 100,
whereas touch-sensitive touchpads do not provide visual output.

[0109]       A touch-sensitive display in some embodiments of touch screen 112 may be as
described in the following applications: (1) U.S. Patent Application No. 11/381,3 13,

"Multi-Functional Hand-Held Device," filed March 3, 2006. All of these applications are
incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
[0110]       Touch screen 112 may have a video resolution in excess of 100 dpi. In some
embodiments, the touch screen has a video resolution of approximately 160 dpi. The user
may make contact with touch screen 112 using any suitable object or appendage, such as a
stylus, a finger, and so forth. In some embodiments, the user interface is designed to work
primarily with finger-based contacts and gestures, which can be less precise than stylus-based
input due to the larger area of contact of a finger on the touch screen. In some embodiments,
the device translates the rough finger-based input into a precise pointer/cursor position or
command for performing the actions desired by the user.
[0111]       In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, device 100 may include a
touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular functions. In some
embodiments, the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device that, unlike the touch
screen, does not display visual output. The touchpad may be a touch-sensitive surface that is
separate from touch screen 112 or an extension of the touch-sensitive surface formed by the
touch screen.
[0112]       Device 100 also includes power system 162 for powering the various components.
Power system 162 may include a power management system, one or more power sources
(e.g., battery, alternating current (AC)), a recharging system, a power failure detection circuit,
                                                   18

1002203380
a power converter or inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a light-emitting diode (LED))
and any other components associated with the generation, management and distribution of
power in portable devices.
[0113]       Device 100 may also include one or more optical sensors 164. FIG. 1A shows an
optical sensor coupled to optical sensor controller 158 in I/O subsystem 106. Optical sensor
164 may include charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) phototransistors. Optical sensor 164 receives light from the
environment, projected through one or more lenses, and converts the light to data
representing an image. In conjunction with imaging module 143 (also called a camera
module), optical sensor 164 may capture still images or video. In some embodiments, an
optical sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112 on the
front of the device so that the touch screen display may be used as a viewfinder for still
and/or video image acquisition. In some embodiments, an optical sensor is located on the
front of the device so that the user's image may be obtained for video conferencing while the
user views the other video conference participants on the touch screen display. In some
embodiments, the position of optical sensor 164 can be changed by the user (e.g., by rotating
the lens and the sensor in the device housing) so that a single optical sensor 164 may be used
along with the touch screen display for both video conferencing and still and/or video image
acquisition.
[0114]       Device 100 optionally also includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165.
FIG. 1A shows a contact intensity sensor coupled to intensity sensor controller 159 in I/O
subsystem 106. Contact intensity sensor 165 optionally includes one or more piezoresistive
strain gauges, capacitive force sensors, electric force sensors, piezoelectric force sensors,
optical force sensors, capacitive touch-sensitive surfaces, or other intensity sensors (e.g.,
sensors used to measure the force (or pressure) of a contact on a touch-sensitive surface).
Contact intensity sensor 165 receives contact intensity information (e.g., pressure information
or a proxy for pressure information) from the environment. In some embodiments, at least
one contact intensity sensor is collocated with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface
(e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112). In some embodiments, at least one contact
intensity sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112,
which is located on the front of device 100.

1002203380
[0115]      Device 100 may also include one or more proximity sensors 166. FIG. 1A shows
proximity sensor 166 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately, proximity sensor 166
may be coupled to input controller 160 in I/O subsystem 106. Proximity sensor 166 may
perform as described in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 11/241,839, "Proximity Detector In
Handheld Device"; 11/240,788, "Proximity Detector In Handheld Device"; 11/620,702,

"Automated Response To And Sensing Of User Activity In Portable Devices"; and
 11/638,251, "Methods And Systems For Automatic Configuration Of Peripherals," which are
hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In some embodiments, the proximity
sensor turns off and disables touch screen 112 when the multifunction device is placed near
the user's ear (e.g., when the user is making a phone call).
[0116]      Device 100 optionally also includes one or more tactile output generators 167.
FIG. 1A shows a tactile output generator coupled to haptic feedback controller 161 in I/O
subsystem 106. Tactile output generator 167 optionally includes one or more electroacoustic
devices such as speakers or other audio components and/or electromechanical devices that
convert energy into linear motion such as a motor, solenoid, electroactive polymer,
piezoelectric actuator, electrostatic actuator, or other tactile output generating component
(e.g., a component that converts electrical signals into tactile outputs on the device). Contact
intensity sensor 165 receives tactile feedback generation instructions from haptic feedback
module 133 and generates tactile outputs on device 100 that are capable of being sensed by a
user of device 100. In some embodiments, at least one tactile output generator is collocated
with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112) and,
optionally, generates a tactile output by moving the touch-sensitive surface vertically (e.g.,
in/out of a surface of device 100) or laterally (e.g., back and forth in the same plane as a
surface of device 100). In some embodiments, at least one tactile output generator sensor is
located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112, which is located on the
front of device 100.
[0117]      Device 100 may also include one or more accelerometers 168. FIG. 1A shows
accelerometer 168 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately, accelerometer 168 may
be coupled to an input controller 160 in I/O subsystem 106. Accelerometer 168 may perform
as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050190059, "Acceleration-based Theft
Detection System for Portable Electronic Devices," and U.S. Patent Publication No.

embodiments, information is displayed on the touch screen display in a portrait view or a
landscape view based on an analysis of data received from the one or more accelerometers.
Device 100 optionally includes, in addition to accelerometer(s) 168, a magnetometer (not
shown) and a GPS (or GLONASS or other global navigation system) receiver (not shown) for
obtaining information concerning the location and orientation (e.g., portrait or landscape) of
device 100.
[0118]      In some embodiments, the software components stored in memory 102 include
operating system 126, communication module (or set of instructions) 128, contact/motion
module (or set of instructions) 130, graphics module (or set of instructions) 132, text input
module (or set of instructions) 134, Global Positioning System (GPS) module (or set of
instructions) 135, and applications (or sets of instructions) 136. Furthermore, in some
embodiments, memory 102 (FIG. 1A) or 370 (FIG. 3) stores device/global internal state 157,
as shown in FIGS. 1A and 3. Device/global internal state 157 includes one or more of: active
application state, indicating which applications, if any, are currently active; display state,
indicating what applications, views or other information occupy various regions of touch
screen display 112; sensor state, including information obtained from the device's various
sensors and input control devices 116; and location information concerning the device's
location and/or attitude.
[0119]      Operating system 126 (e.g., Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX, OS X, iOS,
WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks) includes various software
components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks (e.g., memory
management, storage device control, power management, etc.) and facilitates communication
between various hardware and software components.
[0120]      Communication module 128 facilitates communication with other devices over
one or more external ports 124 and also includes various software components for handling
data received by RF circuitry 108 and/or external port 124. External port 124 (e.g., Universal
Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to other devices or
indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.). In some embodiments, the
external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as, or similar to and/or
compatible with, the 30-pin connector used on iPod@ (trademark of Apple Inc.) devices.

1002203380
[0121]      Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects contact with touch screen 112 (in
conjunction with display controller 156) and other touch-sensitive devices (e.g., a touchpad
or physical click wheel). Contact/motion module 130 includes various software components
for performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as determining if
contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining an intensity of the
contact (e.g., the force or pressure of the contact or a substitute for the force or pressure of the
contact), determining if there is movement of the contact and tracking the movement across
the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more finger-dragging events), and
determining if the contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a finger-up event or a break in contact).
Contact/motion module 130 receives contact data from the touch-sensitive surface.
Determining movement of the point of contact, which is represented by a series of contact
data, optionally includes determining speed (magnitude), velocity (magnitude and direction),
and/or an acceleration (a change in magnitude and/or direction) of the point of contact. These
operations are, optionally, applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts) or to multiple
simultaneous contacts (e.g., "multitouch"/multiple finger contacts). In some embodiments,
contact/motion module 130 and display controller 156 detect contact on a touchpad.
[0122]      In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 uses a set of one or more
intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user (e.g., to
determine whether a user has "clicked" on an icon). In some embodiments, at least a subset
of the intensity thresholds are determined in accordance with software parameters (e.g., the
intensity thresholds are not determined by the activation thresholds of particular physical
actuators and can be adjusted without changing the physical hardware of device 100). For
example, a mouse "click" threshold of a trackpad or touch screen display can be set to any of
a large range of predefined threshold values without changing the trackpad or touch screen
display hardware. Additionally, in some implementations, a user of the device is provided
with software settings for adjusting one or more of the set of intensity thresholds (e.g., by
adjusting individual intensity thresholds and/or by adjusting a plurality of intensity thresholds
at once with a system-level click "intensity" parameter).
[0123]      Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects a gesture input by a user. Different
gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns (e.g., different motions,
timings, and/or intensities of detected contacts). Thus, a gesture is, optionally, detected by
detecting a particular contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture includes
                                                  22

1002203380
detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up (liftoff) event at the same
position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the position of
an icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the touch-sensitive surface
includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or more finger-dragging

[0124]      Graphics module 132 includes various known software components for rendering
and displaying graphics on touch screen 112 or other display, including components for
changing the visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation, contrast, or other visual

[0148]      Each of the above-identified modules and applications corresponds to a set of
executable instructions for performing one or more functions described above and the
methods described in this application (e.g., the computer-implemented methods and other
information processing methods described herein). These modules (e.g., sets of instructions)
need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures, or modules, and thus
various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise rearranged in various
embodiments. For example, video player module may be combined with music player
module into a single module (e.g., video and music player module 152, FIG. 1A). In some
embodiments, memory 102 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified
above. Furthermore, memory 102 may store additional modules and data structures not
described above.
[0149]      In some embodiments, device 100 is a device where operation of a predefined set
of functions on the device is performed exclusively through a touch screen and/or a touchpad.
By using a touch screen and/or a touchpad as the primary input control device for operation
of device 100, the number of physical input control devices (such as push buttons, dials, and
the like) on device 100 may be reduced.
[0150]      The predefined set of functions that are performed exclusively through a touch
screen and/or a touchpad optionally include navigation between user interfaces. In some
embodiments, the touchpad, when touched by the user, navigates device 100 to a main, home,
or root menu from any user interface that is displayed on device 100. In such embodiments, a
"menu button" is implemented using a touchpad. In some other embodiments, the menu
button is a physical push button or other physical input control device instead of a touchpad.
[0151]      FIG. 1B is a block diagram illustrating exemplary components for event handling
in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 (FIG. 1A) or
370 (FIG. 3) includes event sorter 170 (e.g., in operating system 126) and a respective
application 136-1 (e.g., any of the aforementioned applications 137-151, 155, 380-390).
[0152]      Event sorter 170 receives event information and determines the application 136-1
and application view 191 of application 136-1 to which to deliver the event information.
Event sorter 170 includes event monitor 171 and event dispatcher module 174. In some
embodiments, application 136-1 includes application internal state 192, which indicates the
current application view(s) displayed on touch-sensitive display 112 when the application is
                                                 29

1002203380
active or executing. In some embodiments, device/global internal state 157 is used by event
sorter 170 to determine which application(s) is (are) currently active, and application internal
state 192 is used by event sorter 170 to determine application views 191 to which to deliver
event information.
[0153]       In some embodiments, application internal state 192 includes additional
information, such as one or more of: resume information to be used when application 136-1
resumes execution, user interface state information that indicates information being displayed
or that is ready for display by application 136-1, a state queue for enabling the user to go
back to a prior state or view of application 136-1, and a redo/undo queue of previous actions
taken by the user.
[0154]       Event monitor 171 receives event information from peripherals interface 118.
Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on touch
sensitive display 112, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface 118 transmits
information it receives from 11O subsystem 106 or a sensor, such as proximity sensor 166,
accelerometer(s) 168, and/or microphone 113 (through audio circuitry 110). Information that
peripherals interface 118 receives from I/O subsystem 106 includes information from touch
sensitive display 112 or a touch-sensitive surface.
[0155]       In some embodiments, event monitor 171 sends requests to the peripherals
interface 118 at predetermined intervals. In response, peripherals interface 118 transmits
event information. In other embodiments, peripherals interface 118 transmits event
information only when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a
predetermined noise threshold and/or for more than a predetermined duration).
[0156]       In some embodiments, event sorter 170 also includes a hit view determination
module 172 and/or an active event recognizer determination module 173.
[0157]       Hit view determination module 172 provides software procedures for determining
where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views when touch-sensitive display
112 displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and other elements that a
user can see on the display.
[0158]       Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set of
views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which
                                                  30

1002203380
information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a
respective application) in which a touch is detected may correspond to programmatic levels
within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For example, the lowest level
view in which a touch is detected may be called the hit view, and the set of events that are
recognized as proper inputs may be determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the
initial touch that begins a touch-based gesture.
[0159]       Hit view determination module 172 receives information related to sub-events of a
touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized in a hierarchy, hit
view determination module 172 identifies a hit view as the lowest view in the hierarchy
which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view is the lowest level
view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (e.g., the first sub-event in the sequence of sub
events that form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is identified by the hit view
determination module 172, the hit view typically receives all sub-events related to the same
touch or input source for which it was identified as the hit view.
[0160]       Active event recognizer determination module 173 determines which view or
views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some
embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that only the hit
view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, active event
recognizer determination module 173 determines that all views that include the physical
location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and therefore determines that all actively
involved views should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments,
even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to the area associated with one particular
view, views higher in the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved views.
[0161]       Event dispatcher module 174 dispatches the event information to an event
recognizer (e.g., event recognizer 180). In embodiments including active event recognizer
determination module 173, event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to an
event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination module 173. In some
embodiments, event dispatcher module 174 stores in an event queue the event information,
which is retrieved by a respective event receiver 182.
[0162]       In some embodiments, operating system 126 includes event sorter 170.
Alternatively, application 136-1 includes event sorter 170. In yet other embodiments, event
                                                 31

1002203380
sorter 170 is a stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in memory 102, such
as contact/motion module 130.
[0163]      In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes a plurality of event handlers
190 and one or more application views 191, each of which includes instructions for handling
touch events that occur within a respective view of the application's user interface. Each
application view 191 of the application 136-1 includes one or more event recognizers 180.
Typically, a respective application view 191 includes a plurality of event recognizers 180. In
other embodiments, one or more of event recognizers 180 are part of a separate module, such
as a user interface kit (not shown) or a higher level object from which application 136-1
inherits methods and other properties. In some embodiments, a respective event handler 190
includes one or more of: data updater 176, object updater 177, GUI updater 178, and/or event
data 179 received from event sorter 170. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater
176, object updater 177, or GUI updater 178 to update the application internal state 192.
Alternatively, one or more of the application views 191 include one or more respective event
handlers 190. Also, in some embodiments, one or more of data updater 176, object updater
177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a respective application view 191.
[0164]      A respective event recognizer 180 receives event information (e.g., event data
179) from event sorter 170 and identifies an event from the event information. Event
recognizer 180 includes event receiver 182 and event comparator 184. In some
embodiments, event recognizer 180 also includes at least a subset of: metadata 183, and event
delivery instructions 188 (which may include sub-event delivery instructions).
[0165]      Event receiver 182 receives event information from event sorter 170. The event
information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch
movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional
information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a
touch, the event information may also include speed and direction of the sub-event. In some
embodiments, events include rotation of the device from one orientation to another (e.g.,
from a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the event
information includes corresponding information about the current orientation (also called
device attitude) of the device.
                                                  32

1002203380
[0166]       Event comparator 184 compares the event information to predefined event or sub
event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event, or
determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event
comparator 184 includes event definitions 186. Event definitions 186 contain definitions of
events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (187-1), event 2 (187
2), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event (187) include, for example,
touch begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple touching. In one
example, the definition for event 1 (187-1) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double
tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, a first liftoff (touch end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch
(touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, and a second liftoff (touch
end) for a predetermined phase. In another example, the definition for event 2 (187-2) is a
dragging on a displayed object. The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact) on
the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch
sensitive display 112, and liftoff of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event
also includes information for one or more associated event handlers 190.
[0167]       In some embodiments, event definition 187 includes a definition of an event for a
respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator 184 performs a hit
test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event. For example, in
an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on touch-sensitive
display 112, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display 112, event comparator 184
performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface objects is associated with
the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated with a respective event handler
190, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to determine which event handler 190
should be activated. For example, event comparator 184 selects an event handler associated
with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit test.
[0168]       In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event (187) also includes
delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been determined
whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event recognizer's
event type.
[0169]       When a respective event recognizer 180 determines that the series of sub-events
do not match any of the events in event definitions 186, the respective event recognizer 180
                                                   33

1002203380
enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which it disregards
subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other event recognizers,
if any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process sub-events of an
ongoing touch-based gesture.
[0170]       In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 includes metadata 183
with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event delivery system
should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers. In some
embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
how event recognizers may interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another. In some
embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
whether sub-events are delivered to varying levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.
[0171]       In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 activates event handler
190 associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event are
recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 delivers event
information associated with the event to event handler 190. Activating an event handler 190
is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In some
embodiments, event recognizer 180 throws a flag associated with the recognized event, and
event handler 190 associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a predefined process.
[0172]       In some embodiments, event delivery instructions 188 include sub-event delivery
instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating an event
handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to event
handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views. Event
handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views receive the
event information and perform a predetermined process.
[0173]       In some embodiments, data updater 176 creates and updates data used in
application 136-1. For example, data updater 176 updates the telephone number used in
contacts module 137, or stores a video file used in video player module. In some
embodiments, object updater 177 creates and updates objects used in application 136-1. For
example, object updater 177 creates a new user-interface object or updates the position of a
user-interface object. GUI updater 178 updates the GUI. For example, GUI updater 178
                                                  34

1002203380
prepares display information and sends it to graphics module 132 for display on a touch
sensitive display.
[0174]       In some embodiments, event handler(s) 190 includes or has access to data updater
176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178. In some embodiments, data updater 176,
object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a single module of a respective
application 136-1 or application view 191. In other embodiments, they are included in two or
more software modules.
[0175]       It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event handling of
user touches on touch-sensitive displays also applies to other forms of user inputs to operate
multifunction devices 100 with input devices, not all of which are initiated on touch screens.
For example, mouse movement and mouse button presses, optionally coordinated with single
or multiple keyboard presses or holds; contact movements such as taps, drags, scrolls, etc. on
touchpads; pen stylus inputs; movement of the device; oral instructions; detected eye
movements; biometric inputs; and/or any combination thereof are optionally utilized as inputs
corresponding to sub-events which define an event to be recognized.
[0176]       FIG. 2 illustrates a portable multifunction device 100 having a touch screen 112 in
accordance with some embodiments. The touch screen optionally displays one or more
graphics within user interface (UI) 200. In this embodiment, as well as others described
below, a user is enabled to select one or more of the graphics by making a gesture on the
graphics, for example, with one or more fingers 202 (not drawn to scale in the figure) or one
or more styluses 203 (not drawn to scale in the figure). In some embodiments, selection of
one or more graphics occurs when the user breaks contact with the one or more graphics. In
some embodiments, the gesture optionally includes one or more taps, one or more swipes
(from left to right, right to left, upward and/or downward), and/or a rolling of a finger (from
right to left, left to right, upward and/or downward) that has made contact with device 100.
In some implementations or circumstances, inadvertent contact with a graphic does not select
the graphic. For example, a swipe gesture that sweeps over an application icon optionally
does not select the corresponding application when the gesture corresponding to selection is a
tap.
[0177]       Device 100 may also include one or more physical buttons, such as "home" or
menu button 204. As described previously, menu button 204 may be used to navigate to any
                                                   35

1002203380
application 136 in a set of applications that may be executed on device 100. Alternatively, in
some embodiments, the menu button is implemented as a soft key in a GUI displayed on
touch screen 112.
[0178]      In one embodiment, device 100 includes touch screen 112, menu button 204, push
button 206 for powering the device on/off and locking the device, volume adjustment
button(s) 208, subscriber identity module (SIM) card slot 210, headset jack 212, and
docking/charging external port 124. Push button 206 is, optionally, used to turn the power
on/off on the device by depressing the button and holding the button in the depressed state for
a predefined time interval; to lock the device by depressing the button and releasing the
button before the predefined time interval has elapsed; and/or to unlock the device or initiate
an unlock process. In an alternative embodiment, device 100 also accepts verbal input for
activation or deactivation of some functions through microphone 113. Device 100 also,
optionally, includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of
contacts on touch screen 112 and/or one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating
tactile outputs for a user of device 100.
[0179]      FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary multifunction device with a display and
a touch-sensitive surface in accordance with some embodiments. Device 300 need not be
portable. In some embodiments, device 300 is a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a
tablet computer, a multimedia player device, a navigation device, an educational device (such
as a child's learning toy), a gaming system, or a control device (e.g., a home or industrial
controller). Device 300 typically includes one or more processing units (CPUs) 310, one or
more network or other communications interfaces 360, memory 370, and one or more
communication buses 320 for interconnecting these components. Communication buses 320
optionally include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls
communications between system components. Device 300 includes input/output (1/0)
interface 330 comprising display 340, which is typically a touch screen display. I/O interface
330 also optionally includes a keyboard and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 350 and
touchpad 355, tactile output generator 357 for generating tactile outputs on device 300 (e.g.,
similar to tactile output generator(s) 167 described above with reference to FIG. 1A), sensors
359 (e.g., optical, acceleration, proximity, touch-sensitive, and/or contact intensity sensors
similar to contact intensity sensor(s) 165 described above with reference to FIG. 1A).
Memory 370 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR
                                                  36

1002203380
RAM, or other random access solid state memory devices; and optionally includes non
volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage
devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices. Memory 370
optionally includes one or more storage devices remotely located from CPU(s) 310. In some
embodiments, memory 370 stores programs, modules, and data structures analogous to the
programs, modules, and data structures stored in memory 102 of portable multifunction
device 100 (FIG. 1A), or a subset thereof. Furthermore, memory 370 optionally stores
additional programs, modules, and data structures not present in memory 102 of portable
multifunction device 100. For example, memory 370 of device 300 optionally stores drawing
module 380, presentation module 382, word processing module 384, website creation module
386, disk authoring module 388, and/or spreadsheet module 390, while memory 102 of
portable multifunction device 100 (FIG. 1A) optionally does not store these modules.
[0180]       Each of the above-identified elements in FIG. 3 may be stored in one or more of
the previously mentioned memory devices. Each of the above-identified modules
corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above. The above
identified modules or programs (e.g., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as
separate software programs, procedures, or modules, and thus various subsets of these
modules may be combined or otherwise rearranged in various embodiments. In some
embodiments, memory 370 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified
above. Furthermore, memory 370 may store additional modules and data structures not
described above.
[0181]       Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces that may be
implemented on, for example, portable multifunction device 100.
[0182]       FIG. 4A illustrates an exemplary user interface for a menu of applications on
portable multifunction device 100 in accordance with some embodiments. Similar user
interfaces may be implemented on device 300. In some embodiments, user interface 400
includes the following elements, or a subset or superset thereof:
     "    Signal strength indicator(s) 402 for wireless communication(s), such as cellular and
         Wi-Fi signals;
    *    Time 404;

    *    Bluetooth indicator 405;
    *    Battery status indicator 406;
    *    Tray 408 with icons for frequently used applications, such as:

                 includes an indicator 414 of the number of missed calls or voicemail
                 messages;
             o   Icon 418 for e-mail client module 140, labeled "Mail," which optionally
                 includes an indicator 410 of the number of unread e-mails;
             o   Icon 420 for browser module 147, labeled "Browser;" and
             o   Icon 422 for video and music player module 152, also referred to as iPod
                 (trademark of Apple Inc.) module 152, labeled "iPod;" and
    *    Icons for other applications, such as:
             o   Icon 424 for IM module 141, labeled "Messages;"
             o   Icon 426 for calendar module 148, labeled "Calendar;"
             o   Icon 428 for image management module 144, labeled "Photos;"
             o   Icon 430 for camera module 143, labeled "Camera;"
             o   Icon 432 for online video module 155, labeled "Online Video;"

             o   Icon 442 for workout support module 142, labeled "Workout Support;"
             o   Icon 444 for notes module 153, labeled "Notes;" and
             o   Icon 446 for a settings application or module, labeled "Settings," which
                 provides access to settings for device 100 and its various applications 136.

1002203380
[0183]      It should be noted that the icon labels illustrated in FIG. 4A are merely exemplary.
For example, icon 422 for video and music player module 152 may optionally be labeled
"Music" or "Music Player." Other labels are, optionally, used for various application icons.
In some embodiments, a label for a respective application icon includes a name of an
application corresponding to the respective application icon. In some embodiments, a label
for a particular application icon is distinct from a name of an application corresponding to the
particular application icon.
[0184]      FIG. 4B illustrates an exemplary user interface on a device (e.g., device 300, FIG.
3) with a touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a tablet or touchpad 355, FIG. 3) that is separate
from the display 450 (e.g., touch screen display 112). Device 300 also, optionally, includes
one or more contact intensity sensors (e.g., one or more of sensors 357) for detecting intensity
of contacts on touch-sensitive surface 451 and/or one or more tactile output generators 359
for generating tactile outputs for a user of device 300.
[0185]      Although some of the examples which follow will be given with reference to
inputs on touch screen display 112 (where the touch-sensitive surface and the display are
combined), in some embodiments, the device detects inputs on a touch-sensitive surface that
is separate from the display, as shown in FIG. 4B. In some embodiments, the touch-sensitive
surface (e.g., 451 in FIG. 4B) has a primary axis (e.g., 452 in FIG. 4B) that corresponds to a
primary axis (e.g., 453 in FIG. 4B) on the display (e.g., 450). In accordance with these
embodiments, the device detects contacts (e.g., 460 and 462 in FIG. 4B) with the touch
sensitive surface 451 at locations that correspond to respective locations on the display (e.g.,
in FIG. 4B, 460 corresponds to 468 and 462 corresponds to 470). In this way, user inputs
(e.g., contacts 460 and 462, and movements thereof) detected by the device on the touch
sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in FIG. 4B) are used by the device to manipulate the user interface
on the display (e.g., 450 in FIG. 4B) of the multifunction device when the touch-sensitive
surface is separate from the display. It should be understood that similar methods are,
optionally, used for other user interfaces described herein.
[0186]      Additionally, while the following examples are given primarily with reference to
finger inputs (e.g., finger contacts, finger tap gestures, finger swipe gestures), it should be
understood that, in some embodiments, one or more of the finger inputs are replaced with
input from another input device (e.g., a mouse-based input or stylus input). For example, a
swipe gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click (e.g., instead of a contact) followed
                                                   39

1002203380
by movement of the cursor along the path of the swipe (e.g., instead of movement of the
contact). As another example, a tap gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click while
the cursor is located over the location of the tap gesture (e.g., instead of detection of the
contact followed by ceasing to detect the contact). Similarly, when multiple user inputs are
simultaneously detected, it should be understood that multiple computer mice are, optionally,
used simultaneously, or a mouse and finger contacts are, optionally, used simultaneously.
[0187]       FIG. 5A illustrates exemplary personal electronic device 500. Device 500
includes body 502. In some embodiments, device 500 can include some or all of the features
described with respect to devices 100 and 300 (e.g., FIGS. 1A-4B). In some embodiments,
device 500 has touch-sensitive display screen 504, hereafter touch screen 504. Alternatively,
or in addition to touch screen 504, device 500 has a display and a touch-sensitive surface. As
with devices 100 and 300, in some embodiments, touch screen 504 (or the touch-sensitive
surface) may have one or more intensity sensors for detecting intensity of contacts (e.g.,
touches) being applied. The one or more intensity sensors of touch screen 504 (or the touch
sensitive surface) can provide output data that represents the intensity of touches. The user
interface of device 500 can respond to touches based on their intensity, meaning that touches
of different intensities can invoke different user interface operations on device 500.
[0188]       Techniques for detecting and processing touch intensity may be found, for
example, in related applications: International Patent Application Serial No.
PCT/US2013/040061, titled "Device, Method, and Graphical User Interface for Displaying
User Interface Objects Corresponding to an Application," filed May 8, 2013, and
International Patent Application Serial No. PCT/US2013/069483, titled "Device, Method,
and Graphical User Interface for Transitioning Between Touch Input to Display Output
Relationships," filed November 11, 2013, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference
in their entirety.
[0189]       In some embodiments, device 500 has one or more input mechanisms 506 and
508. Input mechanisms 506 and 508, if included, can be physical. Examples of physical
input mechanisms include push buttons and rotatable mechanisms. In some embodiments,
device 500 has one or more attachment mechanisms. Such attachment mechanisms, if
included, can permit attachment of device 500 with, for example, hats, eyewear, earrings,
necklaces, shirts, jackets, bracelets, watch straps, chains, trousers, belts, shoes, purses,
                                                  40

1002203380
backpacks, and so forth. These attachment mechanisms may permit device 500 to be worn
by a user.
[0190]      FIG. 5B depicts exemplary personal electronic device 500. In some embodiments,
device 500 can include some or all of the components described with respect to FIGS. 1A,
1B, and 3. Device 500 has bus 512 that operatively couples I/O section 514 with one or more
computer processors 516 and memory 518. I/O section 514 can be connected to display 504,
which can have touch-sensitive component 522 and, optionally, touch-intensity sensitive
component 524. In addition, I/O section 514 can be connected with communication unit 530
for receiving application and operating system data, using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, near field
communication (NFC), cellular, and/or other wireless communication techniques. Device
500 can include input mechanisms 506 and/or 508. Input mechanism 506 may be a rotatable
input device or a depressible and rotatable input device, for example. Input mechanism 508
may be a button, in some examples.
[0191]      Input mechanism 508 may be a microphone, in some examples. Personal
electronic device 500 can include various sensors, such as GPS sensor 532, accelerometer
534, directional sensor 540 (e.g., compass), gyroscope 536, motion sensor 538, and/or a
combination thereof, all of which can be operatively connected to I/O section 514.
[0192]      Memory 518 of personal electronic device 500 can be a non-transitory computer
readable storage medium, for storing computer-executable instructions, which, when
executed by one or more computer processors 516, for example, can cause the computer
processors to perform the techniques described above, including processes 2400-3300
(FIGS. 24-33). The computer-executable instructions can also be stored and/or transported
within any non-transitory computer-readable storage medium for use by or in connection with
an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based system,
processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the instructions from the
instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the instructions. For purposes
of this document, a "non-transitory computer-readable storage medium" can be any medium
that can tangibly contain or store computer-executable instructions for use by or in
connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The non-transitory
computer-readable storage medium can include, but is not limited to, magnetic, optical,
and/or semiconductor storages. Examples of such storage include magnetic disks, optical
discs based on CD, DVD, or Blu-ray technologies, as well as persistent solid-state memory
                                                41

1002203380
such as flash, solid-state drives, and the like. Personal electronic device 500 is not limited to
the components and configuration of FIG. 5B, but can include other or additional components
in multiple configurations.
[0193]       As used here, the term "affordance" refers to a user-interactive graphical user
interface object that may be displayed on the display screen of devices 100, 300, and/or 500
(FIGS. 1, 3, and 5). For example, an image (e.g., icon), a button, and text (e.g., hyperlink)
may each constitute an affordance.
[0194]       As used herein, the term "focus selector" refers to an input element that indicates
a current part of a user interface with which a user is interacting. In some implementations
that include a cursor or other location marker, the cursor acts as a "focus selector" so that
when an input (e.g., a press input) is detected on a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touchpad 355
in FIG. 3 or touch-sensitive surface 451 in FIG. 4B) while the cursor is over a particular user
interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider or other user interface element), the
particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some
implementations that include a touch screen display (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112
in FIG. 1A or touch screen 112 in FIG. 4A) that enables direct interaction with user interface
elements on the touch screen display, a detected contact on the touch screen acts as a "focus
selector" so that when an input (e.g., a press input by the contact) is detected on the touch
screen display at a location of a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window,
slider, or other user interface element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in
accordance with the detected input. In some implementations, focus is moved from one
region of a user interface to another region of the user interface without corresponding
movement of a cursor or movement of a contact on a touch screen display (e.g., by using a
tab key or arrow keys to move focus from one button to another button); in these
implementations, the focus selector moves in accordance with movement of focus between
different regions of the user interface. Without regard to the specific form taken by the focus
selector, the focus selector is generally the user interface element (or contact on a touch
screen display) that is controlled by the user so as to communicate the user's intended
interaction with the user interface (e.g., by indicating, to the device, the element of the user
interface with which the user is intending to interact). For example, the location of a focus
selector (e.g., a cursor, a contact, or a selection box) over a respective button while a press
input is detected on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touchpad or touch screen) will indicate
                                                    42

1002203380
that the user is intending to activate the respective button (as opposed to other user interface
elements shown on a display of the device).
[0195]       As used in the specification and claims, the term "characteristic intensity" of a
contact refers to a characteristic of the contact based on one or more intensities of the contact.
In some embodiments, the characteristic intensity is based on multiple intensity samples. The
characteristic intensity is, optionally, based on a predefined number of intensity samples, or a
set of intensity samples collected during a predetermined time period (e.g., 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5,
1, 2, 5, 10 seconds) relative to a predefined event (e.g., after detecting the contact, prior to
detecting liftoff of the contact, before or after detecting a start of movement of the contact,
prior to detecting an end of the contact, before or after detecting an increase in intensity of the
contact, and/or before or after detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact). A
characteristic intensity of a contact is, optionally based on one or more of: a maximum value
of the intensities of the contact, a mean value of the intensities of the contact, an average
value of the intensities of the contact, a top 10 percentile value of the intensities of the
contact, a value at the half maximum of the intensities of the contact, a value at the 90 percent
maximum of the intensities of the contact, or the like. In some embodiments, the duration of
the contact is used in determining the characteristic intensity (e.g., when the characteristic
intensity is an average of the intensity of the contact over time). In some embodiments, the
characteristic intensity is compared to a set of one or more intensity thresholds to determine
whether an operation has been performed by a user. For example, the set of one or more
intensity thresholds may include a first intensity threshold and a second intensity threshold.
In this example, a contact with a characteristic intensity that does not exceed the first
threshold results in a first operation, a contact with a characteristic intensity that exceeds the
first intensity threshold and does not exceed the second intensity threshold results in a second
operation, and a contact with a characteristic intensity that exceeds the second threshold
results in a third operation. In some embodiments, a comparison between the characteristic
intensity and one or more thresholds is used to determine whether or not to perform one or
more operations (e.g., whether to perform a respective operation or forgo performing the
respective operation) rather than being used to determine whether to perform a first operation
or a second operation.
[0196]       In some embodiments, a portion of a gesture is identified for purposes of
determining a characteristic intensity. For example, a touch-sensitive surface may receive a
                                                   43

1002203380
continuous swipe contact transitioning from a start location and reaching an end location, at
which point the intensity of the contact increases. In this example, the characteristic intensity
of the contact at the end location may be based on only a portion of the continuous swipe
contact, and not the entire swipe contact (e.g., only the portion of the swipe contact at the end
location). In some embodiments, a smoothing algorithm may be applied to the intensities of
the swipe contact prior to determining the characteristic intensity of the contact. For
example, the smoothing algorithm optionally includes one or more of: an unweighted sliding
average smoothing algorithm, a triangular smoothing algorithm, a median filter smoothing
algorithm, and/or an exponential smoothing algorithm. In some circumstances, these
smoothing algorithms eliminate narrow spikes or dips in the intensities of the swipe contact
for purposes of determining a characteristic intensity.
[0197]      The intensity of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface may be characterized
relative to one or more intensity thresholds, such as a contact-detection intensity threshold, a
light press intensity threshold, a deep press intensity threshold, and/or one or more other
intensity thresholds. In some embodiments, the light press intensity threshold corresponds to
an intensity at which the device will perform operations typically associated with clicking a
button of a physical mouse or a trackpad. In some embodiments, the deep press intensity
threshold corresponds to an intensity at which the device will perform operations that are
different from operations typically associated with clicking a button of a physical mouse or a
trackpad. In some embodiments, when a contact is detected with a characteristic intensity
below the light press intensity threshold (e.g., and above a nominal contact-detection
intensity threshold below which the contact is no longer detected), the device will move a
focus selector in accordance with movement of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface
without performing an operation associated with the light press intensity threshold or the
deep press intensity threshold. Generally, unless otherwise stated, these intensity thresholds
are consistent between different sets of user interface figures.
[0198]      An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the
light press intensity threshold to an intensity between the light press intensity threshold and
the deep press intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as a "light press" input. An
increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the deep press
intensity threshold to an intensity above the deep press intensity threshold is sometimes
referred to as a "deep press" input. An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from
                                                   44

1002203380
an intensity below the contact-detection intensity threshold to an intensity between the
contact-detection intensity threshold and the light press intensity threshold is sometimes
referred to as detecting the contact on the touch-surface. A decrease of characteristic
intensity of the contact from an intensity above the contact-detection intensity threshold to an
intensity below the contact-detection intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as detecting
liftoff of the contact from the touch-surface. In some embodiments, the contact-detection
intensity threshold is zero. In some embodiments, the contact-detection intensity threshold is
greater than zero.
[0199]       In some embodiments described herein, one or more operations are performed in
response to detecting a gesture that includes a respective press input or in response to
detecting the respective press input performed with a respective contact (or a plurality of
contacts), where the respective press input is detected based at least in part on detecting an
increase in intensity of the contact (or plurality of contacts) above a press-input intensity
threshold. In some embodiments, the respective operation is performed in response to
detecting the increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity
threshold (e.g., a "down stroke" of the respective press input). In some embodiments, the
press input includes an increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input
intensity threshold and a subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact below the press-input
intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the
subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below the press-input threshold
(e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input).
[0200]       In some embodiments, the device employs intensity hysteresis to avoid accidental
inputs sometimes ten-ned "jitter," where the device defines or selects a hysteresis intensity
threshold with a predefined relationship to the press-input intensity threshold (e.g., the
hysteresis intensity threshold is X intensity units lower than the press-input intensity
threshold or the hysteresis intensity threshold is 75%, 90%, or some reasonable proportion of
the press-input intensity threshold). Thus, in some embodiments, the press input includes an
increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity threshold and a
subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold that
corresponds to the press-input intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed
in response to detecting the subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below
the hysteresis intensity threshold (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input).
                                                   45

1002203380
Similarly, in some embodiments, the press input is detected only when the device detects an
increase in intensity of the contact from an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity
threshold to an intensity at or above the press-input intensity threshold and, optionally, a
subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact to an intensity at or below the hysteresis
intensity, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the press input
(e.g., the increase in intensity of the contact or the decrease in intensity of the contact,
depending on the circumstances).
[0201]       For ease of explanation, the descriptions of operations performed in response to a
press input associated with a press-input intensity threshold or in response to a gesture
including the press input are, optionally, triggered in response to detecting either: an increase
in intensity of a contact above the press-input intensity threshold, an increase in intensity of a
contact from an intensity below the hysteresis intensity threshold to an intensity above the
press-input intensity threshold, a decrease in intensity of the contact below the press-input
intensity threshold, and/or a decrease in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity
threshold corresponding to the press-input intensity threshold. Additionally, in examples
where an operation is described as being performed in response to detecting a decrease in
intensity of a contact below the press-input intensity threshold, the operation is, optionally,
performed in response to detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact below a hysteresis
intensity threshold corresponding to, and lower than, the press-input intensity threshold.
[0202]       As used herein, an "installed application" refers to a software application that has
been downloaded onto an electronic device (e.g., devices 100, 300, and/or 500) and is ready
to be launched (e.g., become opened) on the device. In some embodiments, a downloaded
application becomes an installed application by way of an installation program that extracts
program portions from a downloaded package and integrates the extracted portions with the
operating system of the computer system.
[0203]       As used herein, the term "open application" or "executing application" refers to a
software application with retained state information (e.g., as part of device/global internal
state 157 and/or application internal state 192). An open or executing application may be any
one of the following types of applications:
[0204]       an active application, which is currently displayed on a display screen of the
device that the application is being used on;
                                                    46

1002203380
[0205]       a background application (or background processes), which is not currently
displayed, but one or more processes for the application are being processed by one or more
processors; and
[0206]       a suspended or hibernated application, which is not running, but has state
information that is stored in memory (volatile and non-volatile, respectively) and that can be
used to resume execution of the application.
[0207]       As used herein, the term "closed application" refers to software applications
without retained state information (e.g., state information for closed applications is not stored
in a memory of the device). Accordingly, closing an application includes stopping and/or
removing application processes for the application and removing state information for the
application from the memory of the device. Generally, opening a second application while in
a first application does not close the first application. When the second application is
displayed and the first application ceases to be displayed, the first application becomes a
background application.
1.       Calendar User Interface Screens
[0208]       Attention is now directed to user interface screens that support a calendar
application that is operable on portable electronic devices. In the discussion that follow,
device 500 (FIG. 5) is used repeatedly as an example of a portable electronic device that
supports calendar functionality, for sake of consistency and brevity. It is noted that the
described embodiments are not limited to device 500, and may be implemented onto other
portable electronic devices, for example devices 100 and 300 (FIGS. 1 and 3).
[0209]       Exemplary calendar user interface screens are now discussed with reference to
FIGS. 6A-6E. FIG. 6A illustrates exemplary user interface screen 600 which may be referred
to as the "month screen". The month screen illustrates one or more days of a month. As
shown, month 602 (i.e., February) has twenty-eight days as indicated by the numbers "1"
through "28." Month screen 600 may visually emphasize the current day. In some
embodiments, the current day is emphasized using an affordance such as affordance 604. In
the illustrated example, affordance 604 has a circular shape and encircles the text (i.e., "16")
representing the current day. Affordance 604 may, however, take on other shapes. In some
embodiments, the current day is emphasized by altering the text representing the current day.
                                                   47

1002203380
For example (not shown), the text may be bolded, brighten, flash, and/or become more
opaque.
[0210]       Month screen 600 is interactive. For example, month screen 600 may be
scrollable to reveal days that are not already displayed, if any. As another example, month
screen 600 may zoom. A user may initiate these interactions through different input
modalities. In some embodiments, scrolling may be invoked via a touch gesture (e.g., swipe
or flick). In some embodiments, scrolling may be invoked via a physical input mechanism
(e.g., rotation of a rotatable mechanism). In some embodiments, zooming may be invoked
via one or more of these mechanisms.
[0211]       FIG. 6B illustrates exemplary calendar screen 610 which may be referred to as the
"'year screen". Year screen 610 illustrates one or more months of a given year. As shown,
the months of January to June of year 612 (i.e., 2018) are at least partially displayed in year
screen 610. In some embodiments, the current day is emphasized using an affordance such as
affordance 614. In the illustrated example, affordance 614 has a circular shape and encircles
the text (i.e., "2") representing the current day. Affordance 614 may, however, take on other
shapes. In some embodiments, the current day is emphasized by altering the text representing
the current day. For example (not shown), the text may be bolded, brighten, flash, and/or
become more opaque. Year screen 610 may be interactive in that it may be, for example,
scrollable and zoom-able.
[0212]       FIG. 6C illustrates another exemplary year screen 620. In contrast to year screen
610 (FIG. 6B), year screen 620 (FIG. 6C) has a center bias, meaning that the current day is
displayed, by default, on or near the vertical center of touchscreen 504. Restated, when
device 600 displays year screen 620, the current day is initially displayed in the center-most
row of calendar days being displayed. As shown, the current day (i.e., May 2) is marked by
affordance 622. Year screen 620 may be interactive in that it may be, for example, scrollable
and zoom-able.
[0213]       FIG. 6D illustrates exemplary calendar screen 630 which may be referred to as the
"day screen". Day screen 630 illustrates calendar entries representing events that have been
scheduled for a given day. Day screen 630 may have hour markers 632 indicating one or
more hours in the day. Day screen 630 may have affordance 634 indicating the current time
of day. As shown, affordance 634 has a horizontal line residing at approximately a quarter of
                                                   48

1002203380
the distance between the eight and nine o'clock hour markers. Affordance 634 thereby
indicates current time as approximately quarter-past eight o'clock.
[0214]       Day screen 630 may indicate calendar entries of the day using regions 636 and
638. Calendar entries may be stored on electronic device 500, a companion device (e.g., a
cellular phone), at a network-accessible location (e.g., in the "cloud"), or in some
combination thereof. These regions are contiguous regions that are visually distinguishable
from the background of day screen 630. In some examples, these regions may take on a
geometric shape. As shown, region 636 and 638 are rectangular boxes. The edges of region
636 and 638 may indicate the start and end times of corresponding calendar entries. For
example, region 636 represents an event scheduled from nine o'clock to half-past nine
because its top edge is aligned with the hour marker indicating 9 o'clock. As another
example, region 638 represents an event scheduled from ten o'clock to half-past eleven. Due
to the correspondence between the edges of regions 636 and 638 with the start/end times of
their corresponding calendar entries, the vertical heights of the regions are proportional to the
durations of the respective calendar entries. This presentation of calendar entries imparts a
grid-like appearance to day screen 230. Accordingly, day screen 630 may be referred to as
the "grid" version of the day screen.
[0215]       Day screen 630 also may have all-day entry indicator 639 indicating a calendared
event that spans the day. In some examples, all-day entry indicator 639 is displayed above all
other partial-day calendar entries to promote its visibility. Note that, to reduce its on-screen
footprint, the vertical height of all-day entry indicator 639 may be shorter compared to
regions 636 and 638, even though its (all-day) duration is longer than that of the events
represented by regions 636 and 638.
[0216]       FIG. 6E illustrates another exemplary day screen 640. In contrast to day screen
630, day screen 640 displays calendar entries in a list-like layout. Day screen 640 may have
region 642 indicating an all-day event that is scheduled for the day. Day screen 640 also may
have regions 644 and 646 indicating additional (partial-day) calendar entries scheduled for
the day. As shown, regions 642, 644, and 646 may abut one another in succession. The
presentation of calendar entries sequentially abutting one another imparts a list-like
appearance to day screen 640. Accordingly, day screen 240 may be referred to as the "list"
version of the day screen.
                                                   49

1002203380
[0217]       Day screen 640 also may have affordances 648 and 649 indicating the source of
the represented calendar entries. (As discussed above, it is possible for device 500 to have
access to more than one calendar.) Calendar indicator 648 may indicate that "John's
Birthday" resides in a first calendar such as a personal calendar, while calendar indicator 649
may indicate that "Meeting B" resides in a second calendar such as work calendar.
[0218]       FIG. 6F illustrates exemplary calendar entry details screen 650, which may
indicate detailed information regarding a calendar entry. As shown, entry details screen 650
may include event name 652, event location 654, event date 656, event time 658, and/or
event organizer 660. Entry details screen 650 may also include participant information, such
as indications of participants indicating planned attendance 662, indications of participants
indicating planned absence (not shown), and/or indication of participants who have not
replied to event organizer 664. Calendar entry details screen 650 may include reminder
option 666, which permits a user to elect a reminder alert. In some examples, the reminder
alert alerts a user a fixed amount of time prior to an event. In other examples, the reminder
alert alerts an amount of time prior to an event corresponding to an amount of time required
for the user to reach the event. Calendar entry details screen 650 also include option 668 for
adjusting the user's presence information, meaning that option 668 controls whether the
calendar application mark the meeting time as busy (or free) on the user's calendar. Calendar
entry details screen 650 may include calendar indicator 670 identifying on which the subject
calendar entry is stored, such as a work calendar.
2.       Transitions between Calendar Screens
[0219]       Attention is now directed to ways in which embodiments of the calendar
application may, in response to user interaction, transition between the displays of the
calendar screens described with respect to FIGS. 6A-6F. These transitions are discussed with
reference to FIGS. 7A-7D.
[0220]       FIG. 7A illustrates an exemplary screen flow 700. As shown, device 500 may
display user interface screen 701 having icons 702-706. Icons 702-706 may correspond to
applications executable on device 500, meaning device 500 may launch a corresponding
applications in response to a user's selection of an icon. In the illustrated example, icon 702
corresponds to a calendar application. Thus, in response to a selection of icon 702, device
500 may launch the calendar application. In some embodiments, user selection of icon 702
                                                  50

1002203380
may occur via a touch gesture (e.g., tap, touch and hold, swipe, flick). In some embodiments,
the selection may occur via a physical input mechanism (e.g., rotation of a rotatable
mechanism).
[0221]      As shown in FIG. 7A, a user may contact (e.g., touch) displayed icon 702. In
response, device 500 may launch the corresponding calendar application. Upon launching,
the calendar application causes device 500 to display the follow user interface screens in
sequence: day screen 708, to month screen 709, and to year screen 710. The display of
screens 708-710 is sequential and automatic in that device 500 displays the screens in order,
one after the other, without requiring further user input beyond touch contact 707. Screens
708 and 709 may each be displayed for a predetermined amount of time before the next
screen is displayed.
[0222]      In flow 700, year screen 710 is the landing screen for the calendar application,
meaning that, if user invoked the calendar application using touch contact 707, the calendar
application would launch and settle into the display of year screen 710. Flow 700 presents
calendar information to a user in a decreasing level of granularity, as the user is initially
presented calendar information for the day, followed by the month, and followed by the year.
[0223]      FIG. 7B illustrates another exemplary screen flow 720. As shown, device 500
may display user interface screen 701 having icons 702-706. A user may touch displayed
icon 702. In response to a user selection of icon 702, device 500 may launch the calendar
application. Upon launching, the calendar application may cause device 500 to display the
follow screens in sequence: year screen 710, to month screen 709, and to day screen 708. In
flow 720, day screen 708 is the landing screen for the calendar application. In this way, flow
720 presents calendar information to a user in an increasing level of granularity.
[0224]      FIG. 7C illustrates another exemplary screen flow 730. As shown, device 500
may display user interface screen 701 having icons 702-706. The center-most displayed icon,
icon 702, may correspond to the calendar application. A user may move rotatable input
mechanism 508 of device 500 while icon 702 is the center-most displayed icon or perform a
gesture (e.g., a tap, touch and hold, or flick) on the icon. In response, device 500 may launch
the calendar application corresponding to icon 702. Upon launching, the calendar application
may cause device 500 to display day screen 708. Thus, day screen 708 is the landing screen
in flow 730. While day screen 708 is displayed, the user may move rotatable input
                                                   51

1002203380
mechanism 508 again. In response to further movement 737 of the rotatable input
mechanism, device 500 may replace the display of day screen 708 with month screen 709.
While month screen 709 is displayed, the user may move rotatable input mechanism 508
again. In response to further movement 747 of the rotatable input mechanism, device 500
may replace the display of month screen 709 with year screen 310. As shown, movements
727, 737, and 747 are in the same direction of rotation. In this way, flow 720 presents
calendar information to the user in a decreasing level of granularity while emphasizing the
lower-level day screen initially (as the landing screen).
[0225]       FIG. 7D illustrates another exemplary screen flow 740. As shown, device 500
may display user interface screen 301 having icons 702-706. The center-most displayed icon,
icon 702, may correspond to the calendar application. A user may move rotatable input
mechanism 508 of device 500 while icon 702 is the center-most displayed icon or perform a
gesture (e.g., a tap, touch and hold, or flick) on the icon. In response, device 500 may launch
the calendar application corresponding to icon 702. Upon launching, the calendar application
causes device 500 to display year screen 710. Thus, year screen 710 is the landing screen in
flow 740. While year screen 710 is displayed, the user may move rotatable input mechanism
508 again. In response to further movement 737 of the rotatable input mechanism, device
500 may replace the display of year screen 710 with month screen 709. While month screen
709 is displayed, the user may move rotatable input mechanism 508 again. In response to
further movement 747 of rotatable input mechanism 508, device 500 replaces the display of
month screen 709 with day screen 708. As shown, movements 727, 737, and 747 are in the
same rotation direction. In this way, flow 740 presents calendar information to the user in an
increasing level of granularity while emphasizing the higher-level year screen initially (as the
landing screen).
[0226]       Attention is now directed to the defaulting behaviors of day screen 708, month
screen 709, and year screen 710. In some embodiments, the display of day screen 708 in the
above-described flows (FIGS. 7A-7D) involves displaying calendar entries for the current
day, by default. That is, when day screen 708 is initially presented in these flows, calendar
entries for the current day (if any) are displayed. In some embodiments, the displays of
month screen 709 in the above-described flows involve displaying the days of the current
month, by default. In some embodiments, the displays of year screen 710 (FIGS. 7A-7D) in
the above-described flows involve displaying the months of the current year, by default.
                                                   52

1002203380
[0227]      In some embodiments, the displays of day view 708 (FIGS. 7A-7D) in the above
described flows involve displaying calendar entries for the most recently viewed day, by
default. In some embodiments, the display of month view 709 (FIGS. 7A-7D) in the above
described flows involve displaying days of the most recently viewed month, by default. In
some embodiments, the display of year view 710 (FIGS. 7A-7D) in the above-described
flows involve displaying the months (and/or days) of the most recently viewed year, by
default.
[0228]      In some embodiments, device 500 supports both flows 700 and 740 such that it
responds differently to input in the form of a selection (e.g., 707) of icon 702 versus input in
the form of a rotational movement (e.g., 717), when screen 701 is displayed. Other
combinations are possible. In some embodiments, device 500 supports flows 700 and 730
when screen 701 is displayed. In some embodiments, device supports flows 720 and 740
when screen 701 is displayed. In some embodiments, device 500 supports flows 720 and 730
when screen 701 is displayed. Other combinations are permutations in different
embodiments. In some embodiments, device 500 permits user-designation of preferred
flow(s).
[0229]      Among other things, the above-described user interface flows beneficially
improve the efficiency of man-machine interface between a user and device 500. For
example, in the described embodiments, device 500 may present a user with multiple ways of
winnowing and accessing specific calendar entries out of a greater set of calendar
information. Consider flow 720 (FIG. 7B), in which device 500 presents a user with a visual
transition from year, to month, to day: This flow may help the user focus onto the
information that is ultimately presented (e.g., information for today), yet it does not require
the user to manually navigate (e.g., find and invoke navigational icons) from screen to screen.
This transition may be particularly helpful when a user does not yet know what day the
calendar application is presently focused on (e.g., what day's calendar entries will the
application display). At the same time, device 500 may allow a user-who is already aware
of the day that is being focused on-   to access the calendar information directly by a single
input. Consider flow 730 (FIG. 7C), in which device 500 allows a user to invoke the day
screen directly. The availability of these flows in a device such as device 500 permits a user
to invoke the most efficient interfaces for particular usage scenarios, thereby improving the
quality and efficiency of the resulting man-machine interactions.

1002203380
[0230]      In addition, the availability of a rotatable input mechanism on device 500 further
improves the speed of these man-machine interactions. For example, after seeing device 500
transition between different calendar screens (e.g., year, month, day) in flow 720 (FIG. 7B), a
user may rotate the input mechanism to quickly "flip" back to the desired screen that he may
have identified as being useful during the transition. In this way, device 500 may reduce (and
in some instances eliminate) intermediate touch gestures involving navigational icons to
retrieve the desired user interface screen. Importantly, this combination of the available
software user interface and hardware input mechanism permit efficient navigation between
calendar screens and entries.
[0231]      Attention is now directed to additional exemplary user interactions with the
calendar application executing on device 500. These aspects are described with reference to
FIGS. 8A-8E. FIG. 8A illustrates exemplary day screen 800. Day screen 800 may be day
screen 708 (FIG. 7A) in some embodiments. Day screen 800 includes text 802 indicating the
day for which calendar entries are being displayed. As shown, day screen 800 indicates
calendar entries scheduled for the current day. Day screen 800 also includes text 804
representing hours in the displayed day. Regions 806 and 808 represent calendar entries
scheduled for the current day. Day screen 800 also includes indicator 810 indicating an all
day calendar entry scheduled for the current day. Note that the vertical length of all-day
entry indicator 810 is shorter than that of regions 806 and 808, even though an all-day event
has a longer duration than the events represented by regions 808 and 810. In this way, the
calendar application is able to reduce the usage of on-screen space necessary for displaying
all-day calendar entries. Day screen 800 also includes affordance 812 indicating the current
time. As shown, affordance 812 is a horizontal line, though it may take on another shape.
[0232]      All-day calendar entry indicator 810 is responsive to user interaction. In some
embodiments, having seen indicator 810, the user may select the indicator to reveal more
information about the all-day event. In some embodiments, the selection is made with touch
gesture such as a tap or a swipe (e.g., downward swipe 842) involving indicator 810. In
response to the user selection, the calendar application may enlarge all-day event indicator
810 to reveal that today is "John's Birthday," as indicated by text 844.
[0233]      As used here, a swipe need not be perfectly aligned with one direction in order for
the swipe to be considered as a swipe in that direction. That is, a downward swipe need not
be perfectly straight nor vertical in the down direction. Instead, a swipe that is substantially
                                                    54

1002203380
in one direction may be considered to be a swipe in that direction. In some examples, a swipe
that is within less than 45 degrees from an axis is may be considered to be substantially along
that axis. In some examples, particularly those in which a screen is scrollable only along one
axis, a swipe that has any detectable motion along that axis may be considered a swipe
substantially along that axis.
[0234]      FIG. 8B illustrates additional exemplary user interactions with day screen 800.
Day screen 800 includes region 808 representing a calendar entry for the displayed day. As
shown, a user contacts (e.g., as indicated by tap 846) the touch-sensitive display of device
500 at the display position of region 808. In response, device 500 may display calendar entry
details screen 820. Calendar entry details screen 820 may be calendar entry details screen
650 (FIG. 6F) in some embodiments.
[0235]      FIG. 8C illustrates exemplary day screen 830 that is used to provide daily calendar
information in some embodiments. Day screen 830 is day screen 708 (FIG. 7A) in some
embodiments. Day screen 830 includes text 832 indicating the day for which calendar entries
are being displayed. Day screen 830 also includes text 834 representing hours in the
displayed day, in this case, the current day. Regions 836 and 838 represent calendar entries
scheduled for the current day. Note that the represented calendar entries are partially
concurrent in that the scheduled meeting times overlap. To accommodate for the display of
concurrent calendar entries, regions 836 and 838 are reduced in their widths so that the events
can be represented on day screen 830. A user may select (e.g., touch) one of the displayed
regions 836 and 838 to display additional details regarding the represented calendar entries.
The additional details are displayed via calendar entry details screen 650 (FIG. 6F) in some
embodiments.
[0236]      FIG. 8D illustrates exemplary day screen 840 that is used to provide daily
calendar information in some embodiments. Day screen 840 is day screen 308 (FIG. 3A) in
some embodiments. Day screen 840 includes text 842 indicating the day for which calendar
entries are being displayed. Day screen 840 also includes text 844 representing hours in the
displayed day, in this case, the current day. Regions 846, 847, and 848 represent calendar
entries scheduled for the current day. Note that the regions are displayed in an overlapping
manner because they represent calendar entries that are (at least partially) concurrent. In this
way, concurrent events are represented on-screen simultaneously. The display of overlapping
                                                 55

1002203380
calendar entries in this manner may be referred to as "stacking" the display of calendar
entries.
[0237]       A user may select (e.g., touch) the displayed regions 846-848 to display additional
event details for the represented calendar entries. In some embodiments, a selection of any
one of the regions 846-848 causes calendar entries screen 850 to be displayed. Calendar
entries screen 850 has non-overlapping regions 852, 854, and 856 corresponding to regions
846, 847, and 848, respectively. Regions 852, 854, 856 are presented in a non-overlapping
manner on screen 850 to facilitate user selection. A user may select any one of regions 852,
854, 856 to access detailed information for the represented calendar entry. The additional
details may be displayed via calendar entry details screen 650 (FIG. 6F).
[0238]       In some embodiments (not illustrated), it is possible for a user to bypass calendar
entries screen 850 by precisely selecting one of regions 846-848 in day screen 840. For
example, if device 500 detects user selection at a position that falls within a single displayed
region (e.g., 847) and not another overlapping region (e.g., 846 or 848), device 500 displays
details for the calendar entry represented by the single region (e.g., 847). The additional
details may be displayed via calendar entry details screen 650 (FIG. 6F).
[0239]       FIG. 8E illustrates exemplary day screen 860 that is used to provide daily calendar
information in some embodiments. Day screen 860 is day screen 708 (FIG. 7A) in some
embodiments. Day screen 860 includes text 862 indicating the day for which calendar entries
are being displayed. Day screen 860 also includes text 864 representing hours in the
displayed in day, in this case, the current day. Region 866 represents multiple calendar
entries scheduled for the current day between the hours of 9:30am to noon. Region 866
includes text 868 indicating its representation of multiple calendar entries. Day screen 860
stands in contrast to day screen 830 (FIG. 8C) in that concurrent calendar entries are not
displayed side-by-side. Day screen 860 stands in contrast to day screen 840 (FIG. 8D) in that
concurrent calendar entries are not displayed in a partially overlapping manner. Rather, day
screen 860 merges multiple calendar entries into the display of region 866. In some
embodiments, the placement of the top of region 866 within screen 860 corresponds to the
start time of the earliest represented calendar entry (as defined by hour markers 864). In
some embodiments, the bottom of region 866 corresponds to the end time of the latest
represented calendar entry. The display of merged calendar representations in this manner
may be referred to as "coalescing" the display of calendar entries.
                                                  56

1002203380
[0240]       A user may select (e.g., touch) region 866 to display calendar entries screen 870.
Calendar entries screen 870 has regions 872, 874, and 876 representing the multiple (in this
case, three) calendar entries that had been coalesced into and were represented by region 866.
From screen 870, a user may select any one of regions 872, 874, and 876 to access detailed
information for the represented calendar entry. The additional details may be displayed via
calendar entry details screen 650 (FIG. 6F).
3.       Contextual Features
[0241]       Attention is now directed to techniques for accessing contextual user interfaces in
embodiments of the calendar application. Device 500 may have a small form factor. Due to
its size, device 500 may not lend itself to displaying large numbers of graphical user interface
elements, as the inclusion of many elements could reduce the display area available for
calendar content.
[0242]       In some embodiments, the calendar application of device 500 may invoke
different features based on the touch intensity of user input. This aspect is described with
reference to FIGS. 9A-9E. As shown in FIG. 9A, device 500 may display day screen 500
which may be day screen 800 (FIG. 8) in some embodiments. A user may select (e.g., touch)
region 908, which represents a calendar entry. Device 500 may determine a measurement of
the intensity of the selection (e.g., touch) and provide different responses based on the
intensity. For example, if the intensity is below a threshold, the calendar application may
display calendar entry details screen 910. Calendar entry details screen 910 may be calendar
entry details screen 650 (FIG. 6F) in some embodiments. If the intensity is above the
threshold, device 500 may display options screen 920 instead of event details screen 910,
even though the contact occurred at a position of affordance 908 corresponding to a calendar
entry.
[0243]       Options screen 920 may include affordances for invoking various options (or
features) of the calendar application. For example, options screen 920 may include
affordance 922 for displaying a day screen for the current day. Options screen 920 may
include affordance 924 displaying a "calendar inbox" screen. (Exemplary calendar inbox
screens are described below with reference to FIGS. 9C-9D.) Options screen 920 may
include affordance 926 for displaying configuration settings related to day screen 900 and/or
the calendar application. (Exemplary configuration screens are described below with
                                                   57

1002203380
reference to FIGS. 9E.) Options screen 920 may include affordance 928 for toggling between
a display of the list and grid versions of the day screen.
[0244]      Attention is now directed to calendar inbox screens that may be invoked using
affordance 924 on options screen 920 (FIG. 9A). FIGS. 9B and 9C illustrate exemplary
calendar inbox screens. FIG. 9B illustrates exemplary calendar inbox screen 930 having
regions 932, 934, and 936 corresponding to incoming calendar entry invitations. Calendar
inbox screen 930 may prioritize the display of new (e.g., unread or recent) invitations. In
some embodiments, unread invitations are displayed near the top of calendar inbox screen
930 while invitations that have been read are displayed, if displayed at all, towards the
bottom of calendar inbox screen 930. In some embodiments, invitations are sorted by time
received, meaning that more recent received invitations are displayed closer to the top of
calendar inbox screen 930. In this way, incoming invitations may still be displayed to the
user even when a large number of invitations are being managed through the calendar inbox.
Calendar inbox screen 930 may be scrollable to reveal additional calendar entry invitations.
[0245]      FIG. 9C illustrate exemplary calendar inbox screens 950 and 952. Calendar inbox
screen 950 may display new calendar entries received by device 500. As shown, regions 954
and 956 represent new calendar entries (e.g., invitations). For example, region 954 may
represent the most recently received entry while region 956 may represent an entry that has
been received for a while but remains unread. Device 500 may receive user input
representing swipe 958 while calendar inbox screen 950 is displayed. In response to the
swipe input, device 500 may display calendar inbox screen 952. Calendar inbox screen 952
may display older invitations. For example, region 960 may represent an invitation that the
user has answered.
[0246]      Calendar inbox screens 950 and 952 may each include affordances 962 and 964
indicating the position of each screen among a plurality of screens. Affordances 962 and 964
may enlarge, darken, or otherwise change in visual appearance when the corresponding
calendar inbox screen is displayed. An exemplary implementation of affordances 962 and
964 is paging dots.
[0247]      Attention is now directed to configuration settings screens that may be invoked
using affordance 926 on options screen 920 (FIG. 9A). FIG. 9D illustrates exemplary
settings screen 970 for configuring calendar application settings. Configuration screen 970
                                                  58

1002203380
may include affordances for configuring the calendar application. For example,
configuration screen 970 may include affordance 972 for selecting one or more calendars to
display in the calendar application. As another example, configuration screen 970 may
include affordance 974 for specifying whether the calendar application displays calendar
entries previously declined by the user.
[0248]      In some embodiments, device 500 may display calendar selection screen 980 in
response to a touch on affordance 972. Calendar selection screen 980 may include a legend
identifying visual representations used to represent different calendars, such as the use of
circle 982 to represent calendar 984. Circle 982 may be affordance 670 (FIG. 6F) in some
embodiments. Settings screen 980 may also include switches for controlling whether the
events of certain calendars are to be shown in the calendar application. For example, switch
986 may be used to indicate that the calendar application should display events of calendar
984 (e.g., personal) while switch 988 may be used to indicate that the calendar application
should omit events of calendar 990 (e.g., work).
[0249]      Attention is now directed to the toggling of different on-screen presentations of
calendar entries that may be invoked by affordance 928 on options screen 920 (FIG. 9A). In
some embodiments, a user may select affordance 928 to toggle between displaying calendar
entries in a list format (e.g., day screen 640 in FIG. 6E) or in a grid format (e.g., day screen
630 in FIG. 6D). As shown in FIG. 9E, while the day screen 990 is displayed in list format, a
user may invoke options screen 992 and select affordance 994 to redisplay day screen 996 in
grid format. Options screen 992 may be options screen 920 in some embodiments. It is also
possible to return to the display of day screen 990 in list format in the same manner.
[0250]      The calendar application may display options screens other than options screen
920 (FIG. 9A) in response to a touch contact that exceeds the threshold intensity. In some
embodiments, the displayed options may vary depending on which user interface screen of
the calendar application is displayed at the time of the high-intensity touch contact. That is,
option screens may be context-sensitive. Examples of additional options screens that may be
invoked in this way are described with reference to FIGS. 10A-10
[0251]      FIG. 1OA illustrates exemplary options screen 1000. In some examples, device
500 displays options screen 1000 if it receives a touch contact exceeding a threshold while it
is displaying a day screen, such as day screen 1030 (FIG. 1OD) and/or day screen 1040 (FIG.
                                                   59

1002203380
10E). Options screen 1000 may include affordance 1002 for causing device 500 to display
the day screen for the current day. Option screen 1000 also may include affordance 1004 for
causing device 500 to display calendar inbox 940 (FIG. 9C). Options screen 1000 also may
include affordance 1006 for causing device to return to the day screen. Options screen 1000
also may include affordance 1008 for causing device 500 to launch a calendar application on
another computing device, such as a cellular phone, that is within communications range of
device 500. In some embodiments, when affordance 1008 is selected, device 500 may
instruct the companion device to display the day screen for the same day that was most
recently displayed on device 500.
[0252]       FIG. 6B illustrates exemplary options screen 1010. In some examples, device 500
displays options screen 1010 if it receives a touch contact exceeding a threshold value while
it is displaying month screen 600 (FIG. 6A) or year screen 610 (FIG. 6B). Options screen
1010 may include affordance 1012 for causing device 500 to display the day screen for the
current day. Options screen 1010 also may include affordance 1014 for causing device 500
to display calendar inbox 930, 950, or 952 (FIGS. 9B and 9C). Options screen 1010 also may
include affordance 1016 for causing device to display a settings screen such as settings screen
970 (FIG. 9D).
[0253]       FIG. 1OC illustrates exemplary options screen 1020. In some examples, device
500 displays options screen 1020 if it receives a touch contact exceeding a threshold value
while it is displaying calendar entry details screen 650 (FIG. 6F). Options screen 1020 may
include affordance 1022 for causing device 500 to accept an invitation to the event that is
displayed on the calendar entry details screen. Options screen 1020 also may include
affordance 1024 to indicate possible attendance. Options screen 1020 also may include
affordance 1026 to decline attendance. Options screen 1020 also may include affordance
1028 for initiating an email to the events' participants.
[0254]       FIG. 1OD illustrates exemplary options screen 1030. In some examples, device
500 displays options screen 1030 if it receives a touch contact exceeding a threshold value
while it is displaying calendar selection screen 1080 (FIG. 10E). Options screen 1040 may
include affordance 1042 for causing device 500 to display the day view for the current day.
Options screen 1040 also may include affordance 1046 for displaying a settings screen such
as settings screen 970 (FIG. 9E).
                                                  60

1002203380
[0255]       FIG. 10E illustrates exemplary options screen 1040. In some examples, device
500 displays options screen 1040 if it receives a touch contact exceeding a threshold value
while it is displaying calendar inbox 930, 950, or 952 (FIGS. 9B and 9C). Options screen
1040 may include affordance 1042 for causing device 500 to display a day screen for the
current day. Options screen 1040 may include affordance 1044 for returning to the calendar
inbox screen. Options screen 1040 also may include affordance 1046 for displaying settings
screen 970 (FIG. 9E). Note that, although the affordances for invoking various display
screens as discussed with respect to FIGS. 10A-10E are illustrated as being circular, they can
take on other shapes. The affordances may be rectangular, instead, for example.
4.       Responding to Calendar Entries
[0256]       Attention is now directed to how the calendar application permits a user to
respond (e.g., accept or decline) to an incoming calendar entry (e.g., an invitation). With
reference to FIG. 11, device 500 may display calendar inbox screen 1100, which may be
screen 930 (FIG. 9B) in some embodiments. Calendar inbox screen 1100 may include region
1102 representing a calendar invitation to "Meeting B." If a user selects (e.g., touches)
region 1102, the calendar application may cause device 500 to display event details screen
1110. Screen 1110 may be screen 1050 (FIG. 1OF) in some embodiments. While event
details screen 1110 is displayed, if a user makes contact with the touch-sensitive display of
device 500-and the contact has a maximum intensity exceeding a threshold-the calendar
application may display options screen 1120. Options screen 1120 may be screen 920 (FIG.
9A) in some embodiments. Options screen 1120 may include: affordance 1122 for accepting
the invitation; affordance 1124 for declining the invitation; affordance 1126 for indicating
tentative attendance; and affordance 1128 for initiating communication (e.g., e-mail or
message) with a member of the invitation, such as the event's organizer. If a user makes
contact with affordance 1122, the calendar application displays acceptance screen 1130.
Acceptance screen 1130 may show an indication confirming that the calendar entry has been
accepted. The calendar application also may transmit a message to the event organizer
indicating the user's acceptance of the calendar entry.
[0257]       In some embodiments, device 500 may display acceptance screen 1130
momentarily (e.g., for a predetermined time interval), and subsequently display calendar
inbox screen 1140. In some embodiments, device 500 may display acceptance screen 1130
until a user input is received (e.g., a touch or swipe), at which time device 500 transitions to
                                                   61

1002203380
the display of calendar inbox screen 1140. While calendar inbox screens 1100 and 1140 are
similar, note that region 1102 is displayed below divider 1142 in screen 1140. This
positioning indicates that the user has responded to the incoming calendar entry represented
by affordance 1102. In this way, other invitations (e.g., the invitation represented by region
1144) may be more prominently displayed to encourage user response.
5.       Creating New Calendar Entries
[0258]       Attention is now directed to the creation of new calendar entries using the
calendar application. This aspect is described with respect to FIGS. 12A and 12B. FIG. 12A
illustrates exemplary user interface screens for creating a new calendar entry according to
some embodiments. As shown, device 500 may display day screen 1200, which may be
screen 630 (FIG. 6D) in some examples. While day screen 1200 is displayed, if a user selects
position 1206, the calendar application may display new entry screen 1210. New entry
screen 1210 may include input areas for entering information regarding the new calendar
entry. For example, new entry screen 1210 may include text input area 1212 for a name of
the corresponding event. Screen 1210 may also include affordance 1214 for invoking a time
(and optionally, day) picker for an event time. Screen 1210 may also include affordance
1216 for entering location information. Screen 1210 also may include affordance 1218 for
invoking a selector for selecting meeting attendees. In some examples, affordance 1214 may
default to a meeting date of day 1204, which is the day displayed on day screen 1200. In
some embodiments, affordance 1214 may default to a time corresponding to position 1206,
which is the location of user selection 1202. In some embodiments, affordance 1214 may
default to the top of the next hour or to the next half hour.
[0259]       FIG. 12B illustrates exemplary user interface screens for creating a new calendar
entry according to some embodiments. As shown, device 500 may display day screen 1220,
which may be screen 630 (FIG. 6D) in some embodiments. While day screen 1220 is
displayed, if a user makes contact 1222 with the touch-sensitive display of device 500, and a
characteristic intensity of the contact exceeds a threshold value, the calendar application may
display options screen 1230. Options screen 1230 may include affordance 1232 for creating
a new calendar entry. While options screen 1230 is displayed, if a user selects affordance
1232, the calendar application may display new calendar entry screen 1240. Screen 1240
may be new calendar entry screen 1210 in some embodiments.
                                                  62

1002203380
6.       Exemplary Flow: Contacting Organizer
[0260]      Attention is now directed to features for contacting one or more persons
associated with calendar entry, such as an event organizer. This aspect is described with
respect to FIGS. 13 and 14. As shown in FIG. 13, device 500 may display calendar inbox
screen 1300. Calendar inbox screen 1300 may be screen 930 (FIG. 9C) in some
embodiments. Calendar inbox screen 1300 may include region 1304 representing a calendar
entry. When a user selects region 1304, the calendar application may display calendar entry
details screen 1310. Calendar entry details screen 1310 may be screen 1050 (FIG. 10F) in
some embodiments. Calendar entry details screen 1310 may have affordance 1312
identifying an event organizer. When a user selects affordance 1312, the calendar application
may display contact card screen 1320.
[0261]      Contact card screen 1320 also may include name 1322, phone number 1324, and
e-mail 1326 for the event organizer. When a user selects phone number 1322, the calendar
application may initiate a phone call to the indicated number. In some embodiments, the
phone call may be initiated using a cellular communication unit of device 500. In some
embodiments, the phone call may be initiated using a network communication unit of device
500, such as a voice-over-IP unit. In some embodiments, device 500 instructs a companion
device, such as a cellular phone, to initiate the phone call using the companion device's
cellular communication unit. In some embodiments, device 500 instructs a companion
device, such as a networkable laptop computer, to initiate the phone call using the companion
device's network communication unit. Upon initiating the phone call, device 500 displays
call progress screen 1330. At the conclusion of the phone call, device 500 returns to event
details screen 1310.
[0262]      FIG. 14A shows additional exemplary user interface screens for contacting one or
more persons associated with a calendar entry. As shown, device 500 may display calendar
entry details screen 1400. Calendar entry details screen 1400 may be screen 1050 (FIG. 6F)
in some embodiments. Calendar entry details screen 1400 may include affordance 1402
identifying the event's organizer. If a user selects event organizer affordance 1402, the
calendar application may display contact card screen 1410.
[0263]      Contact card screen 1410 may include affordance 1412 for initiating a phone call
to the event organizer. If a user selects affordance 1412, device 500 may display screen 1330
                                                   63

1002203380
(FIG. 13) and initiate a call to the organizer. Contact card screen 1410 also may include
affordance 1420 for initiating a video conference with the event organizer. If a user selects
affordance 1412, device 500 may launch a video conferencing application.
[0264]      Contact card screen 1410 also may include affordance 1414 for initiating an e
mail to the event organizer. If a user selects affordance 1414, device 500 may permit a user
to create an e-mail message using various modalities. In some embodiments, device 500 may
display a soft keyboard for entering an e-mail message. In some embodiments, device 500
may permit a user to aurally dictate a message which is then included in a draft e-mail as text.
In some embodiments, device 500 may permit a user to record a voice memo, which is then
included in a draft e-mail as an audio attachment. In some embodiments, device 500 may
permit a user to send emoji characters. In some embodiments, device 500 may present, for
the user's selection, a list of predicted text that device 500 has determined to be possible
and/or likely responses.
[0265]      These predicted texts may include those described in U.S. Provisional Patent
Application No. 62/005,958, "Canned Answers in Messages," filed May 30, 2014, (the
"Canned Answers Specification") the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
For instance, the Canned Answers Specification describes predicting a user's likely response
to an incoming message and presenting those predicted responses as options for user
selection. In some embodiments the predictions are based the content of an incoming
message and/or the sender's identity. In some examples, responsive to an incoming message
that contains a question mark, the system predicts and presents the canned answers "yes" and
"no." In some examples, responsive to an incoming message that contains two phrases
separated by the word "or," the system presents the word appearing before "or" and the word
appearing after "or" as canned answers. In some examples, responsive to an incoming
message from a sender identified as the user's wife (e.g., through the user's contact list), the
system predicts and presents the phrase "I love you" as a canned response.
[0266]       Contact card screen 1410 may also include affordance 1418 for sending a
message to the event organizer. Device 500 may permit a user to create a message (e.g.,
SMS message) using one or more of the above-described input modalities.
[0267]      Contact card screen 1410 also may include affordance 1416 for launching a map
application that maps an address of the event organizer. If a user selects affordance 1416,
                                                    64

1002203380
device 500 may launch a maps application mapping the address of the event organizer. In
some embodiments, the address is static, such as a work address from the organizer's
business card. In some embodiments, the address is dynamic, such as updated locational
information reported by a GPS-equipped device of the organizer's.
[0268]      FIG. 14B shows additional exemplary user interface screens for an event
reminder. As shown, device 500 may display event reminder screen 1450, for instance,
alerting the user of an upcoming event. As previously described, in some examples, the
device 500 may alert the user an amount of time prior to an event, and the amount of time
may either be fixed or based on an amount of time required for the user to travel to the event.
Event reminder screen 1450 may include affordance 1452 identifying the event, affordance
1454 identifying the location of the event, affordance 1456 identifying the time of the event,
and affordance 1458 identifying the location of the event. In some examples, any of
affordances 1452-1458 may be combined or separated further into sub-affordances. The event
reminder screen 1450 may further include affordances 1460 and 1462. If a user selects
affordance 1460, the calendar application may display a contact card screen, such as the
contact card screen 1410 (FIG. 14A), allowing the user to contact the organizer as described.
The user may, for instance, indicate to the organizer a time at which the user will arrive at the
event. If a user selects affordance 1462, the calendar application may launch a map
application that maps an address of the event (or event organizer). As described, in some
examples, the address may be static or dynamic.
7.       Additional Details - Calendar Screens
[0269]      Attention is now directed to additional user interface transitions that may be
displayed by the calendar application in response to user interaction. FIG. 15 illustrates an
exemplary transition between the year and month screens in some embodiments of the
calendar application. As shown, device 500 may display year screen 1500 showing certain
months of the year. Year screen 1500 may be screen 610 (FIG. 6B) in some embodiments.
A user may select one of the displayed months. For example, a user may contact the
touchscreen at position 1502 corresponding to the month of September. In response to the
user selection, the calendar application transitions to month screen 1510 showing the touched
month (i.e., September). Month screen 1510 may be month screen 600 (FIG. 6A) in some
embodiments. As shown, the transition may include enlarging (at least parts of) the selected
month (i.e., September) from screen 1500 into screen 1520. In some embodiments, the
                                                  65

1002203380
transition includes translating the non-selected months-displayed in screen 1500-        off
screen as the selected month enlarges.
[0270]      FIG. 16 illustrates another exemplary transition between the year and month
screens in some embodiments of the calendar application. As shown, device 500 may display
year screen 1600 showing certain months of the years 20<removed-date>. Year screen 1600 may
be screen 610 (FIG. 6B) in some examples. While year screen 1600 is displayed, a user may
swipe upwards on the touch-sensitive display of device 500, which may cause the calendar
application to scroll the year screen 1600 in a corresponding direction to reveal additional
months in year 2018. Year screen 1610 illustrates the display of additional months of the
year 2018. In year screen 1610, the month of August is the center-most of the displayed
months. A user may rotate the rotatable input mechanism of device 500 while year screen
1610 is displayed with August being the center-most month. In response to rotation 1614, the
calendar application may transition to month screen 1620 displaying details of the center
most month-August. In some embodiments, the transition includes enlarging (at least parts
of) the display of the center-most month. In some embodiments, the transition includes
translating the other displayed months off-screen as the center-most month expands.
[0271]      FIG. 17 illustrates another exemplary transition between the year and month
screens in some embodiments of the calendar application. As shown, device 500 may display
year screen 1700. Year screen 1700 may be year screen 610 (FIG. 6B) in some
embodiments. When year screen 1700 is displayed, a user may select one of the displayed
months. For example, a user may touch the touch-sensitive display of device 500 at a
position where month 1702 (i.e., December) is displayed. In some embodiments, in response
to the user selection, the selected month (1702) is visually emphasized. For example, the
selected month may brighten, flash, become boldfaced, and/or become more opaque. In
some embodiments, in response to the user selection, the non-selected months are visually
de-emphasized. For example, they may dim, fade, and/or become translucent. In some
embodiments, the selected month remains unchanged visually while the non-selected months
are visually de-emphasized. In some embodiments, the selected month is visually
emphasized while the non-selected months remain unchanged visually.
[0272]      While still selecting (e.g., touching) the touch-sensitive display of device 500, the
user may drag (e.g., slide) his finger in a particular direction, for example, upwards. As
shown, in response to the upward sliding finger, month 1704 (November)-which precedes
                                                   66

1002203380
month 1702 (December)-becomes visually emphasized, and month 1702 becomes visually
de-emphasized. As the user continues to slide his finger upwards, month 1706 (October)
which precedes month 1704 (November)-becomes visually emphasized, and month 1702
becomes visually de-emphasized. When the user releases his selection (e.g., touch), all of the
displayed months may return to their normal visual appearance, except month 1706
(October), which now has focus. In this way, a user can place focus on a particular month of
the displayed year. While month 1706 has focus, a user may rotate the rotatable input
mechanism of device 500 (as indicated by arrow 1708) to transition from year screen 1730 to
month screen 1740, which shows the days of month 1706.
[0273]      FIG. 18 illustrates an exemplary transition between the month and day screens of
the calendar application. As shown, device 500 may display month screen 1800. Month
screen 1800 may be screen 600 (FIG. 6A) in some examples. Month screen includes
affordance 1802 indicating a currently selected day. While month screen 1800 is displayed, a
user may rotate the rotatable input mechanism of device 500, as indicated by arrow 1802. In
response to rotation 1802, the calendar application may transition to the display of day view
1810. Day view 1810 may display calendar entries scheduled for the day marked by
affordance 1804.
[0274]      FIG. 19 illustrates an exemplary transition between the month and week screens
of the calendar application. The week screen displays the days in a particular week. As
shown, device 500 may display month screen 1900. Month screen 1900 may be screen 600
(FIG. 6A) in some embodiments. Month screen 1900 may indicate the days of a month
across multiple rows. These rows include, for example, row 1904, which indicates the days
of a particular week in the displayed month. While month screen 1900 is displayed, a user
may rotate the rotatable input mechanism of device 500 as indicated by arrow 1902. In
response to rotation 1902, device 500 may transition from displaying month screen 1900 to
displaying week screen 1930. In week screen 1930, numerals representing the days of a
week are displayed vertically. In addition, weekday identifiers (e.g., Mon, Tues, so forth) are
displayed adjacent the numerals.
[0275]      The translation between screen 1900 and screen 1930 involves on-screen
translation of numerals (representing days) from their positions in row 1904 to their new
positions in column 1932. This transition is illustrated by exemplary screens 1910 and 1920.
In screen 1910, row 1904 is shown pivoting from its horizontal (row) orientation towards a
                                                 67

1002203380
vertical (column) orientation roughly about position 1912. While row 1904 pivots, numerals
in other rows are translated off-screen. Screen 1920 illustrates further progression of this
translation. As can be seen, in this stage of the transition, many numerals have been
translated off-screen, leaving primarily the numerals of row 1904. As the transition of row
1904 into column 1932 completes, weekday identifiers are added adjacent the displayed
numerals, as shown on week screen 1930.
[0276]       FIGS. 20A and 20B illustrate a feature of the calendar application that may be
referred to as progressive disclosure. Progressive disclosure refers to the ability of the
application to vary-as a user zooms in or out-       the content of displayed information.
Progressive disclosure may occur together with changes in the size of the displayed
information, as a user invokes zooming functionality. In some embodiments, device 500 may
display more detailed information regarding displayed events when fewer events are
displayed (e.g., when a calendar screen is zoomed in). Conversely, device 500 may display
less information regarding specific events when more events are displayed (e.g., when a
calendar application is zoomed out). In this way, the calendar application may display the
most appropriate level of detail based on the granularity of the zoom. It is noted that
progressive disclosure, which may display more information when zoomed-in, stands in
contrast to conventional zoom functionalities, which tend to display less information, at a
larger size, when zoomed-in.
[0277]       Exemplary user interface screens illustrating progressive disclosure are now
described. As shown in FIG. 20A, device 500 may display day screen 2000. Day screen
2000 may be screen 630 (FIG. 6D) in some embodiments. Day screen 2000 includes
calendar entries scheduled for day 2002. Device 500 may respond to user input representing
request(s) to zoom. In some embodiments, a user may pinch and/or de-pinch day screen
2000 to zoom out and zoom in, respectively. In some embodiments, a user may rotate the
rotational input mechanism of device 500 to zoom (as shown by rotational input 2022).
[0278]       As illustrated in FIG. 20A, if a user provides input representing a request to zoom
in while day screen 2000 is displayed, device may display day screen 2010 which shows
fewer hours of day 2002 but shows more information about calendar entries scheduled during
the displayed hours (e.g., entry 2006). The request to zoom-in may be provided using a touch
gesture (e.g., de-pinching) in some embodiments. The request to zoom-in may be provided
using a rotation (2022) of a rotatable input mechanism of device 500 in some embodiments.
                                                   68

1002203380
[0279]      Turning to FIG. 20B, a user also may provide input representing a request to
zoom-out while day screen 2000 is displayed. When this occurs, device 500 may transition
to an intermediate, multi-day screen 2020 which displays calendar entries for multiple days.
As shown, screen 2020 includes regions 2022, 2024, and 2026 representing calendar entries
on for different days. The size (e.g., height) of regions 2022, 2024, and 2026 are proportional
to the length of the corresponding calendar entries. While multi-day screen 2020 is
displayed, a user may further zoom out to multi-month screen 2030, where calendar entries
across multiple months are displayed using affordances, in this example, lines. In screen
2030, lines 2032 indicate the presence of scheduled events in the displayed months, but the
size of lines 2032 may not represent durations. While multi-month screen 2030 is displayed,
a user may further zoom out to multi-year screen 2040, where numbers of scheduled calendar
entries per year are tallied. For example, as shown by text 2042, three calendar entries are
scheduled in the year of 2019. Note, although not shown, it is possible to transition from
screen 2000 to screens 2020, 2030, and 2040 through one or more rotations of a rotatable
input mechanism of device 500.
[0280]      Attention is now directed to other exemplary user interface screens for displaying
calendar information for a particular day and a particular year. FIG. 21 illustrates exemplary
day screen 2100, which may be used in some embodiments to indicate calendar entries
scheduled for a particular day. Day screen 2100 includes day-date indicator 2102. Day
screen 2100 also includes one or more arc-shaped affordances (e.g., 2104 and 2106)
indicating calendar entries scheduled for the day. The end points of the arc-shaped
affordances may indicate start and end times of corresponding calendar entries. For example,
the left end of affordance 2104 may indicate the start of a calendar entry and the right end of
affordance 2104 may indicate the end of the event. The affordances may be aligned based on
the traditional layout of time markers on a circular watch face. That is, affordance 2104
corresponds to an event scheduled from noon to one o'clock. Also, as a result of this circular
alignment, arc-shaped affordances 2104 and 2106 may be arranged circumferentially around
day-date indicator 2102.
[0281]      In addition, FIG. 21 illustrates exemplary year screen 2110, which may be used in
some embodiments to indicate calendar entries for a particular year. Year screen 2110
includes month indicators 2112 and 2114. Year screen 2110 also includes line segments
(e.g., 2116, 2118) indicating the presence of calendar entries during the month. The length of
                                                  69

1002203380
a line segment may indicate the length of the corresponding calendar entry. For example, the
length of line 2116 (which is relatively shorter) may indicate a day-long event during month
2112 while the length of line 2118 (which is relatively longer) may indicate a week-long
event during month 2114.
[0282]      Attention is now directed to an exemplary transition between the day screen and
the inbox screen of the calendar application in some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 22,
device 10 may display day screen 2200. Day screen 2200 may be day screen 630 (FIG. 6D)
or day screen 640 (FIG. 6E) in some embodiments. A user may drag (e.g., by way of a touch
gesture such as a swipe) day screen 2200 to reveal calendar inbox screen 2210. Calendar
inbox screen 2210 may be screen 930 (FIG. 9C) in some embodiments. Alternatively, a user
may rotate the rotatable input mechanism of device 500 to transition between day screen
2200 and calendar inbox screen 2210. Day screen 2200 and calendar inbox screen 2210 may
each include affordances 2201 and 2202 indicating the position of each screen among a
plurality of screens. An exemplary implementation of affordances 2201 and 2202 is paging
dots. Affordances 2201 and 2202 may enlarge, darken, or otherwise change in visual
appearance when the corresponding calendar inbox screen is displayed.
[0283]      While day screen 2200 is displayed, a user may contact (e.g., touch) the touch
sensitive display of device 500. Device 500 may determine or otherwise obtain a
measurement of the intensity of the contact. If the intensity is above the threshold, the
calendar application may cause device 500 to display options screen 2220. Options screen
2220 may be screens 992 (FIG. 9F), 1000 (FIG. 10A), 1010 (FIG. 10B), 1020 (FIG. 10C),
1030 (FIG. 10D), or 1040 (FIG. 10E) in some embodiments. If the intensity is below a
threshold, the calendar application may cause device 500 to display, for example, the details
of an event that is shown on screen 2200.
[0284]      While calendar inbox screen 2210 is displayed, a user may contact (e.g., touch)
the touch-sensitive display of device 500. Device 500 may determine or otherwise obtain a
measurement of the intensity of the contact. If the intensity is above the threshold, the
calendar application may cause device 500 to display options screen 2230. Options screen
2220 may be screens 992 (FIG. 9F), 1000 (FIG. bOA), 1010 (FIG. 10B), 1020 (FIG. 10C),
1030 (FIG. 10D), or 1040 (FIG. 10E) in some embodiments. If the intensity is below a
threshold, the calendar application may cause device 500 to display, for example, the details
of an event that is shown on screen 2210.
                                                 70

1002203380
[0285]      Attention is now directed to another exemplary landing screen 2310 for the
calendar application, an example of which is shown in FIG. 23. As shown, device 500 may
display user interface screen 2300 having icon 2302. Icon 2302 may correspond to the
calendar application. In response to a selection of icon 2302, device 500 may launch the
calendar application, meaning that the calendar application is brought to the foreground of the
touch-sensitive display of device 500. In some embodiments, the selection may be performed
via a touch gesture (e.g., tap, touch and hold, swipe, flick) on icon 2302. In some
embodiments, the selection may be performed via rotation 2304 of a rotatable input
mechanism of device 500. Upon launching, calendar application causes device 500 to
display landing screen 2310. Exemplary landing screen 2310 includes affordance 2312 for
invoking a day screen showing calendar entries for the current day. Day screen may be
screen 1030 (FIG. 10D) or 1040 (FIG. 10E) in some embodiments. Exemplary landing
screen 2310 also includes affordance 2313 for invoking a calendar inbox screen 2330.
Calendar inbox screen 2330 may be screen 930 (FIG. 9B) or screens 950 and 952 (FIG. 9C)
in some embodiments.
8.       Exemplary Processes
[0286]      Attention is now directed to exemplary processes for carrying out the user
interface techniques described above. FIG. 24 depicts process 2400 for displaying some of
the above-described user interfaces. Process 2400 may be performed at an electronic device
with a touch-sensitive display and a rotatable input mechanism, like device 500 (FIG. 5). At
block 2402, the device may display, on its touch-sensitive display, an icon representing a
calendar application. At block 2404, the device may detect user input. At block 2406, the
device may determine whether the detected user input represents a touch on the displayed
icon or a movement of the rotatable input mechanism. At block 2408, in response to a
determination that the detected user input represents a touch on the displayed icon, the device
may launch the calendar application and transition from the display of the icon, through at
least one intermediate user interface screen, to displaying a landing screen of the calendar
application. Optionally, the transition from the intermediate user interaction screen to the
landing screen may occur after the intermediate user interaction screen has been displayed for
a predetermined amount of time. At block 2410, in response to a determination that the
detected user input represents movement of the rotatable input mechanism, the device may
                                                  71

1002203380
launch the calendar application and transitioning from the display of the icon directly to
displaying the landing screen of the calendar application.
[0287]       In some embodiments, the transition at block 2408 involves the display of a year
screen (e.g., screen 610; FIG. 6B) and a month screen (e.g., screen 600; FIG. 6A) before
landing on a day screen (e.g., screen 630; FIG. 6D). In some embodiments, the transition at
block 2410 involves replacing the display of the icon directly with the display of a day screen
(e.g., screen 630; FIG. 6D) without the display of additional intermediate screens. The
device may thus provide the user with more context if the user interacts with the device in
one way (e.g., touch on the application icon), and the device may provide the user with
quicker access to the day screen if the user interacts with the device in another way (e.g.,
rotation of an input mechanism).
[0288]       When displaying the day screen, device 500 may display one or more affordances
representing calendar entries scheduled for the day. The affordances may have the visual
appearance of a geometric shape, such as a rectangle. More generally speaking, the
affordances may be regions of the display that are distinguishable from the background of the
calendar application. Optionally, when the landing screen is the day screen, device 500 may
display calendar entries for the current day. Optionally, when the month screen is displayed,
device 500 may display an indicator (e.g., numeral) indicating the current day towards the
vertical center of the display.
[02891        FIG. 25 depicts process 2500 for displaying some of the above-described user
interfaces. Process 2500 may be performed at an electronic device with a touch-sensitive
display and a rotatable input mechanism, like device 500 (FIG. 5). At block 2502, the device
may display, on its touch-sensitive display, an affordance representing a calendar application.
At block 2504, the device may detect user input. At block 2506, the device may determine
whether the user input is a touch on the displayed affordance or a movement of the rotatable
input mechanism. At block 2508, in accordance with a determination that the detected user

[0302]       FIG. 34 shows exemplary functional blocks of an electronic device 3400 that, in
some embodiments, perform the features described above. As shown in FIG. 34, an
electronic device 3400 includes a display unit 3402 configured to display graphical objects; a
input/output (1/0) unit 3404 configured to receive user gestures; one or more sensor units
3406 configured to detect intensity of contacts with the touch-sensitive surface unit;
communications unit 3408 and a processing unit 3410 coupled to the display unit 3402, the
I/O unit 3404, the sensor units 3406, and communication unit 3408. The processing unit may
include a graphics processing unit 3412 and a calendar management unit 3414. The
functional blocks of the device 3400 are, optionally, implemented by hardware, software, or a
combination of hardware and software to carry out the principles of the various described
examples. It is understood by persons of skill in the art that the functional blocks described
in FIG. 34 are, optionally, combined or separated into sub-blocks to implement the principles
of the various described examples. Therefore, the description herein optionally supports any
                                                    77

1002203380
possible combination or separation or further definition of the functional blocks described
herein.
[0303]       In some embodiments, processing unit 3408 is configured to detect a user input
(e.g., detecting a touch gesture or other button input with the detecting unit 3410) on a
graphical user interface object, and display relevant calendar information in accordance with
the calendar instruction.
[0304]       For example, in some embodiments, in response to a touch on a calendar,
application icon, graphics processing unit 3412 will cause display unit 3402 to display a
sequence of user interface screens (e.g., year screen, to month screen, to day screen). As
another example, in some embodiments, in response to a movement of a rotatable input
mechanism, graphics processing unit 3412 will cause display unit 3402 to displaying cycle
through the display of individual user interface screens (e.g., year screen, month screen, day
screen). Calendar management unit 3414 may identify relevant information to be displayed
on each screen. In some embodiments, calendar management unit 3414 may progressively
present an increasing amount of information to a user as the user focuses on a particular day's
activities.
[0305]       As yet another example, in some embodiments, input/output unit 3404 may be
able to determine the intensities of touch contacts. In response to a high-intensity contact,
graphics processing unit 3412 may cause display unit 3402 to present additional user
interface features. For instance, a user may able to invoke graphical user interface
affordances for accepting or declining calendar invitations using a high-intensity contact(s).
A user may also be able to invoke graphical user interface affordances for contacting (e.g., e
mailing and/or calling) other members of a calendar entry, such as an event organizer
associated with the calendar entry.
[0306]       As still yet another example, in some embodiments, calendar management unit
3414 may maintain a list of calendar entries that a user has responded to and those that the
user has not responded to. Calendar management unit 3414, in conjunction with graphics
processing unit 3412, may cause display unit 3402 to present calendar entries that still require
a user's response in one region of the user interface screen, and to present calendar entries
that the user has already dealt with in another region.
                                                  78

1002203380
[0307]       As still yet another example, in some embodiments, graphics processing unit 3412
will cause display unit 3402 to visually emphasize and de-emphasized displayed days,
months, and/or years. Calendar management unit 3414 may recognize a visually emphasized
day/month/year as being information that is relevant to the user. For instance, a user may use
one input modality (e.g., touch) to emphasize a particular month among displayed months,
and use another input modality (e.g., movement of a rotatable input mechanism) to retrieve
more information about the particular month.
[0308]       In accordance with some embodiments, FIG. 35 shows a functional block diagram

detected user input represents a touch on the displayed icon, launch (e.g., with the launching
unit 3512) the calendar application and transition (e.g., with the transitioning unit 3514) from
the display of the icon, through at least one intermediate user interface screen, to enable
display of a landing screen of the calendar application; and in response to a determination
that the detected user input represents movement of a rotatable input mechanism, launch
(e.g., with the launching unit 3512) the calendar application and transitioning from the
display of the icon directly to enable display of the landing screen of the calendar application.
                                                  79

1002203380

in the current month comprises enabling display of the text substantially centered on-screen
in the vertical direction.
[0317]       In some embodiments, the processing unit 3506 is further configured to detect
(e.g., with the detecting unit 3510) user selection of a calendar entry of the at least one
calendar entry scheduled for the current day, and in response to detecting user selection of the
calendar entry, enable display (e.g., with the display enabling unit 3508) of a time and
location of the selected calendar entry.
[0318]       In some embodiments, the processing unit 3506 is further configured to detect
(e.g., with the detecting unit 3510) a touch on the touch-sensitive surface unit 3504 while
                                                  80

1002203380
enabling display of the time and location of the selected calendar entry, the touch having a
characteristic intensity; determine (e.g., with the determining unit 3516) whether the
characteristic intensity of the touch is above a threshold intensity; and in response to a
determination that the characteristic intensity of the touch is above the threshold intensity,
enable display (e.g., with the display enabling unit 3508) of, on the display unit 3502, an
affordance for accepting the calendar entry.
[0319]       In some embodiments, the processing unit 3506 is further configured to, in
response to a determination that the characteristic intensity of the touch is not above the
threshold intensity, enable display (e.g., with the display enabling unit 3508) of additional
information regarding the selected calendar entry.
[0320]       In some embodiments, enabling display of at least one calendar entry scheduled
for the current day comprises enabling display of at least one affordance representing the at

[0322]       In some embodiments, enabling display of additional text comprises enabling
display of calendar entry information selected from the group consisting of calendar entry
time, location, and organizer.
[0323]       In some embodiments, the affordance representing the calendar application is a
contiguous region visually distinguishable from a background of the calendar application.
[0324]       The operations described above with reference to FIG. 24 are, optionally,
implemented by components depicted in FIGs. 1A-1B or FIG. 35. For example, displaying
operation 2402, detecting operation 2404, determining operation 2406, and launching
operations 2408 and 2410 are, optionally, implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer
                                                   81

1002203380
180, and event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on
touch-sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information
to application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the
event information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact
at a first location on the touch-sensitive surface (or whether rotation of the device)
corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a user
interface, or rotation of the device from one orientation to another. When a respective
predefined event or sub-event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler
190 associated with the detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally uses
or calls data updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the application internal state 192. In
some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what
is displayed by the application. Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary skill
in the art how other processes can be implemented based on the components depicted in
FIGs. lA-1B.

[0385]      The operations described above with reference to FIG. 29 are, optionally,
implemented by components depicted in FIGs. 1A-1B or FIG. 40. For example, displaying
operations 2902 and 2910, detecting operations 2904 and 2908, and removing operation 2906
are, optionally, implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event handler
190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive display 112,
and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application 136-1. A
respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event information to
respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a first location on
the touch-sensitive surface (or whether rotation of the device) corresponds to a predefined
event or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a user interface, or rotation of the device
from one orientation to another. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is detected,
event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the event
                                                  93

or sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally uses or calls data updater 176 or object updater
177 to update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190
accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application.
Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes
can be implemented based on the components depicted in FIGs. 1A-1B.

[0400]      The operations described above with reference to FIG. 30 are, optionally,
implemented by components depicted in FIGs. 1A-1B or FIG. 41. For example, displaying
operation 3002; detecting operations 3004, 3008, and 3012; changing operations 3006 and
3010, and designating operation 3014 are optionally, implemented by event sorter 170, event
recognizer 180, and event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a
contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event
information to application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1
compares the event information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a
first contact at a first location on the touch-sensitive surface (or whether rotation of the
device) corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a
user interface, or rotation of the device from one orientation to another. When a respective
predefined event or sub-event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler
190 associated with the detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally uses
or calls data updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the application internal state 192. In
some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what
is displayed by the application. Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary skill
in the art how other processes can be implemented based on the components depicted in
FIGs. lA-1B.
[0401]      In accordance with some embodiments, FIG. 42 shows a functional block diagram
of an electronic device 4200 configured in accordance with the principles of the various
described embodiments. The functional blocks of the device are, optionally, implemented by

translation (e.g., with the translation enabling unit 4210) of the one remaining numeral from
its position in the row of numerals to a position in the column of numerals.
[0407]       In some embodiments, the user input is a movement of a rotatable input
mechanism of the electronic device.
[0408]       In some embodiments, enabling translation comprises enabling translation at least
one displayed numeral visibly on the display unit 4202.
[0409]       In some embodiments, the row of numerals is a first row of numerals, the
processing unit 4306 further configured to enable display (e.g., with the display enabling unit
4208) of a second row of numerals representing additional days in the month; in response to
detecting the user input, enable translation of (e.g., with the translation enabling unit 4210)
the second row of numerals towards one or more edges of the display unit 4202; and cease

sensitive surface (or whether rotation of the device) corresponds to a predefined event or sub
event, such as selection of an object on a user interface, or rotation of the device from one
orientation to another. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is detected, event
recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the event or
sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally uses or calls data updater 176 or object updater 177
to update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190
accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application.
Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes
can be implemented based on the components depicted in FIGs. lA-1B.

event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive
display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application
136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event
information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a
first location on the touch-sensitive surface (or whether rotation of the device) corresponds to
a predefined event or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a user interface, or rotation
of the device from one orientation to another. When a respective predefined event or sub
event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the
detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally uses or calls data updater
176 or object updater 177 to update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments,
event handler 190 accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the
application. Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other
processes can be implemented based on the components depicted in FIGs. lA-1B.
[0423]       In accordance with some embodiments, FIG. 44 shows a functional block diagram
of an electronic device 4400 configured in accordance with the principles of the various
described embodiments. The functional blocks of the device are, optionally, implemented by

affordance: launch (e.g., with the launching unit 4412) the calendar application, enable
display (e.g., with the display enabling unit 4408) of a first event affordance representing a
first calendar entry, and enable display (e.g., with the display enabling unit 4408) of a second
event affordance representing a second calendar entry, where the second calendar entry is
longer in duration than the first calendar entry, but the size of the first event affordance is
larger than the size of the second event affordance.
[0426]       In some embodiments, the second calendar entry is an all-day calendar entry.
[0427]       In some embodiments, the processing unit 4406 is further configured to detect
(e.g., with the detecting unit 4410) user selection of the second event affordance and, in
response to detecting the user selection of the second event affordance, enable enlargement
(e.g., with the enlargement enabling unit 4414) of the second affordance.
[0428]       In some embodiments, the enlarged second affordance includes text representing
the name of the second calendar entry.
[0429]       In some embodiments, only one of the first affordance and the second affordance
includes text representing a name of the first calendar entry.
[0430]       In some embodiments, the second event affordance representing the all-day
calendar entry is displayed on top of all other displayed affordances representing calendar
entries.
[0431]       In some embodiments, detecting user selection of the second event affordance
comprises detecting a touch on the touch-sensitive surface unit 4404 at a position of the
displayed second event affordance.
[0432]       In some embodiments, wherein detecting user selection of the second event
affordance comprises detecting a touch on the touch-sensitive surface unit 4404 at a position
of the displayed second event affordance and a movement of the touch.
                                                  101

1002203380
[0433]       In some embodiments, detecting user selection of the second event affordance
comprises detecting a touch on the touch-sensitive surface unit 4404 at a position of the
displayed second event affordance and a movement of the touch above a threshold distance.
[0434]       The operations described above with reference to FIG. 33 are, optionally,
implemented by components depicted in FIGs. 1A-1B or FIG. 44. For example, displaying
operation 3302, detecting operations 3304 and 3308, launching operation 3306, and enlarging
operation 3310 are, optionally, implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and
event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive
display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application
136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event
information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a
first location on the touch-sensitive surface (or whether rotation of the device) corresponds to
a predefined event or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a user interface, or rotation
of the device from one orientation to another. When a respective predefined event or sub
event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the
detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally uses or calls data updater
176 or object updater 177 to update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments,
event handler 190 accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the
application. Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other
processes can be implemented based on the components depicted in FIGs. lA-lB.
