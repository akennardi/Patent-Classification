disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
                                    FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
[0002]    The present disclosure relates generally to power tools, and more particularly to lawn and
garden power tools.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
[0003]    Traditionally, a power tool such as a mower is powered by high-capacity AC power
source or a DC battery power source.
[0004]    Generally, connecting a number of batteries or battery packs in parallel increases the
power capacity for the power tool. However, if the respective voltages of the battery packs
connected in parallel are not equal, current from the battery pack at a high voltage will flow into
the battery pack at a low voltage, reverse charging can occur in the battery or the battery pack
having a lower voltage. This will affect the efficiency of the power supply.
[0005]    The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the
present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.

                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0029]    The following description of the preferred embodiments is merely exemplary in nature
and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.
[0030]    As shown in FIG. 1-FIG. 2, a first battery pack 11 and a second battery pack 12 are used to

[0034]     A power tool 13 comprises a first battery receptacle 101 for receipt of the first battery
pack 11 and a second battery receptacle 102 for receipt of the second battery pack 12.
[0035]     The first battery receptacle 101 includes a first positive terminal 132 and a first negative
terminal 133. The first positive terminal 132 connects to the first positive pole 111. The first

[0036]     The second battery receptacle 102 includes a second positive terminal 135 and a second
negative terminal 136. The second positive terminal 135 connects to the second positive pole 121.
The second negative terminal 136 connects to the second negative pole 123.
[0037]     Both of the first positive terminal 132 and the second positive terminal 135 connect to a
positive node A. Both of the first negative terminal 133 and the second negative terminal 136
connect to a negative node B.
[0038]     The power tool 13 further comprises a first switch device 131, a second switch device 134,
a motor 138 and a controller 139.
[0039]     The motor 138 connects between the positive node A and the negative node B.
[0040]     The first switch device 131 is connected between the first battery or battery pack and the
motor so as to form a first electrical connection between the first battery and the motor or cut off
the first electrical connection between the first battery and the motor, and the second switch device
 134 is connected between the second battery or battery pack and the motor so as to form a second
electrical connection between the second battery and the motor or cut off the second electrical
connection between the second battery and the motor. The first switch device 131 is set between
the positive node A and the positive terminal 132. A first switch terminal of the first switch device
 131 connects to the positive node A, and a second switch terminal of the first switch device 131
connects to the first battery receptacle 101 or the positive terminal 132. The first switch device 131
                                                    6

is closed to form the electrical connection between the first battery or battery pack and the motor,
or opened to cut off the electrical connection of the first battery or battery pack and the motor 138.
[0041]    In one embodiment, the first switch device 131 includes one or more transistors such as
MOSFETs or power MOSFETs. In one form, the first switch device 131 is a field effect transistor.
In another form, the first switch device 13 is a circuit module with a similar switch function. The
circuit module also has a first connection point or terminal for connecting to the positive node A
and a second connection point or terminal for connecting to the first positive terminal 132.
[0042]    The second switch device 134 is set between the positive node A and second positive
terminal 135. A first switch terminal of the second switch device 134 connects to the positive node
A, and a second switch terminal of the second switch device 134 connects to the second battery
receptacle 102 or the second positive terminal 135. The second switch device 134 is closed to form

off the electrical connection of the second battery or battery pack and the motor 138.
[0043]    In one embodiment, the second switch device 134 includes one or more transistors such as
MOSFETs or power MOSFETs. In one form, the second switch device 134 is a MOSFIELD
EFFECT TRANSISTOR. In another form, the second switch device 134 is a circuit module with
similar switch functions. The circuit module also has a first connection point or terminal for
connecting to the positive node A and a second connection point or terminal for connecting to the
second positive terminal 135.
[0044]    In the power tool 13, the second switch device 134 may use the same semiconductor
element as the first switch device 131 or be a circuit module having similar switching functions.
[0045]    As shown in FIG. 2, the first battery pack 11 and the second battery pack 12 plug in the
power tool 13 respectively. The first positive pole 111 connects to the first positive terminal 132.
The first negative pole 113 connects to the first negative terminal 133. The second positive pole
121 connects to the second positive terminal 135. The second negative pole 123 connects to the
second negative terminal 136.
                                                   7

[0046]    Due to the first positive terminal 132 and the second positive terminal 135 connecting to
the common positive node A and the first negative terminal 133 and the second negative terminal
 136 connecting to the common negative node B, the battery pack 11 and the battery pack 12 are set
in parallel to supply power for the motor 138 when the switch 137 is closed.
[0047]    Assume the voltage of the first battery pack 11 is higher than that of the second battery
pack 12, and the first switch device 131 and the second switch device 134 are supposed to be
closed at an initial condition.
[0048]    Due to the first negative terminal 133 and the second negative terminal 136 connecting to
a common ground potential point, the voltage of the first positive terminal 132 is higher than that
of the second positive terminal 135.
[0049]    As shown in FIG. 2, the first switch device 131 and the second switch device 134 are
MOSFET each with two connecting terminals and a control terminal. The two connecting
terminals of the first switch device 131 is connected in series between the first positive terminal
 132 and the positive node A. Turn off the first switch device 131, current from the first positive
terminal 132 flows into the positive node A through the two connecting terminals of the first
switch device 13 1.
[0050]    Controller 139a is set for detecting across the first switch device 131 a first voltage drop,
which is defined by a potential or voltage drop between the first terminal and the second terminal
of the first switch device 131 along the current direction, or between the positive node A and the
first positive terminal 132 due to the connection of the first terminal to the positive node A and the
connection of the second terminal to the first positive terminal 132. In other words, the first voltage
drop of the first switch device 131 detected by the controller 139a along the current direction
equals to the potential or voltage drop from a high potential point of the first positive terminal 132
to a low potential point of the positive node A. Assume that the first voltage drop across the first
switch device 131 along the current direction is less than a first control voltage which is set for
initiating the first switch device 131 and/or the controller 139a, the controller 139a sends a signal
                                                   8

to cause the first switch device 131 opened to disconnect the first battery pack 11 and the motor
 138. That is, if the first voltage drop as detected from the high potential point of the first positive
terminal 132 to the low potential point of the positive node A is less than the first control voltage,
the controller 139a will control the first switch device 131 opened to cut off the electrical
connection of the first battery or battery pack 11 and the motor 138. The first control voltage has a
value greater than zero, and set for initiating the first switch device 131 and/or the controller 139a.
That is, if the first voltage drop as detected from the high potential point of the first positive
terminal 132 to a low potential point of the positive node A is greater than the first control voltage,
the controller 139a enables the first switch device 131 closed to form the electrical connection of
the first battery or battery pack 11 and the motor 138.
[0051]    Controller 139b is set for detecting across the second switch device 134a second voltage
drop along the current direction. When the second voltage drop as detected is less than a second
control voltage, the controller 139b sends a signal to cause the second switch device 134 opened to
disconnect the second battery or battery pack 12 and the motor 138.
[0052]    In the embodiment of Fig. 2, the voltage of the first battery pack 11 is supposed to be
higher than that of the second battery pack 12, it is known that the potential point of the first
positive terminal 132 is higher than that of the positive node A, and the potential point of the
second positive terminal 134 is lower than that of the positive node A. Controller 139a detects the
first voltage drop across the first switch device 13 1 along the current direction, and the first voltage
drop as detected is greater than the first control voltage which is set for initiating the first switch
device 131 and/or the controller 139a,the controller 139a sends a signal to cause the first switch
device 13 1 closed to conduct or form the electrical connection of the second battery or battery pack
11 and the motor 138, while controller 139b detects the second voltage drop across the second
switch device 134 along the current direction, and the detected second voltage drop is less than a
second control voltage which is set for initiating the second switch device 134 and/or the controller
139b, the controller 139b sends a signal to cause the second switch device 134 opened to cut off or
disconnect the second battery or battery pack 11 and the motor 138. Thus, the first battery pack 11
                                                    9

cannot power the second battery pack 12 so as to avoid the current flow from the first battery pack
 11 at a high voltage to the second battery pack 12 at a lower voltage. It should be appreciated that
the voltage drop of the first switch device 131 is greater than or equal to the first control voltage
which is set for initiating the first switch device 131 and/or the controller 139a, the connection of
the first battery 11 to the motor 139 is enabled by the first closed switch device 131 so as to permit
the power tool to be powered merely by the first battery 11 with a higher voltage.
[0053]     Assume the voltage of the first battery pack 11 is equal to the voltage of the second
battery pack 12, by detecting the first voltage drop and the second voltage drop both of which are
greater than a corresponding control voltage, controller 139a controls the first switch device 131
and the second switch device 134 closed to permit the power tool to be powered by both of the first
battery pack 11 and the second battery pack 12 connected in parallel. It should be noted that when
a number of battery packs 12 are provided, certain switch devices or more than two switch devices
associated with the battery packs 12 are detected to have a respective voltage drop greater than a
corresponding control voltage, controller or controllers control the switch devices closed so as to
enable the associate parallel-connected battery packs with the same voltage to power for the power
tool.
[0054]     Thus, no matter the first battery pack 11 and second battery pack 12 are inserted in the
power tool 13 simultaneously or in sequence, the first battery pack 11 and the second battery pack
12 are controlled to power the power tool 13 simultaneously at the time the voltage of the battery
pack 11 as detected is reduced to be equal to the voltage of the second battery pack 12. The current
flow from the battery pack 11 at a high voltage to the battery pack 12 at a low voltage can be
avoided.
[0055]     To prevent over-discharge of the battery back 11, the controller 139a may be operable to
detect a voltage of the first battery pack 11, send a signal to interrupt or cut off the connection of
the first battery pack 11 and the motor when the voltage of the first battery pack 11 is less than a
first voltage threshold.
                                                   10

[0056]    To prevent over-discharge of the battery back 12, the controller 139b may be operable to
detect a voltage of the second battery pack 12, send a signal to interrupt or cut off the connection of
the second battery pack 12 and the motor when the voltage of the second battery pack 12 is less
than the second voltage threshold.
[0057]    In one form, the controller 139a may be operable to detect a current which flows from the
first terminal to the second terminal of the first switch device 13 1. When the current as detected is
less than a predetermined current, the controller 139a sends a signal to cause the first switch device
131 opened so as to cut off the connection of the first terminal and the second terminal of the first
battery pack 11. It should be noted the predetermined current has a value greater than zero.
[0058]    In one form, the controller 139b may be operable to detect a current which flows from the
first terminal to the second terminal of the second switch device 134. When the detected current is
less than a predetermined current, the controller 139b sends a signal to cause the second switch
device 134 opened to disconnect the connection of the first switch terminal and the second switch
terminal.
[0059]    In an alternative embodimentshown in FIG. 3, a first switch device 213 and a controller
212 can be set within a first battery pack 21. In other words, the first switch device 213 and the
controller 212 can be disposed within a housing of the first battery pack 21. A second switch
device 223 and a controller 222 can be set within a second battery pack 22.
[0060]    In FIG. 3, the first switch device 213 connects between the first positive terminal 211 and
the positive pole of the battery cells 214. The second switch device 223 connects between the
second positive terminal 22 land the positive pole of battery cells 224.
[0061]    As shown in FIG.3, the first switch device 213 and the second switch device 223 are
MOSFIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR. The first controller 212 connects to the control terminal of
the first switch device 213 for controlling the first switch device 213 on or off. The second
controller 222 connects to the control terminal of the second switch device 223 for controlling the
second switch device 223 on or off.

[0062]    The first battery pack 21 and the second battery pack 22 plug in the power tool 23, the first
positive pole 211 connects to the first positive terminal 231. A first negative pole 215 connects
with a first negative terminal 232. A second positive pole 221 connects with a second positive
terminal 233. A second negative pole 225 connects with a second negative terminal 234.
[0063]    Turn on a switch 235, the battery pack 21 and the battery pack 22 are set in parallel for
powering the motor 236 as the same as the FIG.2. The first controller 212 and the second controller
222 operate to detect the corresponding voltage of the switch device 213, 223 and send a first
signal to disconnect the corresponding switch which has a voltage drop less than the
predetermined voltage
[0064]    In a preferred embodiment shown in the FIG. 4, a power tool 33 is configured to connect
with a first battery pack 31 and a second battery pack 32.
[0065]    When the first battery pack 31 and the second battery pack 32 plug in the power tool 33
respectively, a first positive pole 3 11 connects with a first positive terminal 331, a first negative
pole 313 connects with a first negative terminal 332, a second positive pole 321connects with a
second positive terminal 334, and a second negative pole 323 connects with a second negative
terminal 335. Turn on a switch 337; the battery pack 11 and the battery pack 12 are connected in
parallel for powering the motor 138.
[0066]    The difference between the power tool 33 of FIG. 4 and the power tool 13 as shown in
FIG. 1 is that the first switch device 333 is set between a negative node D and the first battery
receptacle or the first battery, the second switch device 336 is set between the negative node D and
the second battery receptacle or the second battery.
[0067]    In Fig.4, the first switch device 333 is MOSFET. It includes a first switch terminal for
connecting to the negative node D, the second switch terminal for connecting to the first negative
terminal 332 and a control terminal for connecting the first controller 339a.
[0068]    The second switch device 336 is MOSFET as well. It includes a first switch terminal for
                                                   12

connecting the negative node D, the second switch terminal for connecting the second negative
terminal 335 and a control terminal for connecting the second controller 339b.
[0069]    The first positive terminal 331 and the second positive terminal 334 both connect to the
positive node C.
[0070]    The control terminal of the first controller connects with the control terminal of the first
switch device 333. The first controller 339a detects a first voltage drop across the first switch
device 333 along the current direction. When the first voltage drop of the first switch device 333 is
less than a first predetermined voltage, the first controller 339a sends a signal to cause the first
switch device 333 opened to disconnect the first battery pack 31 and the motor 338. Turn on a
switch 337, the first battery pack 31 and the motor 338 form a current loop.
[0071]    The control terminal of the second controller 339b connects with the control terminal of
the second switch device 336. The second controller 339b detects a second voltage drop across the
second switch device 336 along the current direction. When the second voltage drop of the second
switch device 336 is less than a second control voltage, the second controller 339b sends a signal to
cause the second switch device 336 opened to disconnect the second battery pack 32 and the motor
338. Turn on the switch 337, the second battery pack 32 and the motor 338 form a current loop.
[0072]    Assume the voltage of the first battery pack 31 is higher than the voltage of the second
battery pack 32 in FIG. 4. Turn on the switch 337, the voltage of the first negative terminal 332 is
less than that of the negative node D, the first switch device 333 is controlled to be on or closed, the
current from the first terminal or the negative node D of the first switch device 333 flows to the
second terminal or the first negative terminal 332 of the first switch device 333.Thus, the first
voltage drop of the first switch device 333 along the current direction is greater than the first
control voltage, controller 339a controls the first switch device 333 closed to form the electrical
connection of the first battery or battery pack 31 and the motor 338.
[0073]    The second controller 339b detects a second voltage drop between the first terminal and
the second terminal of the second switch device336. The second voltage drop as detected along the
                                                   13

current direction is less than a second control voltage due to the voltage of the second negative
terminal 335 greater than that of the negative node D, the second controller 339b sends a signal to
turn off or open the second switch device 336. Thus, the first battery pack 31 cannot power the
second battery pack 32 and the second battery pack 32 cannot output current so as to avoid the
current flow of the first battery pack 31 at a high voltage into the second battery pack 32 at a low
voltage.It should be appreciated that the voltage drop of the first switch device 331 along the
current direction is greater than or equal to the first control voltage which is set for initiating the
second switch device 336 and/or the controller 339b, the connection of the first battery pack 31 and
the motor 338 is enabled to permit the power tool powered by the first battery 31.
[0074]     Assume the voltage of the first battery pack 31 is equal to the voltage of the second
battery pack 32 in FIG. 4, the first controller 339a turns on or closes the first switch device 333 and
the second controller 339b turns on or closes the second switch device 336 such that the power tool
is powered by both of the battery packs 31, 32 connected in parallel.
[0075]     To prevent over-discharge of the battery pack 31, the first controller 339a operable to
detect a current voltage of the first battery pack 31, sends a signal to interrupt the connection of the
first battery pack and the motor when the current voltage of the first battery pack is less than a first
voltage thresholdvalue which is set for preventing the over-discharge of the battery pack 31.
[0076]     To prevent over-discharge of the battery back 32, the second controller 339b may be
operable to detect a current voltage of the second battery pack 32, sends a signal to interrupt the
connection of the second battery pack and the motor when the current voltage of the second battery
pack is less than a second voltage threshold value which is set for preventing the over-discharge of
the second battery pack 32.
[0077]     In an alternative embodiment, the first controller 339a may be operable to detect a current
of the first switch device 333, sends a signal to turn off or open the first switch device 333 when the
current of the first switch device 333 is less than a first current threshold.
[0078]     The second controller 339b may be operable to detect a current of the second switch
                                                    14

device 336, sends a signal to turn off or open the second switch device 336 when the current of the
second switch device 336 is less than a second current threshold.

be set within a first battery pack 41. A second switch device 424 and a controller 423 can be set
within a second battery pack 42. In other words, the first switch device 414 and the controller 413

cells 412. The second switch device 424 connects between a second negative terminal 425 and a
negative pole of the second battery cell or cells 422.
[0080]    The first switch device 414 and the second switch device 424 are MOSFIELD EFFECT
TRANSISTOR. The controller 413 connects to the control terminal of the first switch device 414
for controlling the connection or disconnection of the first switch device 424. The controller 423
connects to the control terminal of the second switch device 424 for controlling the connection or

second control voltage.
