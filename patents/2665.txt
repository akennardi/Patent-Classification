   The present invention relates to a cosmetic preparation containing a UV filter combination of
   a) hexyl 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl] benzoate (INCI: Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl
 5 Hexyl Benzoate),

   The trend away from "aristocratic paleness" toward healthy, athletically bronze skin has continued
   undiminished for years. To achieve this, people expose their skin to solar radiation, which causes
   pigment formation in the sense of melanin formation. However, the ultraviolet radiation from
   sunlight also has a damaging effect on the skin. In addition to the acute damage (sunburn), long
 0 term damage occurs, such as increased risk of contracting skin cancer from excessive exposure to
   light from the UVB range (wavelength: 280-320 nm). Overexposure to UVB and UVA radiation
   (wavelength: 320-400 nm) also results in weakening of the elastic, collagenic fibers of the
   connective tissue. This leads to numerous phototoxic and photoallergic reactions, and results in
   premature aging of the skin.
25
   Therefore, for protection of the skin, a number of light protection filter substances have been
   developed which may be used in cosmetic preparations. In most industrialized countries, these
   UVA and UVB filters are compiled in the form of positive lists, such as Annex 7 of the German
   Cosmetics Regulation.
30
   However, the large number of commercially available sunscreens should not obscure the fact that
   these preparations of the prior art have a number of drawbacks.
   Cosmetic sunscreens have the problem that a considerable number of UV filters do not have
35 particularly good solubility in the preparations. In particular when preparations having a high sun

                                                         2
   protection factor and a high UV filter content are developed, the solubility of 4-(tert-butyl)-4'
   methoxydibenzoylmethane (INCI: Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane) and triazine derivatives
   represents a problem for developers. To solve this problem, the liquid UVB filter octocrylene has
   been used in the past as a UV filter and solvent. Octocrylene is also used for the photostabilization
 5 of 4-(tert-butyl)-4'-methoxydibenzoy methane.
   The disadvantage of the prior art lies in the fact that the use of octocrylene, despite approval by the
   licensing authorities, is not entirely without controversy, resulting in "bad marks" in grading of the
   product by some consumer magazines (Oko-Test, for example). This negative assessment is
 0 justified, in that some scientists suspect that this UV filter could possibly have hormonal activity.
   Even if no negative effects in humans have become apparent, despite decades of worldwide use of
   this UV filter in sunscreens, there is a desire by consumers to avoid preparations containing such
   ingredients.
 5 The object of the present invention, therefore, is to eliminate the disadvantages of the prior art and
   to develop a sunscreen having a high sun protection factor, in which the UV filters (in particular
   4-(tert-butyl)-4'-methoxydibenzoy methane and triazine derivatives, in particular 2,4-bis-{[4-(2
   ethylhexyloxy)-2-hydroxy]phenyl}-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (INCI: Bis
   Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine) and 2,4,6-tris-[anilino-(p-carbo-2'-ethyl-1'-hexyloxy)]
 0 1,3,5-triazine (INCI: Ethylhexyl Triazone)) are stably dissolved without using octocrylene as solvent
   and stabilizer.
   Cosmetic preparations such as sunscreen preparations which are applied to the skin routinely
   come into contact (intentionally or unintentionally) with articles of clothing and laundry items (hand
25 towels, for example), to which they sometimes adhere (for example, by rubbing off or by being
   "sucked up" by the fiber materials). Spots and discolorations thus occur, depending on the type of
   ingredients, in particular on light-colored textiles. These discolorations are caused in particular by
   nonwater-soluble UVA filters and broadband filters such as 4-(tert-butyl)-4'
   methoxydibenzoylmethane (INCI: Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane), (2-[4-(diethylamino)-2
30 hydroxybenzoyl] benzoic acid hexyl ester (INCI: Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate),
   and 2,4-bis-{[4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2-hydroxy]phenyl}-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (INCI: Bis
   Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine). The stains are difficult to remove by laundering with
   conventional detergents, and even intensify during the laundering process due to interactions with
   ions in the wash water.

 o Comparative test (wash test) and example
   With the following test, it was possible to document the effect according to the invention by use of
   an example:
   Various emulsifier systems were prepared. These also included a system containing 0.8% of the
   auxiliary substance polyglyceryl-1 0 stearate according to the invention, in order to determine the
25 stain-reducing effect (reduction of b*) compared to a formulation without the auxiliary substance
   according to the invention, using described methods.
   As documentation of the improved washability and reduced spot formation of the preparations
   according to the invention, in vitro tests were conducted, the results of which are shown in Table 1.

                                                       12
   Various sunscreen emulsions were tested for formation of yellow spots, via an in vitro
   application/wash cycle. Prewashed white cotton monitors (100% cotton) were used. For this
   purpose, in each case 25 mg of the test formulation was uniformly distributed on Sch5nberg PMMA
   plates (5.0 x 5.0 cm) and directly transferred to the test textile by applying pressure. The stained
 5 cotton samples were subsequently dried in air for 12 hours under laboratory conditions.
   After drying, a colorimetric characterization of the resulting initial staining was carried out by
   measuring the degree of yellowing, using the spectro-color colorimeter (Dr. Lange); colorimetry
   software: Spectral QC, measurement geometry version: d/80 , gloss component excluded, type of
 0 light: D65 (corresponding to average daylight), calibration standard: LZM 268, measurement
   opening: 10 mm, sample background: backing paper without optical brighteners, test climate
   conditions: 21 C (± 1 C), 41% (± 4%) relative humidity.
   The change in the b value from the CIE Lab color measurement system was used for the
 5 evaluation. In the CIE Lab system, the B axis characterizes the yellow/blue color impression, where
   positive b values stand for an increase in the yellow component. The higher the b value, the greater
   the yellow impression.
   After the measuring operation, the test swatches were separately washed in the Linitest Plus
 0 (Atlas) dyeing and color-fastness apparatus (600C, 1 hour, 20 rpm, Ariel Compact powdered
   detergent,10 metal balls as additional load), followed by a rinsing operation (200C, 15 min, tap
   water).
   After drying for 12 hours under laboratory conditions, a colorimetric characterization of the resulting
25 staining was once again carried out by measuring the color values, using the spectro-color
   colorimeter (Dr. Lange) as described above.
   The CIE Lab system or L*a*b* color space is a three-dimensional measuring space containing all
   perceivable colors. The color space is designed based on complementary color theory. One of the
30 most important properties of the L*a*b* color model is its device independence; i.e., the colors are
   defined independently of the technique used to create and reproduce them.
   The corresponding EU Directive is DIN EN ISO 11664-4, "Colorimetry - Part 4: CIE 1976 L*a*b*
   Color Space." The coordinates of the CIELAB plane are formed from the red/green value a and the
35 yellow/blue value b. The lightness axis L is perpendicular to this plane. According to DIN 6174, L, a,

                                                       13
  and b are to be written using the * symbol in order to make a distinction from other systems, such
  as the Hunter Lab system.
