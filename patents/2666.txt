                                      Abstract
        A system for remotely retrieving sensed conditions at one or more building
components. The building components are remote or numerous so that a wireless
collection of the sensed conditions provides a significant benefit to a builder or building
operator. A remote transceiver sends a wireless signal to a building component. The
building component includes an onboard transceiver. At least some of the energy from
the transmitted wireless signal is received by the onboard transceiver, sent to a storage
device, and stored therein. The stored energy is used to operate a sensor for sensing an
onboard condition. The onboard condition is then wirelessly transmitted by the onboard
transceiver back to the remote transceiver to be displayed.

                           of performing it known to me/us:-

                       CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]       This is a non-provisional application of provisional application 62/438639 filed
December 23, 2016, and provisional application 62/456243 filed February 8, 2017 which claims
priority from both, and the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their
entirety.
                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]       In certain environments (e.g., a space station, a building or construction site, a
warehouse, a storage yard, etc.) it would be desirable to know/confirm the existence of and/or a
condition (e.g., a physical condition) at a particular location in the environment. Furthermore, as
certain locations may be numerous or inaccessible, it might be most convenient if the condition
at the particular location could be retrieved or gathered by a user wirelessly when the location is
a remote distance from the user. For example, in a building or construction site it might be
desirable to know the load being borne by a particular load bearing member. With respect to the
borne load, a building inspector or designer might like to remotely gather information about one
or more members (e.g., load bearing anchors) in order to confirm that such members are being
loaded within code permitted parameters\limits. Alternatively, during construction of a building,
a contractor might desire to wirelessly collect information regarding the presence or identity of
certain members and a condition (e.g., how much load those members are bearing or if moisture
is present) under which they exist in their various locations. A designer (e.g., a structural
designer) might even find that he/she is able to design more efficiently and less conservatively
knowing that an exact or close to exact condition (e.g., load being borne by) of the member can
be determined. The present invention to be described below includes a system for wirelessly
retrieving information about a sensed condition (including the fact of existence of the physical
object about which the condition is being sought) at a remote location. For example, when the
retrieval system retrieves information about the existence of elements, the retrieved information
can be used to determine installation progress during construction.
                                    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

              DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0029]       Figures 1A and 1B show a conventional concrete decking precast anchor 10 and a
conventional wood form precast anchor 20 respectively. Both anchors 10 and 20 include a
shoulder 12 on a first end which extends radially outward so that when set in concrete it resists
pull-out. The anchors also include female threads 16 on a second end for receiving a threaded
support rod after installation. An intermediate portion 14 is disposed between shoulder 12 and
threaded member 16. When set, both types of anchor are secured in the cured concrete with an
exposed connector 16 (e.g., a female thread). The female thread 16 is now able to receive an
object (e.g., a threaded hanger rod). The hanger rod may be secured to the concrete via the
anchor at one end and to a building component at the other end. Building components to be

secured to the concrete may include building conduit for supporting various building systems
(e.g., fire, HVAC, electrical, etc.).
[0030]       In addition to the above mentioned cast in place anchors, the present invention relates
to drop in anchors of the type shown in cross-section in Figure IC. A drop-in anchor 30 is
placed after concrete setting. A hole 32 (e.g., cylindrical) is drilled in the concrete. Drop-in
anchor 30 (e.g., cylindrical in shape) is then inserted into hole 32. The anchors usually include a
well know wedge mechanism which when actuated, forces radially expandable portions 31 of the
anchor outward into contact with the walls of the drilled concrete hole 32 to wedge anchor 30
into hole 32. Similar to the cast in place anchors 10, 20 described above, a connector (e.g., a
threaded female connector) is exposed for connection to a support member (e.g., a threaded rod).
Certain conventional features of the above types of concrete anchors are described in U.S. Patent
Nos. 6,240,697; 4,211,048; 5,593,261; 6,652,207 and 3,769,774, each of which is incorporated
herein by reference in their entirety.
[0031]       Figures 2A and 2B show a smart anchor connector or smart connector 100. Smart
connector 100 includes a first end 102 and a second end 104 through which a central longitudinal
axis A-A passes. At first end 102 of connector 100 is a threaded portion 120 (e.g., male thread)
which can be threadably connected to the female connectors of the anchors 10, 20, 30 of Figure
1. A lower portion of connector 120 may include a bearing surface 130. At second end 104 of
connector 100 is a threaded female connector 150 shown in Figure 2. Connector 100 includes a
hollow cylinder 140 at a second 140. The wall surface forming the hollow portion of the
cylinder is the same female threaded surface of as threaded connector 150. An intermediate
portion 160 extends between threaded connectors 120 and 150. Also between threaded
connectors 120 and 150 is a projection 180 (e.g., radial projection). Radial projection 180 can
includes a center bearing 170 that shares a central axis with longitudinal axis A-A. Radial
projection 180 also includes an outer edge 181, a top surface 183 and a bottom surface 182.
[0032]       When threaded connector 120 of connector 100 is connected to the threaded female
connector 16 of anchors 10, 20 or 30, threaded female connector 150 is exposed for receiving a
threaded rod that would have otherwise been received by the female threaded openings in

anchors 10, 20, and 30. Therefore, in operation connector 100 is positioned between and/or in
series with anchors 10, 20, or 30 and the threaded support rod. When the threaded rod is
connected directly to anchors 10, 20, or 30, load from the threaded rod is transferred from the rod
to anchors 10, 20, or 30 and then to the concrete. On the other hand, when connector 100 is
placed between anchors 10, 20, or 30 and the threaded rod, load (e.g., tension load) from the rod
is transferred through smart connector 100 to anchors 10, 20, or 30 and then to the concrete.
[0033]       Anchors 10, 20, 30 may also be redesigned so that after setting, female threads 16 are
countersunk below the concrete surface. Such countersinking would allow a connector 100 to
also be at least partially countersunk in the concrete if so desired. For example, anchor 20 may
also include a bottom 19 against which anchor 20 rests on a wood form during and after
installation, but before the wood form is stripped. Furthermore, anchor 20 includes a seat 17 on
which shoulder 12 rests after shoulder 12 is impacted (e.g., by a hammer). The length of thread
16 and the pre-set distance between shoulder 12 and seat 17 may be adjusted such that after
installation, threads 16 do not extend all the way to bottom 19. If threads 16 stop short of bottom
19 after installation, a void in the concrete is maintained between the thread and the surface of
the concrete so that connector 100 may be received in the void and at least partially counter sunk
in the concrete after attachment to anchor 20.
[0034]       Smart connector 100 may include a sensor thereon for sensing a condition at the
anchor (e.g., a physical condition, or load) that passes through the anchor. For example, that
load may be measured by a strain gauge positioned on smart connector 100. The gauge may be
positioned to measured strain/load at an intermediate portion 160 of connector 100 between the
male threaded connector 120 and the female threaded connector 150. In one embodiment, it may
be convenient to reduce the dimensions (e.g., radial or cross-sectional) of intermediate portion
160 with respect to threaded connectors 120, 150 in order to amplify or best sense the strain
experienced by the intermediate portion and therefore the load being transferred through the
system to the concrete. Therefore, after installation, an exact amount of load being transferred
through anchors 10, 20, 30 can be determined and know. It should also be noted that in addition
to a tensile strain, a compressive strain can also be the basis of a load calculation when a
compressive load is induced in a portion of anchor 10, 20, or 30 or connector 100.

[0035]      As discussed above, installed anchor systems frequently include components that are
too remote or too numerous to easily collect the determined load information. Therefore, the
present specification contemplates a wireless system for remotely retrieving actual anchor load
information. Figure 2C shows a washer or smart washer 200. Washer 200 can include the RFID
transceiver, the sensor, and/or the storage device of the system of Figure 3. When one of these
elements is absent from washer 200, the element may be located on the anchor in proximity to
washer 200 so that it can communicate electrically with washer 200. Smart washer 200 is disk or
washer shaped but could take on any convenient form depending on the structure of the anchor
on to which it is yoked or connected. Figure 3 shows washer 200 including an inner wall surface
210 defining a washer inner diameter and an outer wall surface 210 having an outer washer
diameter. Washer 200 may also includes a thickness of a dimension that is significantly less than
the outer surface diameter. In one embodiment shown in Figure 2C, washer 200 sits on a top
support surface 183 of projection 180 and is radially secured by a center bearing 170. The
location of washer 200 on surface 183 is in proximity to intermediate portion 160 so that washer
200 may receive an electrical signal from a strain gauge 162 located at intermediate portion 160.
[0036]      Figure 2D shows a drop-in anchor 40 for dropping into a drilled concrete hole 41.
Drop-in anchor includes a shaft 45 and a head 44. Head 44 includes a flange 43 for securing a
structural member 50 to the concrete 39. Shaft 45 includes female threaded wedge 46 for
receiving a threaded member attached to head 44. Legs 48 of shaft 45 expand outward when
head 44 is rotated to pull wedge 46 toward head 44. Expanded legs 48 engage walls of hole 41
to secure anchor 40 in hole 41. Flange 43 may include an axial extension 42 that engages and
transfers load between flange 43 and the object 50 to be secured to the concrete. Shaft 45 may
pass through washer 200 and flange 43 may extend over washer 200 to secure washer 200
without placing washer 200 in the load path. A sensor (e.g., strain gauge) can be disposed along
the shaft. For example, a strain gauge may be disposed between legs 48 and flange 43 through
which tension load will be transferred between the structure 50 and flange 43. Figure 2E shows
a similar drop-in embodiment except that flange 47 is step shaped to define a recess for receiving
and securing washer 200 without placing washer 200 in the load path. Figures 2D and 2E
disclose shaft 45 that includes a wedge fastening mechanism for securing anchor 40 in hole 41.
Instead, a convention screw type fastener may be substituted instead for shaft 45. When a screw

mechanism is used the sensor 49 need only be placed between the flange 43 and the portion of
shaft 45 where the threads make contact with the concrete. For example, a fastener having an
unthreaded portion between the threaded shaft and flange 43 is contemplated. A sensor may be
positioned at the unthreaded portion.
[0037]      As discussed below, washer 200 is capable of wirelessly transmitting load, anchor
identity and other sensed information (e.g., temperature, moisture content, wireless information
from another anchor, etc.) to a remote site for processing and review. Furthermore, information
from multiple connectors 100 may be wirelessly transmitted back from the various anchor
elements 10, 20, 30 or connectors 100 to a remote processor or network processor for processing
and generating useful information. The wireless transmission back may be directly from an
anchor to the processor or to the processor from an anchor via another anchor. For example,
remote electronic processors/displays may include BIM data and/or graphics for showing the
actual BIM location or layout of or identity/ownership of sensed anchors and the loads on each
anchor may be provided. Figure 5 shows a possible wireless handheld display 500 (discussed in
greater detail below) displaying graphics representing a facility site (e.g., construction site) and
actual BIM locations of construction components (e.g., anchors) with attributes (e.g., sensed
conditions) associated therewith.
[0038]      While the above remote anchor condition sensing system includes both an anchor 10,
20, or 30 and a connector 100, the sensing and transmission features of an anchor system may be
entirely incorporated into one and not the other. In other words, the above sensing and
transmission features may be directly incorporated into an anchor 10, 20, or 30. Alternatively, a
structure similar to connector 100 may be set directly in concrete (i.e., without being connected
to an anchor 10, 20, 30) in much the same way anchors 10, 20, 30 are set in concrete.
[0039]      For example, when connector 100 is set directly in concrete a bearing surface 130
engages the concrete to trap and anchor the connector/anchor against pull-out of the concrete.
The dimensions of surface 130 may be varied to ensure adequate trapping strength. A durable,
compressible, or flexible member 190 may be disposed adjacent an edge of projection 180
opposite bearing surface 130.    Flex member 190 prevents concrete from approaching the space

adjacent bottom surface 182. As a result, when load is applied to the threads of connector 150,
connector 100 experiences strain between connector 150 and bearing surface 130. Therefore, as
connector 150 is loaded, projection 180 is displaced relative to bearing surface 130 in the B
direction as shown in Figure 2B. That displacement includes a corresponding compression of
flex member 190.
[0040]      In an alternate embodiment, when anchors 10, 20, 30 incorporate sensing and
transmission features, no connector 100 need be included. In this case, as shown in Figure 1A,
anchor 10 includes a shoulder 12 which when set in concrete resists pull-out. Anchor 10 also
includes female threads 16 for receiving a threaded support rod after installation. An
intermediate portion 14 is disposed between shoulder 12 and threaded member 16. Intermediate
portion may include a reduced diameter portion. For example, such a reduction may facilitate
the amplification of strain to make load calculation easier, more pronounced, or more accurate.
A strain gauge can be disposed at the intermediate portion 14 and a smart disk 200 may be
positioned on deck stop 18. As in the above embodiments, smart disk 200 receives electrical
signals from anchor sensors (e.g., strain gauges, temperature sensors, pressure sensors, moisture
sensors, etc.) representing the sensed condition and transmits those conditions back to a network
or remote central processing station.
[0041]      Figure 3 shows a remote anchor information retrieval system 300 operating at an
installation site 310 where multiple anchors 330 are installed in a facility (e.g., in a building
ceiling). Each anchor 330 includes an electronic module 340 which includes a transceiver 342, a
capacitor 344, and a sensor 346. System 300 also includes a transceiver 350 that may be
handheld.
[0042]      The system of Figure 3 is capable of remotely retrieving a sensed condition at a
remote location and includes an electronic module or onboard station 340 at the location where
condition sensing is necessary and a RFID transceiver 350 remote from the location. While
RFID communication is possible other wireless protocols such as Wi-Fi, UWF, Bluetooth,
Zigbee, infrared light, etc. or Radio Frequency for longer distance applications may also be
utilized depending on the spacing/distance of the remote objects. U.S. Provisional Patent

Application No. 62/562,683 describes certain jobsite communication techniques and is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[0043]      The onboard station includes an onboard RFID transceiver 342 capable of receiving a
wireless signal from the remote RFID transceiver 350, a sensor 346 (e.g., a strain gauge) for
sensing the condition (e.g., an anchor strain) at the location and an energy storage device 344
(e.g., a capacitor) for powering sensor 346. Each of the onboard RFID transceiver 342, the
sensor 346, and the energy storage device 344 are in electrical communication with each other.
The electrical communication is such that the onboard RFID transceiver 342 receives energy via
the wireless signal 352 transmitted from the remote RFID transceiver 350. At least some of the
energy received by onboard RFID transceiver 342 is communicated to energy storage device 344
which receives and stores at least some of that energy. Sensor 346 receives and consumes at
least some of that stored energy in order to sense the condition (e.g., the strain). Sensor 346 also
generates a first signal representing a value of the sensed condition. Onboard RFID transceiver
342 then receives the first signal and transmits a second wireless signal 354 which is in turn
received back by remote RFID transceiver 350. As mentioned, second signal 354 is received by
remote transceiver 350 which could be one of multiple gateways to a network including other
elements. Second signal 354 can then be processed by the remote RFID transceiver 350 or by
another processor in the wireless network to determine a value of the actual condition. The
actual condition value can then be displayed on the remote RFID transceiver 350 or at another
device in the wireless network.
[0044]      In another embodiment shown in Figure 4A-4C, smart disk 400 is similar to smart
disk 200 except that smart disk 400 includes a stud connector 440. Specifically, smart disk 400
includes a disk 420 connected to a connector 440 made of a resilient or flexible material.
Connector 440 may be selectively connectable to and disconnectable from disk 420. Connector
440 also includes a central opening, is tubular and/or frustoconical in shape, and is adapted to be
secured to a shaft-type structure (e.g., shaft-type anchor). Connector 440 includes a first end 422
that is connected to disk 420 and a second end 444 cantilevered from and disposed a distance
from disk 442. The first end 442 of connector 440 has a diameter and the second end 444 has a
second diameter that is smaller than first diameter. Therefore, disk 400 includes a central

passage through both disk 420 and connector 440. Smart disk 400 is connected to studs or
shafts by inserting the shaft into central passage. When the inserted shaft is slightly smaller than
the diameter of the connector's first end 442 and larger than the diameter of the connector's
second end 444, connector 440 will friction fit snuggly on the shaft.
[0045]       Figure 5 shows a display 500 including a wireless receiver (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
Zigbee, infrared light, RF, etc.) in a wireless network. Display 500 can display a CAD building
layout (i.e., from BIM data) showing installed smart anchors (i.e., the existence of an anchor at a
particular location) to communicate a completion fraction or percentage. Display 500 can also
show other sensed conditions such as temperatures, pressures, moisture content, anchor load, etc.
Furthermore, installed anchors shown on displayed 500 including smart disks 200 or 400 may
display other characteristics such as ownership of anchors (e.g., fire, electrical, HVAC, etc.) or
type of anchors (e.g., drip in or cast in place).
[0046]       The station or module 340 onboard the anchor or washer 200 may also include an
LED 348 powered by the energy storage device 344. LED 348 may be energized when certain
conditions are met. Furthermore, onboard RFID transceiver 342 is able to receive a wireless
signal 352 from remote transceiver 350 or another device in the wireless network of a condition
which, if met, would energize led 348 which could be noticed by a user from a location remote
from the anchor (e.g., light up all HVAC anchors bearing more than 30lbs load) . Furthermore,
various color schemes or blinking patterns on display 500 could be used to further indicate
various conditions or combinations of conditions. Furthermore, if the condition is met, an image
on the display 500 might be pulsed at the location of the CAD image construction site so that the
user will be alerted specifically which anchors meet the condition and where they are on the
construction CAD drawing.
[0047]       Figures 6A and 6B illustrate the features of Figure 3 operating based on two different
electronic communication methods. First Figure 6A illustrates the process of the system of
Figure 3 operating in a Re-Broadcast method. Here, in step 1 an RFID reader (remote
transceiver 350) blasts out energy wave(s). In step 2, RFID antenna receives energy and charges
up an energy storage device (e.g., a capacitor). In step 3, the capacitor stores energy until it is
sufficiently charged. In step 4 when the capacitor has enough energy and is able to charge/power

a circuit with a sensor and measure the sensor value (e.g., voltage drop, current, etc.). In step 5
the remaining energy from the capacitor is used to broadcast the sensor value back to the (remote
transceiver 350) through the antenna. Second Figure 6B illustrates the process of the system of
Figure 3 operating based on a Modulation Method. The Modulation method is similar to the RE
Broadcast method in steps 1-4 except that in step 5 the RFID chip's antenna modulates between
absorbing state and reflecting state at a frequency modulation describing the sensor value.
Furthermore, in step 6 the RFID reader (remote transceiver 350) translates modulation between
reflective and absorbing states.
[0048]       The present invention also contemplates a system of associating a unique anchor with
a specific actual location on the job site and on a CAD building drawing. As discussed above,
each anchor includes a unique wirelessly retrievable RFID identification code. That code can be
associated with a specific actual 3D location on the job site either during anchor installation
before the concrete is poured or after concrete curing. The process can be accomplished by pre
assigning an actual location to each uniquely coded anchor before installation begins and making
sure to accurately place the anchors in their designated locations. The mapped RFID codes and
locations can then be uploaded to the BIM software. This process is feasible, but could be time
consuming and prone to installer error.
[0049]       On the other hand, if a system included a mechanism/device (e.g., remote transceiver
350) for tracking an actual position of an item and that system was also able to superimpose that
tracked actual position on CAD drawings a simpler anchor location mapping scheme than
described in the previous method could be devised. Patent application Nos. 62/370292 filed on
August 3, 2016; 14/928,470 filed on October 30, 2015; 61/666,115, filed on June 29, 2012, and
13/923,7 10, filed on June 21, 2013, now pending are related to tool or component location, are
owned by Applicant, and are each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
[0050]       Based on this incorporated disclosure, an RFID scanning device (e.g., remote
transceiver 350) could be fitted with a tag so that the actual location (e.g., 3D location or 2D and
floor location (e.g., 3rd floor)) of the scanner device 350 could be determined. When the scanner
communicates with a network, a scan of an anchor while the scanner is in proximity to the

anchor can automatically link a unique anchor code to an actual location by knowing the location
of the scanner and reading the unique RFID code of the anchor. That data set can then be
uploaded to the network to display the mapped information (e.g., superimposed on CAD building
drawings).    When the location of the scanner is close to multiple anchor locations as set out in
the BIM design data, the system can map the uniquely scanned anchor code to the closest anchor
location. Furthermore, a visible LED may light up onboard the anchor to indicate that the
location of the scanner is now associated/mapped with the location of the lighted anchor. As
mentioned above, the process of mapping the unique anchor code with the scanner/anchor
location could be done before or after concrete placement. In any case, the process of scanning
and mapping can be repeated after concrete setting to update any inaccurate information.
[0051]      Moreover, the present invention contemplates a network of wireless
intercommunication among onboard transceivers of multiple anchors at multiple remote
locations, multiple remote transceivers, multiple displays, and multiple data processors for
processing the retrieved information. Information from each anchor being associated with that
anchors unique code so that each anchor's information maintains its identity as information
passes among network components. Ultimately, the transmission range may be reduced to the
closest adjacent anchor.    A transmitting and receiving network among area building
components can increase the range and performance of the wireless condition retrieval system.
Furthermore, network transmitting and receiving signal boosters may be positioned permanently
throughout the relevant construction site or via a temporary system (e.g., a portable system
wireless networking system as disclosed in U.S. patent application No. 62/370,292).
[0052]      The foregoing embodiments contemplate building construction components fitted
with electronics to measure loads on and in construction components. More specifically, those
loads can be applied to a construction component in various ways. For example, loads can be
applied by suspending an item (e.g., a pipe) from or fastening an item to a building component
(e.g., a concrete anchor). In the latter case, a threaded nut is torqued onto the threaded end of a
building component (e.g., a concrete anchor bolt). A bearing surface of the nut engages a surface
of the object to be secured and as the nut is tightened the building component (e.g., the concrete

anchor bolt) is tensioned so that the tension of the bolt via the nut surface loads the objects
surface to secure the anchor immovably to the concrete.
[0053]      As discussed herein, the construction component (e.g., the concrete anchor bolt) may
include a module for housing electronics. The module may be disk shaped and the electronics
may include a transceiver, an energy storage device, and a sensor. Therefore, the sensor may be
a strain gauge housed in a disk shaped module such as a smart disk 200 including the same
features as the washer 700 shown in Figure 7B. This sensor in washer 700 is then able to sense
and measure the tension, compression or strain developed in the concrete anchor bolt (e.g., bolts
shown in Figures 2E and 2F). This strain is detected when washer 700 is compressed between
the nut or bolt head and the object to be secured as the bolt is tightened with a torque applying
device such as a torque wrench hand tool or a torque wrench power tool.         Specifically, the
washer is compressed in the direction of the thickness of the washer or in the direction of the
longitudinal axis of the bolt around which the washer is trapped. Projections 717 may house
electronic components (e.g., strain gauge). Such wireless transmission systems of smart washer
700 may be active (e.g., battery powered) or passive (e.g., able to operate with energy from
outside the washer 700 or only energy from outside the washer 700). Washer 700 is then able to
receive signals containing information to be stored in the washer (e.g., bolt tension, worker
identity, date of completion, etc.), receive signals requesting stored information, and transmit
stored and sensed information back to a remote communication device for further processing
and/or display. For example, washer 700 may receive and store information related to the target
bolt tension and then transmit that stored tension value back to a tool during a present or future
installation or maintenance.
[0054]      In a building construction component such as a concrete anchor, bolt tension is
developed between one bolt end that is anchored in concrete and another end that is anchored via
a nut 44 to the structural member or object 50 to be secured to the concrete pad. The smart
washer 700 of the present invention may also be utilized in an application where a building
component (e.g., a bolt 705) is to securely hold two or more objects 750 together (e.g., a nut 707
and bolt 705 holding two structural steel members 750 together). The reliability and security of
such building construction component connections may depend on maintaining a minimum
tension in bolt 705 between the bolt head 710 and the nut 707. Such building components may

employ a special smart bolt 705 that includes a sensor 706 and/or may utilize a sensor in smart
washer 700 of the present invention. Smart washer 700 could be located at, adjacent to, or
against head 710 or nut 707 bearing surfaces between the head 710 and the building member
(e.g., the first structural steel building member) or the between the nut 707and the building
member (i.e., the second structural steel building member).
[0055]        The present invention contemplates smart tools 720 that may communicate directly
with one or more smart washers 700 or communicate indirectly with one or more smart washers
700 via a wireless system of computers and smart washers 700. Conventional methods of
installing building components securely (i.e., installation with sufficient bolt tension and no
more) use hand and power tools equipped with gauges (e.g., strain gauges) for torque sensing the
amount of torque being applied to a nut during the installation tightening process. The user sets
the tool's torque limit manually and when the appropriate or maximum torque is reached,
tightening is suspended. In the case of a torque wrench, mechanical slipping occurs so that the
installer is unable to apply excess torque.
[0056]        When such indirect methods are used, torque applied to the head 710 or nut 707 has
to be translated/converted into tension in the bolt by estimate together with potential conversion
inaccuracies. Therefore, unlike the conventional methods, the present invention smart disk 700
determines more directly (and in real time) the tension in bolt 705. Therefore, smart tools 720
that read bolt tension directly can be used to more directly, effectively and accurately install and
maintain building components to the required building code tensions. Furthermore, more than
one smart washer 700 may be utilized for redundancy in sensitive situations.
[0057]        For example, the compression experienced by smart washer 700 may be directly
and/or proportionally converted into actual bolt tension and transmitted back to the tool 720 (i.e.,
hand or powered tool) periodically or continuously. An installer may tighten a nut 707
periodically remembering to check a visual display on the tool that shows bolt tension to
determine when to cease tightening. Alternatively, tool 720 may broadcast an audible alert to
communicate to the installer that the maximum or target torques is nearing and/or reached.
Furthermore a visual display such as light (e.g., and LED) on the tool or a light on or from smart
washer 700 may serve as an indication that a particular bolt tension level has been or is about to

be reached. Furthermore, the tool control system (sensing the target tension is reached) may
automatically send a slow or stop signal to the motor to slow or stop the tool from tightening
when the target bolt tension is reached. In a hand tool such as a torque wrench, a wireless signal
702 may be sent from smart washer 700 to tool 720 to trigger the mechanical slipping that
prevents further torque transmission. Any combination of the above notifications to the user or
tool may be used in any combination and cumulatively.
[0058]       As discussed above, each smart washer 700 on a construction site may communicate
information to a wireless network and/or to a computer to generate and present useful
information wirelessly and remotely. For example, on a given day (e.g., inspection day) an
inspector may transmit a request to a set of smart washer 700 installed bolts on a structure (e.g., a
bridge structure). Each washer 700 could transmit back to the network the desired information
(e.g., bolt tension, installer, moisture condition, temperature, etc.). That information may be
processed and shown on a display 500 in any useful desired manner. For example, a visual
display of the bolts 705 in their actual relative locations that is color coded to show bolt tensions.
For example, green bolts are within acceptable tension tolerance, yellow bolts are within a
second tolerance range, and red bolts are out of range (i.e., too little tension).
[0059]       Furthermore, a building construction component history (e.g., a bolt history) may be
maintained over the life of the structure. The history may take into consideration the data
collected during each inspection and recommendations made (e.g., about maintenance, bolt
replacement, etc.) based on predetermined criterion. Therefore, in a subsequent inspection,
targeted bolt specific maintenance may be performed based on the collected and stored historical
data.
[0060]       In addition, after inspection, for example, a maintenance person equipped with one of
the smart torqueing/tensioning tools 720 discussed above could send a request signal to one or a
group of bolted smart washers 700 within reach. An LED 715 could retrieve the bolt tension
data for each and light up on any washer 700 having an out of range tension. Bolted washers 700
out of the tension range and discovered during inspection would be visually identified for
maintenance (i.e., replacing or retightening). An audible signal from the smart disk could be
used to accomplish the same notification. The maintenance person can then use the smart tool

720 to tighten the bolts as described above. Furthermore, a unique bolt ID can be retrieved from
the washer so that the tool automatically knows the target torque to stop at if a group of bolts
have different required bolt tensions.
[0061]      The hand tool could be a wrench type tool and the hand tool can be any convenient
type torque driver such as an impact type driver. The power tool can be pneumatically powered
or powered by an electric motor. The power tool transmitter may share the same power source
with the electric motor or have a dedicated power source. The power tool may be a pistol grip
type torque driver with a trigger for electrically connecting the battery to the electric motor. As
discussed above the control system sending a stop signal to the electric motor or air supply valve
in a pneumatic tool to end torque transmission when the target torque is reached regardless of
whether the trigger is depressed.

otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and "comprising", will be
understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not
the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps.
[0063]      The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived
from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an acknowledgment
or admission or any form of suggestion that that prior publication (or information derived from

which this specification relates.
