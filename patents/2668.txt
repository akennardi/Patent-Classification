                                                                   9905037 1 (GHMatters) P87985 ALI4 23101118

                                              1
                                       Gaming System
            FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5        This invention relates to a gaming system involving one or more gaming
   machines and a plurality of servers connected thereto.
            BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
10        In the gaming industry, it is known to have a number of electronic gaming
   machines each connected to one or more game servers which control or manage
   games played on the gaming machines. It is also known to have additional servers for
   controlling the operation of other non-game functions and features of the system such
   as game promotions, jackpots or the like. In a gaming system where there are a
15 number of servers providing games services to the gaming machines and a number of
   servers providing non-game services to the gaming machines, the system may be
   considered as having multiple game service providers and multiple non-game service
   providers.
20        Referring now to Figure 1, which shows a related art system 100 which includes
   a pair of gaming machines 102 and 104, a game server 106, an event server 108, and
   a data storage means 110. Each of the gaming machines 102 and 104 is connected to
   each of the servers 106 and 108, and the servers are connected to the data storage
   means 110 by means of data network 112 as shown.
25
          The event server 108 is configured to implement a non-game event being an
   action or sequence of actions that is not part of a game implemented by the game
   server 106. Such events are not directly related to the base game, but may have an
   affect on its outcome or operation. Non-game events run on an event server such as
30 108 can include a jackpot, a promotion, or secondary or feature game.
          In the system 100 each gaming machine 102 and 104 includes a single client
   that cooperates with both the game server 106 and the event server 108 to enable
   playing of a game on the respective gaming machine and implementation of the non
35 game feature provided by the event server 108.
          In such a system if the gaming machines 102 and 104 were made to play
                                                                9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18

                                                 2
   different games or one of the gaming machines was not linked to the event server 108,
   then the client systems running on the respective gaming machines 102 and 104 would
   need to be different.
 5        Such a requirement limits the ability of system operators to reconfigure systems
   and adds to the expense and development cost for system designers, who need to
   build different client systems for each possible machine configuration.
           It is an object of the invention to address or ameliorate one or more of the
10 disadvantages of prior art systems and to propose an alternative system. Insofar as the
   invention is intended to propose an alternative to existing systems, it may also yield
   further advantages as will become apparent below.

             Figure 2 depicts a gaming system 50 according to an embodiment of the
   present invention. The system 50 includes a pair of gaming machines 52 and 54, a
   game server 56, an event server 58 and a data storage means 60.
20         As will be appreciated in certain embodiments, there may be a far greater
   number of gaming machines and servers included in a system; but for simplicity in
   illustrating embodiments of the present invention, only two gaming machines and
   servers are depicted.
25         Each gaming machine 52 and 54 includes a game client, designated 52.1 and
   54.1 respectively, as well as an event client designated 52.2 and 54.2, respectively.
   The game clients 52.1 and 54.1 are connected to the game server 56 by respective
   connections 62 while the event clients 52.2 and 54.2 are connected to the event server
   58 by further respective connections 64. The game and event servers 56 and 58 are
30 connected to the data storage 60 by connections 65. The gaming machines 52 and 54
   are identical to each other. Further details of the gaming machines are described in
   relation to Figures 3 and 4.
             In Figure 3, reference numeral 10 generally designates a gaming machine
35 operable in an embodiment of the present invention. The machine 10 includes a
   console 12 having a display means in the form of a video display unit 14 on which a
   game 16 is played in use. The video display unit 14 may be implemented as a cathode
                                                                 9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18

                                                9
   ray screen device, a liquid crystal display, a plasma screen, or the like. The game 16
   may be a spinning reel game as depicted, or any other type of game playable on an
   electronic gaming machine. In this example the game 16 simulates the rotation of a
   number of spinning reels 18, preferably from three to five. A midtrim 20 of the machine
 5 10 houses a keypad 22 containing buttons for enabling a player to make inputs into the
   gaming machine to interact with the game 16 and other non-game features associated
   with the gaming machine. The midtrim 20 also houses a credit input mechanism 24
   including a coin input chute 24.1 and a bill collector 24.2.
10       The machine 10 includes a top box 26 on which artwork 28 is carried. The
   artwork 28 includes paytables, details of bonus awards, etc. A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the console 12 for cash payouts from the machine 10.
          Referring to Figure 4 of the drawings, a control means or control circuit 32 of the
15 gaming machine 10 is illustrated. The control circuit 32 includes at least one processor
   34 which runs at least one game client program 35.3 which interacts with a server of
   the gaming system to implement the game 16. The at least one processor 34 also runs
   at least one event client program 35.4 which interacts with an event server of the
   gaming system to enable a user of the gaming machine to interact with an event.
20
         The processor 34 is associated with a memory device 35 and forms part of a
   controller 36 that drives the screen of the video display unit 14 and that receives input
   signals from sensors, which include sensors 38.1 associated with the keypad 22 and
   touch sensors 38.2 mounted in the screen of the video display unit 14.
25
           The controller 36 also receives input pulses from the mechanism 24 to
   determine whether or not a player has provided sufficient credit to commence playing.
   The mechanism 24 may, instead of the coin input chute 24.1 or the bill collector 24.2,
   or in addition thereto, be a credit card reader (not shown) or any other type of
30 validation device.
         The memory device 35 includes RAM 35.1 for storing game and event data
   generated in the course of the operation of the gaming machine, and at least one client
   program storage portion 35.2 for storing client program code which controls the
35 operation rules and paytables of the game, and the operation of an event accessible to
   the gaming machine 10. In the present example, the client program code includes a
   game client application 35.3 and an event client application 35.4 stored in the client
                                                                  9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18

                                                 10
   program storage portion 35.2. The client program storage portion 35.2 will typically be
   in the form of a ROM, PROM or EPROM, or optionally in some embodiments as a
    RAM.
 5        Finally, the controller 36 drives a payout mechanism 40 which, for example, may
   be a coin hopper for feeding coins to the coin tray 30 to make a payout to a player
   when the player wishes to redeem his or her credit.
          Returning now to Figure 2, the game server 56, event server 58 and data storage
10 means 60 perform similar functions to the equivalent components depicted in Figure 1.
    In the present embodiment however, the game client 52.1 and 54.1 of each gaming
   machine 52 and 54 communicates with the game server 56 via the connections 62, to
   control games played on the respective gaming machines 52 and 54. Similarly, the
   event client 52.2 and 54.2 of each gaming machine 52 and 54 communicates with the
15 event server 58, via the connections 64, to enable the communication of event
   information.
          In one preferred embodiment of the invention the gaming machines 52 and 54
   are each provided with a switching means 66 for switching between the respective
20 game clients 52.1 and 54.1 and event clients 52.2 and 54.2. Thus, each gaming
   machine 52 and 54, by making use of the switching means 66, can alternate between
   two alternate modes of operation. One of these modes is a game mode in which a
   gaming machine 52 or 54 generates a game under control of its game client 52.1 or
   54.1 in cooperation with the game server 56. In this mode the player can interact with
25 the game by pressing the appropriate buttons 22, and by viewing the machine's display
    14. The other mode is an event mode, in which the game is suspended so that event
   information, which is transferred from the event server 58, can be acted upon by the
   gaming machine 52, 54. Where appropriate, actions can be taken by the player to
   participate in or interact with the event. In the event mode the event client 52.2 or 54.2
30 will cause relevant event information to be transferred from the gaming machine 52 or
   54 to the event server 58. In a preferred embodiment, when the gaming machines 52
   and 54 are in an event mode the processing of games by the games clients 52.1 and
   54.1, and communications between the games clients and the game server 56 in
   relation to the playing of games is suspended.
35
          It should be noted that since events are run separately to the games, and the
   events do not directly affect the games being played on the gaming machines 52 or 54,
                                                                  9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18

                                                11
   the timing of the events and the communication event information from the event
   server 58 is largely independent of the timing of the content of any of the games. Thus,
   in certain embodiments it is necessary to determine how conflicts between games and
   events in relation to the timing of demands for gaming machine processing time,
 5 should be handled. Typically the game client will be given priority over an event client,
   however this may not always be the case.
          In the preferred embodiments an event client is typically passive, that is, it is
   typically inactive and awaits the receipt of event information from the event server
10 before becoming active. On the other hand the game client is active and will keep
   running until it is interrupted. In this regard the receipt of an event request from the
   event server by a gaming machine are effectively "suspend" commands to allow
   control on the game clients 52.1 and 52.2 to be suspended and effectively to be
   switched over to the event clients 52.2 and 54.2.      However, if a game is underway,
15 then this "suspending" only occurs, in one preferred embodiment, once the game
   comes to an end. In other words, the nature of the signals transmitted from the event
   clients 52.2 and 54.2 to the game clients 52.1 and 54.1 is such that, if a gaming
   machine 52 or 54 is not ready to be switched to its respective event mode of operation
   because a game is underway, then the game may continue until its end or until a
20 suitable state is reached in which the game may be suspended. In this case, event
   information must be stored until an appropriate time, and at that time, the game clients
   must stop processing game information so that the event clients can assume control of
   the machines for the duration of the event. Such an appropriate time may, for example,
   be at the end of the game. Once this appropriate time has arrived, the event
25 information can be acted upon, first by way of the switching means 66 switching the
   gaming machine 52 or 54 to the event mode, in which case the clients 52.2 or 54.2
   handle the communications between the respective gaming machines and the event
   server.
30        While in the above preferred embodiment the suspending of the players' control
   over the gaming machines occurs at the end of the game, in other embodiments it
   might occur at a different time. The appropriate time to suspend such control - referred
   to as a "checkpoint" - may depend on the jurisdiction in which the relevant gaming
   establishment is located. The checkpoint may also depend on the technological
35 features of the gaming machines 52 and 54, the game server 56 and event server 58.
   In addition, where the technological features permit, the checkpoint may also possibly
   depend on the requirements of the gaming establishment itself.
                                                                   9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18

                                                12
          The "suspend" commands referred to above have the effect of preventing the
   inputs, made by players who are using the controls 24, from having any effect on the
   games played on the gaming machines 52 and 54, to the extent that these games
 5 involve the game clients 52.1 and 54.1 and game server 56.
            In order that the event clients 52.2 and 54.2 will "know" that the game clients
   52.1 and 54.1 are in the locked-up, passive state, appropriate signals are sent from the
   game clients to the event clients. The event clients 52.2 and 54.2 at this stage are in
10 an active state, not only for handling transmissions of event information from the event
   server 18, but also for managing signals from the controls buttons 24 of the machines
   52 and 54.
            It will thus be appreciated that, while the gaming machines 52 and 54 are in
15 their respective event modes, the machines are adapted for the players to interact with
   the machines for the purpose of viewing event information and transferring event
   information from the gaming machines to the event server 58. This interaction involves
   the viewing of information displayed on the machines' displays 22, and possibly also
   the players controlling the operation of the gaming machines 52 and 54. During this
20 time, the event information is being handled by the event clients 52.2 and 54.2 of the
   gaming machines 52 and 54.
           When a gaming machine 52 or 54 is in an event mode of operation, there may
   be certain functions which continue to be handled by the machines' game clients 52.1
25 and 54.1, such as the operation of the coin-and banknote-receiving slot components
   24, respectively, and the coin hopper component 30, as well as the handling of certain
   game-related       information such as statistical and auditing information which is
   communicated to, and from, the game server 56, and so on.
30        When the service provided by the event server 18 is complete, i.e. when all
   actions relating to the event feature have been completed control of the gaming
   machine 52, 54, then the managing of reverts to the game clients 52.1 and 54.1. For
   effecting this change, the event clients 52.2 and 54.2 send signals to the respective
   game clients 52.1 and 54.1 causing the game clients once again to become active and
35 to resume the management of, and receptiveness to, player interactions with the
   gaming machines 52 and 54.
                                                                  9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18

                                                13
           In some embodiments, such as that shown in figure 7, each gaming machine
   may be equipped with more than one event client to enable the machine to handle
   more than one type of event. In certain embodiments the multiple event clients can
   operate concurrently or at different times. In this case, once control of the respective
 5 gaming machine has been handed back to the game clients 52.1 and 54.1, each of the
   event clients will be in a passive state.
             In addition, each gaming machine may, in some embodiments, be provided
   with more than one game client to enable the machine to handle more than one game.
10 Depending on the configuration, these different games may be handled at different
   times from one another, or concurrently. Thus, it would, in such embodiments, be
   necessary to provide the gaming machines with means, similar to the switching means
   66, for switching the machine between the game clients to enable switching between
   the various games handled by the different game clients. Alternatively, where the
15 games are being run simultaneously, means may be provided for co-coordinating the
   input of the player via the controls of the machines (such as the button controls 24) so
   as to achieve a uniform effect among all of the games that are in progress so that
   such Input has a similar effect on all of the games.
20          As will be appreciated, depending on the exact implementation of the system,
   the running of a game can be split between the game client of a gaming machine and a
   game server in different proportions. These range between one embodiment in which
   the split between the game client and game server is such that the game client
   essentially runs the game with only certain information about the game, such as
25 statistical, or auditing, information being communicated to the game server 56, and
   another embodiment in which the game server 56 essentially runs the game with the
   game client only being responsible for controlling the player interface of the game, e.g.
   by generating screen displays and transmitting player input data back to the server.
   Clearly embodiments can also be implemented in which the running of the game may
30 be more evenly split between the gaming machine and the game server 56, with
   certain of the functions of the game being run on the gaming machine 52 or 54 itself,
   and certain other functions on the game server 16. The game server can retrieve
   stored data, which may be required during the course of a game, from the data storage
   means 20.
35
            The operation of the system 50 will now be described in broad terms by way of
   an example. According to this example, both of the gaming machines 52 and 54 are in
                                                                  9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18

                                                 14
   their respective games modes with players playing games on the machines. Event
   information relating to a promotion is then generated in an event server of the system.
   This causes a signal from the event server 58 to be transmitted to the gaming
   machines 52 and 54. This, in turn, causes the respective switching means 66 to switch
 5 the machines from their games modes to their event modes when each of the games is
   completed so that the ability to continue playing games on the gaming machines is
   suspended.
           Once the gaming machines 52 and 54 are in the respective event modes, the
10 event information, transmitted from the event server 58, can be displayed on the
   displays 22 of the gaming machines 52 and 54. Once each player has had an
   opportunity to view or consider the event information, or interact with the event where
   appropriate, the switching means 66 can switch the machines back into their games
   modes to allow the players to continue playing further games.
15
           Depending on the configuration of the system 50 reversion of the gaming
   machines 52, 54 back to game modes may occur after the event clients 52.2 and 54.2
   send signals to their respective game clients 52.1 and 54.1 relating to the completion
   of the event. In a preferred embodiment, this happens after the results of the event
20 have been displayed to the player on the relevant display 22 followed by a suitable
   passage of lime, or followed by the player indicating, by way of operating appropriate
   controls 24 on the gaming machine 52 or 54, that he wishes to continue playing a
   game.
25         The operation of the system 50 is described in more detail, by way of example
   with reference to Figure 5. In this figure, there is shown a flow chart 80 which indicates
   actions performed by the two gaming machines 52 and 54, by the game server 56, and
   by the event server 58. In the example, the playing of games by the players is
   described in terms of the players transmitting game requests (representing the actions
30 of the players when playing the games) and the transmitting of responses by the game
   server 56 (representing responses, by the game server, to the actions of the players).
           The flow chart 80 includes a left column 82 in which a vertical arrow 84
   represents the passage of time. The next column 86 reflects the actions performed by
35 the gaming machine 52 (by its game client 52.1 or event client 52.2), while the column
   88 next to that reflects the actions performed by the gaming machine 54 (by its game
   client 54.1 or event client 54.2). The next column 90 reflects the actions performed by
                                                                   9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18

                                               15
   the game server 56, and the column 92 next to that reflects the actions of the event
   server 58.
           At the start of the time period shown each of the gaming machines 52 and 54,
 5 are in their respective game modes in which the game clients 52.1 and 54.1 are
   configured to communicate with the game server 90 to allow the playing of games on
   those machines.
           In step 94, by the gaming machine 52, as shown in the column 86, transmits a
   game request A to the game server 56. The game request will typically be issued in
10 response to an action of the player, such as insertion of a coin or the pressing of an
   appropriate button on the gaming machine 52. This game request A is received by the
   game server 56 in step 96, as shown in the column 90.
           Similarly, in next step 98 the gaming machine 54, as shown in the column 88,
15 transmits a game request B to the game server 56. This game request B is received by
   the game server 56 in step 100, as shown in the column 90.
         The game server 56, in step 102, then transmits a game response A to gaming
   machine 52. It then transmits, in step 104, a game response B to gaming machine 54.
20
         The game response A transmitted by the game server 56 in step 102 is received
   by the gaming machine 52 in step 106. Thereafter, this gaming machine, in step 108,
   displays the game response A on the display of the gaming machine for the
   information of the player using that machine marking the end of the game that has
25 been underway on gaming machine 52. Similarly, the game response B transmitted by
   the game server 56 in step 104 is received by the gaming machine 54 in step 110.
   Thereafter, that gaming machine 54, in step 112, displays game response B on the
   display of that gaming machine for the information of the player using that machine.
   This marks the end of the game that has been underway on the gaming machine 54.
30
         In the meantime, the event server 58 has generated an event E in step 114 as
   shown in the column 92. In the present example, the generation of event E has
   occurred around the same time that step 108 was performed by the gaming machine
   52, and prior to the performance of step 112 by the gaming machine 54. In the present
35 example, the nature of the event E generated by the event server 58 is such that it will
   require a response by the players of the gaming machines 52, 54. An example of such
   an event is a promotional competition to which the players must respond in order to be
                                                                9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18

                                              16
   eligible to win the competition.
            The event E is then transmitted by the event server 58, in step 116 to the
   gaming machines 52 and 54.
 5
            At about the same time that the event server 58 transmits event E to the
   gaming machine 52, 54, gaming machine 52, in step 118, transmits another game
   request, namely game request C, to the game server 56, to initiate a new game.
10        The game server 56 receives game request C from the gaming machine 52 in
   step 120. Following this both of the gaming machines 52 and 54, in steps 122 and 124
   respectively, receive the event request E that was transmitted by the event server 58 in
   step 116.
          Next the game server 56, instep 126 transmits a game response C to the gaming
15 machine 52 in response to the game request C.
          As there is no game under way on gaming machine 54 (as the game that was
   being played had already ended as mentioned above) this gaming machine is free to
   immediately initiate, in step 127, the display of the event E for the information of
20 the player on that machine. This involves the event client 54.2 assuming control of the
   gaming machine 54 transferred to it by the switching means 66.
            When the event E is displayed, the player on the gaming machine 54 can
   provide the appropriate or desired response by operating the relevant controls on that
25 machine. This, in turn, causes a response to be transmitted, in step 128, from the
   gaming machine 54 to the event server 58, indicating that the player is ready to
   participate in event E. This is referred to, for convenience, as a "ready for event"
   transmission.
30          In the meantime the game being played on the gaming machine 52 remains
   underway, and this machine is therefore not in a state to initiate the display of the
   event E immediately when the event request E is received in step 122. Rather, the next
   step performed by the gaming machine 52 is step 130, which involves receiving the
   game response C transmitted from the game server 56 in step 120. This is then
35 followed by step 132 in which the game response C is displayed on the display 22 of
   gaming machine 52.
                                                                 9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18

                                                 17
          According to the present example, step 132 marks the end of the game that was
   being played on the gaming machine 52. Gaming machine is then in a state in which it
   can initiate the display of the event E. It does this in step 134. To enable this, the
   relevant event client 52.2 has control of the machine 52 switched to it by the switching
 5 means 66.
          When the event E is displayed, the player on the gaming machine 52 can
   provide the appropriate or desired response to that event by operating the relevant
   controls, on that machine. This, in turn, causes a "ready for event" response to be
10 transmitted, in step 136, from the gaming machine 52 to the event server 58, indicating
   that the player is ready to participate in the event E.
          The "ready for event" transmission made from the gaming machine 54 in step
   128, is received by the event server 58 in step 138, while that from the gaming
15 machine 52 is received by the event server in step 140. Once both "ready for event"
   transmissions are received from the gaming machines 52 and 54, the event server 58
   can operate and interact with the event clients 52.2, 54.2 of respective gaming
   machines 52, 54 to allow for the participation of the players in the event E.
20        In particular, if the system is configured for the event to be run on all of the
   machines simultaneously, then as soon as the machines are all ready (with no games
   being run), the running of the event may proceed.
          It is to be understood that as the steps occur in the flowchart 80, the initial
25 communication from the event server 58 to the gaming machines 52 and 54 occurs
   while they are in their game modes. However, once the respective games have ended,
   as represented by step 112 for the gaming machine 54 and -step 132 for the gaming
   machine 52, the switching means 66 of the gaming machines switch their respective
   machines into an event mode so that the further communications in this                    mode are
30 between the event clients 52.2 and 54.2 of the gaming machines and the event server
   58.
          In the present example the switching of a gaming machine from the game mode
   to its event mode can only occur after the game has terminated. However in other
35 embodiments alternative "check points" may be used.
            In a particular embodiment the system can include a number of gaming
                                                                   9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18

                                                18
   machines in addition to the gaming machines 52 and 54 which are configured to
   enable players to play in a co-operative arrangement in relation to events that are
   generated. In particular, the system is configured for an event to be triggered by a
   certain game-play event on any one of the cooperating gaming machines. It is also
 5 configured, in the event of an award winning condition being met, to make one type of
   award to the player of the machine which triggered the event, and another type of
   award to the other cooperating gaming machines. Prior to such an event being
   generated, the game clients of the various gaming machines interact with the game
   server 56. At this stage the event server 58 is monitoring the gaming machines for the
10 particular occurrence which triggers the generation of the event. When such an
   occurrence occurs at one of the machines, the event server 58 sends a signal to the
   event client of each of the gaming machines in a similar manner to that described
   above.
15        Assuming that this event involves the automatic issuing of an award, as soon as
   the game client of all of the machines are suspended and their event clients activated
   the event client of the machine that triggered the event is instructed by the event server
   58 (by way of appropriate signals being sent) to display, on that machine's display 22,
   the award designated for that machine. Similarly, the event clients of the other
20 cooperating gaming machines are similarly instructed to display their respective award
   to its player.
           In the embodiments above, the clients of the gaming machines 52 and 54 are
   constituted by the game clients 52.1 and 54.1 and the event clients 52.2 and 54.2,
25 where the game clients and event clients are configured for handling, respectively,
   games being played on the gaming machines and events transmitted from the event
   server 58. However, in another embodiment of the invention as reflected in Figure 6,
   each gaming machine 52 and 54 has a game client 52.1 and 54.1 and one or more
   additional, component clients 52.3 and 54.3 which are constituted by peripheral
30 components of the gaming machine, such as the display 14, the buttons 22, the coin
   receipt slot component 24.1, the banknote receipt slot component 24.2, or the prize
   award coin hopper component 40.
             In the system 150 of this embodiment, features corresponding to features in the
35 system 50 described above are designated with corresponding reference numerals.
   Accordingly, the system 150 includes a game server 56 and an event server 58. In
   addition the system 150 includes a component server 152 for each type of component
                                                                   9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18

                                                19
   client 52.3 or 54.3. The component clients 52.3 and 54.3 are connected to the
   component server 152 by connections 153.
          Thus, for example, while a game is underway on a gaming machine 52 or 54
 5 under control of the respective game client 52.1, 54.1, assuming that the component
   clients 52.3 and 54.3 in this example are the coin-and banknote-receipt slot
   components 24.1 and 24.2, information about the operation of these peripheral
   components, such as the number of coins or banknotes to be inserted into the gaming
   machine during a particular period, or the monetary denominations used, can be
10 communicated to the relevant component server 152. This may allow, for instance,
   suitable statistical or auditing calculations to be carried out which may be of-use" to
   the gaming establishment.
           These component clients 52.3 and 54.3 are clients in their own right, and their
15 operation may therefore be independent of the operation of the game clients 52.1 and
   54.1 on the gaming machines 52 and 54. In certain embodiments they may also run as
   stand alone processes. As a result, the transfer of communications from these
   component clients to the component server 152 can occur while a game (or event) is
   underway, without the software for running that game (or event) having to be
20 specifically adapted to permit such communication with the component clients 52.3 and
   54.3.
           Although this embodiment is described with reference to the component clients
   52.3 and 54.3 being constituted by the coin and banknote-receipt slot components 26
25 and 28, it will be appreciated that anyone or more of the peripheral components of the
   gaming machines 52 and 54 may be implemented as independent client processes.
   Furthermore, there may be one or more separate component servers 152 for each type
   of component client of the gaming machines 52 and 54, or one type of component
   server might be configured to serve more than one type of component client as in the
30 present embodiment where the server 152 represented in Figure 6 serves both the
   coin-receipt slot components 24.1 and the banknote-receipt slot components 24.2.
           In addition, this embodiment may also involve a separate event client 52.2 and
   54.2 for each gaming machine 52 and 54 as described above in relation to Figures 3
35 and 4, or may be similar to the prior art system 10 described above to the extent that
   the machines do not have separate event clients.
                                                                   9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18

                                                20
              Figure 7 depicts another embodiment of the present invention. The operation of
   the system of figure 7 is essentially the same as that of previous embodiments, and no
   detailed description of this embodiment will be necessary.
 5            In figure 7 the system 700 includes two gaming machines 752 and 754 and a
   game server 756, an event server 758 and a database 60. Connections between these
   components are similar to those of Figures 2 and 6 and are labelled accordingly.
           In this example gaming machine 752 includes two game clients 752.1 and 752.2
10 and an event 752.3. Gaming machine 754 includes a game client 754.1 and two event
   clients 754.2 and 754.3. The game server 756 is connected to the game clients 752.1,
   752.2 and 754.1 of the gaming machines 752 and 754, and the event server 758 is
   connected to the event clients 752.3 and 754.2, 754.3 of the gaming machines 752
   and 754.
15
              In this example the gaming machine 752 is configured to allow a player to play
   two different types of games each corresponding to one of the game clients residing
   thereon, whereas the gaming machine 754 can play only one type of game, by virtue of
   it only possessing a single game client. Conversely a player of gaming machine 752
20 can only take part in the event corresponding to event client 752.3, whereas gaming
   machine can take part on two types of events corresponding to event clients 754.2 and
   754.3. The gaming machines also include a respective switching components 66, of
   the type described above, that controls which client application is controlling the
   gaming machine at any point in time.
25
           It should be noted that in the present embodiment the game server 756 is the
   server for all games playable on the gaming machines 752 and 754. However it is
   possible for each different type of game to be controlled by a separate server. Similarly
   with events, one or more event clients can be used if multiple events are to be run on a
30 gaming system, possibly with each type of event being given a dedicated event server.
             Although this invention is described above in relation to specific embodiments,
   it is to be understood that is not limited in that regard, but may be embodied in many
   other forms. For example, the embodiments described in relation to Figures 4 and 5
35 are adapted such that the relevant gaming machine is only switched from its game
   mode into its event mode once the game that was being played has come to an end.
   However, in another embodiment, the system 50 may be adapted for the relevant
                                                                   9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18

                                               21
   gaming machine to switch from the games mode to the event mode immediately or
   very soon once signals relating to the generation of the event are received by the
   respective event clients 52.2 and 54.2. In this event, where a game is underway, the
   current phase or state of the game must be stored to enable the game to continue from
 5 the same place once the gaming machine switches back to the games mode. If any
   responses are awaited by the gaming machine 52 or 54 from the games server 56,
   then the gaming machine will not switch to the events mode until the response has
   been received. It will then store information relating to the current phase or state of the
   game before switching control to the event clients 52.2 and 54.2 and event server 58.
10 This embodiment is particularly relevant in a case where the games played on the
   gaming machines 52 and 54 involving the game clients 52.1 and 54.1 are played in
   discreet stages. In this case, the system 50 may be adapted for each gaming machine
   only to switch into the event mode when a particular game stage (as opposed to the
   whole game) is completed.
                                                                   9905037_1 (GHMatters) P87985.AU.4 23101/18
