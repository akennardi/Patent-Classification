                                      Abstract of the Disclosure
               A compact head body hammer that requires less clearance to operate as compared
  to conventional hammers. The hammer does not include a secondary tool located on the rear
  of the hammer, for example, a pry or a wedge. In omitting these secondary tools, the
5 hammer provides more clearance and allows greater pull back prior to the user striking an
  object. Further, the hammer head can weigh substantially the same as a conventional
  hammer head, for example, seven ounces, so that the striking power of the hammer is not
  compromised by the compact nature of the hammer. The centerline of the hammer head
  base can be offset with respect to a centerline of the hammer handle, which also provides
0 less mass at the rear portion of the hammer head and allows greater pull back prior to
  striking the object.

                                       Technical Field of the Invention
                The present invention relates generally to hammers. More particularly, the present
   invention relates to a compact head body hammer adaptable for usage in low clearance
 5 areas.
                                         Background of the Invention
                Hammers are commonly used in automotive and other applications to tap or strike
   metal or other objects. Hammers include a head coupled to a handle, which the user grips
   when striking another object in a swinging motion. Typically, a user will remove the hammer
 0 from the object being struck, perhaps by pulling the hammer back, and strike the object from
   the pulled-back position.
                Many hammer applications require use of the hammer in low clearance areas, for
   example, underneath body panels or fender of a vehicle. Under these circumstances, it is
   difficult for the user to obtain the necessary clearance to pull the hammer back and strike the
 5 desired object with sufficient force. For example, a conventional hammer includes a pry or
   wedge that removes work pieces or otherwise grips objects on an end opposing the striking
   end. This pry or wedge is located on a rear side of the hammer head, extending the length of
   the hammer head beyond what is required for simple striking of the object or work piece. By
   extending the hammer head length, the hammer head requires additional clearance that can
20 be difficult to obtain in low clearance areas.
                                           Summary of the Invention
                An embodiment of the present invention broadly comprises a compact head body
   hammer that requires less clearance than conventional hammers. The hammer of one
   embodiment of the present invention omits any protrusions or additional tools located on the
25 rear side of the hammer head, for example, a pry or wedge, while maintaining substantially
   the same weight as a conventional hammer, for example, seven ounces. In addition, the

                                                         2
   centerline of the hammer head body can be axially offset relative to the centerline of the
   hammer handle, providing less mass on the rear portion of the hammer head and allowing
   greater pull back prior to striking the object for more effective force.
                Another embodiment of the present invention broadly includes a tool including a head
 5 having a base and a face extending from the base. The face is adapted to strike an object
   when the tool is used, and the head has a head centerline extending through a center portion
   of the base. The tool further includes a handle having a handle centerline extending through
   a central axis of the handle, wherein the head centerline and the handle centerline are offset
   relative to each other.
 0              Yet another embodiment of the present invention includes a tool including a head with
   a base and a face extending from the base. The face is adapted to strike an object when the
   tool is used, and the head has a rear opposite the face that is devoid of a secondary tool.
   The tool further includes a handle coupled to the head at the base.

25                                  Detailed Description of the Embodiments
                While the present invention is susceptible of embodiments in many different forms,
   there is shown in the drawings, and will herein be described in detail, embodiments of the
   9644338_1 (GHMatters) P107226.AU

                                                        3
   invention, including a preferred embodiment, with the understanding that the present
   disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is
   not intended to limit the broad aspect of the invention to embodiments illustrated.
                An embodiment of the present invention broadly comprises a hammer that requires
 5 less swing or arc clearance, compared to a conventional hammer, by omitting additional
   secondary tools disposed on a rear side of the hammer head, while maintaining substantially
   the same weight as a conventional hammer, for example, seven ounces. The hammer head
   and handle can include offset centerlines so that the hammer head includes less mass on
   the rear portion, allowing greater pull back prior to striking an object.
 0              Referring to FIG. 1, the tool 100 can include a handle 105 having a grip 110 on the
   lower end of the handle 105 and a neck 115 extending from the grip 110 to a tapered region
   120 on the upper end of the handle 105. The tool 100 can also include a head 125, for
   example a hammer head, coupled to the handle 105 at the upper end of the handle 105. The
   head 125 can include a rear portion 130 opposite a face 135, where the face 135 is adapted
 5 to strike an object when the tool 100 is used and swung by a user.
                The grip 110 can be any structure that allows a better grip of the tool 100. For
   example, the grip 110 can be knurled or otherwise textured, or can include a separate
   structure, for example, a rubberized tube that fits over the handle 105. Any other manner of
   improving the grip of a user at the grip 110 can be implemented without departing from the
20 spirit and scope of the present application. Further, the tool 100 need not include any
   structure at the grip 110 that would improve the grip of a user, and can instead the grip 110
   can be the same structure and/or texture as the remainder of the handle 105.
                The tapered region 120 can be tapered, for example, can be thinner at a portion near
   the neck and can be thicker at a portion near the head 125. The tapered region 120 can
25 include a smaller portion of the head 125 extending beyond the rearmost portion of the
   handle 105, if any portion at all. For example, the tapered region 120 is tapered such that,
   when connected, the rear 130 of the head 125 extends just past the rearmost portion of the
   9644338_1 (GHMatters) P107226.AU

                                                     4
   handle 105, if at all. By providing a structure where the rear 130 extends more forward, less
   head 125 mass is disposed rear of the handle 105 so as to require greater clearance during
   the pullback process of using the tool 100.
                The head 125 can include a base 140 forming the structural backbone of the head
 5 125. The base 145 can couple with the face 135 through a transition region 145. For
   example, the base 145 can have a width smaller than the width of the face 135, and the
   transition region 145 can curve or otherwise extend from the base 145 toward the extreme
   ends of the face 135 to connect the face 135 and the base 145. In some embodiments, the
   base 145 is centered with respect to the face 135 so as to evenly distribute the weight of the
 0 base 145.
                The rear 130 of the head 125 can be a flat, rounded, or angled structure. The rear
   130 can lack any secondary tools, such as the pries or wedges found in conventional tools,
   so as to avoid extraneous matter at the rear 130 of the tool 100 that would require additional
   clearance during use. For example, during use of the tool 100, a user could pull the tool 100
 5 farther back (as compared to conventional hammers or tools) because the tool 100 lacks the
   secondary tools (such as pries or wedges) located at the rear 130 of the tool 100. Despite
   lacking the secondary tools, the tool 100 can still weigh substantially the same as a
   conventional hammer head, for example, seven ounces, so that the striking power of the tool
   100 is not limited despite the secondary tools of the head 125 being omitted. To be clear, the
20 use of a seven ounce head is conventional, but the use of a seven ounce head that lacks
   secondary tools such as pries and wedges, is not, and was invented by the inventors of the
   present application.
                The handle 105 can have a handle centerline 150 and the head 125 can have a head
   centerline 155. The handle centerline 150 can represent the center of the handle 105 and
25 can extend along a central axis of the handle 105, and the head centerline 155 can extend
   through a center of the base 140 of the head 125. As shown, the handle centerline 150 and
   the base centerline 155 can be axially offset relative to each other. In so doing, the rear 130
   9644338_1 (GHMatters) P107226.AU

                                                        5
   of the head 125 can be positioned more forward than it would be without the offset nature of
   the centerlines. Arranging the head 125 and the handle 105 in this manner requires even
   less clearance to perform the striking operation with the tool 100, as it moves the head 125
   more forward on the handle 105, and an even smaller portion of the head 125 extends
 5 beyond the rear edge of the handle 105.
                Referring to FIGs 2 and 3, the head 125 includes an opening 160 for receiving an end
   of the handle 105, for example, the end extending from the tapered region 120. The handle
   105 can be coupled to the head 125 at the opening 160, or in any other area of the head
   125, in any manner. For example, the handle 105 can be coupled to the head 125 by
 0 adhesive, fasteners, interference fit, or the handle 105 can be integrally formed with the head
   125.
                The surface of the face 135 can be flat or semi-flat, for example, rounded. Also, the
   face 135 can be disk-shaped or otherwise round. However, in some embodiments, the face
   135 can be rectangular, square-shaped, triangular-shaped, or oval-shaped. Any other shape
 5 of face 135 can be implemented without departing from the spirit and scope of the present
   application.
                As used herein, the term "coupled" and its functional equivalents are not intended to
   necessarily be limited to a direct, mechanical coupling of two or more components. Instead,
   the term "coupled" and its functional equivalents are intended to mean any direct or indirect
20 mechanical, electrical, or chemical connection between two or more objects, features, work
   pieces, and/or environmental matter. "Coupled" is also intended to mean, in some examples,
   one object being integral with another object.
                The matter set forth in the foregoing description and accompanying drawings is
   offered by way of illustration only and not as a limitation. While particular embodiments have
25 been shown and/or described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that changes and
   modifications may be made without departing from the broader aspects of the invention. The
