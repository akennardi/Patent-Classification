                              MEDICATED FEED SUPPLEMENT
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]       This invention generally relates to a medicated feed supplement for animals. In
particular, the invention concerns a medicated feed supplement for animals containing a pain
relieving agent.
BACKGROUND ART
[0002]       The issue of improving welfare during aversive routine husbandry procedures has
emerged as a leading welfare concern for all livestock industries in Australia and beyond.
Growing consumer awareness of painful procedures and practices poses a significant threat to
the red meat, dairy and wool industries. Providing adequate and long-lasting pain relief will
deal with many of these concerns. However, until recently, there were no products registered
for use by producers to ameliorate pain in the animals.
[0003]       The registration of Tri-Solfen@ spray for use in both sheep and cattle husbandry
procedures has enabled producers to provide significant topical pain relief to wounds incurred
during some procedures due to inhibition of nociception, including surgical castration (Lomax
et al 2010; Lomax and Windsor, 2013), mulesing (Lomax et al, 2008) and dehorning
(McCarthy et al, 2015; 2016). Further, the registration of Buccalgesic@ for oral administration
of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam, potentially provides additional pain
relief for livestock undergoing aversive husbandry procedures, through diminution of pain
sensitisation.  Managing     pain associated   with husbandry       interventions  is increasingly
commonplace in extensive sheep meat and beef production systems, although there remain
unresolved issues preventing the promotion of 'best practice pain management' approaches. In
particular, the timing of and route of administration, plus evidence of efficacy in provision of
practical long-term pain relief on farms, deserves further attention if use of this drug is to be
routinely adopted by producers.
[0004]       The present invention builds on the success of previous projects investigating pain
relief in livestock. Tri-Solfen@ (as described in Australian Patent Number 2007221941 - A
topical anaesthetic composition, filed 2007-10-11; and Australian Patent Number 2006202528
A topical analgesic composition, filed 2006-03-15) has been shown to be efficacious in the
short term, providing topical anaesthetics pain relief for at least 24 hours, but does not address

                                                 2
the inflammation resulting from surgical procedures (Lomax et al, 2008; Windsor et al, 2016).
This is particularly important in procedures that cause severe lesions, such as mulesing (Lomax
et al, 2008) and dehoming (McCarthy et al, 2016). Whilst Buccalgesic@                    addresses
inflammation, a single dose administered during a procedure, also does not provide the longer
term pain relief required.
[0005]       Animal feed is not normally used to deliver pain relieving agents such that animals
can self-regulate consumption to control pain. Pain relief - if administered at all - normally
entails having to muster and handle the animals, and normally entails injecting the animals with
a pain-relieving    agent.   Mustering, handling    and injecting   animals   can be laborious,
inconvenient and expensive.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0006]       In one aspect, the present inventor has now developed a medicated feed supplement
that can be used to deliver at least one type of pain relieving agent to an animal in a controlled
manner.
[0007]       According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a medicated
feed supplement for an animal comprising feed and at least one type of pain relieving agent.
[0008]       According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a pain
relieving method for an animal, said method comprising the step of feeding an animal a
medicated feed supplement comprising feed and an effective amount of at least one type of pain
relieving agent.
[0009]       According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of
manufacturing a medicated feed supplement for an animal, said method comprising the step of:
[0010]       Combining feed with at least one type of pain relieving agent to form a medicated
feed supplement.
[0011]       The medicated feed supplement can be of any suitable form such as a liquid, semi
solid or solid - e.g. solution, suspension, gelatinous, powder, granule, compressed pellet/s,
loose feed, extruded feed, grain mix, block, lick block or concentrate. Likewise the feed can be,
for example, a solution, suspension, gelatinous, powder, granule, compressed pellet/s, loose
feed, extruded feed, grain mix, block, lick block or concentrate.

                                                    3
[0012]       The medicated feed supplement's ingredient content/feed content can be tailored for
the particular animal type for which it is provided, or even for the geographic location of the
animal. For example, grain versus grass fed animals many require different ingredient contents,
such as different mineral content. The medicated feed supplement can also be tailored for the
palate of the animal (e.g. molasses and salt content).
[0013]       The at least one pain relieving agent can be used to prevent, minimise or obviate
any suitable type of pain experienced by the animal. For example, pain may result from an
injury or pain may be caused by a surgical procedure - such as a laceration, a surgical incision,
an ulcer, a major abrasion or a major bum. For example, pain may be caused by an animal
husbandry procedure such as mulesing, shearing, castration, tail docking, ear tagging, de
homing, branding or marking.
[0014]       Any suitable type or types and quantity or quantities of pain relieving agent can be
used. For example, the pain relieving agent content can be in any amount up to about 2%
weight/weight (eg. 0.01 to 2% and all 0.01 increments there between up to 2%). For example,
the pain relieving agent content can be about 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5,
0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1%, 1.5% or 2% weight/weight.
[0015]       In some embodiments, the pain relieving agent could comprise between about 0.5
kg per ton up to about 20 kg per ton of total medicated feed supplement formula.
[0016]       In some embodiments, the pain relieving agent can be an analgesic agent or
combination of different types of analgesic agents. For example, the pain relieving agent can be
any suitable type of anti-inflammatory agent or combination of different types of anti
inflammatory agents. In some embodiments the pain relieving agent can be at least one
analgesic agent in combination with at least one anti-inflammatory agent.

extruded feeds.
[0040]       In some embodiments the medicated feed supplement or feed can comprise grain
mixes (e.g. oats, wheat, com, dried brewers grain, cottonseed, rice hulls).
[0041]       In some embodiments the medicated feed supplement or feed can comprise any type
of loose feed.
[0042]       In some embodiments the medicated feed supplement can be in the form of a
concentrate. The concentrate can be rich in proteins and carbohydrates, e.g. grain crops.
[0043]       Preferably the medicated feed supplement is not in the form of a molasses block.
However, the medicated feed supplement can be in the form of a different type of lick block.
[0044]       Preferably the pain relieving agent is substantially uniformly dispersed throughout
the medicated feed supplement.

                                                8
[0045]       The medicated feed supplement can be fed to any suitable type of animal. Suitable
animals include livestock. Suitable animals include sheep, cattle, horses, buffalo, goats and yak.
[0046]       Preferably, the method comprises the animal self-medicating. That is, the animal
consumes as much of the medicated feed supplement as it desires, as often as it desires.
[0047]       Preferably, the medicated feed supplement provides a dose to the animal in the
order of about 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 and
100mg/animal/day (depending on the size of the animal).
[0048]       Preferably, animals consume approximately 100 to 400 g of medicated feed
supplement per day. For example, rams may consume approximately 200 g per day. For
example, ewes may consume approximately 300 g per day. For example, lambs may consume
approximately 150 g per day. For example, cattle may consume approximately 200 g per day.
[0049]       The medicated feed supplement may be fed to the animal for a period of 1 day, 2
days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days or 7 days or more. The medicated feed supplement may be
fed to the animal for a period 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 or 4 weeks. More preferably, the
medicated feed supplement is fed to the animal for a period of 1 to 3 weeks, and even more
preferably 1 to 2 weeks.
[0050]       The method may comprise a step of feeding to the animal a first medicated feed
supplement containing a first type of pain relieving agent for a first period of time, then a
second medicated feed supplement containing a second type of pain relieving agent for a
second period of time. The first and second periods of time could, for example, each be 1 to 2
week periods. If required, the method may comprise a step of feeding to the animal a third (or
fourth) medicated feed supplement containing a third (or fourth) type of pain relieving agent for
a third (or fourth) period of time.
[0051]       Animals would help themselves ad lib to such a medicated feed supplement to
relieve symptoms of post surgery or injury. Horses, for instance, could be fed such a
supplement for several weeks to alleviate wound healing stress or surgery.
[0052]       Sheep, cattle, lambs and calves could be fed this medicated feed supplement after
routine surgeries for a period of time to relieve pain and improve healing via reduced
inflammation and well known properties of NSAIDs or other analgesics.

                                                9
[0053]      Animals are able to self medicate to relieve symptoms of pain associated with
common complaints such as bloat in cattle, with bloat symptoms disappearing almost
immediately after sufficient ingestion.
[0054]      PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
[0055]      Particularly preferred embodiments of medicated feed supplements are described
below.
[0056]      EXAMPLE 1 - Preparation of medicated feed supplements
[0057]      This example describes the manufacture of medicated feed supplements, each
containing a pain relieving agent.
[0058]      In one example, the following ingredients (weight/weight) were added, in turn, to a
2 tonne ribbon mixer:
[0059]      Salt 10 %
[0060]      Cottonseed meal 50 %
[0061]      Vegetable oil 10 %
[0062]      Cracked lupins 20%

[0066]      The ingredients were mixed for 10 minutes, until homogenously blended.
[0067]      The medicated feed supplement mixture was then packed into 20 kg bags.
[0068]      In a similar manner or using conventional techniques (eg. Matz, S. A. (1991); Riaz,
M. N., Aldrich, G. (2007); Turret RAI (1999); and Church, D. C. (1984) - the entire contents of
which are hereby incorporated by way of cross-reference), a suitable quantity of a pain
relieving agent (such as an NSAID, e.g. carprofen or meloxicam) was combined with relevant
feed ingredients to produce the following types of medicated feed supplements:

                                                10
[0069]      A. Compressed pellets containing the pain relieving agent (up to about 2%
weight/weight).
[0070]      B. Extruded     feed containing    the pain relieving      agent (up to  about 2%
weight/weight).
[0071]      C. Grain mix containing the pain relieving agent (up to about 2% weight/weight).
[0072]      D. Loose feed containing the pain relieving agent (up to about 2% weight/weight).
[0073]      EXAMPLE 2 - Use of medicated feed supplements for pain relief
[0074]      The medicated feed supplements as described in Example 1 can be left in the
presence of animals, such that they can self-regulate consumption to control pain. The
consumption rate of the pain relieving agent can be monitored, and the level of pain in any
given animal can be measured.
[0075]      Horses, for instance, could be fed such a supplement for several weeks to alleviate
wound healing stress or surgery.
[0076]      Sheep, cattle, lambs and calves could be fed this medicated feed supplement after
routine surgeries for a period of time to relieve pain and improve healing via reduced
inflammation and known properties of NSAIDs or other analgesics.
[0077]      Cattle could be fed this medicated feed supplement to combat bloating, with bloat
symptoms disappearing almost immediately after sufficient ingestion.
[0078]      It is to be appreciated that the medicated feed supplements could be used to treat
other types of animals, and that the medicated feed supplements could have used a different
type of pain relieving agent, as described elsewhere in this specification.
[0079]      Some of the advantages of the medicated feed supplement as described in the
Examples are stated below:
[0080]      1. The pain relieving agent (and other biological actives) can be substantially
uniformly dispersed throughout the medicated feed supplement.
[0081]      2. The medicated feed supplement releases the pain relieving agent in a uniform and
controlled manner.

                                                  11
[0082]       3. The medicated feed supplement enables controlled consumption - low daily dose
of pain relieving agent, thereby minimising the risk of overdosing.
[0083]       4. Animals can self regulate consumption to control pain and at the same time
intake essential nutrients to increase productivity.
[0084]       5. The feed saves farmers having to muster and handle animals, as well as
delivering pain relieving injectables.
[0085]       Any of the features described herein can be combined in any combination with any
one or more of the other features described herein within the scope of the invention.
[0086]       The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as
an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of the common
general knowledge.
[0087]       In the present specification and claims (if any), the word 'comprising' and its
derivatives including 'comprises' and 'comprise' include each of the stated integers but does
not exclude the inclusion of one or more further integers.
[0088]       Reference throughout this specification to 'one embodiment' or 'an embodiment'
means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the
embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the
appearance of the phrases 'in one embodiment' or 'in an embodiment' in various places
throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.
Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any
suitable manner in one or more combinations.
[0089]       In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more
or less specific to structural or methodical features. It is to be understood that the invention is
not limited to specific features shown or described since the means herein described comprises
preferred forms of putting the invention into effect. The invention is, therefore, claimed in any
of its forms or modifications within the proper scope of the appended claims (if any)
appropriately interpreted by those skilled in the art.
