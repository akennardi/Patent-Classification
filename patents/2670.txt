                                            ABSTRACT
        An irrigation nozzle with a rotating deflector is provided whose rotational speed may be
controlled by a friction brake. The nozzle may also include an arc adjustment valve having two
portions that helically engage each other to define an opening that may be adjusted at the top of
the sprinkler to a desired arcuate length. The arcuate length may be adjusted by pressing down
and rotating a deflector to directly actuate the valve. The nozzle may also include a radius
reduction valve that may be adjusted by actuation of an outer wall of the nozzle. Rotation of the
outer wall causes a flow control member to move axially to or away from an inlet.

                                                 FIELD
 [0001]       This invention relates to irrigation sprinklers and, more particularly, to an irrigation
 nozzle with a rotating deflector.
                                            BACKGROUND
 [0002]       Nozzles are commonly used for the irrigation of landscape and vegetation.           In a
typical irrigation system, various types of nozzles are used to distribute water over a desired
area, including rotating stream type and fixed spray pattern type nozzles. One type of irrigation
 nozzle is the rotating deflector or so-called micro-stream type having a rotatable vaned deflector
for producing a plurality of relatively small water streams swept over a surrounding terrain area
to irrigate adjacent vegetation.
 [0003]       Rotating stream nozzles of the type having a rotatable vaned deflector for producing
a plurality of relatively small outwardly projected water streams are known in the art. In such
 nozzles, one or more jets of water are generally directed upwardly against a rotatable deflector
 having a vaned lower surface defining an array of relatively small flow channels extending
 upwardly and turning radially outwardly with a spiral component of direction. The water jet or
jets impinge upon this underside surface of the deflector to fill these curved channels and to
 rotatably drive the deflector. At the same time, the water is guided by the curved channels for
 projection outwardly from the nozzle in the form of a plurality of relatively small water streams to
 irrigate a surrounding area. As the deflector is rotatably driven by the impinging water, the water
streams are swept over the surrounding terrain area, with the range of throw depending on the
 radius reduction of water through the nozzle, among other things.
 [0004]       In rotating stream nozzles and in other nozzles, it is desirable to control the arcuate
area through which the nozzle distributes water. In this regard, it is desirable to use a nozzle
that distributes water through a variable pattern, such as a full circle, half-circle, or some other
arc portion of a circle, at the discretion of the user. Traditional variable arc nozzles suffer from
 limitations with respect to setting the water distribution arc. Some have used interchangeable
 pattern inserts to select from a limited number of water distribution arcs, such as quarter-circle or
 half-circle. Others have used punch-outs to select a fixed water distribution arc, but once a
distribution arc was set by removing some of the punch-outs, the arc could not later be reduced.
 Many conventional nozzles have a fixed, dedicated construction that permits only a discrete

                                                  -2
number of arc patterns and prevents them from being adjusted to any arc pattern desired by the
user.
[0005]        Other conventional nozzle types allow a variable arc of coverage but only for a very
limited arcuate range. Because of the limited adjustability of the water distribution arc, use of
such conventional nozzles may result in overwatering or underwatering of surrounding terrain.
This is especially true where multiple nozzles are used in a predetermined pattern to provide
irrigation coverage over extended terrain.      In such instances, given the limited flexibility in the
types of water distribution arcs available, the use of multiple conventional nozzles often results in
an overlap in the water distribution arcs or in insufficient coverage. Thus, certain portions of the
terrain are overwatered, while other portions are not watered at all. Accordingly, there is a need
for a variable arc nozzle that allows a user to set the water distribution arc along a substantial
continuum of arcuate coverage, rather than several models that provide a limited arcuate range
of coverage.

                        DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
[0023]        FIGS. 1 and 2 show a preferred embodiment of the nozzle 100. The nozzle 100
possesses an arc adjustability capability that allows a user to generally set the arc of water
distribution to virtually any desired angle. The arc adjustment feature does not require a hand
tool to access a slot at the top of the nozzle 100 to rotate a shaft. Instead, the user may depress
part or all of the deflector 102 and rotate the deflector 102 to directly set an arc adjustment valve
104. The nozzle 100 also preferably includes a flow rate adjustment feature (or radius reduction
feature), which is shown in FIG. 2, to regulate flow rate and throw radius. The radius reduction
feature is accessible by rotating an outer wall portion of the nozzle 100, as described further
below.
[0024]        The arc adjustment and radius reduction features of the nozzle 100 are similar to
those described in U.S. Patent No. 8,925,837 and U.S. Patent No. 9,079,202, which are
assigned to the assignee of the present application and which patents are incorporated herein
by reference in their entirety. Further, some of the structural components of the nozzle 100 are
preferably similar to those described in U.S. Patent No. 8,925,837 and U.S. Patent No.
9,079,202, and, as stated, the patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
Differences in the arc adjustment feature, radius reduction feature, and structural components
are addressed below and with reference to the figures.
[0025]       As described in more detail below, the nozzle 100 allows a user to depress and
rotate a deflector 102 to directly actuate the arc adjustment valve 104, i.e., to open and close the
valve. The user depresses the deflector 102 to directly engage and rotate one of the two nozzle
body portions that forms the valve 104 (valve sleeve 106). The valve 104 preferably operates
through the use of two helical engagement surfaces that cam against one another to define an
arcuate opening 108. Although the nozzle 100 preferably includes a shaft 110, the user does

                                               -4
not need to use a hand tool to effect rotation of the shaft 110 to open and close the arc
adjustment valve 104. The shaft 110 is not rotated to cause opening and closing of the valve
104. Indeed, the shaft 110 is preferably fixed against rotation, such as through use of splined
engagement surfaces.
[0026]       The nozzle 100 also preferably uses a spring 112 mounted to the shaft 110 to
energize and tighten the seal of the closed portion of the arc adjustment valve 104.           More
specifically, the spring 112 operates on the shaft 110 to bias the first of the two nozzle body
portions that forms the valve 104 (valve sleeve 106) downwardly against the second portion
(nozzle cover 114). In one preferred form, the shaft 110 translates up and down a total distance
corresponding to one helical pitch.      The vertical position of the shaft 110 depends on the
orientation of the two helical engagement surfaces with respect to one another. By using a
spring 112 to maintain a forced engagement between valve sleeve 106 and nozzle cover 114,
the nozzle 100 provides a tight seal of the closed portion of the arc adjustment valve 104,
concentricity of the valve 104, and a uniform jet of water directed through the valve 104.        In
addition, mounting the spring 112 at one end of the shaft 110 results in a lower cost of
assembly.
[0027]       As can be seen in FIGS. 1 and 2, the nozzle 100 generally comprises a compact
unit, preferably made primarily of lightweight molded plastic, which is adapted for convenient
thread-on mounting onto the upper end of a stationary or pop-up riser (FIGS. 7 and 8).            In
operation, water under pressure is delivered through the riser to a nozzle body 116. The water
preferably passes through an inlet 118 controlled by an adjustable flow rate feature that
regulates the amount of fluid flow through the nozzle body 116.       The water is then directed
through an arcuate opening 108 that determines the arcuate span of water distributed from the
nozzle 100. Water is directed generally upwardly through the arcuate opening 108 to produce
one or more upwardly directed water jets that impinge the underside surface of a deflector 102
for rotatably driving the deflector 102.
[0028]       The rotatable deflector 102 has an underside surface that is contoured to deliver a
plurality of fluid streams generally radially outwardly therefrom through an arcuate span. As
shown in FIG. 4, the underside surface of the deflector 102 preferably includes an array of spiral
vanes. The spiral vanes subdivide the water jet or jets into the plurality of relatively small water
streams which are distributed radially outwardly therefrom to surrounding terrain as the deflector
102 rotates. The vanes define a plurality of intervening flow channels extending upwardly and
spiraling along the underside surface to extend generally radially outwardly with selected

                                                -5
inclination angles. A cap 120 is mounted on the deflector 102 to limit the ingress of debris and
particulate material into the sensitive components in the interior of the deflector 102, which might
otherwise interfere with operation of the nozzle 100. During operation of the nozzle 100, the
upwardly directed water jet or jets impinge upon the lower or upstream segments of these
vanes, which subdivide the water flow into the plurality of relatively small flow streams for
passage through the flow channels and radially outward projection from the nozzle 100. The
vanes are curved in a manner and direction to drive rotation of the deflector 102. A deflector like
the type shown in U.S. Patent No. 6,814,304, which is assigned to the assignee of the present
application and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, is preferably used.       Other
types of deflectors, however, may also be used.
[0029]       The variable arc capability of nozzle 100 results from the interaction of two portions
of the nozzle body 116 (nozzle cover 114 and valve sleeve 106). More specifically, as can be
seen in FIGS. 3 and 4, the nozzle cover 114 and the valve sleeve 106 have corresponding
helical engagement surfaces. The valve sleeve 106 may be rotatably adjusted with respect to
the nozzle cover 114 to close the arc adjustment valve 104, i.e., to adjust the length of arcuate
opening 108, and this rotatable adjustment also results in upward or downward translation of the
valve sleeve 106. In turn, this camming action results in upward or downward translation of the
shaft 110 with the valve sleeve 106. The arcuate opening 108 may be adjusted to a desired
water distribution arc by the user through push down and rotation of the deflector 102.
[0030]       As shown in FIGS. 2-4, the valve sleeve 106 has a generally cylindrical shape. The
valve sleeve 106 includes a central hub defining a bore therethrough for insertion of the shaft
110. The downward biasing force of spring 112 against shaft 110 results in a friction press fit
between an inclined shoulder of the shaft 110, a retaining washer 122, and a top surface of the
valve sleeve 106. The valve sleeve 106 preferably has a top surface defining teeth 124 formed
therein for engagement with the deflector teeth 126. The valve sleeve 106 also includes a
bottom helical surface 128 that engages and cams against a corresponding helical surface 130
of the nozzle cover 114 to form the arc adjustment valve 104. As shown in FIG. 3, the non
rotating nozzle cover 114 has an internal helical surface 130 that defines approximately one 360
degree helical revolution, or pitch.
[0031]       The arcuate span of the nozzle 100 is determined by the relative positions of the
internal helical surface 130 of the nozzle cover 114 and the complementary external helical
surface 128 of the valve sleeve 106, which act together to form the arcuate opening 108. The
camming interaction of the valve sleeve 106 with the nozzle cover 114 forms the arcuate

                                                  -6
opening 108, as shown in FIG. 2, where the arc is open on the right side of the C-C axis. The
length of the arcuate opening 108 is determined by push down and rotation of the deflector 102
(which in turn rotates the valve sleeve 106) relative to the non-rotating nozzle cover 114. The
valve sleeve 106 may be rotated with respect to the nozzle cover 114 along the complementary
helical surfaces through approximately one helical pitch to raise or lower the valve sleeve 106.
The valve sleeve 106 may be rotated through approximately one 360 degree helical pitch with
respect to the nozzle cover 114. The valve sleeve 106 may be rotated relative to the nozzle
cover 114 to an arc desired by the user and is not limited to discrete arcs, such as quarter-circle
and half-circle.
[0032]        In an initial lowermost position, the valve sleeve 106 is at the lowest point of the
helical turn on the nozzle cover 114 and completely obstructs the flow path through the arcuate
opening 108.      As the valve sleeve 106 is rotated in the clockwise direction, however, the
complementary external helical surface 128 of the valve sleeve 106 begins to traverse the
helical turn on the internal surface 130 of the nozzle cover 114. As it begins to traverse the
helical turn, a portion of the valve sleeve 106 is spaced from the nozzle cover 114 and a gap, or
arcuate opening 108, begins to form between the valve sleeve 106 and the nozzle cover 114.
This gap, or arcuate opening 108, provides part of the flow path for water flowing through the
nozzle 100. The angle of the arcuate opening 108 increases as the valve sleeve 106 is further
rotated clockwise and the valve sleeve 106 continues to traverse the helical turn.
[0033]        When the valve sleeve 106 is rotated counterclockwise, the angle of the arcuate
opening 108 is decreased. The complementary external helical surface 128 of the valve sleeve
106 traverses the helical turn in the opposite direction until it reaches the bottom of the helical
turn. When the surface 128 of the valve sleeve 106 has traversed the helical turn completely,
the arcuate opening 108 is closed and the flow path through the nozzle 100 is completely or
almost completely obstructed.       It should be evident that the direction of rotation of the valve
sleeve 106 for either opening or closing the arcuate opening 108 can be easily reversed, i.e.,
from clockwise to counterclockwise or vice versa, such as by changing the thread orientation.
[0034]       As shown in FIG. 2, the nozzle 100 also preferably includes a radius reduction valve
132. The radius reduction valve 132 can be used to selectively set the water flow rate through
the nozzle 100, for purposes of regulating the range of throw of the projected water streams. It
is adapted for variable setting through use of a rotatable segment 134 located on an outer wall
portion of the nozzle 100. It functions as a second valve that can be opened or closed to allow
the flow of water through the nozzle 100. Also, a filter 136 is preferably located upstream of the

                                                 -7
radius reduction valve 132, so that it obstructs passage of sizable particulate and other debris
that could otherwise damage the sprinkler components or compromise desired efficacy of the
nozzle 100.
[0035]       As shown in FIG. 2, the radius reduction valve structure preferably includes a nozzle
collar 138, a flow control member (preferably in the form of throttle nut 140), and the nozzle
cover 114. The nozzle collar 138 is rotatable about the central axis C-C of the nozzle 100. It
has an internal engagement surface 142 that engages the throttle nut 140 so that rotation of the
nozzle collar 138 results in rotation of the throttle nut 140. The throttle nut 140 also threadedly
engages a post 144 of the nozzle cover 114 such that rotation of the throttle nut 140 causes it to
move in an axial direction, as described further below. In this manner, rotation of the nozzle
collar 138 can be used to move the throttle nut 140 axially closer to and further away from an
inlet 118. When the throttle nut 140 is moved closer to the inlet 118, the flow rate is reduced.
The axial movement of the throttle nut 140 towards the inlet 118 increasingly pinches the flow
through the inlet 118. When the throttle nut 140 is moved further away from the inlet 118, the
flow rate is increased. This axial movement allows the user to adjust the effective throw radius
of the nozzle 100 without disruption of the streams dispersed by the deflector 102.
[0036]       As can be seen in FIGS. 2-4, the throttle nut 140 is coupled to the nozzle cover 114.
More specifically, the throttle nut 140 is internally threaded for engagement with an externally
threaded hollow post 144 at the lower end of the nozzle cover 114. Rotation of the throttle nut
140 causes it to move along the threading in an axial direction. In one preferred form, rotation of
the throttle nut 140 in a counterclockwise direction advances the nut 140 towards the inlet 118
and away from the deflector 102. Conversely, rotation of the throttle nut 140 in a clockwise
direction causes it to move away from the inlet 118. Although threaded surfaces are shown in
the preferred embodiment, it is contemplated that other engagement surfaces could be used to
effect axial movement.
[0037]       In operation, a user may rotate the outer wall of the nozzle collar 138 in a clockwise
or counterclockwise direction. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the nozzle cover 114 preferably
includes one or more cut-out portions to define one or more access windows to allow rotation of
the nozzle collar outer wall. Further, as shown in FIG. 2, the nozzle collar 138, throttle nut 140,
and nozzle cover 114 are oriented and spaced to allow the throttle nut 140 to essentially block
fluid flow through the inlet 118 or to allow a desired amount of fluid flow through the inlet 118.
As can be seen in FIG. 4, the throttle nut 140 preferably has a helical bottom surface 146 for
engagement with a corresponding helical surface 148 of a valve seat 150 when fully extended.

                                                 -8
[0038]       Rotation in a counterclockwise direction results in axial movement of the throttle nut
140 toward the inlet 118. Continued rotation results in the throttle nut 140 advancing to the
valve seat 150 formed at the inlet 118 for blocking fluid flow. The dimensions of radial tabs 152,
154 of the throttle nut 140 and the splined internal surface 142 of the nozzle collar 138 are
preferably selected to provide over-rotation protection.     More specifically, the radial tabs 152,
154 are sufficiently flexible such that they slip out of the splined recesses 142 upon over
rotation. Once the inlet 118 is blocked, further rotation of the nozzle collar 138 causes slippage
of the radial tabs 152, 154, allowing the collar 138 to continue to rotate without corresponding
rotation of the throttle nut 140, which might otherwise cause potential damage to sprinkler
components.
[0039]       Rotation in a clockwise direction causes the throttle nut 140 to move axially away
from the inlet 118. Continued rotation allows an increasing amount of fluid flow through the inlet
118, and the nozzle collar 138 may be rotated to the desired amount of fluid flow. When the
valve is open, fluid flows through the nozzle 100 along the following flow path: through the inlet
118, between the nozzle collar 138 and the throttle nut 140 and through valve 132, between ribs
156 of the nozzle cover 114, through the arcuate opening 108 (if set to an angle greater than 0
degrees), upwardly along the upper cylindrical wall of the nozzle cover 114, to the underside
surface of the deflector 102, and radially outwardly from the deflector 102. It should be evident
that the direction of rotation of the outer wall for axial movement of the throttle nut 140 can be
easily reversed, i.e., from clockwise to counterclockwise or vice versa.
[0040]       The nozzle 100 may also include features to prevent grit and other debris from
entering into sensitive areas of the nozzle 100, which may affect or even prevent operation of
the nozzle 100. For example, as shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, an upward facing surface 158 of the
nozzle cover 114 includes two "debris traps" 160, 162 that limit debris from becoming lodged in
the central hub 164 of the nozzle cover 114. As can be seen, this central hub 164 of the nozzle
cover 114 defines a recess for the nesting insertion of the valve sleeve 106, and the nozzle
cover 114 and valve sleeve 106 are the two valve bodies that define the arc adjustment valve
104. Accordingly, if debris becomes lodged in the central hub 164 of the nozzle cover 114, it
may interfere with rotation of the valve sleeve 106, may block a portion of the arcuate valve 104,
or may affect sealing between the valve bodies 106, 114 (e.g., the closed portion of the valve
104). In one form, without debris traps 160, 162, the back flow of grit, debris, or other particulate
matter into the nozzle cover 114 may result in such debris being sucked into the central hub 164
and/or valve sleeve 106.

                                                 -9
[0041]       The first debris trap 160 is defined, in part, by the outer wall 166 of the nozzle cover
114. As can be seen, the outer wall 166 is inclined at an angle such that the outermost portion
is at a higher elevation than the innermost portion. During normal operation, when grit, dirt, or
other debris comes into contact with this outer wall 166, it may be guided into a first channel (or
first annular depression) 168. The debris is prevented from moving from this first channel 168
and entering the central hub 164 by an intermediate wall 170. In other words, the debris trap
160 is defined, in part, by the outer wall 166, first channel 168, and intermediate wall 170 such
that debris is trapped in the first channel 168. As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, the second debris
trap 162 includes a second channel 172 (or second annular depression) disposed between the
intermediate wall 170 and an inner wall 174. In other words, the debris traps 160, 162 may
include two separate annular channels 168, 172, respectively, for capturing debris before it
enters the central hub 164.
[0042]       As stated, one way in which debris may accumulate is from back flow or back
siphoning when water stops flowing through the nozzle 100 (i.e., the sprinkler is turned off). One
purpose of the debris traps 160, 162 is to block this back flow or back siphoning from depositing
debris in the central hub 164 of the nozzle cover 114 and/or valve sleeve 106 so as to possibly
interfere with the arc adjustment operation. As is evident, nozzles 100 are subject to external
contaminants during operation. Adding walls/barriers and channels to trap and prevent debris
from reaching the arc valve portion of the nozzle 100 helps ensure effective operation of the
nozzle 100.
[0043]       In addition, in one form, the nozzle 100 may be mounted in a "pop-up" sprinkler
assembly 200. One example of such a pop-up sprinkler assembly 200 is shown in FIGS. 7 and
8. The pop-up sprinkler assembly 200 described and shown herein is one exemplary type of
assembly that may be used with the nozzle 100.               The assembly 200 and many of its
components are similar to that shown and described in U.S. Patent No. 6,997,393 and U.S.
Patent No. 8,833,672, which have been assigned to the assignee of the present application and
which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.         Other similar types of pop-up
sprinklers and components are shown and described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,479,611 and
4,913,352, which also have been assigned to the assignee of the present application and which
are also incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. As should be evident, various other
types of sprinkler assemblies also may incorporate nozzle 100.
[0044]       As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the sprinkler assembly 200 generally includes a housing
202 and a riser assembly 204. The riser assembly 204 travels cyclically between a spring-

                                                 - 10
retracted position and an elevated spraying position in response to water pressure.              More
specifically, when the supply water is on, i.e., pressurized for a watering cycle, the riser
assembly 204 extends ("pops up") above ground level so that water can be distributed to the
terrain for irrigation. When the water is shut off at the end of a watering cycle, the riser assembly
204 retracts into the housing 202 where it is protected from damage. Figures 7 and 8 show the
riser assembly 204 in a retracted position.
[0045]        The housing 202 provides a protective covering for the riser assembly 204 and,
together with the riser assembly 204, serves as a conduit for incoming water under pressure.
The housing 202 preferably has a generally cylindrical shape and is preferably made of a sturdy
lightweight injection molded plastic or similar material, suitable for underground installation with
the upper end 206 disposed substantially flush with the surface of the soil. The housing 202
preferably has a lower end 208 with an inlet 210 that is threaded to connect to a correspondingly
threaded outlet of a water supply pipe (not shown).
[0046]        In one preferred form, the riser assembly 204 includes a stem 212 with a lower end
214 and an upper end, or nozzle mounting portion, 216. The stem 212 is preferably cylindrical
in shape and is preferably made of a lightweight molded plastic or similar material. The riser
assembly 204 has a threaded upper end 218 for attaching to the nozzle 100. The nozzle 100
ejects water outwardly from the sprinkler 200 when the riser assembly 204 is in the elevated
spray position.
[0047]        A spring 220 for retracting the riser assembly 204 is preferably disposed in the
housing 202 about the outside surface 222 of the stem 212. The spring 220 has a bottom coil
224 that engages a guide 226 and an upper coil 228 seated against the inside of a housing
cover 230. The spring 220 biases the riser assembly 204 toward the retracted position until the
water pressure reaches a predetermined threshold pressure.             An example of a threshold
pressure is about 5 psi, at which time the water supply pressure acting on riser assembly 204
would be sufficient to overcome the force of the spring 220 and cause movement of the riser
assembly 204 to the elevated spraying position.
[0048]        The housing cover 230 serves to minimize the introduction of dirt and other debris
into the housing 202. The housing cover 230 preferably has internal threads and is mounted to
the upper end 206 of the housing 202 which has corresponding threads. The cover 230 has a
central opening through which the elongated riser assembly 204 is movable between the
retracted position and the elevated spraying position. The housing cover 230 is also preferably
fitted with a seal 232, preferably a wiper seal, mounted on the inside of the cover 230.

                                                - 11
[0049]         In one form, the nozzle cover 114 has a reduced outer diameter that forms another
sort of debris prevention feature. More specifically, as can be seen in FIG. 5, the nozzle cover
114 includes a reduced diameter portion 234 (or indented portion) near the top of the nozzle
cover 114. As can be seen from FIG. 8, this reduced diameter portion 234 increases the gap
236 between the nozzle cover 114 and the seal 232, thereby creating a larger flow path around
the nozzle 100.
[0050]         The nozzle 100 is exposed to external contaminants during operation. It is believed
that reducing the outside diameter of the nozzle cover 114 creates an alternative path for the
back flow of water and debris. Adding an alternative reverse flow path reduces the likelihood of
debris flowing into the nozzle 100 and reaching the arc valve portion of the nozzle 100.
[0051]         Further, the nozzle 100 includes braking features to maintain relatively consistent
braking under various conditions.       As can be seen in FIGS. 9-11, nozzle 100 includes a
frustoconical brake pad 238.       The brake pad 238 is part of a brake disposed in the deflector
102, which maintains the rotation of the deflector 102 at a relatively constant speed irrespective
of flow rate, fluid pressure, and temperature. The brake includes the brake pad 238 sandwiched
between a friction disk 240 (above the brake pad 238) and a seal retainer 242 (below the brake
pad 238). During operation of the nozzle 100, the friction disk 240 is held relatively stationary by
the shaft 110, the seal retainer 242 rotates with the deflector 102 at a first rate, and the brake
pad 238 rotates at a second, intermediate rate. Further, during operation, the seal retainer 242
is urged upwardly against the brake pad 238, which results in a variable frictional resistance that
maintains a relatively constant rotational speed of the deflector 102 irrespective of the rate of
fluid flow, fluid pressure, and/or operating temperature.
[0052]        As can be seen in FIGS. 9-11, the brake pad 238 is generally frustoconical in shape
and includes a top surface 244 and a bottom surface 246. The frustoconical shape is inverted
as shown in the figures and includes a central bore 248 for insertion of the shaft 110. The top
and bottom surfaces 244, 246 each include three radial grooves 250 spaced equidistantly about
the surfaces and preferably having a uniform width. These radial grooves 250 extend radially
outwardly from the central bore 248 about halfway to the outer perimeter. These grooves 250
help distribute lubrication (or grease) over the surface of the brake pad 238.
[0053]         The brake pad 238 also includes a feature that allows it to provide sufficient braking
at low power input. More specifically, as can be seen in FIGS. 9 and 10, the brake pad 238
includes three radially extending slots 252 that continue outwardly in the direction of the three
radial grooves 250. In other words, each radial groove 250 terminates in a radial slot 252. It

                                                    - 12
has been found that these three radial slots 252 allow the brake pad 238 to act like three
separate, cantilevered brake pad bodies and make the brake pad 238 less springy. This design
allows part of the brake pad 238 to begin to flatten at lower speeds than previous designs. More
specifically, at low power input, a conical design without the slots 252 may not tend to collapse
(or flatten) enough to cause sufficient braking, so the deflector 102 may be rotating too fast. In
contrast, the outer annular portion 239 of the split brake pad 238 defined by the slots 252 tends
to flatten easier and the brake pad 238 stiffness is reduced, thereby causing braking sooner at
low power input.
[0054]         The brake includes another feature intended to help distribute lubrication (or grease)
more uniformly over the top and bottom surfaces 244, 246 of the brake pad 238. The friction disk
240 and seal retainer 242 each include raised spiral surfaces that engage and interact with the
brake pad 238. More specifically, the bottom of the friction disk 240 defines a first, raised spiral
surface 254 that engages the top surface 244 of the brake pad 238, and the top of the seal
retainer 242 defines a second, raised spiral surface 256 that engages the bottom surface 246 of
the brake pad 238. Depending on the orientation of the spiral surfaces 254, 256, i.e., clockwise
or counterclockwise, and the direction of rotation of the deflector 102, these spiral surfaces 254,
256 have been found to help distribute grease deposited at inner or outer margins of the spiral
pattern to the rest of the spiral pattern.
[0055]         Further, in one form, each spiraled surface 254, 256 is preferably a "double spiraled
surface" that initially spirals in a first direction, i.e., clockwise, as the spiral moves inwardly, and
then, near a halfway transition point 258, spirals in the reverse direction, i.e., counter-clockwise,
as the spiral continues to move inwardly. The grease is initially deposited as several dots near
the middle of the double spiraled pattern, and during rotation of the deflector 102, it is distributed
both inwardly and outwardly toward both the inner and outer margins.                 This double spiraled
surface tends to distribute lubricant uniformly to both the inner and outer portions of the brake
pad 238.
[0056]         The brake pad 238 is preferably formed from a silicone rubber material and coated
with a lubricant, such as a thin layer of a selected grease, to provide a relatively low coefficient
of static friction. The spiraled surfaces 254, 256 help distribute the lubricant over the entire top
and bottom faces of the brake pad 238. By ensuring more uniform lubrication, the spiraled
surfaces 254, 256 assist with proper braking at both low and high power input. The power input
is determined generally by fluid pressure and/or flow rate and corresponds generally to the
rotational force directed against the deflector 102 by the impacting fluid.

                                                 - 13
[0057]        The spiraled surfaces 254, 256 define crests 259 and troughs 260 with troughs 260
acting as reservoirs for receiving lubricant. More specifically, the troughs 260 act as reservoirs
for the lubricant to help ensure a minimum grease film thickness and viscosity. Without the
spiraled surfaces 254, 256 (i.e., the surfaces are flat), the grease film thickness and viscosity
can approach zero, and it has been found that this minute thickness can result in excessive
braking, especially for high power input. In contrast, it is believed that the spiraled surfaces 254,
256 provide a higher minimum viscosity and thickness. The minimum grease film thickness will
generally be on the order of (or slightly less than) the distance between the crests 259 and
troughs 260 of the spiraled surfaces 254, 256.
[0058]       Thus, at very low power input, the brake pad 238 generally retains its conical shape,
and the seal retainer 242 is urged slightly upwardly against the bottom surface 246 of the brake
pad 238. The seal retainer 242 engages the brake pad 238 at a relatively thin inner annular
portion 262 of the brake pad 238 and provides relatively little braking at very low power input.
As the power input increases slightly, the three radial slots 252 in the brake pad 238 cause the
outer annular portion 239 of the brake pad 238 to flatten such that more surface area is in
engagement, friction increases, and braking increases.
[0059]       In addition, the reverse spiral surfaces 254, 256 provide relatively uniform lubrication
of the brake pad 238 to make sure that the friction does not become excessive at low power
input. At low power input, when there is significant frictional engagement between the brake pad
238 and other braking components, there may be too much braking, which may lead the nozzle
100 to stall. In other words, without proper lubrication, the brake pad 238 may tend to cause too
much friction at low power input.
[0060]       At high power input, the thick outermost annular lip 264 is sandwiched between the
friction disk 240 and seal retainer 242, and most of the friction (and braking) results from the
engagement of the thick outer lip 264 with the seal retainer 242. However, as addressed, it has
been found that there is more braking at high power input than would be anticipated, and it is
believed that this excessive braking may result from a change in grease viscosity at high power
input. More specifically, it is believed that the grease viscosity may be reduced (i.e., the grease
becomes spread too thin) at high power input, resulting in too much friction, too much braking,
and an overly reduced deflector rotational speed.
[0061]       The spiraled surfaces 254, 256 on the friction disk 240 and seal retainer 242 assist
in avoiding excessive braking at high power input. More specifically, the troughs 260 form a
reservoir for the grease, so as to limit the minimum film thickness of the grease with the

                                                 - 14
minimum film thickness being generally about the distance between a crest 259 and a trough
260. It is believed that this minimum film thickness increases lubrication and thereby limits the
excessive braking and unexpected slowing of the deflector 102 at high power input.
[0062]        As shown in FIG. 12, the friction disk 240 includes another feature that helps with
adjustment of the arc adjustment valve 104. More specifically, an inner diameter 266 of the
friction disk 240 is in the form of a twelve-sided star, or twelve-sided polygon. The inner diameter
266 of the friction disk 240 cooperates with the shaft 110 during arc adjustment. As shown in
FIG. 12, the six-sided (hexagonal) top of the shaft 110 is seated within the twelve-sided recess
defined by the inner diameter 266.
[0063]        It has been found that the twelve-sided star arrangement assists with indexing of the
six-sided shaft 110 during manufacturing and assembly. In other words, it helps align the friction
disk 240 with the shaft 110 during assembly. Also, following assembly and during operation, the
twelve-sided star arrangement may help with alignment of these two components. If, for some
reason, the top of the friction disk 240 and the top of the shaft 110 become out of engagement
during operation, this arrangement helps with realignment by providing more positions for
realignment. In other words, by increasing the friction disk inside diameter 266 from six points to
twelve points, the likelihood of indexing to the shaft six-point shape is increased.
[0064]        As shown in FIG. 14, the deflector 102 and valve sleeve 106 include an engagement
feature that helps with arc adjustment.        More specifically, the deflector 102 includes twelve
downwardly-facing teeth 126 that engage six upwardly-facing teeth 124 of the valve sleeve 106.
As can be seen, the number and arrangement of teeth are mismatched.                  Also, the twelve
downwardly-facing teeth 126 of the deflector 102 are shallower (shorter in height) than the six
upwardly-facing teeth 124 of the valve sleeve 106. With these shallower deflector teeth 126, the
distance between the deflector teeth 126 and the valve sleeve teeth 124 can be reduced.             In
other words, the deflector 102 need not travel as far (i.e., need not be pushed down as far by a
user) so that the teeth engage one another to adjust the arcuate setting.
[0065]        This arrangement reduces the required lift to disengage the teeth 124, 126 from one
another. This reduced lift may be desirable when the force exerted by upwardly directed water
to lift the deflector 102 is limited (such as under low water flow conditions). Otherwise, under
such conditions, the deflector 102 may not have sufficient clearance to rotate without
interference by the teeth 124, 126 with one another. Also, the tips of the deflector and/or valve
teeth 124, 126 may be truncated to provide additional clearance.

                                                 -15
[0066]       Further, it has been found that this engagement feature helps prevent the
accumulation of debris and other particulate matter on and about the valve sleeve 106. The
presence of debris or particulates in the engagement feature (i.e., teeth 124, 126) can lead to
damage to the deflector 102 or valve sleeve 106 when engaged. When a user depresses the
deflector 102 to cause the corresponding teeth to engage, it can be seen that a gap (or a void)
will be formed between the teeth 124, 126. In other words, because the deflector teeth 126 are
shallower than the valve sleeve teeth 124, the deflector teeth 126 will not completely fill the
troughs between adjacent valve sleeve teeth 124 during engagement.              The void between
engaging teeth 124, 126 creates a relief for debris to occupy during engagement, thereby
improving debris tolerance.
[0067]      As shown in FIGS. 15-17, the nozzle 100 includes a seal feature that helps limit
excessive friction as the deflector 102 is rotating during irrigation. More specifically, as shown in
FIGS. 15 and 16, the nozzle 100 includes a single lip deflector seal 268 that seals the interior of
the deflector 102 from upwardly-directed fluid while also minimizing the amount of friction during
deflector rotation. The seal 268 includes an annular top portion 270 that is mounted near the
bottom end of the deflector 102, which causes the seal 268 to rotate with the deflector 102. The
seal 268 further includes an inwardly extending lip 272 that blocks water directed upwardly
through the nozzle 100 from the interior of the deflector 102. Thus, the seal 268 keeps water
and debris from entering the brake/speed control assembly.
[0068]       The seal 268 is designed so that only a small portion of the seal 268 comes into
contact with the shaft 110 during irrigation. As can be seen, the lip 272 has a smaller inner
diameter than the annular top portion 270 so that only the lip 272 circumferentially engages the
shaft 110. During irrigation, the seal 268 is rotating with the deflector 102, and contact by the
seal with the stationary shaft 110 results in friction. A relatively small portion of the lip 272
comes into contact with the shaft 110 in order to seal against the shaft 110, but this portion is
minimized in order to reduce the amount of friction caused by the seal 268.          If the friction is
excessive, this may interfere with the operation of the deflector 102 and with the brake,
especially at low power input settings where seal friction may have a proportionately large
impact on the relatively slow rotation of the deflector 102. Accordingly, the seal 268 cooperates
with the brake to control the rotational speed of the deflector 102, especially at slower speeds.
In addition, the lip 272 provides an effective seal because it fits snugly about the entire
circumference of the shaft 110 (i.e., there is good interference with the shaft 110).              This

                                                - 16
circumferential arrangement also helps the seal 268 resist becoming dislodged or out of position
due to side load forces acting against the nozzle 100.
