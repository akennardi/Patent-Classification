                                   Fin Plug for Water Craft
Field of the invention
[001]           The present invention relates to a fin plug, for installation in a water craft,
such as a surfboard or the like, adapted to enable fins to be removably attached to the
water craft.
[002]           The present invention also relates to fins or other items which are adapted
to be removably attached to the abovementioned fin plug.
Background of the invention
[003]           A water craft, such as a surfboard, particularly one on which a person
stands, kneels or sits, when traversing water or riding a wave, generally has at least one
fin in an underside of the water craft, generally near the tail end of the water craft. Such
fins have a number of functions, including: enabling the craft to travel in a desired
direction; facilitating the turning of the craft; preventing the craft from slipping sideways;
and providing greater control over the movement of the craft, such as when riding a
wave.
[004]           The following discussion is directed mainly to surfboards but it is to be
understood that the discussion applies equally to other water craft (and surf craft) which
are adapted to include fins, such as sail boards, paddle boards, rescue boards, surf
skis, kayaks, and the like.
[005]           Some surfboards have fins integrally formed in the underside of the
surfboard and, historically, most surfboards included such integrally formed fins. These
integrally formed fins are generally 'glassed in', meaning that they are formed as part of
the surfboard by means of fiber-reinforced resin. The formation of such 'glassed in' fins
is quite labour intensive and it makes the subsequent sanding and finishing of the board
more difficult.
[006]           In the last twenty years or so, it has become more common for surfboards
to incorporate fin systems which include removable fins.              Such fin systems have
numerous benefits, including: enabling the fins to be removed whilst travelling; allowing
damaged fins to be easily replaced; and enabling fins of different shapes or styles to be
selectively used. These fin systems typically include at least one fin plug embedded in

P4332AU05
                                                2
the underside of the surfboard, adapted to receive at least one surfboard fin. Each such
fin plug will generally include an open cavity adapted to receive a base portion (or base
element) of a surfboard fin.       The fin is then able to be removably attached to the
surfboard by inserting the relevant base portion (or base element) of the fin into the
cavity (or cavities) of the fin plug (or fin plugs). There are numerous known fin systems
which incorporate such an arrangement.
[007]          One known and commonly used fin system is described in US5,464,369 in
the name of Fin Control Systems Pty Ltd. This system includes fins, each having two
projecting base elements (or tabs) and, for each fin, two fin plugs installed in the
underside of the surfboard. Each of the fin plugs has a cavity for receiving one of the
base elements. Each fin plug also includes a grub screw for securing the base element
within the cavity of the fin plug.
[008]          The above fin system of US5,464,369 has become exceedingly popular
and widely used as the system enables fins to be affixed to a surfboard in a highly
secure manner whilst also enabling the fins to be easily removed from the surfboard
when desired.      However, one drawback of the abovementioned system is that the
installation and removal of fins from the fin plugs is somewhat time-consuming and
requires the use of a tool (e.g. an Allen key) as the grub screws need to be threaded
into or out of each cavity in order to secure or release the base elements of each fin (as
desired).
[009]          Another fin plug which functions in a similar way to that described above is
the fin plug assembly described in PCT/AU/2008/001132, also in the name of Fin
Control Systems Pty Ltd. The fin plug described in PCT/AU/2008/001132 includes two
open cavities adapted to receive corresponding base elements of a surfboard fin.
These base elements are adapted to be secured and released by means of grub screws
(which can be threaded into or out of the cavities). Each such grub screw is adapted to
press laterally against a side of a base element of the fin to secure it in position.
[010]          Other known fin systems include systems which incorporate a single fin
plug, with a single cavity, for each surfboard fin. Typically, such a fin system has quite a
large fin plug with an elongated fin cavity for receiving the base element(s) of a fin. In
such fin systems it is again usual for each fin to be secured to the surfboard (that is, the

P4332AU05
                                                 3
base element of the fin to be secured within the cavity of the fin plug) by means of a
grub screw arrangement, such as that mentioned above.
[011]           There is a present need for a surfboard fin plug adapted to enable
surfboard fins to be removably secured to the underside of a surfboard in a quick, easy
and secure manner and preferably without the need for using a tool.
[012]           The present invention is directed towards ameliorating at least some of the
above described problems associated with prior art fin plugs.          More particularly, the
present invention is directed towards a fin plug adapted to receive a surfboard fin which
enables the fin to be easily and quickly secured to or removed from a surfboard. Even
more particularly, the present invention is directed towards a fin plug, adapted to receive
a surfboard fin, which enables the fin to be easily and quickly secured to or removed
from a surfboard without the use of a tool.
[013]            Further, the present invention is directed towards fins or other items which
are adapted to be easily and quickly secured to or removed from the abovementioned
fin plugs without the use of a tool.

referred to or discussed, this reference or discussion is not an admission that the
document, act or item of knowledge or any combination thereof was at the priority date:
        a) part of the common general knowledge; or
        b) known to be relevant to an attempt to solve any problem with which this
             specification is concerned.
[015]           Any reference herein to known prior art does not, unless the contrary
indication appears, constitute an admission that such prior art is commonly known by
those skilled in the art to which the invention relates, at the priority date of this
application.
Summary of the invention
[016]           According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fin
plug for installation in a water craft, said fin plug including:
    *   a first open cavity adapted to receive a base portion of a water craft fin;

P4332AU05
                                                 4
    *   a resilient biasing rod and a protruding member cooperating with the biasing rod,
        said protruding member being adapted to abut the base portion of said fin when
        received in said first open cavity;
wherein said biasing rod and protruding member are adapted to apply a force to the
base portion of said fin to inhibit removal of said fin from said first open cavity.
[017]            The biasing rod is preferably located adjacent the first open cavity. The
biasing rod generally extends substantially parallel to a side surface of the base portion
of said fin.    It is preferred that the orientation of the biasing rod is also substantially
parallel to the plane of the water craft.
[018]            The biasing rod may be formed of any suitable material, such as titanium,
steel (e.g. marine grade steel), fiberglass, carbon fibre or plastic (including reinforced
engineering plastic). It is particularly preferred that the biasing rod is formed of titanium.
[019]            The protruding member is preferably adapted to abut the side surface of
the base portion of said fin.
[020]            It is preferred that the fin plug further includes a lateral cavity and said
biasing rod is located within said lateral cavity. The lateral cavity typically includes a
lateral opening positioned in a side of said fin plug.          It is preferred that this lateral
opening is sealed (at least prior to installation in the water craft).
[021]            Preferably, the lateral cavity and the first open cavity are separated by an
internal wall. It is preferred that the internal wall is an apertured wall and a portion of
said protruding member protrudes through an aperture in said wall into said first open
cavity.
[022]            In an alternative embodiment, the protruding member may be formed on
the internal wall and said protruding member cooperates with the biasing rod and is
adapted to abut the base portion of said fin when received in said first cavity.
[023]            In a particularly preferred embodiment, the side surface of the base
portion of said fin includes an inclined surface section, said inclined surface section
being adapted to co-operate with the protruding member so as to cause a force,
inwardly into said first open cavity, to be applied to said base portion under the influence
of said biasing rod.

P4332AU05
                                                 5
[024]          The fin plug will typically have a forward region and a rearward region and
it will preferably include additional fin removal inhibiting means located in said forward
region. Preferably, the protruding member is located in the rearward region.
[025]          The additional fin removal inhibiting means preferably includes fin
engagement means. The fin engagement means preferably includes a ledge portion
adapted to overlie a fin section of said fin and to inhibit movement of said fin when the
base portion of said fin is received within the first open cavity.
[026]           It is particularly preferred that the fin plug includes a second open cavity,
wherein the first open cavity is adapted to receive a first tab of the base portion of said
fin and the second open cavity is adapted to receive a second tab of the base portion of
said fin.
[027]           Preferably, the first open cavity is located in the rearward region and the
second open cavity is located in the forward region of said fin plug.
[028]          The inclined surface section of the base portion is preferably located on
the first tab.
[029]          The ledge portion is preferably located within said second open cavity.
Preferably, this ledge portion includes a ledge extending from one end of said second
open cavity and defining a recess between said ledge and a base surface of said
second open cavity, said recess being adapted to receive the fin section.
[030]          Accordingly, it is preferred that the fin section of the water craft fin is
located on the second tab of the base portion of said fin.
[031]           In a particularly preferred embodiment, the protruding member is a ring
shaped member located about said biasing rod. Preferably, this ring-shaped member is
adapted to rotate about said biasing rod. The ring-shaped member preferably has a
circumferential outer surface extending between two side surfaces, said circumferential
outer surface having a convex profile between said side surfaces. This convex profile
enables the load or force, which is applied to the ring-shaped member when it engages
with the base portion or the first tab of the water craft fin, to be dispersed more evenly
across the ring shaped member.
[032]          The ring- shaped member is typically formed of a durable, non corrosive
polymer/plastic material (although a number of other suitable materials could be used).

                                                6
Acetal is a particularly preferred material for the ring-shaped member. Acetal is a
common term for a comparatively hard engineering plastic with high tensile strength,
suitable for machining and high rigidity in use.
[033]          The fin plug may also include a grub screw adapted to extend into said
first open cavity and to further secure the base portion of said fin within said first open
cavity. The fin plug may also include a further grub screw adapted to extend into said
second open cavity and to further secure the second tab of the base portion of said fin
within said second open cavity. A benefit of having one or more grub screws in the fin
plug is so that some existing water craft fins, which are made to be received within
existing fin plugs, may also be received and secured by the fin plug of the present
invention.
[034]          It is preferred that the first open cavity and the second open cavity of the
fin plug are separated by a bridge section having an upper surface which is adapted to
abut a lower surface of the water craft fin.      This bridge section enhances the rigidity
and/or strength of the fin plug. Also, by abutting the lower surface of the water craft fin,
this bridge section prevents the lower surface of the fin from being forced down against
other surfaces of the fin plug and/or the water craft (which could over time cause some
damage to the fin, the fin plug and/or the surfboard).
[035]          Typically, the fin plug of this invention will be installed within a surfboard,
such as a stand-up surfboard.
[036]          According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
water craft fin having a base portion adapted to be received within an open cavity of a
fin plug according to the first aspect of this invention (as described above).
[037]          The base portion of the water craft fin preferably includes a side surface
adapted to abut the protruding member of said fin plug. The side surface preferably
includes an inclined surface section adapted to cooperate with the protruding member
so as to cause a force, inwardly into said open cavity, to be applied to said base portion
under the influence of the biasing rod of said fin plug.
[038]          Preferably, the base portion of the water craft fin further includes a fin
section adapted to underlie the ledge portion of said fin plug and to inhibit movement of
said fin when the base portion of said fin is received within the first open cavity.

[039]           The base portion of the water craft fin preferably includes a first tab and a
second tab and the fin plug preferably includes a first open cavity and a second open
cavity, wherein the first tab is adapted to be received within said first open cavity and
the second tab is adapted to be received within said second open cavity.
[040]            It is preferred that the inclined surface section of the base portion of the
water craft fin is located on the first tab.
[041]            It is further preferred that the fin section of the base portion of the water
craft fin is located on the second tab.
[042]           The water craft fin preferably includes a lower surface adapted to abut an
upper surface of the bridge section of the fin plug.
[043]           Typically, the water craft fin described above will be adapted for use in a
surfboard.
[044]           According to a third aspect of this invention, there is provided fin plug and
a water craft fin kit, for use in a surfboard, including a fin plug as described above and a
water craft fin as described above.
[045]           According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
water craft attachment device having a base portion adapted to be received within an
open cavity of a fin plug according to the first aspect of this invention (as described
above).
[046]           The base portion of the water craft attachment device preferably includes
a side surface adapted to abut the protruding member of said fin plug. The side surface
preferably includes an inclined surface section adapted to cooperate with the protruding
member (of the fin plug) so as to cause a force, inwardly into said open cavity, to be
applied to said base portion under the influence of the biasing rod of said fin plug.
[047]            Preferably, the base portion of the water craft attachment device further
includes a nose section adapted to underlie the ledge portion of said fin plug and to
inhibit movement of the water craft attachment device when the base portion of said
attachment device is received within the first open cavity.
[048]           The base portion of the water craft attachment device preferably includes
a first tab and a second tab and the fin plug preferably includes a first open cavity and a

                                                8
second open cavity, wherein the first tab is adapted to be received within said first open
cavity and the second tab is adapted to be received within said second open cavity.
[049]          It is preferred that the inclined surface section of the base portion of the
water craft attachment device is located on the first tab.
[050]          It is further preferred that the nose section of the base portion of the water
craft attachment device is located on the second tab.
[051]          In a particularly preferred embodiment, the water craft attachment device
includes a support connecting element for connecting the attachment device to a
support structure. This support connecting element may include a hook element for
connecting the water craft attachment device to a support rod (e.g. a horizontal support
rod). The support connecting element, such as a hook element, is preferably separated
from the base portion of the water craft attachment device by an intermediate section of
the attachment device.
[052]          In a further, particularly preferred embodiment of this aspect of the
invention, the hook element lies in a plane which is at right angles to the plane of the
first and second tabs.
[053]          The water craft attachment device preferably includes a lower surface
adapted to abut an upper surface of the bridge section of the fin plug.
[054]          Typically, the water craft attachment device described above will be
adapted for use in a surfboard.
[055]          The above preferred embodiment of the fourth aspect of the present
invention enables a water craft attachment device, which includes a hook element, to be
attached to a surfboard (or other water craft), which then enables the surfboard (or other
water craft) to be suspended from a supporting rod (e.g. a horizontal support rod). In
the abovementioned preferred embodiment, in which the hook element lies in a plane
which is at right angles to the plane of the first and second tabs, this enables a multitude
of surfboards to be suspended from the supporting rod in a sandwiched formation,
thereby enabling a greater number of surfboards to be stored on the supporting rod.
[056]          As will be appreciated from the above discussion (and as further explained
and illustrated later in this specification), a water craft fin or other water craft attachment

device, according to the above relevant descriptions, can readily be attached to a fin
plug, according to the above relevant description.
[057]           This attachment is effected, in the case of a water craft fin, by inserting the
base portion of the fin into the first open cavity of the fin plug. This is typically achieved
by engaging a forward portion of the fin (e.g. the fin section) with the fin engagement
means of the fin plug and then rotating a rearward portion of the fin down towards the
fin plug, so that the base portion of the fin extends into the relevant open cavity, thereby
enabling this base portion to abut the protruding means which protrudes into said cavity.
[058]           In the case of another water craft attachment device, such as a hook
element (as described above), the attachment is effected by inserting the base portion
of the attachment device into the first open cavity of the fin plug.          This is typically
achieved by engaging a forward portion of the attachment device (e.g. the nose section
of the base portion of the water craft attachment device) with the fin engagement means
of the fin plug and then rotating a rearward portion of the attachment device down
towards the fin plug, so that the base portion of the attachment device extends into the
relevant open cavity, thereby enabling this base portion to abut the protruding means
which protrudes into said cavity
[059]           There is provided herein a device for holding a first fin portion in a water
craft, the device including: a first cavity having a cavity wall; and, a resilient elongate
member located at least partially along an elongate side of the cavity wall, the resilient
elongate member having an extending portion, the extending portion extending from the
resilient member through a recess in the elongate side of the cavity wall, wherein the
first fin portion is configured to be inserted into the first cavity such that any one or a
combination of the resilient elongate member and the extending portion apply a force to
the first fin portion to hold the first fin portion within the first cavity.
[060]           The resilient elongate member can be a resilient rod and the extending
portion includes a bulbous portion, the bulbous portion being configured to engage with
the first fin portion.
[061]           The bulbous portion can be part of a wheel-like member formed around
the elongate rod, the wheel-like member being configured to rotate about the rod when
engaging with the first fin portion, during installation and/or removal of the fin/first fin

portion, and to hold the first fin portion in the first cavity once the fin/first fin portion is
installed.
[062]         The first fin portion can include a grooved portion (or an inclined portion)
on a side fin surface, the grooved portion (or inclined portion) being configured to
engage with the extending portion.
[063]         A surface of the wheel-like member can be is configured to sit within the
grooved portion (or against the inclined portion).
[064]         The device can include a second cavity, the second cavity including a
protrusion, the protrusion being configured to be received by a corresponding recess of
a second fin portion, to thereby hold the second fin portion within the second cavity.
[065]         Any one or a combination of the protrusion and the recess and, the
extending portion and the first fin portion can snap-lock together.
[066]         The first cavity and the second cavity can be part of one elongate cavity.
[067]         The first cavity and the second cavity can be two distinct cavities formed
within the device.
[068]         The first fin portion and the second fin portion can be first and second
tabs, respectively, the first and second tabs protruding from a base portion of the fin.
[069]         The device can be shaped so as to have a substantially figure-eight
profile.
[070]         The first cavity can be formed within a first end of the figure-eight and the
second cavity is formed within a second end of the figure-eight.
[071]         The device can be integral to the water craft. Alternatively, the device can
be a stand-alone product which can be installed within a water craft during the
manufacture of the craft.
[072]         Thus, the device can be insertable into the water craft as a separate
device.

Detailed description of the embodiment or embodiments
[0156]          An example of a device or fin plug 10 is shown in Figures 1A and 1B.
[0157]           In this particular example, the device 10 is used for holding a first fin
portion 15 in a water craft, such as a surfboard or the like (not shown). The device 10
can be formed such that it is integral or insertable into the water craft.
[0158]          As shown in Figures 1A and 1B, the device 10 can include a first cavity
20, having a cavity wall 25 (and further described below). The device 10 also includes a
resilient elongate member 30, which can be located at least partially along an elongate
side of the cavity wall 25. Figure 1 also shows that the resilient elongate member 30 can
have an extending portion 35, where the extending portion 35 extends from the resilient
member 30 through a recess 40 or aperture in the elongate side of the cavity wall 25,
[0159]          Accordingly, when the first fin portion 15 is inserted into the first cavity 20,
any one or a combination of the resilient elongate member 30 and the extending portion
35 can apply a force to the first fin portion 15 to hold the first fin portion 15 within the
first cavity 20.
[0160]          Thus, in one particular example, the resilient elongate member 30 is a
resilient rod or pin, and the extending portion 35 can includes a bulbous portion 45,
where the bulbous portion 45 is configured to engage with the first fin portion 15. In yet
a further example, the bulbous portion 45 can be a part of a wheel-like member formed
around the elongate rod 30, where the wheel-like member 35 is configured to move
around the rod 30 when engaging with the first fin portion 15, to hold the first fin portion
15 in the first cavity 20.
[0161]           Figures 1A and 1B, for example, show that the rod 30 is a pin, or the like,
which can act as a spring to allow the wheel-like member 35, to act as a barrel, which

P4332AU05
                                               17
can hold the fin 50 in place. Thus the device 10 can be in the form of a box which can
hold the fin and hold the pin in place. Figure 1 also shows that once the rod 30 is
inserted into the device 10, the insertion can be sealed by a end plug 55, or the like.
The plug 55 can prevent the rod 30 moving out of the device 10.
[0162]         Additionally, Figures 1A and 1B also show that the device 10 can include
one or more caps 55, 57, 60, which can be used to seal the extending portion 35 into
the device 10. In one particular example, the end cap 55 is typically water tight and can
hold both the rod 30 and the extending portion 35 therein. The side cap 57 can be
optional, the rod 30 and the extending portion 35 can be installed without the use of an
aperture that side cap 57 seals.
[0163]         According to yet a further example, the first fin portion 15 can also include
a grooved portion 65 on a side fin surface 70. The grooved portion 65 is typically
configured to engage with the extending portion 35. Thus, in one example, a surface of
the wheel-like member 35, which is typically a curved surface, is configured to site
within the grooved portion 65.
[0164]         It will be appreciated that although the grooved portion 65 can be formed
or shaped such that it substantially conforms or mates with the curved surface of the
extending portion 35, strict conformance or mating is not necessary. In these examples,
the grooved portion 65 is configured to roll over the extending portion 35 and the
extending portion 35 can then lock the first fin portion 15 into the first cavity 20. It will
also be appreciated that when the locking action occurs and the first fin portion 15 is
pushed into the cavity, the rod 30 may bend and may remain slightly bent when
applying the force to the extending portion 35, which subsequently applies a force to the
grooved portion 65, in order to maintain the first fin portion 15 within the first cavity 20.
In one particular example, either a lateral or a downward force, or a combination thereof
can be applied to maintain the first fin portion 15 within the device 10.
[0165]         According to one particular example, when inserting the fin 50 into the
device 10, a second fin portion 90 is inserted initially, where the recess 85 on the
second fin portion 90 engages with the protrusion 80 on the device 10 (within the
second cavity 75). Once the second fin portion 90 is in place, the first fin portion 15 is
locked into the first cavity 20 by pushing down on the fin 50 such that the groove 65

P4332AU05
                                               18
engages with the extending portion 35, which is at least partially within the first cavity
20.
[0166]         Thus, in a further example, referring to Figures 1A and 1B, there is
provided herein a fin plug 10 for installation in a water craft (not shown), said fin plug 10
including a first open cavity 20 adapted to receive a base portion 18 of a water craft fin
50; and, a resilient biasing rod 30 and a protruding member (otherwise referred to
herein as an extending portion) 35 cooperating with the biasing rod 30. The protruding
member 35 is adapted / configured to abut the base portion 18 of said fin 50 when
received in said first open cavity 20. Accordingly, the biasing rod 30 and protruding
member 35 are adapted to apply a force to the base portion 18 of said fin 50 to inhibit
removal of said fin 50 from said first open cavity 20.
[0167]         As shown in Figures 1A and 1B, the biasing rod 30, when inserted into the
fin plug 10 is located adjacent the first open cavity 20. According to one particular
example, the biasing rod 30 extends substantially parallel to a side surface 16 of the
base portion 18 of the fin 50. Thus, the protruding member 35 can abut the side surface
16.
[0168]         It will further be appreciated that the fin plug 10 can also include a lateral
cavity 22 where the biasing rod 30 is located within the lateral cavity 22. Thus, the
lateral cavity 22 and the first open cavity 20 are separated by an apertured wall (herein
referred to as the cavity wall) and at a portion of the protruding member 35 protrudes
through an aperture (or recess) 40 in the wall 25 into the first open cavity 20.
[0169]         The side surface 16 can include an inclined surface section (otherwise
described herein as a grooved portion) 65. The inclined surface section 65 is adapted to
cooperate with the protruding member 35 so as to cause a force, inwardly into the first
open cavity 20 to be applied to the base portion 18 under the influence of the biasing
rod 30.
[0170]         According to one particular example, the fin plug 10 can have a forward
region 12 and a rearward region 14. The protruding member 35 is typically located in
the rearward region 14.
[0171]         The fin plug 10 can include an additional fin removal inhibiting means
located in the forward region 12. The fin removal inhibiting means can include a fin

P4332AU05
                                              19
engagement means which includes a ledge portion (referred to herein as the protrusion)
80 which is adapted to overlie a fin section (referred to herein as the recess) 85 and to
inhibit movement of the fin 50 when the base portion 18 is received within the first open
cavity 20.
[0172]         As described herein, the fin plug 10 can include a second open cavity 75.
Accordingly, the first open cavity 20 can receive a first tab of the base portion 18 of the
fin 50 and the second open cavity 75 can receive a second tab of the base portion 18 of
the fin 50. In this particular example, the first open cavity 20 is located in the rearward
region 14 and the second open cavity is located in the forward region 12. And further,
the inclined surface section 65 of the base portion of said fin is located on the first tab.
Additionally, the ledge portion 80 can be located within said second open cavity, and the
fin section can be located on the second tab of the base portion of the fin 50.
[0173]         As shown in Figures 12A to 12H, the ledge portion can include a ledge
extending from one end of said second open cavity and defining a recess between said
ledge and a base surface of said second open cavity, said recess being adapted to
receive the fin section.
[0174]         As discussed herein, the extending portion/protruding member 35 can be
wheel-like or a ring-shaped member located about the biasing rod 30. In one particular
example, the ring-shaped member can rotate about said biasing rod. In yet a further
example, the ring-shaped member does not necessarily have to be cylindrical in shape
and may have a circumferential outer surface extending between two side surfaces,
where the circumferential outer surface has a convex profile between said side
surfaces.
[0175]         In yet a further example, as particularly shown in Figures 2A, 3A, 4A, 4F,
5A, and 5F, the device 10 can also include a second cavity 75. The second cavity 75
can include a protrusion 80, where the protrusion 80 is configured to be inserted into
and mate with a respective recess 85 of a second fin portion 90, to thereby hold the
second fin portion 90 within the second cavity 75.
[0176]         Thus, for example, any one or a combination of the protrusion 80 and the
recess 85; and, the extending portion 35 and the first fin portion 15 can snap-lock
together, and the fin 50 can be held robustly within the device 10.

P4332AU05
                                                20
[0177]           Notably, it will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the second
fin portion 90 can be held within the second cavity 75 by a number of different
mechanical elements/fixing means. Further examples of fixing means for fixing/holding
the second fin portion 90 into a second cavity 75 are described below.
[0178]           In the examples shown in the Figures, the first cavity 15 and the second
cavity 75 are two distinct cavities within the device 10. However, it will be appreciated
that they may in some instances form a part of one elongate cavity (not shown).
Notably, certain advantages may be provided by maintaining the two distinct cavities.
That is, the bridge 95 between the two cavities can be configured to more robustly hold
the first and second fin portions 15, 90 in respective first and second cavities 20, 75.
Furthermore, the bridge can include a bridge section which has an upper surface which
is adapted to abut a lower surface of a water craft fin.
[0179]           It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that many water crafts
such as surfboards or the like can include one or more fins. In one particular example, a
surfboard may include a central fin and two side fins (referred to herein as left and right
fins, when viewing the underside of the surfboard with tail of the surfboard lowermost).
Thus, although the features described herein may be applicable to any fin, the water
craft may include slight variations depending on the location of the fin (whether a central
fin, right fin, or left fin).
[0180]           An example of a variation can be seen when comparing Figures 2C, 4C,
and 5C. In these examples, Figures 2A to 3C represent an example of a central fin 50,
where, as shown in figure 2C, the fin 50 is substantially perpendicular to the device 10.
However, in contrast, the fins 50 of Figures 4C and 5C, are at an angle to the vertical of
the device 10. Figure 4C is an example of a right-side fin, and Figure 5C is an example
of a left side fin. Although the fins described are configured to be inserted at any angle
to the vertical, in one particular example, the angle is 7 to 9 degrees from the vertical.
[0181]           Accordingly, the device 10 may also be varied to accommodate for the
varying angle of insertion. As shown in Figures 4C and 5C, the first cavity 15 may
include an angled opposing wall 28, opposite to the cavity wall 25 (which is typically
cavity wall where the extending portion 35 protrudes there through).
[0182]           In further examples, Figures 6A to 6P show example of a device or fin
plug 10, where in these examples, the device 10 would typically be used for a centre fin.

P4332AU05
                                              21
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that, as shown in figure 6M, the
extending portion 35 protrudes through the cavity wall 25 at a position where it can
easily mate with the corresponding grooved portion 65 of the fin 50. Thus, the extending
portion 35 need not necessarily protrude through at the centre of the cavity wall 25, and
can, according to this particular example, be offset from the centre.
[0183]         Additionally, the device 10 shows fixation points 98 for fixing of grub
screws or any other suitable fixing means, or the like, for further fixing the fin 50 to the
device 10. It will be appreciated that the use of the grub screws or other suitable fixing
means can allow for different types of fins to be fixed to the device 10. Thus in this
particular example, the grub screw can be configured to extend into the first cavity 20 to
further secure a base portion of the fin 50 within the first cavity 20. A similar grub screw
can be used for the second cavity 75 where a grub screw is configured to extend into
the second cavity 75 to further secure a tab, base portion, or the like of the fin 50 into
the second cavity 75.
[0184]         Figures 7A to 7D are examples of the device 10 for use with a right side
fin. Furthermore, Figures 8A to 8D are examples of the device 10 for use with a left side
fin. Of particular note from these figures, it will be appreciated that the examples show
that the devices when used for the side fins (such as the left and right fins) can be
formed such that they are mirror images of each other. Furthermore, Figures 7B and 8B
show the angled opposing wall 28, to allow for an angled insertion of the respective fins.
[0185]         In the examples shown herein, the device 10 is shaped substantially as a
figure-eight, such that at least one profile of the device has substantially, a figure-eight
shape. In these examples, the first cavity 15 is located or formed within a first end 12 of
the figure-eight and the second cavity 75 is formed within the second end 14 of the
figure-eight.
[0186]         It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the figure-eight
shape of the device 10 can provide advantages such allowing for the device 10 to form
part of the water craft and further allowing the fin portions to be locked therein. The
smooth edges of the figure-eight shape can also provide for an easier manufacturing
process. However, it will be appreciated that the device is not limited to this shape and
other shapes which provide the functionality of the cavities, are incorporated herein.

[0187]         Figures 9A to 9H show examples of a centre fin 50, for use with a centre
device 10. Figures 10A to 10D show examples of a right fin 50, and Figures 11A to 11 D
show an example of a left fin 50. Notably, the left and right fins may be mirror images of
each other.
[0188]         Notably, referring to the fins 50, it will further be appreciated that although
the first fin portion 15 and the second fin portion 90 can be or can include first and
second tabs respectively, it will be appreciated that any base portion of the fin 50 may
be configured to be insertable into the first and second cavities 20, 75.
[0189]      Further examples of fixing means for the second fin portion 90 and the
second cavity 75 are shown in Figures 12A to 27B. Thus, in these examples the
following variations are shown in the following paragraphs.
[0190]      Figure 12A shows the second fin portion 90 having a convex edge 1210,
mating with a corresponding concave portion 1212 of the second cavity 75.
[0191]      Figure 12B shows the second fin portion 90 having a concave edge 1214,
mating with a corresponding concave portion 1216 of the second cavity 75.
[0192]      Figure 12C shows a different concave edge 1218 on the second fin portion
90, mating with a protruding convex portion 1220 in the second cavity 75.
[0193]      Figure 12D shows a variation of Figure 12A where the second fin portion 90
has a slanted convex edge 1222 with a corresponding second cavity geometry 1224.
[0194]      Figure 12E shows an entire top edge of the second fin portion 90 being cut
away 1226 and mating with a corresponding convex edge 1228 of the second cavity 75.
[0195]      Figure 12F shows a groove 1230 or the like cut in the sides of the fin tab nose
1232 and being configured to correspond with pins 1234 from both sides of the second
cavity 75.
[0196]      Figure 12G shows a single pin 1236 being configured to be inserted into the
second fin portion 90 to hold the fin portion 90 within the second cavity 75.
[0197]      Figure 12H shows a rounded bottom edge 1238 of the second fin portion 90,
protruding and mating with a corresponding convex portion 1240 of the second cavity
75.

[0198]     Figures 13A to 13C show the insertion of the second fin portion 90 into the
second cavity 75, where the second fin portion 90 has a spring-loaded undercut 1310.
In these examples, the undercut 1310 retracts when the second fin portion 90 is
inserted into the second cavity 75 (as shown in Figure 13B), and then springs into a
corresponding recess 1312 within the second cavity 75 when the fin portion 90 is in
place (as shown in Figure 13C).
[0199]     Figures 14A to 14C show the insertion of two pins 1410 on the second fin
portion 90 into the second fin cavity 75, where the two pins surround a convex portion of
the second cavity 75. The pins may also be formed from the undercutting of the fin tab
nose.
[0200]     Figures 15A to 15C show a further example of flexes 1510 or deformable
members 1510 inserted in the second fin portion 90 to create an undercut which then
mates by deforming with a corresponding shape 1512 of the second cavity 75.
[0201]     In Figures 16A to 18C the front tab 90 detail in engaging with the second
cavity 75 not only uses a variation in undercut profile to secure the front tab but also has
the secondary function of creating a prescribed entry and exit angle for the fin into the
fin plug. This secondary function may make it more difficult for a fin to release from a fin
plug unintentionally during surfing if configured as per Figures 16A to 18C.
[0202]     Figures 16A to 16C show an example sequence of inserting the second fin
portion 90 into the second cavity 75 by the use of an oval pin 1610. The fin plug second
cavity 75 with the oval pin 1610 that may only allow the front fin tab 90 to release when
the corresponding oval shaped recess in the front fin tab 90 is aligned in the direction of
intended release, as shown by way of example in Figures 16A to 16C.
[0203]     Figures 17A to 17D show an example sequence of the use of a pin 1710 in
the tab 90 and a track 1712 mechanism to insert the second fin portion 90 into the
second cavity 75. The track 1712 can be located in the side wall of the second cavity
75.
[0204]     Figures 18A to 18C shows the use of another mating of a concave portion
1810 in the second fin portion 90 with a convex portion 1812 of the second cavity 75.

[0205]      Figure 19 is an example of the use of two shallow static pins 1910 protruding
from either side of the second cavity 75 side walls . The two pins 1910 each mate with
respective shallow grooves 1920 of the second fin portion 90 as shown in Figure 19.
[0206]      Figure 20 shows an example where the rear fin tab 15 has a geometry or cut
out so as not to engage with the barrel 35. In this example the front tab cut out 2010 is
also configured to not engage with a protrusion 2012. The fin of Figure 20 may be fixed
into the fin plug by use of fixing means such as grub screws in the fixation points 98 of
the fin plug.
[0207]      Figures 21, 23 and 24 show examples of various shaped cut-outs 2110 of the
second fin portion 90 which then mate with corresponding shaped protrusions 2112 of
the second cavity 75.
[0208]      Figure 22 shows an extension 2210 of the baseline of the second fin portion
90 to be inserted into a corresponding cutout 2212 in the second cavity 75.
[0209]      Figures 25A to 25C show a sequence for a rear fin tab 15 configuration that
may allow the fin tabs 15, 90 to be lowered into their respective cavities 20, 75 and then
the fin pushed forward so that the rear fin tab 15 engages with the barrel 35. The rear
tab geometry of Figures 25A to 25C may be modified (not shown) to facilitate engaging
with the barrel 35 in this alternate embodiment.
[0210]      Figures 26A and 26B illustrate the securing of a fin to the fin plug where the
fin has no rear fin tab. In this situation the front fin tab 90 may engage with the second
cavity 75 as shown with protrusion 2512 and corresponding recess 2510 or the
engagement may be as described herein elsewhere. In addition the fin of Figures 26A
and 26B may be further securred into the fin plug by use of fixing means such as grub
screws in the fixation points 98 of the fin plug.
[0211]      Figures 27A and 27B show a further example to FIGURE 20 where the rear
fin tab 15 also has a geometry or cut-out so as not to engage with the barrel 35. The
front fin tab 90 may engage with the second cavity 75 via different shaped cutouts 2510
in the second fin portion 90 mating with a corresponding protrusion 2512 of the second
cavity 75. In addition the fin of Figures 27A and 27B may be further securred into the fin
plug by use of fixing means such as grub screws in the fixation points 98 of the fin plug.

[0212]          Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the engagement means described
herein, which is typically used to hold the second tab portion within the second cavity,
can be of any form and can also include any attachment means such as magnets, or
even a second biasing means (such as the rod and wheel-like member of the first
cavity).
[0213]          In yet further examples, the device/fin plug described herein can be
configured to receive an adapted fin. For example, the fin portion or base portion on the
adapted fin, can be a separate element which is insertable as an adapter over a fin, in
order to then be able to insert the fin into the device/fin plug as described herein.
Example adaptors are shown in Figures 28A to 28C. In Figures 28A1 and 28A2, the first
adaptor 2810 can be screwed in to the base of a tab-less fin. Alternatively in figures
28B1 and 28B2 the first adapter piece 2810 can be screwed in to the side of the tabs on
a two-tab fin. Accordingly, in both instances, the geometry of the proposed new tab
configuration is added through this extension. In yet a further example, as shown in
Figures 28C1 and 28C2, two holes can be drilled through the sides of the tabs on an
existing 2-tab fin. Then, two pins (or plugs) 2812, 2814 can be screwed or press fitted in
to place to form second and third adapter pieces. The result is two protruding pins from
the sides of the tabs (the front pin 2814 nesting under the front undercut area of the box
front slot whilst the rear pin 2812 interacts with the barrel which applies a downward and
lateral force).
[0214]          Although the fin plug of the first aspect of this invention is primarily
intended to be used with water craft fins (e.g. surfboard fins) of the second aspect of
this invention, so as to enable such fins to be easily and conveniently attached to, or
detached from the fin plug (without the use of a tool), it is not limited to such use. For
instance, other water craft attachment devices can be selectively attached to, or
detached from, the        relevant fin   plug   in substantially the   same way as the
abovementioned fins are attached or detached.
[0215]          An example of such other water craft attachment devices is the hook
device 100 shown in Figures 29A to 29H.           As will readily be appreciated, this hook
device is adapted to be connected to a surfboard (or other water craft) so that the
surfboard (or other water craft) can be suspended from a horizontal supporting rod (or
similar structure).

P4332AU05
                                                26
[0216]          This hook device 100 has a first end 101 and a second end 102. A hook
element 103 is located adjacent the first end 101 and a connection portion 105 is
located adjacent the second end 102. An intermediate portion 106 is located between
the hook element 104 and the connection portion 105.
[0217]          The hook element 103 comprises a plurality of perforations 104. A benefit
of the perforations is that they reduce the weight of the device and less material is
required when the device is manufactured (resulting in cost savings).
[0218]          The connection portion 105 comprises a first tab 115 and a second tab
190. The first tab 115 and the second tab 190 are adapted to be inserted into the first
cavity 20 and the second cavity 75 (respectively) of the fin plug 10.
[0219]          The first tab includes a grooved portion 165. This grooved portion 165 is
located on a side surface 170 of the first tab 115. The grooved portion 165 is typically
configured to engage with the extending portion 35 of the fin plug 10. Thus, in one
example, a surface of the wheel-like member 35, which is typically a curved surface, is
configured to site within the grooved portion 165.
[0220]          It will be appreciated that although the grooved portion 165 can be formed
or shaped such that it substantially conforms or mates with the curved surface of the
extending portion 35 (of the fin plug 1), strict conformance or mating is not necessary. In
this example, the grooved portion 165 is configured to roll over the extending portion 35
(of the fin plug 1) and the extending portion 35 can then lock the first tab 115 into the
first cavity 20. It will also be appreciated that when the locking action occurs and the first
tab 115 is pushed into the cavity, the rod 30 may bend and may remain slightly bent
when applying the force to the extending portion 35, which subsequently applies a force
to the grooved portion 165, in order to maintain the first tab 115 within the first cavity 20.
In one particular example, either a lateral or a downward force, or a combination thereof
can be applied to maintain the first tab 115 within the fin plug 10.
[0221]          The second tab 190 includes a recess 185. This recess 185 is adapted to
engage with the protrusion 80 on the device 10 (within the second cavity 75).
[0222]          According to one particular example, when inserting the hook device 100
into the fin plug 10, the second tab 190 is inserted initially, where the recess 185 on the
second tab 190 engages with the protrusion 80 on the fin plug 10 (within the second

P4332AU05
                                                27
cavity 75). Once the second tab 190 is in place, the first tab 115 is locked into the first
cavity 20 by pushing down on the hook device 100 such that the groove 165 engages
with the extending portion 35 (of the fin plug 1), which is at least partially within the first
cavity 20.
[0223]         As can be seen from the drawings, the plane of the hook element 103 is at
right angles (normal to) the plane of the connection portion 105. The effect of this is
that, when a surfboard is connected to the hood device 100 (via the connection portion
105), the substantial plane of the surfboard will be substantially parallel to the plane of
the hook element 103, thereby enabling a plurality of surfboards to be suspended from
a supporting rod, in a sandwich-type formation (which results in improved space
efficiencies).
[0224]         A fifth aspect of the invention is the infills illustrated in figures 30A to 35C.
The infills can be of two types, compatibility infills and full plug infills. A compatibility infill
as illustrated in figures 30A to 32E can be used to fill in gaps or voids remaining
between a fin and the first and / or second cavities 20, 75 of the fin plug 10. Such gaps
can occur with the use of fins which were not originally intended for use with the fin
plugs 10 as described here. For example fins as described with respect to figures 28A
to 28C with the use of adapters or other fins that can be used with the fin plug 10. The
compatibility infill by filling a gap or a void of the fin plug 10 with the fin can improve the
hydrodynamic performance about the fin and the fin plug, for example reduced
hydrodynamic drag. The compatibility infill can also be used to exclude foreign matter
such as sand from the fin plug 10 as well as improving the aesthetic appeal of the fin
plug, the fin and the surfboard / water craft overall.
[0225]         Figures 30A to 30E are respective elevational views of rear, side, front,
top and bottom for a center fin compatibility infill 3010. Figures 30F to 301 are
corresponding perspective illustrations of the center fin compatibility infill 3010 where an
exterior surface 3012, a side surface 3014, a front surface profile 3016, a rear surface
profile 3018 and a bottom surface 3020 are shown. The front surface profile 3016 is
adapted to engage with a fin engagement means 80 or ledge portion 80 in the second
cavity 75 of the fin plug 10, described in detail with respect to figures 32A to 32E.
[0226]         Figures 31 A to 31 E are respective elevational views of rear, side, front,
top and bottom for a side fin compatibility infill 3110. Figures 31F to 311 are

P4332AU05
                                               28
corresponding perspective illustrations of the side fin compatibility infill 3110 where an
exterior surface 3112, a side surface 3114, a front surface profile 3116, a rear surface
profile 3118 and a bottom surface 3120 are shown. The front surface profile 3116 is
configured as described above for the center fin compatibility infill 3010. The rear profile
3118 exists to replicate the front profile 3116 on the alternate side fin plug, that is the
"front" profile 3116 performs the same function on the left hand fin plug as the "rear"
profile 3118 performs on the right hand fin plug. This allows a single moulded part 3110
to be used in either the right or left side fin plugs by simply flipping or otherwise rotating
the side fin infill 3110.
[0227]          Figures 32A to 32E show a sequence of fitting the center fin compatibility
infill 3010 into the fin plug 10 with another fin 3210 not originally designed for the fin
plug 10. The infill 3010 is inserted into the second cavity 75 as shown in figure 32B so
that the front surface 3016 of the infill engages with the fin engagement means 80. The
infill 3010 is then pressed into the second cavity 75 until the exterior surface 3012 of the
infill 3010 is approximately flush with the top or exterior surface 3220 of the fin plug 10.
Figure 32C shows the infill installed into the forward region 12 of the second cavity 75.
The press fitting of the infill 3010 is aided by selecting a material for the infill such as
silicone rubber so that the rubber deforms for press fitting then reforms within the
second cavity 75 to secure the infill 3010 within the second cavity 75. The selection of
silicone rubber is also advantageous for its resistance to corrosion in the marine
environment. Other suitable materials for the infill can be a thermoplastic polyurethane
(TPU), a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), a polypropylene (PP) or other suitable
materials as determined by a person skilled in the art. In figures 32D and 32E the front
90 and rear 15 tabs of the other fin 3210 are shown being respectively inserted into the
second 75 and first 20 cavities. The front tab 90 of the fin 3210 can also engage with
the rear surface profile 3018 of the infill 3010 by press fitting, deformity and reforming of
the infill 3010. It will be readily appreciated that the rear surface profile 3018 of the infill
can be shaped or otherwise adapted so as to aid securing with the front tab 90. The fin
3210 can also be secured to the fin plug 10 as described previously above.
[0228]          The fitting of the side fin compatibility infill 3110 together with another side
fin can also be done in a similar manner to that described for the center fin compatibility
infill 3010.

P4332AU05

[0229]           Figures 33 to 35 illustrate full plug infills to completely fill in the first 20 and
second 75 cavities of the fin plug 10 when a fin is not present, as shown in figure 35C.
The use of the full plug infills can be to improve the hydrodynamic performance, exclude
foreign matter and improve aesthetic appeal as described above for the compatibility
infills. Full plug infills can be particularly useful for surfboards that are capable of varying
their multi-fin setup, for example a tri-fin and quad-fin set-ups in the one tri-quad fin
surfboard. Tri-quad fin surfboards can have five fin plugs. The redundant one or two fin
plugs, depending on whether a respective quad-fin or tri-fin setup is used, can be filled
in with full plug infill/s. It will be readily appreciated that many multiple fin set-up
surfboards can have redundant fin plug cavities for some fin set-ups.
[0230]           Figures 33A to 33E are respective elevational views of rear, side, front,
bottom and top for a center fin full plug infill 3310 for the first cavity 20 of the fin plug 10.
Figures 33F to 331 are corresponding perspective illustrations of the center fin full plug
infill 3310 where an exterior surface 3312, a side surface 3314, a front surface profile
3316, a rear surface profile 3318 and a bottom surface 3320 are shown. A small,
circular boss or protuberance 3322 on the side 3314 of the full plug infill 3310 can be
present to aid in securing the infill 3310 in a cavity 20 of the fin plug. The infill 3310 also
features a vertical member 3324 which can aid in removing the infill 3310 from the first
cavity 20 as well as aiding with the flush installation of the infill 3310, described below
with respect to figures 35A to 35C.
[0231]           Figures 34A to 34E are respective elevational views of rear, side, front,
bottom and top for a center fin full plug infill 3410 for the second cavity 75 of the fin plug
10. Figures 34F to 341 are corresponding perspective illustrations of the center fin full
plug infill 3410 where an exterior surface 3412, a side surface 3414, a front surface
profile 3416, a rear surface profile 3418 and a bottom surface 3420 are shown. A small,
circular boss or protuberance 3322 on the side 3414 of the full plug infill 3410 can also
be present to aid in securing the infill 3410 in the second cavity 75 of the fin plug 10.
The infill 3410 also features two vertical members 3424, 3426 which can aid in
removing the infill 3310 from the first cavity 20 as well as aiding with the flush
installation of the infill 3310, described below with respect to figures 35A to 35C. The
two vertical members 3424, 3426 can also be joined together at their respective bottom
ends as shown in the figures. The joint between the two vertical members can also be

                                                    30
the location of the boss 3322; alternatively the boss 3322 may be placed on either of the
vertical members 3424, 3426.
[0232]            It will be readily appreciated that full plug infills can also be designed and
made for side fin plugs.
[0233]            Figures 35A to 35C show a sequence of fitting the two full plug infills 3310,
3410 into the fin plug 10. The full plug infills 3310, 3410 are pressed into their respective
cavities 20, 75 until the exterior surfaces 3312, 3412 of both infills 3310, 3410 are
approximately flush with the top or exterior surface 3220 of the fin plug 10. As described
above the press fitting of the infills is aided by selecting a material for the infill such that
the material deforms for press fitting then reforms within the cavities 20, 75 to secure
the infills 3310, 3410. The selection of materials for the full plug infills can also be as
described above for the compatibility infills. In addition the boss 3322 can also provide
further securing within the cavities 20, 75. The use of the vertical members 3324, 3424,
3426 for the full plug infills 3310, 3410 allows the full plug infills to be removed from the
fin plug 10 by depressing the exterior surface 3412 of the full plug infills to allow at least
part of the full plug infill to rise above the exterior surface 3220 of the fin plug 10. The
full plug infills can then be easily removed manually.
[0234]           The full plug infills can alternatively be made in a fuller profile so as to fill
the cavities more completely and more securely. In this alternative embodiment the full
plug infills can be removed with the aid of a tool and/or fingernail.
[0235]            Notably, it will be appreciated that although many different materials can
be used for the device 10, it can be formed of ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, or
any other plastics) or Zytel. The side cap 57, cap 60 and end plug 55 can also be
formed of the same material. The rod 30 is typically formed of any elastic material such
as high grade stainless steel or titanium, which is also a robust material in watercraft as
the material does not generally degrade or rust. The same robust material may also be
used for the extending portion 35.         It will further be appreciated that the device 10 can
be injection molded.
[0236]            It will also be appreciated that the hook device 100 can be formed from
many different materials. Typically, this device will be formed from appropriate plastic
materials which are relatively inexpensive and sufficiently strong for suspending a
