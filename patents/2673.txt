recovery in a patient with disuse atrophy triggered by reduced mobility due to a hip fracture
and consequent major surgery, which employ a therapeutically effective amount of a
myostatin antagonist, e.g., a myostatin binding molecule, e.g., a myostatin antibody or an
ActRil receptor binding molecule, an ActRil receptor antibody, such as the bimagrumab
antibody.

METHODS OF IMPROVING OR ACCELERATING PHYSICAL RECOVERY AFTER
SURGERY FOR HIP FRACTURE
This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2015249396, the entire
content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
This disclosure is in the field of myostatin antagonists, e.g., myostatin binding molecules or
Activin receptor IIB (ActRIIB) binding molecules, e.g., an antagonist antibody to ActRIIB, e.g.,
bimagrumab. In particular, it relates to the improvement or acceleration of recovery after
surgical treatment of hip fracture (or hip fracture surgery) and to novel dosing regimens used
for this indication, which employ a therapeutically effective amount of an ActRII antagonist,
e.g., an Activin receptor II (ActRII) binding molecule, e.g., an anti-Activin receptor II (ActRII)
antibody, such as bimagrumab.
BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
Myostatin, a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-p) superfamily, is a
secreted protein that negatively regulates skeletal muscle mass in animals and humans
throughout the lifecycle. Myostatin acts via the activin receptor type II (mainly via ActRIIB)
and its proposed signaling is through the SMAD 2/3 pathway, which is involved in the
inhibition of protein synthesis, and myocyte differentiation and proliferation.        Myostatin
inhibition or genetic ablation increases muscle mass and strength (Lee et al 2005, Lee and
McPherron 2001, Whittemore et al 2003).
Bimagrumab (BYM338) or is a monoclonal antibody developed to bind competitively to activin
receptor type II (ActRII) with greater affinity than myostatin or activin, its natural ligands.
Bimagrumab is a fully human antibody (modified IgG1, 234-235-Ala-Ala, X2 ) which binds to
the ligand binding domain of ActRII, thereby preventing binding and subsequent signaling of
its ligands, including myostatin and activin that act as natural inhibitors of skeletal muscle
growth. Myostatin, a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B) superfamily, is a
secreted protein that negatively regulates skeletal muscle mass in animals and humans.
Myostatin signaling occurs at ActRII and its proposed mechanism of action is through the
Smad 2/3 pathway to inhibit protein synthesis and myocyte differentiation and proliferation.
Myostatin inhibition or genetic ablation increases muscle mass and strength (Lee et al 2005;
Lee and McPherron 2001; Whittemore et al 2003).

   WO 2015/162590                                                                PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                   2
     Bimagrumab is cross-reactive with human and mouse ActRIIB and effective on human,
     cynomolgus, mouse         and rat skeletal muscle cells. Bimagrumab           is formulated   for
     intravenous (i.v.) administration.
 5
     Myostatin, ActRIIB Receptor and ActRIIB receptor antibodies
     Bimagrumab, also known as BYM338, is a human monoclonal antibody developed to bind
     competitively to activin receptor type II B (ActRIIB) with greater affinity than myostatin, its
10   principal natural ligand.       Bimagrumab      is disclosed    in W02010/125003,      which    is
     incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Myostatin, a member of the transforming
     growth factor beta (TGF-p) superfamily, is a secreted protein that negatively regulates
     skeletal muscle mass in animals and humans, throughout the lifecycle. Myostatin signaling
     occurs at ActRIIB and its proposed mechanism of action is through the Smad 2/3 pathway
15   to inhibit protein synthesis and myocyte differentiation and proliferation. The absence of
     myostatin in developing animals and humans results in a hypermuscular phenotype with an
     increased number and size of muscle fibers. Reducing the level of myostatin postpartum
     results in the hypertrophy of skeletal muscle due to an increase in the size of existing
     myofibers. In the adult, myostatin is produced in skeletal muscle and circulated in the blood
20   in part as a latent inactive complex.
     Consistent with the role of myostatin as an endogenous inhibitor of skeletal muscle mass,
     bimagrumab dramatically increased skeletal muscle mass in preclinical murine models of
     disuse and steroid-induced atrophy and in toxicology studies with healthy cynomolgus
25   monkeys. In addition, the increased mass in mouse and rat resulted in a corresponding
     increase in muscle strength (force production). Following i.v. and s.c. administration to mice
     and cynomolgus monkey, bimagrumab showed a consistent IgG1 pharmacokinetic (PK)
     profile with target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) and was well tolerated.
30   An analysis of the six dose levels of the first in human, single ascending dose study,
     suggests that single i.v. doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg of bimagrumab are safe,
     well tolerated, and produce a PK profile that is predictable from modeled preclinical data. At
     four weeks doses of 3-30 mg/kg result in a measurable increase in thigh muscle volume of
     2.7-5.2% from baseline over placebo.
35
     Role of body composition in the determination of mobility and hip fracture risk
     It is well established that even in the healthy elderly, declines in muscle strength cannot fully
     be explained by loss of skeletal muscle mass (Frontera et al 2000, Vandervoort 2002).

   WO 2015/162590                                                                  PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                   3
     Further, maintenance or even gains in muscle mass do not necessarily prevent the loss of
     muscle strength (Goodpaster et al 2006); and the force produced by skeletal muscle per
     unit of muscle mass decreases with advancing age (Goodpaster et al 2006; Brooks and
     Faulkner 1994). While these facts do not diminish the importance of maintaining muscle
 5   mass during aging, they do underscore that there is more than the loss of muscle tissue to
     understand and treat to address age-related decline in mobility.
              In addition to loss of muscle mass, there is also infiltration of muscle tissue by lipids
     and other non-contractile components. Emerging evidence suggests that skeletal muscle
     lipid content directly influences muscle strength and mobility function (Goodpaster et al
10   2001; Visser et ai 2002) as well as the increased risk of future mobility loss in older men
     and women (Visser et ai 2005). Beavers et ai (2013) showed that high/increasing inter
     muscular adipose tissue (IMAT) area in the thigh, as well as the decreasing total thigh
     muscle area, is an important predictor of walking speed decline. Baseline thigh IMAT
     predicts the annual gait speed decline in both men and women. In longitudinal analyses,
15   changes in thigh IMAT and total thigh muscle are the only body-composition measures that
     predict gait-speed decline in both men and women (Figure 1).
     Age-related adipose infiltration of muscle tissue as well as reduced muscle strength
     combined with reduced lower extremity performance confer increased risk of outcomes,
20   such as loss of mobility, falls, and skeletal fractures, including hip fracture (Lang et a 2010).
          Mechanisms underlying the impact of intermuscular fat mass on skeletal muscle
     Mechanisms underlying the links between increased IMAT and walking speed decline may
     include the endocrine nature of adipose tissue. Excessive fat accumulation in the muscle
25   may be associated with excessive secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (Fanuzzi et al
     2005). Chronic inflammation is associated with lower muscle strength (Vsser et al 2002),
     and predicts disability in older adults (Verg.hese et al 2011), potentially as a result of
     impaired muscle-fiber contractility (Pahor & Kritchevsky 1998). Excessive adiposity may
     also down-regulate the anabolic actions of insulin, testosterone and growth hormone
30   (Chevalier et al 2006, Schaap et al 2005, Waters et al 2008), all of which may contribute to
     muscle loss and functional decline.
          Changes of body composition after hip fracture
     Clinical   observations indicate that elderly subjects sustaining a             hip fracture  and
35   subsequently undergoing major surgery for fracture repair are subject to additional rapid
     changes in body composition, in a vicious cycle due to exacerbating postoperative mobility
     limitations (VVehren et ai 2005; D'Adamo et ai 2014). The immediate or rapidly evolving
     changes include neurogenic muscle weakness, skeletal muscle loss (disuse atrophy),

   WO 2015/162590                                                                 PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                   4
     increase in fat mass and accelerated bone loss (D'Adamo et al 2014. Fox et al 2000,
     Daguet et al 2011). Importantly, these changes can be apparent from as early as Day 10
     and can reach maximum by approximately 2 months after surgery.
              Collectively, the acute complication of frailty and fragility - hip fracture - further
 5   worsens body composition that contributed to the occurrence of the complication in the first
     place. In addition, it diminishes the rate and magnitude of postoperative functional recovery,
     which in turn increases the risk of mobility-related complications (injurious falls, fractures,
     and related re-hospitalizations). The net result of this vicious cycle is the alarming mortality
     rate of patients after hip fracture, ranging from 8.4-36% during the first year (Abrahamsen et
10   ai 2009).
          Early need for preventing postoperative complications
     Importantly, the bulk of complications tend to occur in the first 6 months after surgery
     increasing the need for measures that can both accelerate and increase the magnitude of
15   general mobility to prevent mobility-related complications, re-hospitalizations and ultimately
     decrease the fairly high mortality rate in this population.
          Unmet medical needs
     Current standard of care encompassing dietary measures (protein, vitamin D and Ca
20   supplementation),      early post-op mobilization and resistance training        combined with
     antiresorptive    therapies    leave  considerable   room for     optimization. Compliance     to
     rehabilitation    is   limited   and   the  effect   of  current    pharmacological     treatment
     (bisphosphonates, denosumab, vitamin D) is relatively small and slow in onset.
25        Requirements to the ideal pharmacological agent
     In light of these demands, there is a definite unmet need for a pharmacological agent that
     can accelerate and boost the efficacy of current standard of care without posing significant
     safety issues in this frail population with common presence of comorbidities. Thus, the ideal
     drug candidate would fulfill the following requirements:
30
              A. Can rapidly achieve maximal benefits in terms of reversing the adverse
                  alterations of body composition
              B. Can induce muscle mass changes that are clinically meaningful, which can
                  translate into increases in muscle strength and physical performance
35            C. Can substantially reduce fat infiltration of skeletal muscle thereby improving
                  muscle quality and improvement of muscle strength and mobility
              D. No significant safety or tolerability issues limiting the delivery of the intended 6
                  months treatment

   WO 2015/162590                                                              PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 5
          Evidence    that bimagrumab       has the best chances to deliver on those               3
          requirements
     Applicant has evidence that of the current approaches to prevent myostatin signaling (anti
 5   myostatin antibody, soluble activin receptor type IIB, and antibody against cell-bound activin
     type II receptors), activin receptor antagonism is providing the best balance between
     efficacy and safety (highest benefit/risk ratio), hence being able to induce rapid and
     substantial muscle growth with concomitant decreases in inter-muscular adipose tissue (i.e.
     improved muscle quality), which are both contribute directly to improvements of muscle
10   contraction and ultimately mobility.
                       Preclinical evidence
     ActRil blockade induces the largest increases in muscle mass
     The applicant has investigated whether inhibition of other ligands that signal via ActRII were
15   playing a significant role in the hypertrophy induced by bimagrumab by comparing the
     antibody with an inhibitor that neutralizes only myostatin in the circulation (Lach-Trifilieff
     2014). For this purpose a stabilized myostatin propeptide (D76A) was used, which was
     validated to be a myostatin-specific inhibitor. Both bimagrumab and the myostatin
     propeptide were administered weekly for 5 weeks to young SCID mice; bimagrumab was
20   administered at 10 mg/kg, and the myostatin propeptide was administered at 30 mg/kg.
              Body weight increased throughout the treatment period, reaching significance upon
     bimagrumab treatment only (36% versus 15% for myostatin propeptide). The 15% increase
     induced by the myostatin propeptide is in line with that described in a prior publication
     (Trendelenburg et al 2009); the ActRII antibody was over 2-fold more efficacious (Figure 2,
25   left panel). Muscle weights increased significantly in most muscles examined, with more
     pronounced increases demonstrated with bimagrumab (Figure 2, middle panel). This
     greater increase in total muscle mass was further corroborated by analyzing the fiber cross
     sectional area distribution, demonstrating that the factors were acting by increasing fiber
     diameter, as opposed to fiber number (Figure 2, right panel).
30
     The considerably higher efficacy of activin type II receptor blockade versus neutralization of
     the circulating myostatin pool clearly demonstrates that there are ligands beyond myostatin
     that are able to promote muscle loss via activin type IB receptors.
35
     The third approach to blocking myostatin signaling is by the soluble activin type IIB receptor
     trap/decoy (ActRIIB-Fc) that can capture all possible ligands of this receptor in the
     circulation, including myostatin. The efficacy of this approach in terms of induction of muscle

   WO 2015/162590                                                               PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                  6
     growth is probably comparable with that of bimagrumab. Results from a Phase 2 study with
     the ActRIIB-Fc (ACE-031) on boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy showed an increase
     in LBM and attenuation of declines in TMV and the six-minute walk distance (Campbell et al
     2012). However, observations of reversible nosebleeds and skin telangiectasias in the
 5   healthy volunteer MAD study as well as in the Phase 2 muscular dystrophy study have led
     to the termination of these trials and the clinical development of this pharmacological
     approach (Smith and Lin 2013). The fundamental difference of bimagrumab from this latter
     approach is that it only blocks ligand trafficking through receptors on the target tissue (e.g.
     muscle) and does not eliminate the opportunity of circulating ligands from reaching their
10   own alternative receptors to exert effects which may be critical for safety (e.g. the signaling
     of BMPs through ActRIIB located on skeletal muscle will be blocked but BMP can reach and
     signal through their own BMP receptors, which is not an option with the decoy that prevents
     action).
15   Although the activin receptor IIB trap can evoke muscle volume increases comparable with
     those evoked by blockade of the membrane-bound ActRIIB, and results from a Phase 2
     study with the ActRIIB-Fc (ACE-031) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy boys showed an
     increase in lean body mass and attenuation of declines in thigh muscle volume and six
     minute walk distance (Campbell et al 2012), the observation of reversible nosebleeds and
20   skin telangiectasias in the healthy volunteer MAD study as well as in the Phase 2 muscular
     dystrophy study has led to the termination of these trials (Smith and Lin 2013). The
     fundamental difference between the two approaches is that while the ActRIIB-Fc captures
     and neutralizes all possible ligands of the receptor in the circulation preventing their binding
     to other possible target receptors, bimagrumab only blocks ligand trafficking through the
25   ActRIIB on target tissue (e.g. muscle). For example BMPs that bind to ActRIIB may
     continue to signal through their BMP receptors.
     Responsiveness to ActRil inhibition in younger and older animals
     Animal studies demonstrated that a single administration of bimagrumab at 20mg/kg IV.
30   significantly increased body weight over 2-3 weeks in both 6 and 21 month old rats pointing
     to promotion of anabolic muscle actions. This was indeed confirmed by MRI-based
     evaluation of hind leg muscle volume, which demonstrated that a single dose bimagrumab
     administration promoted muscle hypertrophy in both 6 and 21 month old rats (Figure 3).
35   The hypertrophic action of bimagrumab was prominent 2 weeks after the single
     administration of the compound, where it reached a 13-15% increase over the control
     group. Importantly, the maximal response to bimagrumab was similar in 6 and 21 month old
     rats, demonstrating that old animals are still equally responsive to ActRII inhibition and able

   WO 2015/162590                                                             PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                  7
     to generate the same volume increase in skeletal muscle as young animals when compared
     in a parallel setting.
                     Clinical evidence
 5   Reversal of disuse atrophy in healthy young volunteers: Full-length leg casting
     model
     The applicant has evidence that bimagrumab is capable of triggering rapid reversal of
     disuse-associated muscle loss in young healthy volunteers (average age 24 years) who
     underwent full-length casting of one leg for 2 weeks. This immobilization (i.e. deactivation of
10   muscles) induced rapid muscle loss of -5%      in the course of 2 weeks. A single i.v. dose of
     bimagrumab (30 mg/kg) yielded almost full recovery (to -0.8% of pre-casting) of thigh
     muscle volume within 2 weeks after cast removal, whereas it took seemingly 12 weeks to
     return to baseline for the group that recovered muscle mass just by returning to normal daily
     activities (no targeted rehabilitation program). This observation clearly demonstrates the
15   rapid onset of action of ActRII blockade by bimagrumab as reflected by increases in skeletal
     muscle mass during the early period of remobilization.
              Further to the normalization, thigh muscle mass continued to increase from Week 2
     to Week 12 after cast removal ending with approximately 5% more volume than the group
     not receiving bimagrumab (Figure 4). Hence, all in all a total of -10%       increase in thigh
20   muscle volume to a single intravenous dose of the drug could be evidenced over a 12-week
     observation period.
     Regaining muscle mass in sarcopenic patients
     In a recently completed study on elderly patients with sarcopenia and physical frailty, a
25   single dose of 30 mg/kg intravenous bimagrumab could trigger thigh muscle volume
     increases, which were comparable with the magnitude of muscle growth seen in the
     experimental model of disuse atrophy, i.e. >8% increase from baseline in eight weeks
     (Figure 5). This increase in mass preceded a significant increase in 6 minute walking
     distance (6MWD) in the most mobility limited patients, those who started with 6MWD < 300
30   m (+76 meters, p = 0.02).
     Accordingly, bimagrumab was able to induce comparable responses regardless whether it
     was administered to young subjects with disuse atrophy or elderly subjects who have
     substantial muscle atrophy due to aging.
35
     Marked decreases in intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT)
     In a randomized, six treatment, double blind, placebo controlled, single ascending dose
     design trial on 49 healthy women and men up to 65 years of age single i.v. doses of 0.1,

   WO 2015/162590                                                              PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 8
     0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg were administered in a staggered fashion.           In this trial, in
     addition to safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics, effects of bimagrumab on thigh muscle
     volume as well as intermuscular adipose tissue measured by magnetic resonance imaging
     were also assessed. As shown in Figure 6, bimagrumab induced dose-dependent
 5   decreases in inter-muscular adipose tissue. The effect of 10 and 30 mg/kg was comparable
     at Week 10 after the drug injection, both exceeding 10% decrease from baseline.
     Bimagrumab treatment is associated with significant improvements in functional
     performance
10   As illustrated by data from patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis, a progressive
     muscle degenerative disease, the rapid increases in lean body mass (>5 % from baseline)
     induced by a single injection of bimagrumab (30 mg/kg) are able to trigger significant
     increases in physical performance (Figure 7). Importantly, improvement of functional
     following muscle mass increase require a period of lag time possibly reflecting the
15   structural/functional remodeling of skeletal muscle before becoming fully matured and ready
     to serve increased contractile activities.
     Collectively, bimagrumab seems to possess the properties of a capable pharmacological
     agent that can reverse both age-related changes of body composition as well as the
20   reactive changes (disuse atrophy) following hip fracture surgery. The applicant also has
     growing evidence arguing that the drug candidate can trigger functional improvement in
     muscle wasting diseases. Thus, with relatively rapid and pronounced effects on both muscle
     and IMAT, bimagrumab offers an innovative approach to accelerate recovery after hip
     fracture.

     SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
     Intervening in a patient population having undergone hip fracture surgery is highly
30   innovative and would meet a high unmet medical need.             Indeed, there is currently no
     therapeutic option to improve and/ or accelerate recovery from hip fracture surgery. This
     objective is achieved by the methods and dosing regimen provided within this disclosure.
            A first subject matter of the disclosure therefore relates to methods or uses for
35   improving and/or accelerating         recovery from   hip fracture surgery of compositions
     comprising a myostatin antagonist, which can be a myostatin binding molecule or an ActRII
     binding molecule. The myostatin binding molecule can be, e.g., an antagonist antibody to

   WO 2015/162590                                                             PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 9
     myostatin. The ActRII binding molecule can be, e.g., an antagonist antibody to ActRII, e.g.,
     bimagrumab also known as BYM338.
             "Myostatin antagonist" as used herein refers to a molecule capable of antagonizing
     (e.g., reducing, inhibiting, decreasing, delaying) myostatin function, expression and/or
 5   signalling (e.g., by blocking the binding of myostatin to the myostatin receptor, i.e., ActRII).
     Non-limiting examples of antagonists include myostatin binding molecules and ActRII
     receptor binding molecules.      In some embodiments of the disclosed methods, regimens,
     kits, processes, uses and compositions, a myostatin antagonist is employed.
             By "myostatin binding molecule" is meant any molecule capable of binding to the
10   human myostatin antigen either alone or associated with other molecules.          The binding
     reaction may be shown by standard methods (qualitative assays) including, for example, a
     binding assay, competition assay or a bioassay for determining the inhibition of myostatin
     binding to its receptor or any kind of binding assays, with reference to a negative control
     test in which an antibody of unrelated specificity, but ideally of the same isotype, e.g., an
15   anti-CD25 antibody, is used. Non-limiting examples of myostatin binding molecules include
     small molecules, myostatin receptor decoys, and antibodies that bind to myostatin as
     produced by B-cells or hybridomas and chimeric, CDR-grafted or human antibodies or any
     fragment thereof, e.g., F(ab') 2 and Fab fragments, as well as single chain or single domain
     antibodies. Preferably the myostatin binding molecule antagonizes (e.g., reduces, inhibits,
20   decreases, delays) myostatin function, expression and/or signalling. In some embodiments
     of the disclosed methods, regimens, kits, processes, uses and compositions, a myostatin
     binding molecule is employed.
     By "ActRII binding molecule" is meant any molecule capable of binding to the human ActRII
     receptor (ActRIIA and/or ActRIIB) either alone or associated with other molecules.         The
25   binding reaction may be shown by standard methods (qualitative assays) including, for
     example, a binding assay, competition assay or a bioassay for determining the inhibition of
     ActRII receptor binding to myostatin or any kind of binding assays, with reference to a
     negative control test in which an antibody of unrelated specificity, but ideally of the same
     isotype, e.g., an anti-CD25 antibody, is used.      Non-limiting examples of ActRII receptor
30   binding molecules include small molecules, myostatin decoys, and antibodies to the ActRII
     receptor as produced by B-cells or hybridomas and chimeric, CDR-grafted or human
     antibodies or any fragment thereof, e.g., F(ab') 2 and Fab fragments, as well as single chain
     or single domain antibodies. Preferably the ActRII receptor binding molecule antagonizes
     (e.g., reduces, inhibits, decreases, delays) myostatin function, expression and/or signalling.
35   In some embodiments of the disclosed methods, regimens, kits, processes, uses and
     compositions, an ActRIIB receptor binding molecule is employed.

     DEFINITIONS
     In order that the present disclosure may be more readily understood, certain terms are first
15   defined. Additional definitions are set forth throughout the detailed description.
     The term "comprising" means "including" e.g. a composition "comprising" X may consist
     exclusively of X or may include something additional e.g. X + Y.
     The term "about" in relation to a numerical value x means, for example, x+10%.
20
     The term "disuse atrophy" is another term for muscle atrophy, or muscle wasting. It occurs
     when a muscle is no longer as active as usual. When muscles are no longer in use, they
     slowly become weaker. Eventually, they begin to shrink. In some cases, disuse atrophy can
     be reversed if the muscles become active again.
25    Disuse atrophy can be caused by immobility, such as an arm being in a cast for a long
     period of time. It can also occur to some degree if a person stops performing their usual
     activities, such as walking.
     The term "major surgery" is any surgery involving anesthesia and respiratory assistance. In
30   the present context, it implies the significant resection (removal and replacement of a joint)
     risks of intraoperative or postoperative complications (cardiac or respiratory complication,
     major bleedings, severe infections). The surgery comprises internal fixation or arthroplasty.
     The following exemplifies possible pre-clinical treatment regimes to evaluate possible
35   effects of a treatment with a myostatin antagonist, e.g., myostatin binding molecule or
     ActRII binding molecule, preferably ActRII binding molecule, more preferably an antagonist
     antibody to ActRII, e.g., bimagrumab.

   WO 2015/162590                                                               PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                15
     The treatment is exemplified by using cynomolgus monkeys, but the described experiments
     are not limited to monkeys and the skilled person knows how to set up suitable experiments
     or dosing regimens for other species, in particular for humans: the anti-ActRII antibody, e.g.,
 5   bimagrumab, can be administered once a week for 3 months to male and female
     cynomolgus monkeys by intravenous injection. 32 cynomolgus monkeys (16/sex) can be
     assigned to one of four treatment groups (3 to 5 animals/sex/group) and can be
     administered intravenous injections of either vehicle or the ActRIIB antibody, e.g., BYM338,
     at 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg once weekly for 13 weeks (total of 14 doses; doses shall be
10   selected on the basis of muscle hypertrophy activity in monkey).
     The terms "ActRIIA" and "ActRIIB" refer to Activin receptors. Activins signal through a
     heterodimeric complex of receptor serine kinases which include at least two type I (I and IB)
     and two type II (IIA and IIB, aka ACVR2A and ACVR2B) receptors. These receptors are all
15   transmembrane      proteins, composed of a ligand-binding extracellular domain with a
     cysteine-rich region, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with predicted
     serine/threonine specificity. Type I receptors are essential for signaling while type II
     receptors are required for binding ligands and for expression/recruitment of type I receptors.
     Type I and II receptors form a stable complex after ligand binding resulting in the
20   phosphorylation of type I receptors by type II receptors. The activin receptor II B (ActRIIB) is
     a receptor for myostatin. The activin receptor II A (Act RIIA) is also a receptor for
     mysostatin. The term ActRIIB or Act IIB receptor refers to human ActRIIB as defined in SEQ
     ID NO: 181 (AAC64515.1, GI:3769443). Research grade polyclonal and monoclonal anti
     ActRIIB antibodies are known in the art, such as those made by R&D Systems®, MN, USA.
25   Of course, antibodies could be raised against ActRIIB from other species and used to treat
     pathological conditions in those species.
     The term "immune response" refers to the action of, for example, lymphocytes, antigen
     presenting cells, phagocytic cells, granulocytes, and soluble macromolecules produced by
30   the above cells or the liver (e.g. antibodies, cytokines, and complement) that results in
     selective damage to, destruction of, or elimination from the human body of invading
     pathogens, cells or tissues infected with pathogens, cancerous cells, or, in cases of
     autoimmunity or pathological inflammation, normal human cells or tissues.
35   A "signaling activity" refers to a biochemical causal relationship generally initiated by a
     protein-protein interaction such as binding of a growth factor to a receptor, resulting in
     transmission of a signal from one portion of a cell to another portion of a cell. In general, the
     transmission involves specific phosphorylation of one or more tyrosine, serine, or threonine

   WO 2015/162590                                                             PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 16
     residues on one or more proteins in the series of reactions causing signal transduction.
     Penultimate processes typically include nuclear events, resulting in a change in gene
     expression.
 5   The term "antibody" as referred to herein includes whole antibodies and any antigen binding
     fragment (i.e. "antigen-binding portion") or single chains thereof. A naturally occurring
     "antibody" is a glycoprotein comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L)
     chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain
     variable region (abbreviated herein as    VH)  and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy
10   chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain
     is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain
     constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The         VH
     and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed
     complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more
15   conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each        VH and VL is composed of three CDRs
     and four FRs arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order:
     FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light
     chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the
     antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors,
20   including various cells of the immune system (e.g. effector cells) and the first component
     (Clq) of the classical complement system.
     The term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody (or simply "antigen portion"), as used
     herein, refers to full length or one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to
25   specifically bind to an antigen (e.g. a portion of ActRIIB). It has been shown that the
     antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length
     antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term "antigen-binding
     portion" of an antibody include a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL,
     VH,  CL and CH1 domains; a F(ab) 2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab
30   fragments, each of which binds to the same antigen, linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge
     region; a Fd fragment consisting of the    VH  and CH1 domains; a Fv fragment consisting of
     the VL and   VH domains of a single arm of an antibody; a dAb fragment (Ward et al., 1989
     Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a        VH domain; and an isolated complementarity
     determining region (CDR).
35
     Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and        VH,  are coded for by
     separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that
     enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and       VH  regions pair to

                                                17
     form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g. Bird et al., 1988
     Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al., 1988 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85:5879-5883). Such
     single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term "antigen
     binding region" of an antibody. These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional
 5   techniques known to those of skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility in the
     same manner as are intact antibodies.
     An "isolated antibody", as used herein, refers to an antibody that is substantially free of
     other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that
10   specifically binds ActRIIB is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens
     other than ActRIIB). An isolated antibody that specifically binds ActRIIB may, however, have
     cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as ActRIIB molecules from other species. Moreover,
     an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.
15   The terms "cross-block", "cross-blocked" and "cross-blocking" are used interchangeably
     herein to mean the ability of an antibody or other binding agent to interfere with the binding
     of other antibodies or binding agents to ActRIIB, particularly the ligand binding domain, in a
     standard competitive binding assay.
20   The terms "monoclonal antibody" or "monoclonal antibody composition" as used herein
     refer to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition. A monoclonal
     antibody composition displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular
     epitope.
25   The term "human antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having
     variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from sequences
     of human origin. Furthermore, if the antibody contains a constant region, the constant
     region also is derived from such human sequences, e.g. human germline sequences, or
     mutated versions of human germline sequences or antibody containing consensus
30   framework sequences derived from human framework sequences analysis, for example, as
     described in Knappik, et al. (2000. J Mol Biol 296, 57-86).      The human antibodies of the
     disclosure may include amino acid residues not encoded by human sequences (e.g.
     mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation
     in vivo). However, the term "human antibody", as used herein, is not intended to include
35   antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian
     species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.

   WO 2015/162590                                                              PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                18
     The term "human monoclonal antibody" refers to antibodies displaying a single binding
     specificity which have variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are
     derived from human sequences. In one embodiment, the human monoclonal antibodies are
     produced by a hybridoma which includes a B cell obtained from a transgenic nonhuman
 5   animal, e.g. a transgenic mouse, having a genome comprising a human heavy chain
     transgene and a light chain transgene fused to an immortalized cell.
     The term "recombinant human antibody", as used herein, includes all human antibodies that
     are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies
10   isolated from an animal (e.g. a mouse) that is transgenic or transchromosomal for human
     immunoglobulin genes or a hybridoma prepared therefrom, antibodies isolated from a host
     cell transformed to express the human antibody, e.g. from a transfectoma, antibodies
     isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library, and antibodies
     prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involve splicing of all or a
15   portion of a human immunoglobulin gene, sequences to other DNA sequences. Such
     recombinant human antibodies have variable regions in which the framework and CDR
     regions are derived      from   human   germline    immunoglobulin     sequences.   In certain
     embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies can be subjected to in vitro
     mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo
20   somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the         VH and VL regions of the
     recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human
     germline   VH and VL sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline
     repertoire in vivo.
25   As used herein, "isotype" refers to the antibody class (e.g. IgM, IgE, IgG such as IgG1 or
     IgG2) that is provided by the heavy chain constant region genes.
     The phrases "an antibody recognizing an antigen" and "an antibody specific for an antigen"
     are used interchangeably herein with the term "an antibody which binds specifically to an
30   antigen".
     As used herein, an antibody that "specifically binds to ActRIIB polypeptide" is intended to
     refer to an antibody that binds to human ActRIIB polypeptide with a K0 of a about 1OOnM or
     less, about 1OnM or less, about 1nM or less. An antibody that "cross-reacts with an antigen
35   other than ActRIIB" is intended to refer to an antibody that binds that antigen with a K0 of
     about 10 x 10-9 M or less, about 5 x 10-9 M or less, or about 2 x 10-9 M or less. An antibody
     that "does not cross-react with a particular antigen" is intended to refer to an antibody that
     binds to that antigen, with a K0 of about 1.5 x 10-8 M or greater, or a K0 of about 5-10 x 10-8

   WO 2015/162590                                                                  PCT/IB2015/052990

     M, or about 1 x 10- 7 M or greater. In certain embodiments, such antibodies that do not
     cross-react with the antigen exhibit essentially undetectable binding against these proteins
     in standard binding assays. K0 may be determined using a biosensor system, such as a
     Biacore® system, or Solution Equilibrium Titration.
 5
     As used herein, the term "antagonist antibody" is intended to refer to an antibody that
     inhibits ActRIIB induced signaling activity in the presence of myostatin or of other ActRIIB
     ligands such as activins or GDF-11 and/or to an antibody that inhibits ActRIIA induced
     signaling activity in the presence of myostatin or of other ActRIIA ligands such as activins or
10   GDF-11.    Examples of an assay to detect this include inhibition of myostatin induced
     signalling (for instance by a Smad dependent reporter gene assay), inhibition of myostatin
     induced Smad phosphorylation (P-Smad ELISA) and inhibition of myostatin induced
     inhibition of skeletal muscle cell differentiation (for instance by a creatine kinase assay).
15   In some embodiments, the antibodies inhibit myostatin induced signalling as measured in a
     Smad dependent reporter gene assay at an IC50 of about 1OnM or less, about 1nM or less,
     or about 100pM or less.
     As used herein, an antibody with "no agonistic activity" is intended to refer to an antibody
20   that does not significantly increase ActRIIB mediated signaling activity in the absence of
     myostatin in a cell-based assay, such as inhibition of myostatin induced signalling (for
     instance by a Smad dependent reporter gene assay), inhibition of myostatin induced Smad
     phosphorylation (P-Smad ELISA) and inhibition of myostatin induced inhibition of skeletal
     muscle cell differentiation (for instance by a creatine kinase assay). Such assays are
25   described in more details in the examples below.
     The term "Kassoc" or "Ka", as used herein, is intended to refer to the association rate of a
     particular antibody-antigen interaction, whereas the term       "Kdis" or "Kd", as used herein, is
     intended to refer to the dissociation rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. The
30   term "KD", as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant, which is obtained
     from the ratio of   Kd  to Ka (i.e. Kd/Ka) and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). K0
     values for antibodies can be determined using methods well established in the art. A
     method for determining the K0 of an antibody is by using surface plasmon resonance, such
     as the biosensor system of Biacore®, or Solution Equilibrium Titration (SET) (see Friguet B
35   et al. (1985) J. Immunol Methods; 77(2): 305-319, and Hanel C et al. (2005) Anal Biochem;
     339(1): 182-184).

   WO 2015/162590                                                               PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 20
     As used herein, the term "Affinity" refers to the strength of interaction between antibody and
     antigen at single antigenic sites. Within each antigenic site, the variable region of the
     antibody "arm" interacts through weak non-covalent forces with antigen at numerous sites;
     the more interactions, the stronger the affinity.
 5
     As used herein, the term "Avidity" refers to an informative measure of the overall stability or
     strength of the antibody-antigen complex. It is controlled by three major factors: antibody
     epitope affinity; the valency of both the antigen and antibody; and the structural
     arrangement of the interacting parts. Ultimately these factors define the specificity of the
10   antibody, that is, the likelihood that the particular antibody is binding to a precise antigen
     epitope.
     As used herein, the term "ADCC" or "antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity" activity refers
     to human B cell depleting activity. ADCC activity can be measured by the human B cell
15   depleting assays known in the art.
     In order to get a higher avidity probe, a dimeric conjugate (two molecules of an antibody
     protein coupled to a FACS marker) can be constructed, thus making low affinity interactions
     (such as with the germline antibody) more readily detected by FACS. In addition, another
20   means to increase the avidity of antigen binding involves generating dimers, trimers or
     multimers of any of the constructs described herein of the anti-ActRIIB antibodies. Such
     multimers may be generated through covalent binding between individual modules, for
     example, by imitating the natural C-to-N-terminus binding or by imitating antibody dimers
     that are held together through their constant regions. The bonds engineered into the Fc/Fc
25   interface may be covalent or non-covalent. In addition, dimerizing or multimerizing partners
     other than Fc can be used in ActRIIB hybrids to create such higher order structures. For
     example, it is possible to use multimerizing domains such as the trimerizing domain
     described in W02004/039841 or pentamerizing domain described in W098/18943.
30   As used herein, the term "selectivity" for an antibody refers to an antibody that binds to a
     certain target polypeptide but not to closely related polypeptides.
     As used herein, the term "high affinity" for an antibody refers to an antibody having a K0 of
     1nM or less for a target antigen. As used herein, the term "subject" includes any human or
35   nonhuman animal.

   WO 2015/162590                                                             PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                21
     The term "nonhuman animal" includes all vertebrates, e.g. mammals and non-mammals,
     such as nonhuman primates, sheep, dogs, cats, horses, cows, chickens, amphibians,
     reptiles, etc.
 5   As used herein, the term, "optimized" means that a nucleotide sequence has been altered
     to encode an amino acid sequence using codons that are preferred in the production cell or
     organism, generally a eukaryotic cell, for example, a cell of Pichia, a cell of Trichoderma, a
     Chinese Hamster Ovary cell (CHO) or a human cell. The optimized nucleotide sequence is
     engineered to retain completely or as much as possible the amino acid sequence originally
10   encoded by the starting nucleotide sequence, which is also known as the "parental"
     sequence. The optimized sequences herein have been engineered to have codons that are
     preferred in CHO mammalian cells, however optimized expression of these sequences in
     other eukaryotic cells is also envisioned herein. The amino acid sequences encoded by
     optimized nucleotide sequences are also referred to as optimized.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE
     It has been discovered that antibodies directed to the ActRII receptors, e.g, bimagrumab,
     can prevent myostatin from binding to the receptor, thus improving or accelerating recovery
20   from hip fracture surgery patients.
     Therefore, in one aspect, the disclosure provides a composition comprising a myostatin
     antagonist, e.g., myostatin binding molecule or ActRII binding molecule, preferably ActRII
     binding molecule, more preferably an anti-ActRII antibody, e.g, bimagrumab or a functional
25   protein comprising an antigen-binding portion of said antibody for use. In one embodiment,
     the ActRIIB is human ActRIIB. The polypeptide sequence of human ActRIIB is recited in
     SEQ ID NO: 181 (AAC64515.1, GI:3769443). In one embodiment, the antibody or functional
     protein is from a mammal, having an origin such as human or camelid. Thus the antibody
     comprised in the disclosed composition may be a chimeric, human or a humanized
30   antibody. In a particular embodiment, the anti-ActRIIB antibody comprised in the disclosed
     composition is characterized as having an antigen-binding region that is specific for the
     target protein ActRIIB and binds to ActRIIB or a fragment of ActRIIB.
35   In one embodiment, the antibodies comprised in the disclosed composition are ActRII
     antagonists with no or low agonistic activity. In another embodiment, the antibody or
     functional fragment comprised in the disclosed composition binds the target protein ActRII

   WO 2015/162590                                                                PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                   22
     and decreases the binding of myostatin to ActRII to a basal level. In a further aspect of this
     embodiment, the antibody or functional fragment comprised in the disclosed composition
     completely prevents myostatin from binding to ActRIL. In a further embodiment, the antibody
     or functional fragment comprised in the disclosed composition inhibits Smad activation. In a
 5   further embodiment, the antibody or functional fragment comprised in the disclosed
     composition inhibits activin receptor type IB mediated myostatin-induced inhibition of
     skeletal differentiation via the Smad-dependent pathway.
     The binding may be determined by one or more assays that can be used to measure an
10   activity which is either antagonism or agonism by the antibody. Preferably, the assays
     measure at least one of the effects of the antibody on ActRIIB that include: inhibition of
     myostatin binding to ActRIIB by ELISA, inhibition of myostatin induced signalling (for
     instance by a Smad dependent reporter gene assay), inhibition of myostatin induced Smad
     phosphorylation (P-Smad ELISA) and inhibition of myostatin induced inhibition of skeletal
15   muscle cell differentiation (for instance by a creatine kinase assay).
     In one embodiment, the disclosure provides compositions comprising antibodies that
     specifically bind to the myostatin binding region (i.e. ligand binding domain) of ActRIIB. This
     ligand binding domain consists of amino acids 19-134 of SEQ ID NO: 181 and has been
20   assigned SEQ ID NO: 182 herein. The ligand biding domain comprises several below
     described epitopes.
     In one embodiment, the antibodies comprised in the disclosed composition bind to ActRIIB
     with a K0 of about 1OOnM or less, about 1OnM or less, about 1nM or less. Preferably, the
25   antibodies comprised in the disclosed composition bind to ActRIIB with an affinity of 100pM
     or less (i.e. about 100pM, about 50pM, about 10pM, about 2 pM, about 1pM or less). In one
     embodiment, the antibodies comprised in the disclosed composition bind to ActRIIB with an
     affinity of between about 1 and about 10pM.
30   In one embodiment, the antibodies comprised in the disclosed composition do not cross
     react with an ActRIIB related protein, particularly do not cross-react with human ActRIIA
     (NP_001607.1, GI:4501897). In another embodiment, the antibodies comprised in the
     disclosed composition cross-react with Act RIIA and bind to ActRIIB with equivalent affinity,
     or about 1, 2, 3 , 4 or 5-fold greater affinity than they bind to ActRIIA, more preferably about
35   10-fold, still more preferably about 20-, 30- 40- or 50-fold, still more preferably about 100
     fold.

                                                23
     In one embodiment, the antibodies comprised in the disclosed composition bind to ActRIIA
     with an affinity of 1OOpM or more (i.e. about 250pM, about 500pM, about 1 nM, about 5nM or
     more).
 5   In one embodiment the antibodies comprised in the disclosed composition are of the IgG2
     isotype.
     In another embodiment, the antibodies comprised in the disclosed composition are of the
     IgG1 isotype. In a further embodiment, the antibodies comprised in the disclosed
10   composition are of the IgG1 isotype and have an altered effector function through mutation
     of the Fc region. Said altered effector function may be a reduced ADCC and CDC activity.
     In one embodiment, said altered effector function is silenced ADCC and CDC activity.
     In another related embodiment, the antibodies comprised in the disclosed composition are
15   fully human or humanized IgG1 antibodies with no antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity
     (ADCC) activity or CDC activity and bind to a region of ActRIIB consisting of amino acids
     19-134 of SEQ ID NO:181.
     In another related embodiment, the antibodies comprised in the disclosed composition are
20   fully human or humanized IgG1 antibodies with reduced antibody dependent cellular
     cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity or CDC activity and bind to a region of ActRIIB consisting of
     amino acids 19-134 of SEQ ID NO:181.
     The present disclosure also relates to compositions comprising human or humanized anti
25   ActRIIB antibodies for use in accelerating/improving physical recovery in a patient with
     disuse atrophy triggered by reduced mobility due to a hip fracture and consequent
     major surgery.
     In certain embodiments, the antibodies comprised in the disclosed composition are derived
30   from particular heavy and light chain sequences and/or comprise particular structural
     features such as CDR regions comprising particular amino acid sequences. The disclosure
     provides     isolated   ActRIIB   antibodies,   methods     of   making   such  antibodies,
     immunoconjugates and multivalent or multispecific molecules comprising such antibodies
     and pharmaceutical compositions containing the antibodies, immunoconjugates or bispecific
35   molecules.

     5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 mg/kg body weight.
15   Disclosed herein are myostatin antagonists for the manufacture of a medicament for
     accelerating/improving physical recovery in a patient with disuse atrophy triggered by
     reduced mobility due to a hip fracture and consequent major surgery.
     In further embodiments all the aspects disclosed herein can be used in combination one
20   with any of the other.
     Various aspects of the disclosure are described in further detail in the following subsections.
     Standard assays to evaluate the binding ability of the antibodies toward ActRII of various
     species are known in the art, including for example, ELISAs, western blots and RIAs.
25   Suitable assays are described in detail in the Examples. The binding affinity of the
     antibodies also can be assessed by standard assays known in the art, such as by Biacore
     analysis or Solution Equilibrium Titration. Surface plasmon resonance based techniques
     such as Biacore can determine the binding kinetics which allows the calculation of the
     binding affinity. Assays to evaluate the effects of the antibodies on functional properties of
30   ActRIIB (e.g. receptor binding, preventing or inducing human B cell proliferation or IgG
     production) are described in further detail in the Examples.
     Accordingly, an antibody that "inhibits" one or more of these ActRII functional properties
     (e.g. biochemical, immunochemical, cellular, physiological or other biological activities, or
35   the like) as determined according to methodologies known to the art and described herein,
     will be understood to relate to a statistically significant decrease in the particular activity
     relative to that seen in the absence of the antibody (e.g. or when a control antibody of
     irrelevant specificity is present). An antibody that inhibits ActRII activity effects such a

   WO 2015/162590                                                              PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                35
     statistically significant decrease by at least 10% of the measured parameter, by at least
     50%, 80% or 90%, and in certain embodiments an antibody of the disclosure may inhibit
     greater than 95%, 98% or 99% of ActRIIB functional activity.
 5   The ability or extent to which an antibody or other binding agent is able to interfere with the
     binding of another antibody or binding molecule to ActRII, and therefore whether it can be
     said to cross-block according to the disclosure, can be determined using standard
     competition binding assays. One suitable assay involves the use of the Biacore technology
     (e.g. by using a BlAcore instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden)), which can measure the
10   extent of interactions using surface plasmon resonance technology. Another assay for
     measuring cross-blocking uses an ELISA-based approach. A further assay uses FACS
     analysis, wherein competition of various antibodies for binding to ActRIIB expressing cells is
     tested (such as described in the Examples).
15   According to the disclosure, a cross-blocking antibody or other binding agent according to
     the disclosure binds to ActRII in the described BlAcore cross-blocking assay such that the
     recorded binding of the combination (mixture) of the antibodies or binding agents is
     between 80% and 0.1% (e.g. 80% to 4%) of the maximum theoretical binding, specifically
     between 75% and 0.1% (e.g. 75% to 4%) of the maximum theoretical binding, and more
20   specifically between 70% and 0.1% (e.g. 70% to 4%), and more specifically between 65%
     and 0.1% (e.g. 65% to 4%) of maximum theoretical binding (as defined above) of the two
     antibodies or binding agents in combination.
     An antibody is defined as cross-blocking an anti-ActRIIB antibody of the disclosure in an
25   ELISA assay, if the test antibody is able to cause a reduction of anti-ActRII antibody binding
     to ActRIIB of between 60% and 100%, specifically between 70% and 100%, and more
     specifically between 80% and 100%, when compared to the positive control wells (i.e. the
     same anti-ActRIIB antibody and ActRIIB, but no "test" cross-blocking antibody). Examples
     of cross blocking antibodies as cited herein are MOR08159 and MOR08213 (disclosed in
30   W02010/125003). Thus, the disclosure provides compositions comprising antibodies that
     cross block MOR08159 or MOR08213 for binding to ActRIIB.
     Recombinant antibodies
     Antibodies, e.g., antagonist antibodies to ActRII, such as bimagrumab, comprised in the
35   compositions used within this disclosure include the human recombinant antibodies,
     isolated and structurally characterized, as described in the Examples. The      VH  amino acid

                                                  36
     sequences of antibodies comprised in the inventive compositions are shown in SEQ ID
     NOs: 99-112. The VL amino acid sequences of              antibodies comprised in the inventive
     compositions are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 85-98 respectively. Examples of preferred full
     length heavy chain amino acid sequences of antibodies comprised in the inventive
 5   compositions are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 146-150 and 156-160. Examples of preferred full
     length light chain amino acid sequences of antibodies comprised in the inventive
     compositions are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 141-145 and 151-155 respectively.                   Other
     antibodies comprised in the inventive compositions include amino acids that have been
     mutated by amino acid deletion, insertion or substitution, yet have at least 60, 70, 80, 90,
10   95, 97 or 99 percent identity in the CDR regions with the CDR regions depicted in the
     sequences described above.          In some embodiments, it includes mutant amino acid
     sequences wherein no more than 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 amino acids have been mutated by amino
     acid deletion, insertion or substitution in the CDR regions when compared with the CDR
     regions depicted in the sequence described above.
15
     Further, variable heavy chain parental nucleotide sequences are shown in SEQ ID NOs:
     127-140. Variable light chain parental nucleotide sequences are shown in SEQ ID NOs:
     113-126. Full length light chain nucleotide sequences optimized for expression in a
     mammalian cell are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 161-165 and 171-175. Full length heavy chain
20   nucleotide sequences optimized for expression in a mammalian cell are shown in SEQ ID
     NOs: 166-170 and 176-180.         Other antibodies comprised in the inventive compositions
     include amino acids or are encoded by nucleic acids that have been mutated, yet have at
     least 60 or more (i.e. 80, 90, 95, 97, 99 or more) percent identity to the sequences
     described above. In some embodiments, it includes mutant amino acid sequences wherein
25   no more than 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 amino acids have been mutated by amino acid deletion,
     insertion or substitution in the variable regions when compared with the variable regions
     depicted in the sequence described above.
     Since each of these antibodies binds the same epitope and are progenies from the same
30   parental antibody, the  VH, VL, full length light chain, and full length heavy chain sequences
     (nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences) can be "mixed and matched" to create
     other anti-ActRIIB binding molecules of the disclosure. ActRIIB binding of such "mixed and
     matched" antibodies can be tested using the binding assays described above and in the
     Examples (e.g. ELISAs). When these chains are mixed and matched, a            VH sequence from
35   a particular VH/VL pairing should be replaced with a structurally similar         VH  sequence.
     Likewise a full length heavy chain sequence from a particular full length heavy chain / full
     length light chain pairing should be replaced with a structurally similar full length heavy
     chain sequence.      Likewise, a VL sequence from a particular VH/VL pairing should be

   WO 2015/162590                                                               PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                   37
     replaced with a structurally similar VL sequence. Likewise a full length light chain sequence
     from a particular full length heavy chain / full length light chain pairing should be replaced
     with a structurally similar full length light chain sequence. Accordingly, in one aspect, the
     disclosure provides compositions comprising a recombinant anti-ActRII antibody or antigen
 5   binding region thereof having: a heavy chain variable region comprising an amino acid
     sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 99-112; and a light chain
     variable region comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of
     SEQ ID NOs: 85-98.
10   In another aspect, the disclosure provides compositions comprising:
     (i) an isolated recombinant anti-ActRII antibody having: a full length heavy chain comprising
     an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:99-112; and a
     full length light chain comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group
     consisting of SEQ ID NOs:85-98, or
15   (ii) a functional protein comprising an antigen binding portion thereof.
     In another aspect, the disclosure provides compositions comprising:
     (i) an isolated recombinant anti-ActRII antibody having a full length heavy chain encoded by
     a nucleotide sequence that has been optimized for expression in the cell of a mammalian
     selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:127-140, and a full length light chain
20   encoded by a nucleotide sequence that has been optimized for expression in the cell of a
     mammalian selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:113-126, or
     (ii) a functional protein comprising an antigen binding portion thereof.
     Examples of amino acid sequences of the          VH CDR1s of the antibodies comprised in the
25   inventive compositions are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 1-14. The amino acid sequences of the
     VH   CDR2s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 15-28. The amino acid sequences
     of the   VH  CDR3s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 29-42. The amino acid
     sequences of the VL CDR1s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 43-56. The amino
     acid sequences of the VL CDR2s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 57-70. The
30   amino acid sequences of the VL CDR3s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 71-84.
     The CDR regions are delineated using the Kabat system (Kabat, E. A., et al., 1991
     Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health
     and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242). An alternative method of determining
     CDR regions uses the method devised by Chothia (Chothia et al. 1989, Nature, 342:877
35   883). The Chothia definition is based on the location of the structural loop regions.
     However, due to changes            in the numbering system used by Chothia (see e.g.
     http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/-martin/abs/Generallnfo.html                                  and

   WO 2015/162590                                                             PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                38
     http://www.bioinf.org.uk/abs/), this system is now less commonly used. Other systems for
     defining CDRs exist and are also mentioned in these two websites.
     Given that each of these antibodies can bind to ActRII and that antigen-binding specificity is
 5   provided primarily by the CDR1, 2 and 3 regions, the   VH  CDR1, 2 and 3 sequences and VL
     CDR1, 2 and 3 sequences can be "mixed and matched" (i.e. CDRs from different antibodies
     can be mixed and matched, each antibody containing a     VH  CDR1, 2 and 3 and a VL CDR1,
     2 and 3 create other anti-ActRII binding molecules of the disclosure. ActRIIB binding of such
     "mixed and matched" antibodies can be tested using the binding assays described above
10   and in the Examples (e.g. ELISAs). When     VH CDR sequences are mixed and matched, the
     CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 sequence from a particular          VH  sequence should be replaced
     with a structurally similar CDR sequence(s). Likewise, when VL CDR sequences are mixed
     and matched, the CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 sequence from a particular VL sequence
     should be replaced with a structurally similar CDR sequence(s). It will be readily apparent
15   to the ordinarily skilled artisan that novel   VH  and VL sequences can be created by
     substituting one or more     VH  and/or VL CDR region sequences with structurally similar
     sequences from the CDR sequences shown herein for monoclonal antibodies.

     As used herein, a human antibody comprises heavy or light chain variable regions or full

     sequence if the variable regions or full length chains of the antibody are obtained from a
     system that uses      human    germline immunoglobulin      genes. Such systems        include
     immunizing a transgenic mouse carrying human immunoglobulin genes with the antigen of

   WO 2015/162590                                                           PCT/IB2015/052990

     interest or screening a human immunoglobulin gene library displayed on phage with the
     antigen of interest. A human antibody that is "the product of" or "derived from" a human
     germline immunoglobulin sequence can be identified as such by comparing the amino acid
     sequence of the human antibody to the amino acid sequences of human germline
 5   immunoglobulins and selecting the human germline immunoglobulin sequence that is
     closest in sequence (i.e. greatest % identity) to the sequence of the human antibody. A
     human antibody that is "the product of" or "derived from" a particular human germline
     immunoglobulin sequence may contain amino acid differences as compared to the germline
     sequence, due to, for example, naturally occurring somatic mutations or intentional
10   introduction of site-directed mutation. However, a selected human antibody typically is at
     least 90% identical in amino acids sequence to an amino acid sequence encoded by a
     human germline immunoglobulin gene and contains amino acid residues that identify the
     human antibody as being human when compared to the germline immunoglobulin amino
     acid sequences of other species (e.g. murine germline sequences). In certain cases, a
15   human antibody may be at least 80%, 90%, or at least 95%, or even at least 96%, 97%,
     98%, or 99% identical in amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence encoded by the
     germline immunoglobulin gene. Typically, a human antibody derived from a particular
     human germline sequence will display no more than 10 amino acid differences from the
     amino acid sequence encoded by the human germline immunoglobulin gene. In certain
20   cases, the human antibody may display no more than 5, or even no more than 4, 3, 2, or 1
     amino    acid difference from the amino      acid sequence    encoded    by the germline
     immunoglobulin gene.

     chain variable region comprising CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 sequences and a light chain
     variable region comprising CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 sequences, wherein one or more of
     these CDR sequences have specified amino acid sequences based on the antibodies
     described herein or variant sequences thereof comprising 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 amino acid
20   changes or conservative modifications thereof, and wherein the antibodies retain the
     desired functional properties of the anti-ActRIIB antibodies of the disclosure. Accordingly,
     the disclosure provides compositions comprising an isolated recombinant anti-ActRIIB
     antibody, or a functional protein comprising an antigen binding portion thereof, consisting of

 5   modifications thereof. Preferably the antibody exhibits at least one of the following functional
     properties: (i) it inhibits myostatin binding in vitro or in vivo, (ii) decreases inhibition of
     muscle differentiation through the Smad-dependent pathway and/or (iii) does not induce
     hematological changes, in particular no changes in RBC.
10   In various embodiments, the antibody may exhibit one or both of the functional properties
     listed above. Such antibodies can be, for example, human antibodies, humanized
     antibodies or chimeric antibodies.
     In other embodiments, an antibody comprised in the inventive composition optimized for
15   expression in a mammalian cell has a full length heavy chain sequence and a full length
     light chain sequence, wherein one or more of these sequences have specified amino acid
     sequences based on the antibodies described herein or conservative modifications thereof,
     and wherein the antibodies retain the desired functional properties of the anti-ActRIIB
     antibodies of the disclosure. Accordingly, the disclosure provides compositions comprising
20   an isolated monoclonal anti-ActRII antibody optimized for expression in a mammalian cell
     consisting of a full length heavy chain and a full length light chain wherein: the full length
     heavy chain has amino acid sequences selected from the group of SEQ ID NOs: 146-150
     and 156-160 or variant sequences thereof comprising 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 amino acid changes,

     modifications thereof; and the antibody exhibits at least one of the following functional
     properties: (i) it inhibits myostatin binding in vitro or in vivo, (ii) decreases inhibition of
     muscle differentiation through the Smad-dependent pathway and/or (iii) does not induce

     In various embodiments, the antibody may exhibit one or both of the functional properties
     listed above. Such antibodies can be, for example, human antibodies, humanized
     antibodies or chimeric antibodies.

     As used herein, the term "conservative sequence modifications" is intended to refer to
     amino acid modifications that do not significantly affect or alter the binding characteristics of
     the antibody containing the amino acid sequence. Such conservative modifications include

   WO 2015/162590                                                                 PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 48
     amino acid substitutions, additions and deletions. Modifications can be introduced into an
     antibody of the disclosure by standard techniques known in the art, such as site-directed
     mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis.
 5   Conservative amino acid substitutions are ones in which the amino acid residue is replaced
     with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues
     having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids
     with basic side chains (e.g. lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g. aspartic acid,
     glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g. glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine,
10   threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g. alanine, valine,
     leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g.
     threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g. tyrosine, phenylalanine,
     tryptophan, histidine). Thus, one or more amino acid residues within the CDR regions of an
     antibody of the disclosure can be replaced with other amino acid residues from the same
15   side chain family, and the altered antibody can be tested for retained function using the
     functional assays described herein.
     Antibodies that bind to the same epitope as anti-ActRIl antibodies comprised in the
     disclosed composition
     In another embodiment, the disclosure provides compositions comprising antibodies that
20   bind to the same epitope as the various specific anti-ActRII antibodies described herein. All
     the antibodies described in the examples that are capable of blocking myostatin binding to
     ActRIIA and ActRIIB bind to one of the epitopes in ActRIIA and ActRIIB with high affinity,
     said epitope being comprised between amino acids 19-134 of SEQ ID NO:181.
25   Additional antibodies can therefore be identified based on their ability to cross-compete
     (e.g. to competitively inhibit the binding of, in a statistically significant manner) with other
     antibodies of the disclosure in standard ActRIIB binding assays. The ability of a test
     antibody to inhibit the binding of antibodies comprised in the inventive compositions to
     human ActRIIB demonstrates that the test antibody can compete with said antibody for
30   binding to human ActRIIB; such an antibody may, according to non-limiting theory, bind to
     the same or a related (e.g. a structurally similar or spatially proximal) epitope on human
     ActRIIB as the antibody with which it competes. In a certain embodiment, the antibody that
     binds to the same epitope on human ActRIIA and ActRIIA as the antibodies comprised in
     the inventive compositions is a human recombinant antibody. Such human recombinant
35   antibodies can be prepared and isolated as described in the examples.
     Thus, the disclosure provides a composition comprising an antibody that binds to an epitope
     recognised by and/or that competes for binding with an antibody having the variable heavy

     Thus, the disclosure also provides a composition comprising an antibody that binds to an

     amino acids 52-56 of SEQ ID NO: 181 (EQDKR).
     Engineered and modified antibodies
15   An antibody comprised in the inventive compositions further can be prepared using an
     antibody having one or more of the        VH  and/or VL sequences shown herein as starting
     material to engineer a modified antibody, which modified antibody may have altered
     properties from the starting antibody. An antibody can be engineered by modifying one or
     more residues within one or both variable regions (i.e. VH and/or VL), for example within one
20   or more CDR regions and/or within one or more framework regions. Additionally or
     alternatively, an antibody can be engineered by modifying residues within the constant
     region(s), for example to alter the effector function(s) of the antibody.
     One type of variable region engineering that can be performed is CDR grafting. Antibodies
25   interact with target antigens predominantly through amino acid residues that are located in
     the six heavy and light chain complementarity determining regions (CDRs). For this reason,
     the amino acid sequences within CDRs are more diverse between individual antibodies
     than sequences outside of CDRs. Because CDR sequences are responsible for most
     antibody-antigen interactions, it is possible to express recombinant antibodies that mimic
30   the properties of specific naturally occurring antibodies by constructing expression vectors
     that include CDR sequences from the specific naturally occurring antibody grafted onto
     framework sequences from a different antibody with different properties (see, e.g.
     Riechmann, L. et al., 1998 Nature 332:323-327; Jones, P. et al., 1986 Nature 321:522-525;
     Queen, C. et al., 1989 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86:10029-10033; U.S. Patent No.
35   5,225,539 to Winter, and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,530,101; 5,585,089; 5,693,762 and 6,180,370
     to Queen et al.).

   WO 2015/162590                                                              PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                  52
     Accordingly, another embodiment of the disclosure pertains to compositions comprising a
     monoclonal anti- ActRII antibody, or a functional protein comprising an antigen binding
     portion thereof, comprising a heavy chain variable region comprising CDR1 sequences
     having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1-14;
 5   CDR2 sequences having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of
     SEQ ID NOs: 15-28; CDR3 sequences having an amino acid sequence selected from the
     group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 29-42, respectively; and a light chain variable region
     having CDR1 sequences having an amino acid sequence selected from the group
     consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 43-56; CDR2 sequences having an amino acid sequence
10   selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 57-70; and CDR3 sequences consisting
     of an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 71-84,
     respectively. Thus, such antibodies contain the     VH and VL CDR sequences of monoclonal
     antibodies, yet may contain different framework sequences from these antibodies.
15   Such framework sequences can be obtained from public DNA databases or published
     references that include germline antibody gene sequences. For example, germline DNA
     sequences for human heavy and light chain variable region genes can be found in the
     "VBase" human germline sequence database (available on the Internet at www.mrc
     cpe.cam.ac.uk/vbase), as well as in Kabat, E. A., et al., [supra]; Tomlinson, I. M., et al.,
20   1992 J. fol. Biol. 227:776-798; and Cox, J. P. L. et al., 1994 Eur. J Immunol. 24:827-836.
     An example of framework sequences for use in the antibodies of the disclosure are those
     that are structurally similar to the framework sequences used by selected antibodies of the
     disclosure, e.g. consensus sequences and/or framework sequences used by monoclonal
     antibodies of the disclosure. The    VH CDR1, 2 and 3 sequences, and the VL CDR1, 2 and 3
25   sequences, can be grafted onto framework regions that have the identical sequence as that
     found in the germline immunoglobulin gene from which the framework sequence derive, or
     the CDR sequences can be grafted onto framework regions that contain one or more
     mutations as compared to the germline sequences. For example, it has been found that in
     certain instances it is beneficial to mutate residues within the framework regions to maintain
30   or enhance the antigen binding ability of the antibody (see e.g. U.S. Patents. 5,530,101;
     5,585,089; 5,693,762 and 6,180,370 to Queen et al).
     Another type of variable region modification is to mutate amino acid residues within the    VH
     and/or VL CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 regions to thereby improve one or more binding
35   properties (e.g. affinity) of the antibody of interest, known as "affinity maturation." Site
     directed mutagenesis or PCR-mediated mutagenesis can be performed to introduce the
     mutation(s) and the effect on antibody binding, or other functional property of interest, can
     be evaluated in in vitro or in vivo assays as described herein and provided in the Examples.

   WO 2015/162590                                                             PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                53
     Conservative modifications (as discussed above) can be introduced. The mutations may be
     amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions. Moreover, typically no more than one, two,
     three, four or five residues within a CDR region are altered.
 5   Accordingly,     in  another  embodiment,    the   disclosure  provides  isolated  anti-ActRII
     monoclonal antibodies, or a functional protein comprising an antigen binding portion thereof,
     consisting of a heavy chain variable region having: a       VH CDR1 region consisting of an
     amino acid sequence selected from the group having SEQ ID NOs: 1-14 or an amino acid
     sequence having one, two, three, four or five amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions
10   as compared to SEQ ID NOs: 1-14; a        VH   CDR2 region having an amino acid sequence
     selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 15-28, or an amino acid sequence
     having one, two, three, four or five amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions as
     compared to SEQ ID NOs: 15-28; a         VH   CDR3 region having an amino acid sequence
     selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 29-42, or an amino acid sequence
15   having one, two, three, four or five amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions as
     compared to SEQ ID NOs: 29-42; a VL CDR1 region having an amino acid sequence
     selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 43-56, or an amino acid sequence
     having one, two, three, four or five amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions as
     compared to SEQ ID NOs: 43-56; a VL CDR2 region having an amino acid sequence
20   selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 52-70, or an amino acid sequence
     having one, two, three, four or five amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions as
     compared to SEQ ID NOs: 52-70; and a VL CDR3 region having an amino acid sequence
     selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 71-84, or an amino acid sequence
     having one, two, three, four or five amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions as
25   compared to SEQ ID NOs: 71-84.
     Camelid antibodies
     Antibody proteins obtained from members of the camel and dromedary family (Camelus
     bactrianus and Camelus dromaderius) including new world members such as llama species
     (Lama paccos, Lama glama and Lama vicugna) have been characterized with respect to
30   size, structural complexity and antigenicity for human subjects. Certain IgG antibodies from
     this family of mammals as found in nature lack light chains, and are thus structurally distinct
     from the typical four chain quaternary structure having two heavy and two light chains, for
     antibodies from other animals (see W094/04678).
35   A region of the camelid antibody which is the small single variable domain identified as   VHH
     can be obtained by genetic engineering to yield a small protein having high affinity for a
     target, resulting in a low molecular weight antibody-derived protein known as a "camelid

     nanobody" (see US5,759,808; Stijlemans, B. et al., 2004 J Biol Chem 279: 1256-1261;
     Dumoulin, M. et al., 2003 Nature 424: 783-788; Pleschberger, M. et al. 2003 Bioconjugate
     Chem 14: 440-448; Cortez-Retamozo, V. et al. 2002 Int J Cancer 89: 456-62; and
     Lauwereys, M. et al. 1998 EMBO J 17: 3512-3520).                Engineered libraries of camelid
 5   antibodies and antibody fragments are commercially available, for example, from Ablynx,
     Ghent, Belgium. As with other antibodies of non-human origin, an amino acid sequence of
     a camelid antibody can be altered recombinantly to obtain a sequence that more closely
     resembles a human sequence, i.e. the nanobody can be "humanized". Thus the natural low
     antigenicity of camelid antibodies to humans can be further reduced.
10
     The camelid nanobody has a molecular weight approximately one-tenth that of a human
     IgG molecule, and the protein has a physical diameter of only a few nanometers.              One
     consequence of the small size is the ability of camelid nanobodies to bind to antigenic sites
     that are functionally invisible to larger antibody proteins, i.e. camelid nanobodies are useful
15   as reagents detect antigens that are otherwise cryptic using classical immunological
     techniques, and as possible therapeutic agents. Thus yet another consequence of small
     size is that a camelid nanobody can inhibit as a result of binding to a specific site in a
     groove or narrow cleft of a target protein, and hence can serve in a capacity that more
     closely resembles the function of a classical low molecular weight drug than that of a
20   classical antibody.
     The low molecular weight and compact size further result in camelid nanobodies being
     extremely thermostable, stable to extreme pH and to proteolytic digestion, and poorly
     antigenic.    Another consequence is that camelid nanobodies readily move from the
25   circulatory system into tissues, and even cross the blood-brain barrier and can treat
     disorders that affect nervous tissue. Nanobodies can further facilitate drug transport across
     the blood brain barrier (see US2004/0161738).          These features combined with the low
     antigenicity to humans indicate great therapeutic potential. Further, these molecules can be
     fully expressed in prokaryotic cells such as E. coli and are expressed as fusion proteins with
30   bacteriophage and are functional.
     Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present disclosure related to composition comprising a
     camelid antibody or nanobody having high affinity for ActRIIB. In certain embodiments
     herein, the camelid antibody or nanobody is naturally produced in the camelid animal, i.e. is
35   produced by the camelid following immunization with ActRIIB or a peptide fragment thereof,
     using techniques described herein for other antibodies.           Alternatively, the anti-ActRIIB
     camelid nanobody is engineered, i.e. produced by selection for example from a library of
     phage displaying appropriately mutagenized camelid nanobody proteins using panning

   WO 2015/162590                                                               PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                  55
     procedures with ActRIIB as a target as described in the examples herein.            Engineered
     nanobodies can further be customized by genetic engineering to have a half-life in a
     recipient subject of from 45 minutes to two weeks. In a specific embodiment, the camelid
     antibody or nanobody is obtained by grafting the CDRs sequences of the heavy or light
 5   chain of the human antibodies of the disclosure into nanobody or single domain antibody
     framework sequences, as described for example in W094/04678.
     Non-antibody scaffold
     Known non-immunoglobulin frameworks or scaffolds include, but are not limited to,
     Adnectins (fibronectin) (Compound Therapeutics, Inc., Waltham, MA), ankyrin (Molecular
10   Partners AG, Zurich, Switzerland), domain antibodies (Domantis, Ltd (Cambridge, MA) and
     Ablynx nv (Zwijnaarde, Belgium)), lipocalin (Anticalin) (Pieris Proteolab AG, Freising,
     Germany), small modular immuno-pharmaceuticals (Trubion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Seattle,
     WA), maxybodies (Avidia, Inc. (Mountain View, CA)), Protein A (Affibody AG, Sweden) and
     affilin (gamma-crystallin or ubiquitin) (Scil Proteins GmbH, Halle, Germany), protein epitope
15   mimetics (Polyphor Ltd, Allschwil, Switzerland).
     (i) Fibronectin scaffold
     The fibronectin scaffolds are based preferably on fibronectin type III domain (e.g. the tenth
     module of the fibronectin type III (10 Fn3 domain)). The fibronectin type III domain has 7 or
20   8 beta strands which are distributed between two beta sheets, which themselves pack
     against each other to form the core of the protein, and further containing loops (analogous
     to CDRs) which connect the beta strands to each other and are solvent exposed. There are
     at least three such loops at each edge of the beta sheet sandwich, where the edge is the
     boundary of the protein perpendicular to the direction of the beta strands (US 6,818,418).
25
     These fibronectin-based scaffolds are not an immunoglobulin, although the overall fold is
     closely related to that of the smallest functional antibody fragment, the variable region of the
     heavy chain, which comprises the entire antigen recognition unit in camel and llama IgG.
     Because of this structure, the non-immunoglobulin antibody mimics antigen binding
30   properties that are similar in nature and affinity to those of antibodies. These scaffolds can
     be used in a loop randomization and shuffling strategy in vitro that is similar to the process
     of affinity maturation of antibodies in vivo. These fibronectin-based molecules can be used
     as scaffolds where the loop regions of the molecule can be replaced with CDRs of the
     disclosure using standard cloning techniques.
35
     (ii) Ankyrin - Molecular Partners

   WO 2015/162590                                                               PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 56
     The technology is based on using proteins with ankyrin derived repeat modules as scaffolds
     for bearing variable regions which can be used for binding to different targets. The ankyrin
     repeat module is a 33 amino acid polypeptide consisting of two anti-parallel a-helices and a
     p-turn. Binding of the variable regions is mostly optimized by using ribosome display.
 5
     (iii) Maxybodies/Avimers - Avidia
     Avimers are derived from natural A-domain containing protein such as LRP-1. These
     domains are used by nature for protein-protein interactions and in human over 250 proteins
     are structurally based on A-domains. Avimers consist of a number of different "A-domain"
10   monomers (2-10) linked via amino acid linkers. Avimers can be created that can bind to the
     target antigen using the methodology described in, for example, US2004/0175756;
     US2005/0053973; US2005/0048512; and US2006/0008844.
     (vi) Protein A - Affibody
15   Affibody@ affinity ligands are small, simple proteins composed of a three-helix bundle based
     on the scaffold of one of the IgG-binding domains of Protein A. Protein A is a surface
     protein from the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. This scaffold domain consists of 58
     amino acids, 13 of which are randomized to generate Affibody@ libraries with a large
     number of ligand variants (See e.g. US 5,831,012). Affibody@ molecules mimic antibodies,
20   they have a molecular weight of 6 kDa, compared to the molecular weight of antibodies,
     which is 150 kDa. In spite of its small size, the binding site of Affibody@ molecules is similar
     to that of an antibody.
     (v) Anticalins - Pieris
25   Anticalins® are products developed by the company Pieris ProteoLab AG. They are derived
     from lipocalins, a widespread group of small and robust proteins that are usually involved in
     the physiological transport or storage of chemically sensitive or insoluble compounds.
     Several natural lipocalins occur in human tissues or body liquids.
     The protein architecture is reminiscent of immunoglobulins, with hypervariable loops on top
30   of a rigid framework. However, in contrast with antibodies or their recombinant fragments,
     lipocalins are composed of a single polypeptide chain with 160 to 180 amino acid residues,
     being just marginally bigger than a single immunoglobulin domain.
     The set of four loops, which makes up the binding pocket, shows pronounced structural
     plasticity and tolerates a variety of side chains. The binding site can thus be reshaped in a
35   proprietary process in order to recognize prescribed target molecules of different shape with
     high affinity and specificity.

   WO 2015/162590                                                              PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 57
     One protein of lipocalin family, the bilin-binding protein (BBP) of Pieris brassicae has been
     used to develop anticalins by mutagenizing the set of four loops. One example of a patent
     application describing "anticalins" is WO1 999/16873.
 5   (vi) Affilin - Scil Proteins
     AFFILINTM molecules are small non-immunoglobulin proteins which are designed for
     specific affinities towards proteins and small molecules. New AFFILINTM molecules can be
     very quickly selected from two libraries, each of which is based on a different human
     derived scaffold protein.
10
     AFFILINTM molecules do not show any structural homology to immunoglobulin proteins. Scil
     Proteins employs two AFFILINTM scaffolds, one of which is gamma crystalline, a human
     structural eye lens protein and the other is "ubiquitin" superfamily proteins. Both human
     scaffolds are very small, show high temperature stability and are almost resistant to pH
15   changes and denaturing agents. This high stability is mainly due to the expanded beta
     sheet structure of the proteins.       Examples of gamma crystalline derived proteins are
     described in WO2001/004144 and examples of "ubiquitin-like" proteins are described in
     WO2004/106368.
20   (vii) Protein Epitope Mimetics (PEM)
     PEM are medium-sized, cyclic, peptide-like molecules (MW 1-2kDa) mimicking beta-hairpin
     secondary structures of proteins, the major secondary structure involved in protein-protein
     interactions.
     Grafting antigen-binding domains into alternative frameworks or scaffolds
25   A wide variety of antibody/immunoglobulin frameworks or scaffolds can be employed so
     long as the resulting polypeptide includes at least one binding region which specifically
     binds to ActRIIB. Such frameworks or scaffolds include the 5 main idiotypes of human
     immunoglobulins, or fragments thereof (such as those disclosed elsewhere herein), and
     include immunoglobulins of other animal species, preferably having humanized aspects.
30   Single heavy-chain antibodies such as those identified in camelids are of particular interest
     in this regard. Novel frameworks, scaffolds and fragments continue to be discovered and
     developed by those skilled in the art.
     In one aspect, the compositions of the disclosure may comprise non-immunoglobulin based
35   antibodies     using non-immunoglobulin scaffolds onto which        CDRs of the disclosed
     antibodies can be grafted. Known or future non-immunoglobulin frameworks and scaffolds
     may be employed, as long as they comprise a binding region specific for the target protein

   WO 2015/162590                                                             PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                58
     of SEQ ID NO: 181 (preferably, the ligand binding domain thereof as shown in SEQ ID NO:
     182).    Such compounds are known herein as "polypeptides comprising a target-specific
     binding region". Examples of non-immunoglobulin framework are further described in the
     sections below (camelid antibodies and non-antibody scaffold).
 5   Framework or Fc engineering
     Engineered antibodies comprised in the compositions of the disclosure include those in
     which modifications have been made to framework residues within         VH and/or VL, e.g. to
     improve the properties of the antibody. Typically such framework modifications are made to
     decrease the immunogenicity of the antibody. For example, one approach                 is to
10   "backmutate" one or more framework residues to the corresponding germline sequence.
     More specifically, an antibody that has undergone somatic mutation may contain framework
     residues that differ from the germline sequence from which the antibody is derived. Such
     residues can be identified by comparing the antibody framework sequences to the germline
     sequences from which the antibody is derived. To return the framework region sequences
15   to their germline configuration, the somatic mutations can be "backmutated" to the germline
     sequence by, for example, site-directed mutagenesis or PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Such
     "backmutated" antibodies can also be comprised in the compositions of the disclosure.
     Another type of framework modification involves mutating one or more residues within the
20   framework region, or even within one or more CDR regions, to remove T-cell epitopes to
     thereby reduce the potential immunogenicity of the antibody. This approach is also referred
     to as "deimmunization" and is described in further detail in US2003/0153043.
     In addition or alternative to modifications made within the framework or CDR regions,
25   antibodies of the disclosure may be engineered to include modifications within the Fc
     region, typically to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody, such as serum
     half-life, complement fixation, Fc receptor binding, and/or antigen-dependent cellular
     cytotoxicity. Furthermore, an antibody comprised in the compositions of the disclosure may
     be chemically modified (e.g. one or more chemical moieties can be attached to the
30   antibody) or be modified to alter its glycosylation, again to alter one or more functional
     properties of the antibody. Each of these embodiments is described in further detail below.
     The numbering of residues in the Fc region is that of the EU index of Kabat.
     In one embodiment, the hinge region of CH1 is modified such that the number of cysteine
35   residues in the hinge region is altered, e.g. increased or decreased. This approach is
     described further in US5,677,425. The number of cysteine residues in the hinge region of

   WO 2015/162590                                                               PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 59
     CH1 is altered to, for example, facilitate assembly of the light and heavy chains or to
     increase or decrease the stability of the antibody.
     In another embodiment, the Fc hinge region of an antibody is mutated to decrease the
 5   biological half-life of the antibody. More specifically, one or more amino acid mutations are
     introduced into the CH2-CH3 domain interface region of the Fc-hinge fragment such that
     the antibody has impaired Staphylococcyl protein A (SpA) binding relative to native Fc
     hinge domain SpA binding. This approach is described in further detail in US 6,165,745.
10   In another embodiment, the antibody is modified to increase its biological half-life. Various
     approaches are possible. For example, one or more of the following mutations can be
     introduced: T252L, T254S, T256F, as described in US6,277,375. Alternatively, to increase
     the biological half-life, the antibody can be altered within the CH1 or CL region to contain a
     salvage receptor binding epitope taken from two loops of a CH2 domain of an Fc region of
15   an IgG, as described in US5,869,046 and US6,121,022.
     In yet other embodiments, the Fc region is altered by replacing at least one amino acid
     residue with a different amino acid residue to alter the effector functions of the antibody.
     For example, one or more amino acids can be replaced with a different amino acid residue
20   such that the antibody has an altered affinity for an effector ligand but retains the antigen
     binding ability of the parent antibody. The effector ligand to which affinity is altered can be,
     for example, an Fc receptor or the C1 component of complement. This approach is
     described in further detail in US5,624,821 and US5,648,260, both by Winter et al. In
     particular, residues 234 and 235 may be mutated. In particular, these mutations may be to
25   alanine. Thus in one embodiment the antibody comprised in the compositions of the
     disclosure has a mutation in the Fc region at one or both of amino acids 234 and 235. In
     another embodiment, one or both of amino acids 234 and 235 may be substituted to
     alanine. Substitution of both amino acids 234 and 235 to alanine results in a reduced ADCC
     activity.
30
     In another embodiment, one or more amino acids selected from amino acid residues of the
     described antibodies can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the
     antibody has altered Clq binding and/or reduced or abolished complement dependent
     cytotoxicity (CDC). This approach is described in further detail in US6,194,551.
35
     In another embodiment, one or more amino acid residues of the described antibodies are
     altered to thereby alter the ability of the antibody to fix complement. This approach is
     described further in W094/29351.

   WO 2015/162590                                                             PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                60
     In yet another embodiment, the Fc region of the described antibodies is modified to
     increase the ability of the antibody to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity
     (ADCC) and/or to increase the affinity of the antibody for an Fcy receptor by modifying one
 5   or more amino acids. This approach is described further in WOOO/42072. Moreover, the
     binding sites on human IgG1 for FcyRI, FcyRII, FcyRIII and FcRn have been mapped and
     variants with improved binding have been described (see Shields, R.L. et al., 2001 J. Biol.
     Chen. 276:6591-6604).
10   In still another embodiment, the glycosylation of an antibody comprised in the compositions
     of the disclosure is modified. For example, an aglycoslated antibody can be made (i.e. the
     antibody lacks glycosylation). Glycosylation can be altered to, for example, increase the
     affinity of the antibody for the antigen. Such carbohydrate            modifications can be
     accomplished by; for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the
15   antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that
     result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glycosylation sites to thereby
     eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity of the
     antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Nos.
     5,714,350 and 6,350,861 by Co et al.
20
     Additionally or alternatively, an antibody can be used         that has an altered type of
     glycosylation, such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl
     residues or an antibody having increased bisecting GlcNac structures. Such altered
     glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies.
25   Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the
     antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation
     machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express
     the disclosed recombinant antibodies to thereby produce an antibody with altered
     glycosylation. For example, EP 1,176,195 by Hang et al. describes a cell line with a
30   functionally disrupted     FUT8 gene, which encodes a fucosyl transferase, such that
     antibodies expressed in such a cell line exhibit hypofucosylation.          Therefore, in one
     embodiment, the antibodies comprised in the compositions of the disclosure are produced
     by recombinant expression in a cell line which exhibit hypofucosylation pattern, for example,
     a    mammalian     cell  line with  deficient   expression  of the   FUT8     gene   encoding
35   fucosyltransferase. W003/035835 describes a variant CHO cell line, Lec13 cells, with
     reduced ability to attach fucose to Asn(297)-linked        carbohydrates, also resulting in
     hypofucosylation of antibodies expressed in that host cell (see also Shields, R.L. et al.,
     2002 J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740). W099/54342 describes cell lines engineered to

   WO 2015/162590                                                             PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                61
     express       glycoprotein-modifying     glycosyl      transferases     (e.g.     beta(1,4)-N
     acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII)) such that antibodies expressed in the engineered
     cell lines exhibit increased bisecting GlcNac structures which results in increased ADCC
     activity of the antibodies (see also Umana et al., 1999 Nat. Biotech. 17:176-180).
 5   Alternatively, the antibodies comprised in the compositions of the disclosure can be
     produced in a yeast or a filamentous fungi engineered for mammalian-like glycosylation
     pattern, and capable of producing antibodies lacking fucose as glycosylation pattern (see
     for example EP1297172B1).
10   Another modification of the antibodies herein that is contemplated by the disclosure is
     pegylation. An antibody can be pegylated to, for example, increase the biological (e.g.
     serum) half-life of the antibody. To pegylate an antibody, the antibody, or fragment thereof,
     typically is reacted with polyethylene glycol (PEG), such as a reactive ester or aldehyde
     derivative of PEG, under conditions in which one or more PEG groups become attached to
15   the antibody or antibody fragment. The pegylation can be carried out by an acylation
     reaction or an alkylation reaction with a reactive PEG molecule (or an analogous reactive
     water-soluble polymer). As used herein, the term "polyethylene glycol" is intended to
     encompass any of the forms of PEG that have been used to derivatize other proteins, such
     as mono (Cl-C10) alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol or polyethylene glycol-maleimide.
20   In certain embodiments, the used antibody to be pegylated is an aglycosylated antibody.
     Methods for pegylating proteins are known in the art and can be applied to the disclosed
     antibodies (see for example, EP0154316 and EP0401384).
     Another modification of the antibodies that is contemplated by the disclosure is a conjugate
25   or a protein fusion of at least the antigen-binding region of the antibody comprised in the
     composition of the disclosure to serum protein, such as human serum albumin or a
     fragment thereof to increase half-life of the resulting molecule (see, for example,
     EP0322094).
30   Another possibility is a fusion of at least the antigen-binding region of the antibody
     comprised in the composition of the disclosure to proteins capable of binding to serum
     proteins, such as human serum albumin to increase half-life of the resulting molecule (see,
     for example, EP0486525).
     Methods of engineering altered antibodies
35   As discussed above, the anti-ActRIIB antibodies having CDR sequences,             VH  and VL
     sequences or full length heavy and light chain sequences shown herein can be used to
     create new anti-ActRIIB antibodies by modifying the CDR sequences full length heavy chain

   WO 2015/162590                                                              PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                62
     and/or light chain sequences,   VH and/or VL sequences, or the constant region(s) attached
     thereto. Thus, in another aspect of the disclosure, the structural features of an anti-ActRIIB
     antibody comprised in the compositions of the disclosure are used to create structurally
     related anti-ActRIIB antibodies that retain at least one functional property of the antibodies
 5   comprised in the compositions of the disclosure, such as binding to human ActRIIB but also
     inhibit one or more functional properties of ActRIIB (for example, the inhibition of Smad
     activation).
     For example, one or more CDR regions of the antibodies comprised in the compositions of
10   the present disclosure, or mutations thereof, can be combined recombinantly with known
     framework regions and/or other CDRs to create additional, recombinantly-engineered, anti
     ActRIIB antibodies comprised in the compositions of the disclosure, as discussed above.
     Other types of modifications include those described in the previous section. The starting
     material for the engineering method is one or more of the    VH and/or VL sequences provided
15   herein, or one or more CDR regions thereof. To create the engineered antibody, it is not
     necessary to actually prepare (i.e. express as a protein) an antibody having one or more of
     the VH  and/or VL sequences provided herein, or one or more CDR regions thereof. Rather,
     the information contained in the sequence(s) is used as the starting material to create a
     "second generation" sequence(s) derived from the original sequence(s) and then the
20   "second generation" sequence(s) is prepared and expressed as a protein.
     The altered antibody sequence can also be prepared by screening antibody libraries having
     fixed CDR3 sequences selected among the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 29-42 and
     SEQ     ID   NO:   71-84  or minimal    essential   binding   determinants   as  described   in
25   US2005/0255552 and diversity on CDR1 and CDR2 sequences. The screening can be
     performed according to any screening technology appropriate for screening antibodies from
     antibody libraries, such as phage display technology.
     Standard molecular biology techniques can be used to prepare and express the altered
30   antibody sequence. The antibody encoded by the altered antibody sequence(s) is one that
     retains one, some or all of the functional properties of the anti-ActRIIB antibodies described
     herein, which functional properties include, but are not limited to, specifically binding to
     human ActRIIB and inhibition of Smad activation.
35   The altered antibody may exhibit one or more, two or more, or three or more of the
     functional properties discussed above.

     The functional properties of the altered antibodies can be assessed using standard assays
     available in the art and/or described herein, such as those set forth in the Examples (e.g.
     ELISAs).
     Mutations can be introduced randomly or selectively along all or part of an anti-ActRIIB
 5   antibody coding sequence and the resulting modified anti-ActRIIB antibodies can be
     screened for binding activity and/or other functional properties as described herein.
     Mutational methods have been described in the art. For example, W002/092780 describes
     methods for creating and screening antibody mutations using saturation mutagenesis,
     synthetic ligation assembly, or a combination thereof. Alternatively, W003/074679
10   describes methods of using computational screening methods to optimize physiochemical
     properties of antibodies.
     Nucleic acid molecules encoding antibodies comprised in the compositions of the
     disclosure
     Examples of full length light chain nucleotide sequences optimized for expression in a
15   mammalian cell are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 161-165 and 171-175. Examples of full length
     heavy chain nucleotide sequences optimized for expression in a mammalian cell are shown
     in SEQ ID NOs: 166-170 and 176-180.
     The nucleic acids may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or may be nucleic acids in
20   a partially purified or substantially pure form. A nucleic acid is "isolated" or "rendered
     substantially pure"    when   purified away from      other cellular components or other
     contaminants, e.g. other cellular nucleic acids or proteins, by standard techniques, including
     alkaline/SDS     treatment,   CsCI    banding,    column     chromatography,    agarose    gel
     electrophoresis and others well known in the art. See, F. Ausubel, et al., ed. 1987 Current
25   Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing and Wiley Interscience, New York.
     Nucleic acids can be obtained using standard molecular biology techniques. For antibodies
     expressed by hybridomas (e.g. hybridomas prepared from transgenic mice carrying human
     immunoglobulin genes as described further below), cDNAs encoding the light and heavy
     chains of the antibody made by the hybridoma can be obtained by standard PCR
30   amplification or cDNA cloning techniques. For antibodies obtained from an immunoglobulin
     gene library (e.g. using phage display techniques), nucleic acid encoding the antibody can
     be recovered from various phage clones that are members of the library.
     Once DNA fragments encoding       VH  and VL segments are obtained, these DNA fragments
35   can be further manipulated by standard recombinant DNA techniques, for example to
     convert the variable region genes to full-length antibody chain genes, to Fab fragment
     genes or to an scFv gene. In these manipulations, a VL- or VH-encoding DNA fragment is

   WO 2015/162590                                                               PCT/IB2015/052990

     operatively linked to another DNA molecule, or to a fragment encoding another protein,
     such as an antibody constant region or a flexible linker. The term "operatively linked", as
     used in this context, is intended to mean that the two DNA fragments are joined in a
     functional manner, for example, such that the amino acid sequences encoded by the two
 5   DNA fragments remain in-frame, or such that the protein is expressed under control of a
     desired promoter.
     The isolated DNA encoding the       VH  region can be converted to a full-length heavy chain
     gene by operatively linking the VH-encoding DNA to another DNA molecule encoding heavy
10   chain constant regions (CH1, CH2 and CH3). The sequences of human heavy chain
     constant region genes are known in the art (see e.g. Kabat, E. A., et al. [supra]) and DNA
     fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard PCR amplification.
     The heavy chain constant region can be an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, IgE, IgM or IgD
     constant region. The heavy chain contstant region can be selected among IgG1 isotypes.
15   For a Fab fragment heavy chain gene, the VH-encoding DNA can be operatively linked to
     another DNA molecule encoding only the heavy chain CH1 constant region.
     The isolated DNA encoding the VL region can be converted to a full-length light chain gene
     (as well as to a Fab light chain gene) by operatively linking the VL-encoding DNA to another
20   DNA molecule encoding the light chain constant region, CL. The sequences of human light
     chain constant region genes are known in the art (see e.g. Kabat, E. A., et al. [supra]) and
     DNA fragments encompassing these              regions can   be obtained     by standard     PCR
     amplification. The light chain constant region can be a kappa or a lambda constant region.
25   To create an scFv gene, the     VH- and VL-encoding DNA fragments are operatively linked to
     another fragment encoding a flexible linker, e.g. encoding the amino acid sequence (Gly4
     Ser)3 , such that the VH  and VL sequences can be expressed as a contiguous single-chain
     protein, with the VL and   VH  regions joined by the flexible linker (see e.g. Bird et al., 1988
     Science 242:423-426; Huston et al., 1988 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883;

     Generation of monoclonal antibodies
     Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be produced by a variety of techniques, including
     conventional monoclonal antibody methodology e.g. the standard somatic cell hybridization
     technique of Kohler and Milstein (1975 Nature 256: 495). Many techniques for producing
35   monoclonal antibody can be employed e.g. viral or oncogenic transformation of B
     lymphocytes.

     An animal system for preparing hybridomas is the murine system. Hybridoma production in
     the mouse is a well-established procedure. Immunization protocols and techniques for
     isolation of immunized splenocytes for fusion are known in the art. Fusion partners (e.g.
     murine myeloma cells) and fusion procedures are also known.
 5
     Chimeric or humanized antibodies comprised in the compositions of the present disclosure
     can be prepared based on the sequence of a murine monoclonal antibody prepared as
     described above. DNA encoding the heavy and light chain immunoglobulins can be
     obtained from the murine hybridoma of interest and engineered to contain non-murine (e.g.
10   human) immunoglobulin sequences using standard molecular biology techniques. For
     example, to create a chimeric antibody, the murine variable regions can be linked to human
     constant regions using methods known in the art (see e.g. US4,816,567). To create a
     humanized antibody, the murine CDR regions can be inserted into a human framework
     using methods known in the art (see e.g. U.S. Patent No. 5225539; 5530101; 5585089;
15   5693762 and 6180370).
     In a certain embodiment, the antibodies comprised in the compositions of the disclosure are
     human monoclonal antibodies. Such human monoclonal antibodies directed against ActRIIB
     can be generated using transgenic or transchromosomic mice carrying parts of the human
20   immune system rather than the mouse system. These transgenic and transchromosomic
     mice include mice referred to herein as HuMAb mice and KM mice, respectively, and are
     collectively referred to herein as "human Ig mice."
     The HuMAb mouse (Medarex, Inc.) contains human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that
25   encode un-rearranged human heavy (p and y) and       K light chain immunoglobulin sequences,
     together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous p and    K chain loci (see e.g.
     Lonberg, et al., 1994 Nature 368(6474): 856-859). Accordingly, the mice exhibit reduced
     expression of mouse IgM or       K, and in response to immunization, the introduced human
     heavy and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate
30   high affinity human IgGK monoclonal (Lonberg, N. et al., 1994 [supra]; reviewed in Lonberg,

     In another embodiment, human antibodies comprised in the compositions of the disclosure
     can be raised using a mouse that carries human immunoglobulin sequences on transgenes
     and transchomosomes such as a mouse that carries a human heavy chain transgene and a
10   human light chain transchromosome. Such mice, referred to herein as "KM mice", are
     described in detail in W002/43478.
     Still further, alternative transgenic animal systems expressing human immunoglobulin
     genes are available in the art and can be used to raise anti-ActRIIB antibodies of the
15   disclosure. For example, an alternative transgenic system referred to as the Xenomouse
     (Abgenix, Inc.) can be used. Such mice are described in, e.g. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,939,598;
     6,075,181; 6,114,598; 6, 150,584 and 6,162,963.
     Moreover,      alternative   transchromosomic     animal     systems     expressing    human
20   immunoglobulin genes are available in the art and can be used to raise anti-ActRIIB
     antibodies of the disclosure. For example, mice carrying both a human heavy chain
     transchromosome and a human light chain tranchromosome, referred to as "TC mice" can
     be used; such mice are described in Tomizuka et al., 2000 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
     97:722-727. Furthermore, cows carrying human heavy and light chain transchromosomes
25   have been described in the art (Kuroiwa et al., 2002 Nature Biotechnology 20:889-894) and
     can be used to raise anti-ActRIIB antibodies.
     Human recombinant antibodies comprised in the compositions of the disclosure can also be
     prepared using phage display methods for screening libraries of human immunoglobulin
30   genes. Such phage display methods for isolating human antibodies are established in the
     art or described in the examples below. See for example: U.S. Patent Nos. 5,223,409;
     5,403,484; 5,571,698; 5,427,908; 5,580,717; 5,969,108; 6,172,197; 5,885,793; 6,521,404;

35   Human monoclonal antibodies comprised in the compositions of the disclosure can also be
     prepared using SCID mice into which human immune cells have been reconstituted such
     that a human antibody response can be generated upon immunization. Such mice are

     Generation of hybridomas producing human monoclonal antibodies
     To generate hybridomas producing human monoclonal antibodies comprised in the
     compositions of the disclosure, splenocytes and/or lymph node cells from immunized mice
     can be isolated and fused to an appropriate immortalized cell line, such as a mouse
 5   myeloma cell line. The resulting hybridomas can be screened for the production of antigen
     specific antibodies. For example, single cell suspensions of splenic lymphocytes from
     immunized mice can be fused to one-sixth the number of P3X63-Ag8.653 nonsecreting
     mouse myeloma cells (ATCC, CRL 1580) with 50% PEG. Cells are plated at approximately
     2 x 145 in flat bottom microtiter plates, followed by a two week incubation in selective
10   medium containing 20% fetal Clone Serum, 18% "653" conditioned media, 5% origen
     (IGEN), 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5mM HEPES, 0:055 mM 2
     mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 mg/ml gentamycin and
     1X HAT (Sigma; the HAT is added 24 hours after the fusion). After approximately two
     weeks, cells can be cultured in medium in which the HAT is replaced with HT. Individual
15   wells can then be screened by ELISA for human monoclonal IgM and IgG antibodies. Once
     extensive hybridoma growth occurs, medium can be observed usually after 10-14 days. The
     antibody secreting hybridomas can be replated, screened again, and if still positive for
     human IgG, the monoclonal antibodies can be subcloned at least twice by limiting dilution.
     The stable subclones can then be cultured in vitro to generate small amounts of antibody in
20   tissue culture medium for characterization.
     To purify human monoclonal antibodies, selected hybridomas can be grown in two-liter
     spinner-flasks for monoclonal antibody purification. Supernatants can be filtered and
     concentrated before affinity chromatography with protein A-sepharose (Pharmacia). Eluted
     IgG can be checked by gel electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography to
25   ensure purity. The buffer solution can be exchanged into PBS, and the concentration can be
     determined by OD280 using 1.43 extinction coefficient. The monoclonal antibodies can be
     aliquoted and stored at -80'C.
     Generation of transfectomas producing monoclonal antibodies
     Antibodies comprised in the compositions of the disclosure also can be produced in a host
30   cell transfectoma using, for example, a combination of recombinant DNA techniques and
     gene transfection methods as is well known in the art (e.g. Morrison, S. (1985) Science
     229:1202).
     For example, to express the antibodies, or antibody fragments thereof, DNAs encoding
35   partial or full-length light and heavy chains, can be obtained by standard molecular biology
     techniques (e.g. PCR amplification or cDNA cloning using a hybridoma that expresses the
     antibody of interest) and the DNAs can be inserted into expression vectors such that the

   WO 2015/162590                                                               PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                  68
     genes are operatively linked to transcriptional and translational control sequences. In this
     context, the term "operatively linked" is intended to mean that an antibody gene is ligated
     into a vector such that transcriptional and translational control sequences within the vector
     serve their intended function of regulating the transcription and translation of the antibody
 5   gene. The expression vector and expression control sequences are chosen to be
     compatible with the expression host cell used. The antibody light chain gene and the
     antibody heavy chain gene can be inserted into separate vector or, more typically, both
     genes are inserted into the same expression vector. The antibody genes are inserted into
     the expression vector by standard methods (e.g. ligation of complementary restriction sites
10   on the antibody gene fragment and vector, or blunt end ligation if no restriction sites are
     present). The light and heavy chain variable regions of the antibodies described herein can
     be used to create full-length antibody genes of any antibody isotype by inserting them into
     expression vectors already encoding heavy chain constant and light chain constant regions
     of the desired isotype such that the   VH  segment is operatively linked to the CH segment(s)
15   within the vector and the VL segment is operatively linked to the CL segment within the
     vector. Additionally or alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can encode a signal
     peptide that facilitates secretion of the antibody chain from a host cell. The antibody chain
     gene can be cloned into the vector such that the signal peptide is linked in frame to the
     amino terminus of the antibody chain gene. The signal peptide can be an immunoglobulin
20   signal peptide or a heterologous signal peptide (i.e. a signal peptide from a non
     immunoglobulin protein).
     In addition to the antibody chain genes, the recombinant expression vectors of the
     disclosure carry regulatory sequences that control the expression of the antibody chain
     genes in a host cell. The term "regulatory sequence" is intended to include promoters,
25   enhancers and other expression control elements (e.g. polyadenylation signals) that control
     the transcription or translation of the antibody chain genes. Such regulatory sequences are
     described, for example, in Goeddel (Gene Expression Technology. Methods in Enzymology
     185, Academic Press, San Diego, CA 1990). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art
     that the design of the expression vector, including the selection of regulatory sequences,
30   may depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of
     expression of protein desired, etc.         Regulatory sequences for mammalian host cell
     expression include viral elements that direct high levels of protein expression in mammalian
     cells, such as promoters and/or enhancers derived from cytomegalovirus (CMV), Simian
     Virus 40 (SV40), adenovirus (e.g. the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP)), and
35   polyoma. Alternatively, nonviral regulatory sequences may be used, such as the ubiquitin
     promoter or P-globin promoter. Still further, regulatory elements composed of sequences
     from different sources, such as the SRa promoter system, which contains sequences from

   WO 2015/162590                                                             PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                  69
     the SV40 early promoter and the long terminal repeat of human T cell leukemia virus type 1
     (Takebe, Y. et al., 1988 Mol. Cell. Biol. 8:466-472).
     In addition to the antibody chain genes and regulatory sequences, the recombinant
 5   expression vectors may carry additional sequences, such as sequences that regulate
     replication of the vector in host cells (e.g. origins of replication) and selectable marker
     genes. The selectable marker gene facilitates selection of host cells into which the vector
     has been introduced (see, e.g. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,399,216, 4,634,665 and 5,179,017). For
     example, typically the selectable marker gene confers resistance to drugs, such as G418,
10   hygromycin or methotrexate, on a host cell into which the vector has been introduced.
     Selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene (for use in dhfr
     host cells with methotrexate selection/amplification) and the neo gene (for G418 selection).
     For expression of the light and heavy chains, the expression vector(s) encoding the heavy
15   and light chains is transfected into a host cell by standard techniques. The various forms of
     the term "transfection" are intended to encompass a wide variety of techniques commonly
     used for the introduction of exogenous DNA into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell, e.g.
     electroporation, calcium-phosphate precipitation, DEAE-dextran transfection and the like. It
     is theoretically possible to express the antibodies of the disclosure in either prokaryotic or
20   eukaryotic host cells. Expression of antibodies in eukaryotic cells, in particular mammalian
     host cells, is discussed because such eukaryotic cells, and in particular mammalian cells,
     are more likely than prokaryotic cells to assemble and secrete a properly folded and
     immunologically active antibody. Prokaryotic expression of antibody genes has been
     reported to be ineffective for production of high yields of active antibody (Boss, M. A. and
25   Wood, C. R., 1985 Immunology Today 6:12-13).
     Mammalian host cells for expressing the recombinant antibodies comprised in the
     compositions of the disclosure include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) (including dhfr
     CHO cells, described Urlaub and Chasing, 1980 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216-4220
30   used with a DH FR selectable marker, e.g. as described in R.J. Kaufman and P.A. Sharp,
     1982 Mol. Biol. 159:601-621), NSO myeloma cells, COS cells and SP2 cells. In one
     embodiment the host cells are CHO K1PD cells. In particular, for use with NSO myeloma
     cells, another expression system is the GS gene expression system shown in W087/04462,
     W089/01036 and EP 338,841. Mammalian host cells for expressing the recombinant
35   antibodies comprised in the compositions of the disclosure include mammalian cell lines
     deficient for FUT8 gene expression, for example as described in US6,946,292B2. When

     sufficient to allow for expression of the antibody in the host cells or secretion of the antibody
     into the culture medium in which the host cells are grown. Antibodies can be recovered from
     the culture medium using standard protein purification methods.
     Immunoconjuqates
 5   In another aspect, the present disclosure features compositions comprising an anti-ActRIIB
     antibody, or a fragment thereof, conjugated to a therapeutic moiety, such as a cytotoxin, a
     drug (e.g., an immunosuppressant) or a radiotoxin. Such conjugates are referred to herein
     as "immunoconjugates".          Immunoconjugates that include one or more cytotoxins are
     referred to as "immunotoxins." A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is
10   detrimental to (e.g., kills) cells.
     Cytotoxins can be conjugated to antibodies of the disclosure using linker technology
     available in the art. Examples of linker types that have been used to conjugate a cytotoxin
     to an antibody include, but are not limited to, hydrazones, thioethers, esters, disulfides and
15   peptide-containing linkers. A linker can be chosen that is, for example, susceptible to
     cleavage by low pH within the lysosomal compartment or susceptible to cleavage by
     proteases, such as proteases preferentially expressed in tumor tissue such as cathepsins
     (e.g. cathepsins B, C, D).

     Antibodies comprised in the compositions of the present disclosure also can be conjugated
     to a radioactive isotope to generate cytotoxic radiopharmaceuticals, also referred to as
     radioimmunoconjugates. Examples of radioactive isotopes that can be conjugated to
30   antibodies for use diagnostically or therapeutically include, but are not limited to, iodine ,
     indium", yttrium9", and lutetium177 . Methods for preparing radioimmunconjugates are
     established in the art. Examples of radioimmunoconjugates are commercially available,
     including ZevalinTM (DEC Pharmaceuticals) and BexxarTM (Corixa Pharmaceuticals), and
     similar methods can be used to prepare radioimmunoconjugates using the antibodies of the
35   disclosure.

   WO 2015/162590                                                                PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                  71
     The antibody conjugates comprised in the compositions of the disclosure can be used to
     modify a given biological response, and the drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to
     classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or
     polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for
 5   example, an enzymatically active toxin, or active fragment thereof, such as abrin, ricin A,
     pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor or
     interferon-y; or, biological response       modifiers such as, for example,         lymphokines,
     interleukin-1 ("IL-1"), interleukin-2 ("IL-2"), interleukin-6 ("IL-6"), granulocyte macrophage
     colony stimulating factor ("GM-CSF"), granulocyte colony stimulating factor ("G-CSF"), or
10   other growth factors.
     Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moiety to antibodies are well known, see, e.g.
     Amon et al., "Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy", in
     Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et al. (eds.), pp. 243-56 (Alan R. Liss,
15   Inc. 1985); Hellstrom et al., "Antibodies For Drug Delivery", in Controlled Drug Delivery (2nd
     Ed.), Robinson et al. (eds.), pp. 623-53 (Marcel Dekker, Inc. 1987); Thorpe, "Antibody
     Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review", in Monoclonal Antibodies '84:
     Biological And Clinical Applications, Pinchera et al. (eds.), pp. 475-506 (1985); "Analysis,
     Results, And Future Prospective Of The Therapeutic Use Of Radiolabeled Antibody In
20   Cancer Therapy", in Monoclonal Antibodies For Cancer Detection And Therapy, Baldwin et
     al. (eds.), pp. 303-16 (Academic Press 1985), and Thorpe et al., "The Preparation And
     Cytotoxic Properties Of Antibody-Toxin Conjugates", Inmunol. Rev., 62:119-58 (1982).
     Bispecific molecules
     In another aspect, the present disclosure features compositions comprising bispecific or
25   multispecific molecules comprising an anti-ActRIIB antibody, or a fragment thereof, of the
     disclosure. An antibody comprised in the compositions of the disclosure, or antigen-binding
     regions thereof, can be derivatized or linked to another functional molecule, e.g. another
     peptide or protein (e.g. another antibody or ligand for a receptor) to generate a bispecific
     molecule that binds to at least two different binding sites or target molecules. The antibody
30   of the disclosure may in fact be derivatized or linked to more than one other functional
     molecule to generate multi-specific molecules that bind to more than two different binding
     sites and/or target molecules; such multi-specific molecules are also intended to be
     encompassed by the term "bispecific molecule" as used herein. To create a bispecific
     molecule of the disclosure, an antibody of the disclosure can be functionally linked (e.g. by
35   chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more
     other binding molecules, such as another antibody, antibody fragment, peptide or binding
     mimetic, such that a bispecific molecule results.

   WO 2015/162590                                                             PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                  72
     Accordingly, the present disclosure includes compositions comprising bispecific molecules
     comprising at least one first binding specificity for ActRIIB and a second binding specificity
     for a second target epitope. For example, the second target epitope may be another epitope
 5   of ActRIIB different from the first target epitope.
     Additionally, for the compositions in which the bispecific molecule is multi-specific, the
     molecule can further include a third binding specificity, in addition to the first and second
     target epitope.
10
     In one embodiment, the bispecific molecules of the disclosed compositions comprise as a
     binding specificity at least one antibody, or an antibody fragment thereof, including, e.g. an
     Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2, Fv, or a single chain Fv. The antibody may also be a light chain or heavy
     chain dimer, or any minimal fragment thereof such as a Fv or a single chain construct as
15   described in Ladner et al. US4,946,778, the contents of which is expressly incorporated by
     reference.
     Other antibodies which can be employed in the bispecific molecules are murine, chimeric
     and humanized monoclonal antibodies.
20
     The bispecific molecules comprised in the compositions of the present disclosure can be
     prepared by conjugating the constituent binding specificities, using methods known in the
     art. For example, each binding specificity of the bispecific molecule can be generated
     separately and then conjugated to one another. When the binding specificities are proteins
25   or peptides, a variety of coupling or cross-linking agents can be used for covalent
     conjugation.   Examples of cross-linking agents include protein A, carbodiimide,            N
     succinimidyl-S-acetyl-thioacetate (SATA), 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB),       o
     phenylenedimaleimide (oPDM), N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), and
     sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohaxane-l-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC) (see e.g.
30   Karpovsky et al., 1984 J. Exp. Med. 160:1686; Liu, MA et al., 1985 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
     USA 82:8648). Other methods include those described in Paulus, 1985 Behring Ins. Mitt.
     No. 78,118-132; Brennan et al., 1985 Science 229:81-83), and Glennie et al., 1987 J.
     Immunol. 139: 2367-2375). Conjugating agents are SATA and sulfo-SMCC, both available
     from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL).
35
     When the binding specificities are antibodies, they can be conjugated by sulfhydryl bonding
     of the C-terminus hinge regions of the two heavy chains. In a particularly embodiment, the

   WO 2015/162590                                                             PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 73
     hinge region is modified to contain an odd number of sulfhydryl residues, for example one,
     prior to conjugation.
     Alternatively, both binding specificities can be encoded in the same vector and expressed
 5   and assembled in the same host cell. This method is particularly useful where the bispecific
     molecule is a mAb x mAb, mAb x Fab, Fab x F(ab') 2 or ligand x Fab fusion protein. A
     bispecific molecule comprised in the compositions of the disclosure can be a single chain
     molecule comprising one single chain antibody and a binding determinant, or a single chain
     bispecific molecule comprising two        binding determinants.   Bispecific molecules may
10   comprise at least two single chain molecules. Methods for preparing bispecific molecules
     are described for example in U.S. Patent Numbers 5,260,203; 5,455,030; 4,881,175;
     5,132,405; 5,091,513; 5,476,786; 5,013,653; 5,258,498; and 5,482,858.
     Binding of the bispecific molecules to their specific targets can be confirmed by, for
15   example, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), FACS
     analysis, bioassay (e.g. growth inhibition), or Western Blot assay. Each of these assays
     generally detects the presence of protein-antibody complexes of particular interest by
     employing a labeled reagent (e.g. an antibody) specific for the complex of interest.

   WO 2015/162590                                                              PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 74
     Multivalent antibodies
     In another aspect, the present disclosure relates to compositions comprising multivalent
     antibodies comprising at least two identical or different antigen-binding portions of the
     disclosed antibodies binding to ActRIIB. In one embodiment, the multivalent antibodies
 5   provide at least two, three or four antigen-binding portions of the antibodies. The antigen
     binding portions can be linked together via protein fusion or covalent or non-covalent
     linkage. Alternatively, methods of linkage have been described for the bispecific molecules.
     In various embodiments, the composition can be mono-, bi- or multi-valent (e.g., capable of
     binding to one, two or several antigens), and/or mono-, bi- or multi-specific (e.g., having
10   binding region(s) capable of binding to one, two or several different antigens). a composition
     can be any combination of these, e.g., monovalent and mono-specific (having one binding
     region that binds to one antigen or epitope); or bi-valent and bi-specific (having two binding
     regions, each of which bind to a different epitope or antigen); or bi-valent and mono-specific
     (having two binding regions, each of which bind to the same epitope or antigen); or multi
15   valent and mono-specific (having several binding regions that all bind to the same antigen
     or epitope); or multi-valent and multi-specific (having several binding regions that bind to
     several different antigens or epitopes).
     Pharmaceutical compositions
     In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a composition, e.g. a pharmaceutical
20   composition, containing one or a combination of the above described antibodies/monoclonal
     antibodies,    or   antigen-binding   portion(s)  thereof,   formulated     together  with   a
     pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may include one or a combination
     of (e.g. two or more different) the described antibodies, or immunoconjugates or bispecific
     molecules. For example, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure can comprise a
25   combination of antibodies that bind to different epitopes on the target antigen or that have
     complementary activities.
     Pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure also can be administered in combination
     therapy, i.e. combined with other agents. For example, the combination therapy can include
30   an anti-ActRII antibody of the present disclosure combined with at least one other muscle
     mass/strength increasing agent, for example, IGF-1, IGF-2 or variants of IGF-1 or IGF-2, an
     anti-myostatin antibody, a myostatin propeptide, a myostatin decoy protein that binds
     ActRIIB but does not activate it, a beta 2 agonist, a Ghrelin agonist, a SARM, GH
     agonists/mimetics or follistatin. Examples of therapeutic agents that can be used in
35   combination therapy are described in greater detail below in the section on uses of the
     antibodies of the disclosure.

   WO 2015/162590                                                                PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 75
     As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any and all solvents,
     dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption
     delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. The carrier should be
 5   suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral, spinal or epidermal
     administration (e.g. by injection or infusion), preferably for intravenous injection or infusion.
     Depending     on  the   route   of administration,    the   active   compound,    i.e. antibody,
     immunoconjuage, or bispecific molecule, may be coated in a material to protect the
     compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the
10   compound.
     The    pharmaceutical    compositions    of the    disclosure    may   include   one   or   more
     pharmaceutically acceptable salts. A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a salt that
     retains the desired biological activity of the parent compound and does not impart any
15   undesired toxicological effects (see e.g. Berge, S.M., et al., 1977 J. Pharm. Sci. 66:1-19).
     Examples of such salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Acid addition
     salts include those derived from nontoxic inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, nitric,
     phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphorous and the like, as well as from
     nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono- and di-carboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted
20   alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids
     and the like. Base addition salts include those derived from alkaline earth metals, such as
     sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic
     amines,    such   as  N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine,       N-methylglucamine,    chloroprocaine,
     choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, procaine and the like.
25
     A pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure also may include a pharmaceutically
     acceptable anti-oxidant. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include:
     water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate,
     sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl
30   palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl
     gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and metal chelating agents, such as citric acid,
     ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the
     like.
35   Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers that may be employed in the
     pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure include water, ethanol, polyols (such as
     glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof,
     vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper

   WO 2015/162590                                                             PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                76
     fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by
     the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of
     surfactants.
 5   These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents,
     emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of presence of microorganisms may
     be ensured both by sterilization procedures, supra, and by the inclusion of various
     antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid,
     and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium
10   chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the
     injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay
     absorption such as, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
     Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and
     sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or
15   dispersion. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is
     known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the
     active compound, use thereof in the pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure is
     contemplated. Supplementary       active compounds can also be incorporated          into the
     compositions.
20
     Therapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of
     manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion,
     liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier can be
     a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example,
25   glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable
     mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating
     such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion
     and by the use of surfactants. In many cases, one can include isotonic agents, for example,
     sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition.
30   Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in
     the composition an agent that delays absorption for example, monostearate salts and
     gelatin.
     Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the
35   required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of agents enumerated
     above, as required, followed by sterilization microfiltration. Generally, dispersions are
     prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic
     dispersion medium and the required other agents from those enumerated above. In the

   WO 2015/162590                                                             PCT/IB2015/052990
                                               77
     case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the methods of
     preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying lyophilizationn) that yield a powder of the
     active agent plus any additional desired agent from a previously sterile-filtered solution
     thereof.
 5
     The amount of active agent which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a
     single dosage form will vary depending upon the subject being treated, and the particular
     mode of administration. The amount of active agent which can be combined with a carrier
     material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the composition
10   which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will
     range from about 0.01 per cent to about ninety-nine percent of active agent, from about 0.1
     per cent to about 70 per cent, or from about 1 percent to about 30 percent of active agent in
     combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
15   Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g. a therapeutic
     response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be
     administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated
     by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate
     parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of
20   dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary
     dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active
     compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the
     required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the
     disclosure are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active
25   compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent
     in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in
     individuals.
     For administration of the antibody comprising composition, the antibody dosage ranges
30   from about 0.0001 to about 100 mg/kg, and more usually about 0.01 to about 30 mg/kg, of
     the host body weight. For example dosages are about 1 mg/kg body weight, about 3 mg/kg
     body weight, about 5 mg/kg body weight or about 10 mg/kg body weight within the ranges
     of about 1-10 mg/kg e.g., about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 mg/kg body weight, preferably
     once every 4 weeks. Such administration is preferably carried out intraveneously. Dosage
35   regimens for an anti-ActRII antibody of the disclosure, e.g., bimagrumab, include about 1
     mg/kg body weight or about 3 mg/kg body weight or about 10 mg/kg body once every four
     weeks weight by intravenous administration.

   WO 2015/162590                                                               PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                78
     Also, the dosage ranges above can be administered at corresponding fixed doses on the
     basis of a 70 kg adult individual average weight.
     For example dosages are about 70 mg, about 210 mg, about 350 mg or about 500 mg or
     about 700 mg within the ranges of about 70-700 mg/kg e.g., about 70, 140, 210, 280, 350,
 5   420, 490, 560, 630, 700 mg/kg body weight, preferably once every 4 weeks
     Preferably the compositions of the disclosure are for use in accelerating/improving physical
     recovery in a patient with disuse atrophy triggered by reduced mobility due to a hip fracture
     and consequent major surgery.

     In some methods, two or more monoclonal antibodies with different binding specificities are
     comprised in the compositions of the disclosure and, thus, administered simultaneously, in
     which case the dosage of each antibody administered falls within the ranges indicated. An
     antibody is usually administered on multiple occasions. Intervals between single dosages
15   can be, for example, weekly, monthly, every three months, every six months or yearly.
     Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring blood levels of antibody to the
     target antigen in the patient. In some methods, dosage is adjusted to achieve a plasma
     antibody concentration of about 1- about 1000 pg/ml and in some methods about 25- about
     300 pg/ml. For example, an ActRII antibody of the disclosure could be co-administered with
20   an anti-myostatin antibody.
     Dosage and frequency vary depending on the half-life of the antibody in the patient. In
     general, human antibodies show the longest half-life, followed by humanized antibodies,
     chimeric antibodies, and nonhuman antibodies. The dosage and frequency of administration
25   can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. In prophylactic
     applications, a relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent intervals over a
     long period of time. Some patients continue to receive treatment for the rest of their lives. In
     therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is sometimes
     required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated or until the patient shows
30   partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patient can be
     administered a prophylactic regime.
     Administration of a "therapeutically effective dosage" of an anti-ActRII antibody comprised
     in the compositions of the disclosure can result in a decrease in severity of disease
35   symptoms, an increase in frequency and duration of disease symptom-free periods, or a
     prevention of impairment or disability due to the disease affliction i.e. an increase in muscle
     mass and/or strength.

     The active compounds can be prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against
     rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal
     patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers
     can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen,
 5   polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations
     are patented or generally known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g. Sustained and
     Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J.R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New
     York, 1978.
10   Therapeutic compositions can be administered with medical devices known in the art.
     Uses and methods of the disclosure
     The compositions of the present disclosure and the disclosed antibodies have therapeutic
     utilities, because they have an impact on the treatment of sporadic inclusion body myositis
     or on the amelioration of the condition of patients affected by sporadic inclusion body
15   myositis or on the reduction of symptoms associated with sporadic inclusion body myositis.
     The term "subject" or "individual" as used herein is intended to include human and non
     human animals. Non-human animals include all vertebrates, e.g. mammals and non
     mammals, such as non-human primates, sheep, dogs, cats, cows, horses, chickens,
20   amphibians, and reptiles.
     Hence, the disclosure also relates to methods of treatment in which compositions of the
     disclosure or the disclosed myostatin antagonists, e.g., myostatin binding molecules or
     ActRII binding molecules, preferably ActRII binding molecules, more preferably antibodies
25   to ActRII, e.g, bimagrumab or BYM338, inhibit, i.e. antagonize, the function of ActRII and
     thereby resulting in the improvement in hip fracture surgery recovery. The disclosure
     provides a method of accelerating/improving physical recovery in a patient with disuse
     atrophy triggered by reduced mobility due to a hip fracture and consequent major surgery
     comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a myostatin antagonist, e.g.,
30   myostatin binding molecule or ActRIIB binding molecule, preferably ActRIIB binding
     molecule, more preferably an antagonist antibody to ActRIIB, e.g, bimagrumab or BYM338
     or the disclosed compositions to the patient.
     Examples of myostatin antagonists, e.g., myostatin binding molecules or ActRII binding
35   molecules, preferably ActRIIB binding molecules, more preferably antagonist antibodies to
     ActRIIB, e.g, bimagrumab or BYM338, that can be used in the disclosed methods of
     treatment are those disclosed or described in detail above. In certain embodiments, the

   WO 2015/162590                                                              PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 80
     ActRII antibodies (e.g., bimagrumab or BYM338) are comprised in the herein disclosed
     inventive compositions.
     The disclosure also relates to the use of a myostatin antagonist, e.g., myostatin binding
 5   molecule or ActRIIB binding molecule, preferably ActRIIB binding molecule, more preferably
     an antagonist antibody to ActRII, e.g, BYM338, in the manufacture of a medicament for
     accelerating/improving physical recovery in a patient with disuse atrophy triggered by
     reduced mobility due to a hip fracture and consequent major surgery
10   In a further embodiment, the patient may be one who has not responded to previous
     treatments. For example, the patient may not have responded to treatment with IGF-1, IGF
     2 or variants of IGF-1 or IGF-2, an anti-myostatin antibody, a myostatin propeptide, a
     myostatin decoy protein that binds ActRIIB but does not activate it, a beta 2 agonist, a
     Ghrelin agonist, a SARM, GH agonists/mimetics or follistatin. A simple way of measuring a
15   patient's response to treatment may be timing how long it takes for a patient to climb a
     known height of stairs and comparing the results both before and after treatment.
     The myostatin antagonist, e.g., myostatin binding molecule or ActRII binding molecule,
     preferably ActRII binding molecule, more preferably an antagonist antibody to ActRII, e.g.,
20   bimagrumab or BYM338, may be administered as the sole active agent or in conjunction
     with, e.g. as an adjuvant to or in combination to, other drugs e.g. IGF-1, IGF-2 or variants of
     IGF-1 or IGF-2, an anti-myostatin antibody, a myostatin propeptide, a myostatin decoy
     protein that binds ActRIIB but does not activate it, a beta 2 agonist, a Ghrelin agonist, a
     SARM, GH agonists/mimetics or follistatin. For example, the antagonists of the disclosure
25   may be used in combination with an IGF-1 mimetic as disclosed in W02007/146689.
     In accordance with the foregoing the present disclosure provides in a yet further aspect:
     A method or use as defined above comprising co-administration, e.g. concomitantly or in
     sequence, of a therapeutically effective amount of a myostatin antagonist, e.g., myostatin
30   binding molecule or ActRII binding molecule, preferably an ActRII or binding molecule, more
     preferably an antagonist antibody to ActRII, e.g, bimagrumab or BYM338, and at least one
     second drug substance, said second drug substance being IGF-1, IGF-2 or variants of IGF
     1 or IGF-2, an anti-myostatin antibody, a myostatin propeptide, a myostatin decoy protein
     that binds ActRII but does not activate it, a beta 2 agonist, a Ghrelin agonist, a SARM, GH
35   agonists/mimetics or follistatin.
             Kits

   WO 2015/162590                                                               PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                81
             The invention also encompasses kits which may comprise a myostatin antagonist,
     e.g., a myostatin binding molecule (e.g., a myostatin antibody or antigen binding fragment
     thereof, e.g., bimagrumab or BYM338) or myostatin receptor (i.e., ActRIIB receptor) binding
     molecule (e.g., anti-ActRIIB antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof) (e.g., in liquid or
 5   lyophilized form) or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the myostatin antagonist
     (described supra).     Additionally, such kits may comprise means for administering the
     myostatin antagonist (e.g., a syringe and vial, a prefilled syringe, a prefilled pen) and
     instructions for use.    These kits may contain additional therapeutic agents (described
     supra), e.g., for delivery in combination with the enclosed myostatin antagonist, e.g.,
10   BYM338.
            The phrase "means for administering" is used to indicate any available implement for
     systemically administering a drug top a patient, including, but not limited to, a pre-filled
     syringe, a vial and syringe, an injection pen, an autoinjector, an i.v. drip and bag, a pump,
     etc. With such items, a patient may self-administer the drug (i.e., administer the drug on
15   their own behalf) or a physician may administer the drug.
     Each component of the kit is usually enclosed within an individual container, and all of the
     various containers are within a single package along with instructions for use.

     Study design
     This is a Phase Ila/Ilb, 56-week, 4-treatment arm, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind,
     placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical study (Figure 8). A screening epoch of up to 5
20   weeks postoperatively will be used to assess eligibility. At baseline visit, 245 eligible
     patients will be randomized 2:1:2:2 to either placebo, bimagrumab 70 mg, bimagrumab 210
     mg, or bimagrumab 700 mg. Randomized patients will be treated for 12 months and will
     receive investigational treatment every 4 weeks for a total of 13 doses. When all patients
     have completed 24 weeks of treatment, an endpoint analysis will be conducted to assess
25   the primary and secondary endpoints together with key safety measures. After completing
     the treatment epoch, patients will enter a 4-week post-treatment follow up. The end of study
     visit (EOS) will be 8 weeks after receiving the last dose of investigational treatment.
     There are 3 study epochs:
     Screening epoch: Informed consent will be obtained prior to implementing any study
30   specific procedures. The screening epoch will start immediately once the patient starts to
     walk (defined as the subject completing a 4 meter gait speed test) and is able to enter a
     rehabilitation program, which depending on the individual patient's functional recovery is
     expected to start approximately 7 days after surgery. The screening epoch may last for a
     maximum of 4 weeks thereafter (up to 35 days postoperatively); however, it should be
35   completed as soon as possible to ensure that patients enter the trial at the beginning of their
     functional recovery.

                                                  101
     Successful surgical intervention for fracture repair, evaluated by the investigator as 1)
     surgical fixation or arthroplasty according to manufacturer's instruction as confirmed by X
     ray AND 2) completed surgical wound healing, must be confirmed prior to patient
     randomization.
 5   After confirming that all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria have been met,
     the patient will be randomized.
     Randomization must occur as soon as possible after the initiation of the screening so that
     treatment with study medication can start shortly after the patient's individual "functional
     baseline".
10   The randomization date will be the 'Day 1' study visit (baseline/randomization) and used as
     reference for visit scheduling throughout the study period.
     Treatment epoch:
      First dose of investigational treatment will be administered on the day of randomization
15   (Day 1). At every visit, all evaluations will be performed prior to the administration of
     investigational treatment except for post-dose PK sampling. Patients will receive 13 doses,
     one every 4 weeks. Final dose will be administered at the Week 48 visit and the treatment
     epoch will end 4 weeks later at Week 52 visit (End of Treatment).
     Investigational treatment will be administered in addition to the local standard of care for hip
20   fracture and combined with the local rehabilitation program (including resistance training)
     that needs to comply with the protocol-mandated minimum requirements.
     Post treatment Follow-up epoch: After completing the End of Treatment visit, patients will
     enter a post-treatment follow-up epoch and complete the study 4 weeks later at week 56 (or
     8 weeks after receiving last dose of investigational treatment).
25   Rationale of study design
     There is no published Health Authority guidance to provide considerations for this study
     population or for the treatment of postsurgical disuse atrophy. The working hypothesis is
     that drug-induced increases in muscle mass combined with standard rehabilitation will lead
     to enhanced recovery of muscle strength and endurance with subsequent improvements of
30   functional performance compared with patients receiving standard of care only. As a result
     of improved physical performance, a decrease in the incidence of falls and related
     injuries/fractures can be expected.

                                                 102
     Rationale of dose/regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment
     The choice of doses, frequency, route of administration, and duration of treatment is based
     on results of three Phase I studies: the First in Human (FIH) study (CBYM338X2101 Part
     A), casting study in healthy male volunteers (CBYM338X2101 Part B) and the multi-dose
 5   study (CBYM338X2102) in healthy volunteers.
     Dose and frequency
     In the Phase I trials, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses were effective in increasing the TMV in
     healthy volunteers thus they are expected to be effective in patients after hip fracture.
     Results in healthy volunteers (CBYM338X2101 and CBYM338X2102) indicated that thigh
10   muscle volume, as assessed by MRI, increased comparably for single doses of 10 mg/kg
     and 30 mg/kg, but the effect of 30 mg/kg lasted longer. With 3 repeated monthly doses of
     bimagrumab, there was a comparable increase in TMV in healthy adults at 3 mg/kg and 10
     mg/kg, even though it is thought that 3 mg/kg causes complete receptor occupancy for
     approximately half the duration of 10 mg/kg over a dosing interval. In healthy volunteers
15   (CBYM338X2101), a limited and transient effect on the TMV was observed after infusion of
     a single dose of 1 mg/kg bimagrumab. The 1 mg/kg dose is therefore expected to be a non
     effective or a minimally effective dose in this study.
     This study will evaluate fixed i.v. doses of bimagrumab 70, 210, or 700 mg administered
     every 4 weeks. The fixed dose equivalent of the mg/kg doses used in previous studies was
20   calculated based on the mean patients' weight and similar calculation was used for the
     current study based on the mean patients' weight rounded to 70 kg reported in literature for
     hip fracture patients (66±12 kg) (Mak et al 2014). Therefore, this study will evaluate fixed i.v.
     doses of bimagrumab 70 (initially 1mg/kg), 210 (initially 3 mg/kg), or 700 mg (initially 10
     mg/kg).
25   Weight-based dosing was initially chosen to ensure consistent exposure across all patient's
     body weight in the respective treatment arms. Nonetheless, with either fixed- or weight
     based dosing, it is not expected that randomized patients will be exposed to bimagrumab at
     Cmax levels exceeding those experienced with the highest tested dose in previous studies,
     i.e. 30 mg/kg.
30   Dosing frequency every 4 weeks is based on observations from PK/PD studies where the
     efficacy reached the same plateau with both the 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks dosing and the 30
     mg every 8 weeks i.v. dosing.
     Route of administration
     Study medication will be administered via intravenous infusion over 30 minutes, which was
35   tested in study BYM338X2107 and documented to be well tolerated.

   WO 2015/162590                                                                 PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 103
     Treatment duration
     A recent study in hip fracture patients treated with an anabolic agent (ibutamoren mesylate)
     showed that a 6-month (but not a 3-month) treatment was effective in improving physical
     function as measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery and its component gait
 5   speed score (Adunsky et al 2011). Since increases in LBM are expected to reach their
     maximum after 2-3 months of the treatment and functional benefits are expected to be
     observed with a delay, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that 6 months duration of
     therapy is sufficient for increasing the functional recovery of hip fracture patients.
     However, since hip fracture recovery takes about 1 year, there could be an added benefit of
10   longer treatment up to 12 months (secondary objective), especially if the number of falls can
     be reduced over a 12-month period. The primary risk factor for a secondary hip fracture is a
     fall, and over 90% of all fractures occur after a fall. Using Medicare and Medicaid data from
     hip fracture patients 65 years of age and older, Bischoff-Ferrari et al (2010) reported that
     10.3% suffered a second hip fracture within 3 years - 51% of second hip fractures occurred
15   within 6 months of the first fracture and 75% occurred within a year.
     Timing of first dose
     The efficacy of bimagrumab is expected to be optimal when coupled with physical activity,
     therefore the timing of the first dose is aligned to be close to the start of physical therapy
     (i.e., 7 days-4 weeks and up to 6 weeks post-surgery). A number of studies reviewed by
20   Chudyk et al 2009 and English and Paddon-Jones D 2010 indicate that early ambulation
     following surgical fixation of a hip fracture may improve patient outcomes such as early
     physical function, rate of discharge to home, complications and hospital readmissions.
     Recent reviews also argue that early (and preferably more                 intensive) initiation of
     physiotherapy is critical for overcoming the early loss of muscle strength after hip fracture
25   surgery (Bandholm and Kehlet 2012), which is an important predictor of the course of
     recovery.
     Rationale for choice of comparator
     The choice of placebo as a control agent is necessary to obtain information concerning the
     specific versus non-specific effects of the active treatment and provides the best way of
30   evaluating the efficacy and assessing the safety and tolerability of bimagrumab.
     In the absence of any approved pharmacological comparator (i.e., a 'gold standard' or
     'standard of care') in disuse atrophy, placebo will be used in addition to vitamin D (minimum
     800 IU per day) and physical rehabilitation.

     Expected Benefits
     It is expected that as seen in healthy volunteers and patients with sIBM, the hip fracture
     patients will have an increase in muscle mass that may translate to better function and
     faster return to mobility. Over study duration, the number of falls might be reduced leading
 5   to a reduction in secondary hip fractures.

         and aluminum flip-off caps.
 5   2.          Additional study treatment
     Local standard of care therapy after hip fracture
     Local standard of care therapy to manage patients peri/post operatively (such as for
     thrombosis      prophylaxis,   pain   management,       calcium  supplementation,    secondary
     osteoporosis prevention) is acceptable and may be used according to the national or local
10   guidelines.
     Protocol-mandated additional study treatment
     This protocol requires adherence to:
     *   Rehabilitation (minimum requirements are defined below)
     *   Vitamin D supplementation (minimum 800 international units (IU) daily)
15   Minimum rehabilitation requirements
     Rehabilitation after hip fracture is assumed to be a prerequisite to maximize the effect of
     bimagrumab in this indication. Especially resistance and strength training in the course of
     rehabilitation may work synergistically with an anabolic compound that induces muscle
     hypertrophy. Ideally, a standard rehabilitation program would be performed by all patients,
20   to avoid variability in assessing the efficacy of various bimagrumab dose regimens.
     In this study, however, no detailed single rehabilitation protocol will be defined for two
     reasons:
     *   The compound should work in different scenarios including different rehabilitation
         programs and
25   e   Harmonization across multiple sites with different rehabilitation approaches does not
         seem feasible. There is general agreement in the medical community about the principal
         phases of rehabilitation including the beneficial impact of a resistance exercise program.
         This protocol will ensure that each patient enrolled receives the minimum required
         rehabilitation elements as a basis for the synergistic action of exercise training with
30       bimagrumab (Table 1). Adherence to the program will be monitored by the use of an
         electronic exercise adherence diary completed by the patient in conjunction with the
         investigative team.

   Key efficacy assessments
   Total LBM and aLBM by DXA

   WO 2015/162590                                                                PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                  107
     The clinical relevance of monitoring the changes of LBM (Lean Body Mass) lies in the fact
     that the drug-induced increase in muscle mass is a prerequisite of the subsequent
     functional improvement.        Previous work on     testosterone supplements have already
     highlighted this by documenting that in order to enhance muscle strength and physical
 5   function threshold improvements in LBM and appendicular skeletal muscle mass are
     necessary (Sattler et al 2011). In line with this previous observation, preliminary data on
     sIBM patients receiving a single dose of bimagrumab (30 mg/kg) showed that drug-induced
     increases in LBM (plateau at 8-12 weeks) were followed by significant increases in physical
     performance as quantified by the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at Week 24 (Figure 6-1).
10   Moreover, when LBM declined upon drug withdrawal and returned to baseline, the
     functional benefits also vanished. Thus, increases in LBM are clinically relevant reflections
     of the expected functional benefits.
     Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry          provides a recommended        alternative method for
     estimating skeletal muscle mass with advantages of inexpensiveness, short scan-time,
15   much lower radiation exposure to patients and more widespread availability in clinical and
     research settings as compared with the gold-standard              methods, e.g. computerized
     tomography (CT) and MRI.
     Studies document that the DXA approach gives mean total body skeletal muscle estimates
     that agree closely with muscle measured by CT or MRI, although DXA tends to
20   systematically overestimate total body skeletal muscle by about 5% (Wana et al 1996, Chen
     et al2007). This is due to the fact that DXA may also take into account organ lean mass of
     the trunk, the skin, and non-fat components in the adipose tissue when measuring total
     LBM (Wan       et al 976).
     Focusing lean mass measurement on aLBM (legs plus arms) or leg LBM may only slightly
25   improve the estimation of skeletal muscle mass (Chen et al 2007). However, when used in
     a monitoring setting, the advantages of eliminating the torso for higher accuracy may be
     overcome by variations arising from differences between different scans in the use of
     anatomical landmarks to define the extremities (Covey et al 2010, Wang et al 1996). This
     latter variation is of particular relevance in the context of multi-center Phase 2 clinical trials
30   aiming to establish the dose-response relationship between the drug and the induced
     changes of skeletal muscle mass.
     Furthermore, the relative inaccuracy of total LBM to estimate total skeletal muscle mass is
     of less concern in the monitoring setting, because the drug has no known effect on organ
     lean mass, skin, or the non-fat components of fat mass. In support, our observations in the
35   BYM338X2102 study indicated a high degree of correlation (r=0.94) between the percent
     changes of total LBM (DXA) and percent changes of thigh muscle volume (MRI).

   WO 2015/162590                                                               PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                 108
     While total LBM is the preferred choice to quantify the primary pharmacodynamics effect of
     the drug and establish the dose-response relationship, the measurement and monitoring of
     the changes of aLBM - which will also be the subject of postoperative rehabilitation
     (physical exercise) - will be of increased interest for the exploration of how drug-induced
 5   changes in skeletal muscle mass predict/reflect the anticipated functional benefits of the
     treatment.
     Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)
     The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) has been shown to be highly predictive of
     subsequent disability, hospitalization, institutionalization, and mortality in community
10   dwelling elders in epidemiological studies and outpatient clinics (Guralnik et al 2000;
     Studenski at al 2003). The disability remains even after adjustment for level and severity of
     comorbidity and self-report functional status.
     Recently, it has been demonstrated that the SPPB can be feasibly and safely used to
     evaluate the functional status of acutely ill geriatric patients admitted to the hospital for
15   serious medical conditions and that the SPPB score can provide important short-term
     prognostic information (Volpato et a! 2008). Patients with a SPPB score below 10 are more
     likely to present with several other diseases than those patients with a score of 10 or higher.
     In multiple regression analysis, the authors found that the significant independent predictors
     of poor lower extremity function were age, diabetes, stroke, and osteoporosis.
20   Moreover, sequential assessment of physical performance by SPPB during hospital stay
     and in the first weeks after discharge can provide additional information on future health risk
     in older acutely ill patients. Collectively, SPPB might be considered as a nonspecific but
     highly sensitive indicator of global health status reflecting several underlying physiological
     impairments.
25   Gait Speed
     Gait speed will be measured as a component of SPPB to assess functional improvement.
     Usual gait speed represents one of the most suitable physical performance measures to be
     implemented into the standard clinical evaluation of older persons. Gait speed is associated
     with physical activity levels, changes in the isometric force of lower extremity muscles, frailty
30   and falls (Newman et al 2005, Chandler et al 1998, Cesari et al 2005).
     Gait speed is not only a well-established measure of physical function but it may also
     predict future disability in diverse community-dwelling elderly populations and is sensitive to
     reflect changes in physical status in response to changes in physical activity, including
     short-term rehabilitation (Barthuly et al 2012). Poor functional performance as measured by
35   slow or declining gait speed is related to risk of disability, hospitalization and mortality
     (Studenski et al 2011), whereas improvements in gait speed are related to reductions in

   WO 2015/162590                                                                PCT/IB2015/052990
                                                  109
     mortality risk (Hardy et al 2007). For these reasons, gait speed has often been quoted as a
     global indicator of health in the geriatric population.
     Falls and fractures
     Hip fracture patients experience a substantial reduction of mobility following fracture, with
 5   most patients never returning to the pre-fracture level of mobility. Many of these patients
     also experience mobility-related events in the period post-fracture, notably falls (Bischoff
     Ferrari et al 2010). In such fragile individuals, falls often cause injuries, including recurrent
     fractures. Treatment with bimagrumab in the period after fracture is likely to accelerate
     muscle volume gain, and may improve strength and mobility, which is likely to result in
10   improved physical function and potentially a reduction in mobility-related adverse events.
