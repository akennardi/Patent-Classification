 5      The disclosure relates to a swim training system, a swim data computation method
   using the same, and a swim training method using the same, more particularly to a swim
   training system which converts a tension into a swimming speed, a swim data computation
   method using the same, and a swim training method using the same.
   Background
10      According to the research, swimming is an exercise which causes fewer injuries for
   exercisers than jogging, cycling and ball games. Swimming increases cardiopulmonary
   function, muscle strength and metabolic rate of human bodies. In order to acquire the
   benefits mentioned above, people have to have enough swimming distance during the
   swimming process. However, the watercourse length of the swimming pool at home is
15 limited by the size of the backyard and causing the inconvenience of the swim training.
        U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0171270 discloses a swim training
   device. The swim training device includes a sensor and a restraint component. One end of
   the restraint component is fastened to a side of a water tank, and the other end of the
   restraint component is fastened to a swimmer. The sensor measures the force applied on the
20 restraint component when the swimmer is swimming in the water tank. Therefore, this
   swimming training device helps the swimmer to do the swimming training in the water tank,
   and obtains a swimming speed of the swimmer by the processor according to the force
   measured by sensor. However, the accuracy of the swimming speed obtained by this swim
   training device is arguable.

        As shown in FIG. 1, the training device 100 includes a connecting component 110, a
   wearing component 120, a fastening component 130, and a sensor 140. The connecting
   component 110 includes a first section 111 and a second section 112. The connecting
 5 component 110 is, for example, a rope or a strap. The wearing component 120 and the
   sensor 140 are connected by the first section 111, and the fastening component 130 and the
   sensor 140 are connected by the second section 112. The wearing component 120, such as a

   component 110, the user is restrained by the connecting component 110 so that the user is
15 not able to swim toward a direction away from the fixing object A, which is located around
   the swimming pool.
        As shown in FIG. 3 to FIG. 5, the sensor 140 includes a casing 141, a bar 142, a circuit
   board 143, a tension measurement module 144, a wireless communication module 145, two
   liquid resistant rings 146, a liquid resistant loop 147, and a liquid resistant cover 148. The
20 casing 141 includes a top case 1411 and a bottom case 1412, and the casing 141 has an
   accommodation space 1413, a first through hole 1414, a second through hole 1415, and a
   charging hole 1416. The accommodating space 1413 is formed by the top case 1411 and the
   bottom case 1412. The first through hole 1414 and the second through hole 1415 are
   located at two opposite sides of the casing 141 and located at the junction of the top case
25 1411 and the bottom case 1412, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. In other
   embodiments of the present disclosure, both of the first through hole and the second
   through hole are located at the top case or the bottom case. The charging hole 1416 is
   located at the top case 1411. The first through hole 1414, the second through hole 1415,
   and the charging hole 1416 are communicated with the accommodating space 1413.
                                                    7

        The bar 142 has a first fastening end 1421 and a second fastening end 1422 which are
   opposite to each other. The bar 142 also has a deformable part 1423 which is located
   between and connects the first fastening end 1421 and the second fastening end 1422. The
   deformable part 1423 is disposed in the accommodating space 1413. The first fastening end
 5 1421 and the second fastening end 1422 respectively penetrate through the first through
   hole 1414 and the second through hole 1415. The first fastening end 1421 and the second
   fastening end 1422 are configured to be respectively fastened by the first section 111 and
   the second section 112 of the connecting component 110. In the first embodiment of the
   present disclosure, the first fastening end 1421, for example, has a fixing ring, and the
10 second fastening end 1422, for example, also has a fixing ring.
        The circuit board 143 is disposed in the accommodating space 1413. The circuit board
   143 has a charging connector 1431. A battery (not shown in figures) is electrically
   connected to the circuit board 143. The charging connector 1431, which is corresponding to
   the charging hole 1416, is configured to be plug by a charging plug (not shown in figures)
15 so as to charge the battery.
        The tension measurement module 144 is disposed in the accommodating space 1413
   and electrically connected to the circuit board 143. When the deformable part 1423 is
   deformed, the tension measurement module 144 obtains a deformation amount of the
   deformable part 1423 by, for example, a resistance difference of a strain gauge in a bridge
20 resistor; thus, the tension measurement module 144 obtains a tension in the connecting
   component 110 between the first section 111 and the second section 112.
        The wireless communication module 145 is disposed in the accommodating space
   1413 and electrically connected to the circuit board 143. The wireless communication
   module 145 is, for example, an infrared communication module, a wireless network
25 communication       module,   or  a   Bluetooth  communication    module.    The   wireless
   communication module 145 is configured to transmit the tension measured by the tension
   measurement module 144 to the processing device 200. In the first embodiment of the
   present    disclosure,  the  wireless   communication    module   145   is  the  Bluetooth
                                                 8

   communication module.
        Each of the two liquid resistant rings 146 has a clearance hole 1461 and a slit 1462
   which are communicated to each other. The clearance hole 1461 and the slit 1462 both
   extend through the liquid resistant ring 146. The two liquid resistant rings 146 are made of,
 5 for example, silicone, rubber or plastic. One of the two liquid resistant ring 146, which is
   located in the first through hole 1414, is coupled with the first fastening end 1421 by the slit
   1462 so that the first fastening end 1421 penetrates through the clearance hole 1461 of the
   liquid resistant ring 146. The liquid resistant ring 146 is pressed by the first fastening end
   1421, the top case 1411, and the bottom case 1412 of the casing so that the liquid resistant
10 ring 146 is deformed to seal the slit 1462 on the liquid resistant ring 146. As a result, the
   liquid resistant ring 146 prevents a damage of the circuit board 143 caused by water which
   enters the accommodating space 1413 through the first through hole 1414. Similarly, the
   other liquid resistant ring 146 is coupled with the second fastening end 1422 in the same
   way, and the other liquid resistant ring 146 is located in the second through hole 1415. As a
15 result, the liquid resistant ring 146 prevents the damage of the circuit board 143 caused by
   water which enters the accommodating space 1413 through the second through hole 1415.
        The liquid resistant loop 147 connects the two liquid resistant rings 146. The liquid
   resistant loop 147 is dispose at the junction between the top case 1411 and the bottom case
   1412 so as to seal a gap between the top case 1411 and the bottom case 1412. The liquid
20 resistant loop 147 is made of, for example, silicone or plastic. Therefore, the liquid resistant
   loop 147 prevents the damage of the circuit board 143 caused by water which enters the
   accommodating space 1413 through the gap between the top case 1411 and the bottom case
   1412.
        The liquid resistant cover 148 is detachably disposed at the charging hole 1416. The
25 liquid resistant cover 148 is made of, for example, silicone or plastic. When the user
   charges the sensor 140, the liquid resistant cover 148 is detached so as to expose the
   charging hole 1416 and the charging connector 1431. When the user uses the sensor 140,
   the liquid resistant cover 148 is disposed at the charging hole 1416 so as to seal the

        The processing device 200 includes an input module 210, a storage module 220, a
   processing module 230, an output module 240, and a wireless communication module 250.
 5 As shown in FIG. 2, the input module 210, the storage module 220, the processing module
   230, and the output module 240 communicatively connected to the wireless communication
   module 145 through the wireless communication module 250. In the first embodiment of
   the present disclosure, the input module 210, the storage module 220, the output module
   240, and the wireless communication module 250 are communicatively connected to each
10 other by the processing module 230.
        The input module 210 is configured to input a user information or a comparison
   exercise information to the processing module 230. The user information includes the
   user's height, weight, and swimming stroke. In other embodiments of the present disclosure,
   the user information further includes the user's gender, arm length, leg length, or waistline.
15 The comparison exercise information includes a plurality of comparison instantaneous
   swimming speeds and a plurality of timings which respectively correspond to the plurality
   of comparison instantaneous swimming speeds, or a plurality of comparison tensions and
   the plurality of timings which respectively correspond to the plurality of comparison
   tensions. The storage module 220 stores information required by the processing device 200,
20 which includes a conversion parameter table. The storage module 220 is also available to
   store the user information inputted by the user, the comparison exercise information, or an
   exercise information of the user's swimming process.
        The processing module 230 is configured to select one conversion parameter from the
   conversion parameter table in the storage module 220 according to the user information,
25 and the processing module 230 is also configured to generate a tension information
   according to the tension from the sensor 140. Therefore, the exercise information is
   obtained by the computation of the processing module 230 according to the tension
   information and the conversion parameter. The tension information includes the tension and
                                                 10

   the timing corresponding to the tension. Specifically, the tension information includes the
   tension and the timing when the tension is measured. The exercise information includes an
   instantaneous swimming speed information, an average swimming speed, a swimming
   distance, or a calorie expenditure. The instantaneous swimming speed information includes
 5 the instantaneous swimming speed and the timing corresponding to the instantaneous
   swimming speed. Specifically, the instantaneous swimming speed information includes the
   instantaneous swimming speed and the timing when the tension for the conversion of the
   instantaneous swimming speed is measured.
        The output module 240 is configured to output the exercise information obtained by
10 the computation of the processing module 230. The wireless communication module 250
   and the wireless communication module           145 in the swim training device        1 are
   communicatively connected to each other so as to receive the tension measured by the
   sensor 140. The wireless communication module 250 is, for example, an infrared
   communication module, a wireless network communication module, or a Bluetooth
15 communication module. In the first embodiment of the present disclosure, the wireless
   communication module 250 is the Bluetooth communication module.
        In the first embodiment of the present disclosure, the processing module 230 selects a
   proper conversion parameter from the conversion parameter table according to the user's
   height, weight, and swimming stroke. This conversion parameter table is built according to
20 the experiment data. The experiment data is collected from the users, who use a specific
   swimming stroke but with different height and weight, when they swimming normally in
   the conventional swimming pool and from the users equipped with the training device 100
   when they swimming in the water tank. The conversion parameters, which are for the
   conversion between the user's instantaneous forward force and the instantaneous swimming
25 speed, are then conducted according to water resists of the users' heights, weights, and
   swimming strokes. In the first embodiment of the present disclosure, when the swimming
   stroke is the breaststroke, the conversion parameter table is shown in the following table 1.
   Since the user is restrained by the training device 100, the instantaneous forward force
   generated by the user, who is swimming, is equal to the tension in the connecting
                                                 11

   component 110, the tension measured by the sensor 140 is the instantaneous forward force
   generated by the user, who is swimming. As a result, the user's instantaneous swimming
   speed is computable by the processing module 230 according to a formula (I), the tension
   measured by the sensor 140, and the conversion parameter selected according to the user
 5 information.
         Formula (I)    V=ef;
        wherein, V is the instantaneous swimming speed, e is the conversion parameter, and f
   is the tension.
        Further according to the tension measured by the sensor 140, the timing corresponding
10 to the tension, the user information, and the conversion parameter, the average swimming
   speed, the swimming distance, or the calorie expenditure are computable by the processing
   module 230.

       In the first embodiment of the present disclosure, the training device 100 helps the user
  to swim in the swimming pool or the water tank in a restrained swimmable distance. The
  processing device 200 computes the user's exercise information of the swimming process
  according to the tension information provided by the training device, and the processing
5 device 200 also helps the user to execute the swim training program according to the
  exercise information. The processing device 200 is, for example, a smart phone or a tablet
  PC. The input module 210 and the output module 240 are, for example, a touch panel of the
  smart phone or the tablet PC, or a wireless communication module of the smart phone or
  the tablet PC. The storage module 220 is, for example, a memory of the smart phone or the
                                                18

   tablet PC. The processing module 230 is, for example, a processor of the smart phone or the
   tablet PC. In the first embodiment of the present disclosure, the processing device 200 is
   the smart phone or the tablet PC, and the wireless communication module 250 is the
   Bluetooth communication module, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. In other
 5 embodiments of the present disclosure, the processing device is a desktop computer, and
   the input module is a mouse, keyboard, or the wireless communication module, and the
   storage module is a hard disk, and the processing module is a central processing unit (CPU),
   and the output module is an external screen.
        In the first embodiment of the present disclosure, when the bar 140 of the sensor 140 is
10 pulled, the Bluetooth communication module in the training device 100 and the Bluetooth
   communication module in the processing device 200 are paired to be communicatively
   connected to each other. As a result, when the user is using the swim training system, the
   tension measured by the sensor 140 is instantly transmitted to the processing device 200.
        The following illustrates steps of a swim data computation method for the swim
15 training system in the first embodiment of the present disclosure. Please refer to FIG. 6.
   FIG. 6 is a flow chart of a swim data computing method for the swim training system
   according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure.
        First, input the user information by the input module (S101).
        In detail, the user's height, weight, and swimming stroke are inputted into the
20 processing module or the storage module by the user with the input module.
        Next, select the conversion parameter from the conversion parameter table by the
   processing module according to the user information (S 102).
        In detail, the proper conversion parameter is selected from the conversion parameter
   table by the processing module according to the user's height, weight, and swimming
25 stroke which are inputted into the processing module or the storage module. For example,
   when the height, the weight, and the swimming stroke inputted by the user are respectively
                                                   19

   175 centimeters, 70 kilograms, and breaststroke, the processing module selects the
   conversion parameter table of the breaststroke, which is the above table 1, and then selects
   e=0.0130284 as the conversion parameter from table 1.
        Next, measure the tension by the sensor (S 103).
 5      In detail, the sensor measures the tension in the connecting component when the user is
   swimming. The tension measured by the sensor is outputted by the wireless communication
   module. A time interval of the tension measurement by the sensor is, for example, 0.1
   second, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. In other embodiments of the present
   disclosure, the time interval of the tension measurement by the sensor is 0.01 second to 1
10 second.
        Next, acquire the tension information by the processing module according to the
   tension obtained from the sensor (S 104).
        In detail, the tension sent by the wireless communication module is received by the
   processing module. After the processing module receiving the tension, a timing is given to
15 the tension as a tag by the processing module to obtain the tension information.
        Next, obtain the exercise information by the processing module according to the
   tension information and the conversion parameter (S 105).
        In detail, the instantaneous swimming speed V is obtained by the computation of the
   processing module according to the formula (I) V=ef, the conversion parameter e, and the
20 tension f in the tension information. Formula (I) is the relationship among the user's total
   work, the user's weight and the instantaneous swimming speed V, wherein the total work
   output by the user instantaneously is the integral of the tension and instantaneous time.
   Since the total work output by the user instantaneously and the conversion among the total
   work, the user's weight and the instantaneous swimming speed V are both affected by the
25 user's swimming stroke, height and weight, the conversion parameter e is selected
   according to the user's height, weight, and swimming stroke.
                                                  20

        Next, the average swimming speed or the swimming distance is further obtained by the
   computation of the processing module according to two timings and two instantaneous
   swimming speeds respectively corresponding to the two timings in two tension information.
   Next, the calorie expenditure is further obtained by the computation of the processing
 5 module according to the user information, the two timings and the two instantaneous
   swimming speeds respectively corresponding to the two timings in the two tension
   information.
        In the step S105, the processing module converts the tension, which is a physical
   quantity of force, to the instantaneous swimming speed, which is a physical quantity of
10 velocity, according to the conversion parameter selected from the conversion parameter
   table. As a result, the swim training system in the first embodiment of the present
   disclosure not only help user to swim in the swimming pool or the water tank with the
   restrained swimmable distance, but also converts the tension in the connecting component
   to the instantaneous swimming speed by using the conversion parameter in the conversion
15 parameter table with the cooperation between the training device and the processing device.
        In the swim data computation method for the swim training system in the first
   embodiment of the present disclosure, the step S102 to the step S104 are executed in
   sequence, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. In other embodiments of the
   present disclosure, the step S102 and the step S103 in the swim data computation method
20 have no particular order to be executed, or the step S102 and the step S104 in the swim data
   computation method have no particular order to be executed.
        In the swim data computation method for the swim training system in the first
   embodiment of the present disclosure, the conversion parameter is selected according to the
   user's height, weight, and swimming stroke, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto.
25 In other embodiments of the present disclosure, the conversion parameter is calibrated
   according to the user's gender, arm length, leg length, or waistline so as to further improve
   the accuracy of the instantaneous swimming speed obtained by the computation.
        Further, by using the swim data computation method of the swim training system in the
                                                 21

   first embodiment and other embodiments of the present disclosure, the actual swimming
   time and the corresponding swimming distance of the user swimming in the general
   swimming pool are taken as a calibration swimming time and a calibration swimming
   distance respectively. Next, swim the same time as the calibration swimming time with the
 5 swim training system and calculate the user's total work and the user's swimming distance
   by the swim training system. Next, calibrate the original conversion parameter selected
   from the conversion parameter table according to the difference between the user's
   swimming distance and the calibration swimming distance to obtain a conversion parameter
   by the processing module. For example, in a calibration mode, a user first inputs the
10 swimming time required to complete 25 meters of swim in a general swimming pool, which
   is 30 seconds, and then the user swims with the swim training system for 30 seconds. The
   processing module of the swim training system calibrates the original conversion
   parameters based on the difference between the users' swimming distance calculated by the
   processing module and the actual swimming distance, which is 25 meters, in a general
15 swimming pool. In this way, the calibrated conversion parameter allows the total work
   obtained by the swim training system when the user swimming with the swim training
   system close to the total work done by the user swimming in the general swimming pool,
   and thereby, the accuracy of the instantaneous swimming speed is further increased.
        The following illustrates steps of a swim training method for the swim training system
20 in the first embodiment of the present disclosure. Please refer to FIG. 7 to FIG. 11. FIG. 7
   is a flow chart of a swim training method for the swim training system according to the first
   embodiment of the present disclosure. FIG. 8 to FIG. 11 are schematic views of a display
   screen of an output module of the swim training system according to the first embodiment
   of the present disclosure.
25      First, build a comparison exercise information of a comparison swimming process in
   the storage module (S201).
        In detail, input and store the comparison exercise information of the comparison
   swimming process into the storage module by the input module, or record the comparison
                                                 22

   exercise information of the comparison swimming process by the swim training system.
   The comparison exercise information includes a Nth comparison instantaneous swimming
   speed to a (N+1)th comparison instantaneous swimming speed and a Nth timing to a
   (N+1)th timing which respectively correspond to the Nth comparison instantaneous
 5 swimming speed to the (N+1)th comparison instantaneous swimming speed, or a Nth
   comparison tension information to a (N+1)th comparison tension information and the Nth
   timing to the (N+1)th timing which respectively correspond to the Nth comparison tension
   information to the (N+1)th comparison tension information; wherein, the N is a positive
   integer greater than zero. The comparison exercise information is able to further include a
10 Nth comparison swimming distance which is corresponding to the Nth timing, or a Nth
   comparison average swimming speed which is corresponding to the Nth timing. When the
   comparison exercise information is the exercise information recorded by the swim training
   system from the same user, there is no need to enter the user information again. When the
   comparison exercise information is the exercise information recorded by the swim training
15 system from a previous user, the user needs to input a previous user information of the
   previous user so that the processing device is able to select a proper conversion parameter
   for executing the conversion between the comparison tension information and the
   comparison instantaneous swimming speed.
        Next, select the conversion parameter from the conversion parameter table by the
20 processing module according to the user information (S202).
        In detail, the proper conversion parameter is selected from the conversion parameter
   table by the processing module according to the user's height, weight, and swimming
   stroke, which are inputted into the processing module or the storage module by the user.
        Next, measure the training tension by the sensor (S203).
25      In detail, a Nth training tension to a (N+1)th training tension are respectively measured
   at the Nth timing to the (N+1)th timing by the sensor. The Nth training tension corresponds
   to the Nth timing, and the (N+ 1)th training tension corresponds to the (N+ 1)th timing. As a
   result, timing intervals of the training tensions measured by the sensor are the same as the
                                                  23

   timing intervals of the comparison instantaneous swimming speeds or the timing intervals
   of the comparison tension information so as to provide a basis for comparison on an equal
   timing interval.
        Next, acquire the training tension information by the processing module according to
 5 the training tension, which is obtained from the sensor (S204).
        In detail, the Nth training tension to the (N+1)th training tension, which are transmitted
   by the wireless communication module, are received by the processing module. After the
   processing module receives the Nth training tension to the (N+1)th training tension, the Nth
   training tension to the (N+1)th training tension are tagged by the timing to acquire the Nth
10 training tension information to the (N+1)th training tension information by the processing
   module.
        Next, obtain the training exercise information by the processing module according to
   the conversion parameter and the training tension information (S205).
        In detail, the training instantaneous swimming speed V is obtained by the computation
15 executed by the processing module according to the formula (I), the conversion parameter e,
   and the training tension f in the training tension information. Next, the average training
   swimming speed or the training swimming distance is able to be obtained by the further
   computation executed by the processing module according to the Nth training instantaneous
   swimming speed and the (N+1)th training instantaneous swimming speed which are
20 respectively corresponding to the Nth timing and the (N+1)th timing. Next, the calorie
   expenditure is able to be obtained by the further computation executed by the processing
   module according to the user information, the Nth training instantaneous swimming speed
   and the     (N+1)th training instantaneous        swimming    speed which are      respectively
   corresponding to the Nth timing and the (N+1)th timing.
25      Next, compare the comparison exercise information and the training exercise
   information corresponding to each other by the processing module to obtain a comparison
   result (S206).
                                                   24

        In detail, the Nth training instantaneous swimming speed and the Nth comparison
   instantaneous swimming speed, which are corresponding to the Nth timing, are compared
   by the processing module, or the Nth training average swimming speed and the Nth
   comparison average swimming speed, which are corresponding to the Nth timing, are
 5 compared by the processing module, or the Nth training swimming distance and the Nth
   comparison swimming distance, which are corresponding to the Nth timing, are compared
   by the processing module.
        Next, output the comparison result by the output module after the training exercise
   information corresponding to the timing is obtained by the processing module but before
10 the training exercise information corresponding to the next timing is obtained by the
   processing module (S207).
        In detail, when the comparison result is that the Nth comparison instantaneous
   swimming speed is greater than the Nth training instantaneous swimming speed, the
   processing module comments the output module to output a first notification. When the
15 comparison result is that the Nth comparison instantaneous swimming speed is smaller than
   the Nth training instantaneous swimming speed, the processing module comments the
   output module to output a second notification. When the comparison result is that the Nth
   comparison average swimming speed is greater than the Nth training average swimming
   speed, the processing module comments the output module to output the first notification,
20 when the comparison result is that the Nth comparison average swimming speed is smaller
   than the Nth training average swimming speed, the processing module comments the output
   module to output the second notification. When the comparison result is that the Nth
   comparison swimming distance is greater than the Nth training swimming distance, the
   processing module comments the output module to output the first notification. When the
25 comparison result is that the Nth comparison swimming distance is smaller than the Nth
   training swimming distance, the processing module comments the output module to output
   the second notification.
        Before the processing module obtains the comparison result of the (N+1)th timing, the
                                                25

   processing module comments the output module to output the comparison result of the Nth
   timing so that the output module is able to instantly provide the comparison result to the
   user. Therefore, the user is able to realize the user's performance is better or worse than the
   performance in the comparison swimming process, but the disclosure is not limited thereto.
 5 In other embodiments of the present disclosure, the processing module is also available to
   comment the output module to output all the comparison results of all the timings at once
   after obtaining all the comparison results of all the timings.
        In the swim training method for the swim training system in the first embodiment of
   the present disclosure, the step S202 to the step S204 are executed in sequence, but the
10 present disclosure is not limited thereto. In other embodiments of the present disclosure, the
   step S202 and the step S203 in the swim training method have no particular order to be
   executed, or the step S202 and the step S204 in the swim training method have no
   particular order to be executed.
        As shown in FIG. 8 to FIG. 11, the comparison exercise information, the training
15 exercise information, and the comparison result are visualized to be presented by the output
   module, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. The comparison exercise information, the
   training exercise information, and the comparison result are presented in sound by the
   output module to notify the user. For example, the output module presents the exercise
   information in digital form on the display, and the output module uses the line graph to
20 show the instantaneous swimming speeds at different timings and the bar graph to show the
   accumulation of the calorie expenditure. Moreover, as shown in FIG. 11, the output module
   presents the bar graph of the comparison swimming distance Dr and the bar graph of the
   training swimming distance Dt on the display at every corresponding timings. The distance
   difference d between the comparison swimming distance Dr and the training swimming
25 distance Dt is marked on the display so that the comparison result between the comparison
   swimming distance and the training swimming distance is able to be realized easily in a
   short time by the user.
        In the swim training method for the swim training system in the first embodiment of
                                                   26

   the present disclosure, after the processing module compares the training exercise
   information and the comparison exercise information, the processing module comments the
   display module to provide the first notification or the second notification to the user
   according to the comparison result. Therefore, during the swim training process, the user is
 5 notified by the display module about that the user's swimming performance is better or
   worse than the swimming performance of the comparison swimming process. As a result,
   the swim training method for the swim training system in the first embodiment of the
   present disclosure helps the user to execute the swim training program for improving the
   training result.
10      The following illustrates a swim training system 2 in the second embodiment of the
   present disclosure. Please refer to FIG. 12. FIG. 12 is a schematic view of a swim training
   system according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure. The swim training
   system 2 in the second embodiment of the present disclosure is similar to the swim training
   system 1 in the first embodiment of the present disclosure. Only the differences between
15 the swim training system 2 and the swim training system 1 are explained herein, and the
   same structures thereof are not repeated herein.
        The swim training system 2 in the second embodiment of the present disclosure
   includes a training device 100' , a processing device 200'     , a buoyancy auxiliary device
   300, and a photography device 400. The buoyancy auxiliary device 300 is disposed at the
20 wearing component 120 so as to provide an auxiliary buoyancy to the user. The buoyancy
   auxiliary device 300 is, for example, floats or airbags installed at the wearing component
   120. In the second embodiment of the present disclosure, the buoyancy auxiliary device is
   located at the user's ventral side, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. In other
   embodiments of the present disclosure, the buoyancy auxiliary device is located at the
25 user's backside or waist side.
        When the user is swimming in the swimming pool without the training device 100 in
   the swim training system 1, a relative movement between the user and the water flow
   generates a buoyancy for the user. However, when the user is swimming in the swimming
                                                 27

   pool with the training device 100 in the swim training system 1, there is no relative
   movement between the user and the water flow so that no buoyancy is generated for the
   user. As a result, the user swimming with the swim training system 1 spends an extra
   strength to maintain the swimming stroke since the lower body tends to sink.
 5      The buoyancy auxiliary device 300 in the swim training system 2 provides the
   auxiliary buoyancy to compensate the buoyancy generated by the relative movement
   between the user and the water flow. As a result, the user's lower body has no tendency to
   sink, and the user has no need to spend the extra strength to maintain the swimming stroke.
        Comparing with the wearing component 120 without the buoyancy auxiliary device
10 300, after the wearing component 120 is equipped with the buoyancy auxiliary device 300,
   the user's swimming stroke and force using method are changed, and thereby the total work
   output by user when using the swim training device is affected. Therefore, the storage
   module in the processing device 200' further stores a buoyancy parameter table for
   calibrating the conversion parameter. A proper conversion parameter is selected from the
15 conversion parameter table as an original conversion parameter by the processing module
   according to the user's height, weight, and swimming stroke. A buoyancy parameter is also
   selected from the buoyancy parameter table by the processing module according to the
   magnitude of the auxiliary buoyancy. The original conversion parameter is calibrated with
   the buoyancy parameter by the processing module to obtain a conversion parameter. Next,
20 the instantaneous swimming speed is obtained by the processing module according to the
   conversion parameter and the tension measured by the sensor 140'. An average swimming
   speed, a swimming distance, or a calorie expenditure is further obtained by the processing
   module according to the conversion parameter, the tension measured by the sensor 140', a
   timing corresponding to the tension, and the user information.

10 as a part of the exercise information, is also recorded in the storage module. The user image
   photoed or shot by the photography device 400 is able to be directly displayed on the output

        The following illustrates steps of a swim data computation method for the swim
   training system in the second embodiment of the present disclosure. Please refer to FIG. 13.
   FIG. 13 is a flow chart of a swim data computing method for the swim training system
10 according to the second embodiment of the present disclosure. The step S301, and 305 to
   S307 in the swim data computation method for the swim training system 2 in the second
   embodiment is similar to the step S101, and 103 to S105 in the swim data computation
   method for the swim training system 1 in the first embodiment. Only the different steps
   S302 to S304 are explained herein.
15      After executing the step S301, next, select an original conversion parameter from the
   conversion parameter table by the processing module according to the user information
   (S302).
        In detail, the proper original conversion parameter is selected from the conversion
   parameter table by the processing module according to the user's height, weight, and
20 swimming stroke, which are inputted into the processing module or the storage module. For
   example, when the height, the weight, and the swimming stroke inputted by the user are
   respectively 175 centimeters, 70 kilograms, and breaststroke, the processing module selects
   the conversion parameter table of the breaststroke, which is the above table 1, and then
   selects e=0.0130284 as the original conversion parameter from table 1.
25      Next, select a buoyancy parameter from the buoyancy parameter table stored in the
   storage module by the processing module according to the auxiliary buoyancy provided to
   the user by the buoyancy auxiliary device (S303).
                                                30

        In detail, the float number of the buoyancy auxiliary device is determined by the user
   according to the user's weight. Next, the proper buoyancy parameter is selected from the
   buoyancy parameter table by the processing module according to the float number, which is
   proportional to the magnitude of the buoyancy. The float number, as a part of the user
 5 information, is inputted in to the processing module or the storage module by the user, but
   the disclosure is not limited thereto. In other embodiments of the present disclosure, the
   proper float number is selected from the table 2 by the processing module according to the
   user's weight in the user information.
        Next, calibrate the original conversion parameter with the buoyancy parameter by the
10 processing module to obtain the conversion parameter (S304).
        In detail, the original conversion parameter is calibrated with the buoyancy parameter
   by the processing module to obtain the conversion parameter. For example, when the user's
   weight is 70 kilograms, the buoyancy auxiliary device has 4 floats. The original conversion
   parameter eo is subtracted 0.0000562x4 to obtain the conversion parameter e=0.0128036
15 according to formula (II) e   = eo-0.0000562xf1 by the processing module.
        Next, execute the following step S305 to S307 to obtain the exercise information.
        In the swim data computation method for the swim training system in the second
   embodiment of the present disclosure, the step S302 to the step S306 are executed in
   sequence, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. In other embodiments of the
20 present disclosure, the step S302 to the step S303 are executed in sequence, and the step
   S304 to the step S306 are executed in sequence; however, the step S302 and the step S305
   have no particular order to be executed, and the step S302 and the step S306 have no
   particular order to be executed, and the step S303 and the step S305 have no particular
   order to be executed, and the step S303 and the step S306 have no particular order to be
25 executed.
        In the swim data computation method for the swim training system in the second
   embodiment of the present disclosure, except for using the original conversion parameter,
                                                  31

   which is selected according to the user's height, weight, and swimming stroke, the original
   conversion parameter is further calibrated with the buoyancy by the processing unit
   according to the formula (II) to obtain the conversion parameter. As a result, the
   instantaneous swimming speed, which is converted from the tension by the swim data
 5 computation method for the swim training system in the second embodiment, is more close
   to the actual instantaneous swimming speed of the user swimming in the conventional
   swimming pool without the training device.
        The following illustrates steps of a swim training method for the swim training system
   in the second embodiment of the present disclosure. Please refer to FIG. 14. FIG. 14 is a
10 flow chart of a swim training method for the swim training system according to the second
   embodiment of the present disclosure. The step S401, and 405 to S409 in the swim data
   computation method for the swim training system 2 in the second embodiment is similar to
   the step S201, and 204 to S207 in the swim training method for the swim training system 1
   in the first embodiment. Only the different steps S402 to S404 are explained herein.
15      After executing the step S401, next, select an original conversion parameter from the
   conversion parameter table by the processing module according to the user information
   (S402).
        In detail, the proper original conversion parameter is selected from the conversion
   parameter table by the processing module according to the user's height, weight, and
20 swimming stroke, which are inputted into the processing module or the storage module.
        Next, select a buoyancy parameter from the buoyancy parameter table stored in the
   storage module by the processing module according to the auxiliary buoyancy provided to
   the user by the buoyancy auxiliary device (S403)
        In detail, the float number of the buoyancy auxiliary device is determined by the user
25 according to the user's weight. Next, the proper buoyancy parameter is selected from the
   buoyancy parameter table by the processing module according to the float number, which is
   proportional to the magnitude of the buoyancy. The float number, as a part of the user
                                                 32

   information, is inputted in to the processing module or the storage module by the user, but
   the disclosure is not limited thereto. In other embodiments of the present disclosure, the
   proper float number is selected from the table 2 by the processing module according to the
   user's weight in the user information.
 5      Next, calibrate the original conversion parameter with the buoyancy parameter by the
   processing module to obtain the conversion parameter (S404).
        In detail, the original conversion parameter is calibrated with the buoyancy parameter
   by the processing module to obtain the conversion parameter.
        Next, execute the following step S405 to S409 to obtain the comparison result.
10      In the swim data computation method for the swim training system in the second
   embodiment of the present disclosure, the step S402 to the step S406 are executed in
   sequence, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. In other embodiments of the
   present disclosure, the step S402 to the step S404 are executed in sequence, and the step
   S405 to the step S406 are executed in sequence; however, and the step S402 and the step
15 S405 have no particular order to be executed, and the step S403 and the step S406 have no
   particular order to be executed, and the step S404 and the step S405 have no particular
   order to be executed, and the step S404 and the step S406 have no particular order to be
   executed.
        In the swim training method for the swim training system in the second embodiment of
20 the present disclosure, except for using the original conversion parameter, which is selected
   according to the user's height, weight, and swimming stroke, the original conversion
   parameter is further calibrated with the buoyancy by the processing unit according to the
   formula (II) to obtain the conversion parameter. As a result, the instantaneous swimming
   speed, which is converted from the tension by the swim data computation method for the
25 swim training system in the second embodiment, is more close to the actual instantaneous
   swimming speed of the user swimming in the conventional swimming pool without the
   training device. Therefore, the swim training method for the swim training system in the
                                                 33

   second embodiment of the present disclosure helps the user to execute the swim training
   program for further improving the training result.
        According to the swim training system, the swim data computation method using the
   same, and the swim training method using the same, the conversion parameter is selected
 5 from the conversion parameter table according to the user information so as to perform the
   following conversion between the tension and the swimming speed. As a result, the
   processing module performs the conversion between the tension and the swimming speed
   with a proper conversion parameter, and therefore, a more accurate swimming speed is
   obtained.
10      Moreover, in the swim training system, the swim data computation method using the
   same, and the swim training method using the same, the original conversion parameter is
   further calibrated with the buoyancy, which is proportion to the float number, by the
   processing unit to obtain the conversion parameter. As a result, the instantaneous
   swimming speed, which is converted from the tension by the swim training system, is more
15 close to the actual instantaneous swimming speed of the user swimming in the conventional
   swimming pool without the training device.
