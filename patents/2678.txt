  BATTERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR A WATERCRAFT MOTOR MODULE
                                          ABSTRACT
         Disclosed herein is a battery management system. A housing may contain one or
more of an electric motor, a battery electrically coupled to the electric motor, and a sensor
configured to detect a harmful environmental condition within the housing. Such sensors can
detect a potentially harmful condition including but not limited to smoke, heat, water, or
shock. A circuit may be coupled to the at least one sensor and configured to uncouple the
battery from the motor and discharge the battery when the sensor detects the harmful
environmental condition. If a potential problem with the internal environment of the cassette
is detected, the cassette batteries can be effectively disconnected with the main output, thus
disabling the motors. Furthermore, energy stored in the batteries can be slowly and safely
discharged. In some embodiments, when a potential problem with the internal environment
of the cassette is detected, the batteries can be discharged and permanently disabled.
Illustrative embodiments disclose a battery management system implemented in a motorized
watercraft.

                          DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
       [00311           While the present disclosure relates primarily to battery safety in the
context of a motorized cassette for use in a personal watercraft such as a surfboard, the
inventions described herein can be implemented in a variety of applications.         The battery
condition of any device including a lithium and/or lithium ion battery may be monitored and
discharged if unsafe conditions are detected.      For example, battery conditions of personal
electronics, such as, for example, laptops and tablets may be monitored using the techniques
described herein. In general, disclosed herein are systems and methods that can detect the
environmental conditions that a battery resides in. Batteries may be housed in hermitically
sealed enclosures and/or not easily observed by a user.             The system may monitor
environmental conditions in and around the battery and may display the conditions to a user.
In some embodiments, the system includes a sensor configured to detect water and/or
moisture in and around the vicinity of a battery. Such an unsafe condition may be displayed
to a user. In some embodiments, when an unsafe environmental condition is detected, a
circuit can disconnect the battery output and/or input. In some embodiment, the circuit may
trigger battery discharge.
       [00321           Particular implementations of the subject matter described in this
disclosure can be implemented to realize one or more of the following potential advantages.
The embodiments described herein provide a device having a long battery life and that can be
stored, shipped, or traveled with in a manner that is safe and compliant with government
regulations. Shipping and carriage of lithium and/or lithium ion batteries is often regulated
and/or restricted because of the possible risk of overheating, fire, rupture, and/or explosion.
Damaged and/or compromised batteries and/or unsafe battery environments carry a risk of
exploding when charging and/or discharging.           Accordingly, the devices, systems, and
methods disclosed herein provide one or more safety features.
       [00331           In some advantageous embodiments, a motorized drive system is
provided as a separately housed cassette. The cassette may house batteries, motors, control
electronics, impellers, and associated drive hardware.      This design has many significant
                                               -5-

advantages. It may be made removable and/or exchangeable. The cassette may also be used
in a variety of watercraft, not just in surfboards.
       [00341           The cassettes disclosed herein house, among other things, rechargeable
batteries within a hermetically sealed enclosure.       In some embodiments, the cassette is
waterproof, meaning that the cassette is capable of being completely submerged under water
for a substantial period of time without water penetrating the enclosure.         The cassettes
disclosed herein can include one or more sensors configured to detect a potential problem
with the internal environment of the cassette or other sealed container in which such a battery
is housed. Such sensors can detect a potentially harmful environmental condition including
but not limited to smoke, heat, water, or shock. If a potential problem with the internal
environment of the cassette is detected, the batteries can be effectively disconnected with the
main output, thus disabling the motors. Furthermore, energy stored in the batteries can be
slowly and safely discharged.
       [00351           In some embodiments, when a potential problem with the internal
environment of the cassette is detected, the batteries are discharged and may be permanently
disabled. For example, in some embodiments, the housing includes a sensor configured to
detect heat. When the heat sensor detects an unsafe temperature within the housing, the one
or more batteries within the housing are effectively disconnected from the electric motors and
batteries are slowly discharged.       Similarly in some embodiments, the housing includes a
sensor configured to detect moisture. When the moisture sensor detects an unsafe humidity
level within the housing, the one or more batteries within the housing are effectively
disconnected from the electric motors and batteries are slowly discharged.
       [00361           In some embodiments, one or more sensors disposed within the sealed
enclosure are configured to monitor one or more characteristics of each battery disposed
within the sealed enclosure.        In some embodiments, the physical battery size may be
monitored. Increase in the physical battery size (i.e. battery swelling) may be an indication of
a dangerous battery condition. As such, when a change in battery size is detected, the battery
can be disabled and discharged. In some embodiments, the voltage, current, balance, internal
impedance, discharge rate, temperature, and/or number of charge/discharge cycles of each
battery is monitored.     Such battery characteristics may be compared to normal operating
parameters and the battery may be disabled and discharged when one or more characteristics
are determined to be dangerous and/or abnormal.          In some embodiments, the system is
configured to inform the user and/or disable the cassette when the number of
                                                 -6-

charge/discharge cycles has reached a pre-determined number.             The user may then be
instructed to return the cassette for inspection and/or maintenance.      In some embodiments,
one or more sensors are disposed on one or more batteries disposed within the cassette and
configured to monitor the battery temperature. When a temperature outside of the normal
operating range for the battery is detected, the battery can be disabled and discharged.
      [00371            As used herein, the term "environmental condition external to the
battery" means a physical condition measurable outside of the battery itself that is separate
from electrical battery parameters such as output current, charging current, and output
voltage. Conventional battery protection circuits focus on battery electrical parameters, but
not on environmental conditions        external to the battery as disclosed herein.         Such
environmental conditions can cause unsafe battery malfunctions that are not adequately
addressed in conventional systems that focus on measuring battery electrical parameters.
      [00381            Some important forms of these environmental conditions are not
caused by the batteries themselves. For example, water-proof enclosures containing batteries
may fail and leak, causing water to enter the enclosure and posing dangerous conditions for a
battery inside.    Dropping a battery powered system may result in dangerous battery
malfunction from the mechanical shock.         Other environmental conditions external to the
battery may be caused by the batteries themselves, such as an increased temperature on or
adjacent to the battery, or the presence of smoke. Another example is battery swelling, which
may cause measurable changes in battery dimension or measurable stress on a battery
mounting system.
      [00391            In some implementations disclosed herein, a personal watercraft
(which may include a motorized cassette) includes a user interface and a battery management
system. The user interface can display battery charge levels. The user interface and battery
management can also allow for a user to discharge the batteries such that the motorized
cassette can be safely stored, shipped, or traveled with on an airplane. The user interface may
inform the user of the battery condition within the housing.
      [00401            These, as well as, other various aspects, components, steps, features,
objects benefits, and advantages will now be described with reference to specific forms or
embodiments selected for the purposes of illustration. It will be appreciated that the spirit and
scope of the cassettes disclosed herein is not limited to the selected forms. Moreover, it is to
be noted that the figures provided herein are not drawn to any particular proportion or scale,
and that many variations can be made to the illustrated embodiments.
                                                -7-

       [00411           Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a personal watercraft comprising a first
embodiment of a motorized cassette 1020 and a surfboard body 1000 is shown. The body
1000 comprises a top side 1004 and a bottom side 1002. In other embodiments, the body
1000 may comprise other traditionally non-powered watercrafts including, for example,
inflatable watercrafts, dinghies, life rafts, tenders, sail boards, stand up paddle boards ("SUP
boards"), kayaks, and canoes. The body 1000 may be constructed by affixing a top shell to a
bottom shell or may be constructed using other various methods.              The body 1000 may
optionally comprise one or more fin boxes 1010 configured to receive one or more fins 1012.
       [00421           Turning now to Figure 2, the bottom side 1002 of the body 1000 may
comprise a recess 1008 configured to receive a cassette 1020 therein. The recess 1008 may
extend from the bottom surface 1002 toward the top surface 1004 and comprise a generally
convex shaped depression in the bottom surface 1002 of the body 1000. In one embodiment,
the recess 1008 forms a tear-drop shaped aperture in the bottom surface 1002. The tear-drop
shaped aperture may be complimentary to the shapes of an insert 1014 and/or cassette 1020
such that the insert 1014 and/or cassette 1020 can be oriented and/or positioned in a desired
configuration within the recess 1008. As explained in further detail below, the insert can be
useful because it can include desired features such as flanges, threaded holes for fastener
engagement, and the like that can be used to, among other things, secure the cassette in the
recess of the surfboard. This allows the shell of the surfboard itself to be entirely made with
smooth and gently rounded surfaces in and around the recess 1008 and without sharp comers,
holes, or other features that require difficult manufacturing processes.         This makes the
production of the surfboard 1000 itself very easy and requires minimal changes to the process
of manufacturing a conventional surfboard.
       [00431           With continued reference to Figure 2, the insert 1014 may comprise a
solid or substantially ring-shaped sheet structure configured to cover at least a portion of the
recess 1008.    The insert 1014 may be coupled to the recess 1008 using various coupling
means, for example, adhesives, bonding agents, and/or fasteners. In some embodiments, by
virtue of the complimentary shapes of the insert 1014 and the recess 1008, the insert 1014
may be form fitted within the recess 1008 such that the engagement therebetween inhibits
longitudinal, lateral, and/or transverse motion of the insert 1014 relative to the recess 1008.
When disposed within the recess 1008, the insert 1014 can define a receiving space 1016 for
receiving the cassette 1020. In some embodiments, the insert 1014 may comprise one or more
relatively small flanges or protrusions (not shown) extending into the receiving space 1016.
                                                 -8-

The one or more flanges can be configured to engage one or more mating grooves (not
shown) disposed in the cassette 1020. In one embodiment, a flange extends from a forward
most portion of the insert 1014 into the receiving space 1016 and the forward most portion of
the cassette 1020 includes a corresponding groove.        In this way, the cassette 1020 may
releasably engage the insert 1014 to align and hold the front of the cassette 1020 relative to
the insert 1014 and body 1000. As shown in Figure 1, the base surface 1022 of the cassette
1020 may be configured to substantially match the adjacent base surface 1002 of the body
1000 to achieve a desired hydrodynamic profile of the personal watercraft.
       [00441           The cassette 1020 may be releasably coupled to the insert 1014 and
recess 1008 by one or more fasteners 1060. In one embodiment, the insert 1014 includes an
internally threaded bore 1062 configured to threadably engage a portion of a threaded fastener
1060, for example, a screw, that passes through a corresponding aperture 1024 formed in the
cassette 1020.    In another embodiment, a threaded bore is disposed in the body 1000 and
configured to engage a portion of threaded fastener 1060. In one embodiment, a groove on a
first end of the cassette 1020 may releasably receive at least a portion of a corresponding
flange extending from the insert 1014 and the second end of the cassette 1020 may be
fastened to the insert/body by fastener 1060 to restrict longitudinal, lateral, and/or transverse
motion of the cassette 1020 relative to the recess 1008. As discussed in more detail below,
the receiving space 1016 may be configured to releasably receive various different cassettes
that are similarly shaped to cassette 1020.
       [00451           As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the removable cassette 1020 may
comprise a drive system for the personal watercraft. In one embodiment, the drive system
components are housed within the cassette 1020.          For example, the cassette 1020 may
comprise one or more exhaust ports 1026, one or more pump housings 1028, one or more
motor shafts 1030, one or more motors (not shown), one or more batteries (not shown),
and/or one or more impellers (not shown). Thus, cassette 1020 may propel the body 1000
relative to a body of water, for example, to aid in paddling out a surfboard and catching
waves.
       [00461           Figures 3 and 4 show the personal watercraft comprising a second
embodiment of a cassette 1040 received within body 1000. Cassette 1040 may be similarly
shaped to cassette 1020 of Figures 10 and 11 such that both cassettes fit tightly within the
receiving space 1016 formed by insert 1014. Cassette 1040 may be releasably coupled to the
body 1000 by one or more threaded fasteners 1060 and/or the engagement between a flange
                                               -9-

extending from the insert and a groove in the cassette 1040. As shown, fastener 1060 may
pass through an aperture 1034 in the cassette 1040 and be received within threaded bore 1062
in insert 1014.
       [00471          In contrast to cassette 1020 of Figures 1 and 2, cassette 1040 may be
un-powered or non-motorized. In some embodiments, the cassette 1040 may be hollow and
may enclose a storage space configured to store personal items, for example, sun screen,
watercraft hardware, keys, mobile phones, etc. In one embodiment, the storage space may be
substantially water tight to protect items stored therein from the ingress of water from a body
of water, for example, the ocean.         In other embodiments, the cassette 1040 may be
substantially solid such that the watercraft has generally uniform buoyancy and/or rigidity
characteristics from the front end to the back end.
       [00481          The cassette 1020 of Figures 1 and 2 and the cassette 1040 of Figures 3
and 4 may be interchanged to convert the body 1000 between a motorized configuration
(Figures 1 and 2) and a non-motorized configuration (Figures 3 and 4). The body 1000 may
come as a kit with one or both of the motorized cassette 1020 and the non-motorized cassette
1040. A user may switch between cassettes 1020 and 1040 depending on water conditions
and/or desired performance characteristics of the personal watercraft.     For example, a user
may wish to lower the overall mass characteristic of the personal watercraft by opting to place
the non-motorized cassette 1040 within the body 1000 or a user may wish to minimize human
energy used in a surf session by opting to place the motorized cassette 1020 within the body
1000.
       [00491          Turning now to Figures 5 and 6, a personal watercraft comprising a
motorized cassette 1620 and a watercraft body 1600 is shown. The body 1600 comprises a
top side 1604 and a bottom side 1602. In some embodiments, the body 1600 may comprise a
surfboard and in other embodiments the body 1600 may comprise other various watercrafts.
Similar to the personal watercraft of Figures 1-4, the body 1600 may be constructed by
affixing a top shell to a bottom shell as discussed above or may be constructed using other
various methods.     The body 1600 may optionally comprise one or more fin boxes 1610
configured to receive one or more fins 1612.
       [00501          Turning now to Figure 6, the bottom side 1602 of the body 1600 may
comprise a recess 1608 configured to receive a cassette 1620 therein. The recess 1608 may
extend from the bottom surface 1602 toward the top surface 1604 and comprise a generally
convex shaped depression in the bottom surface 1602 of the body 1600. In one embodiment,
                                               -10-

the recess 1608 forms a tear-drop shaped aperture in the bottom surface 1602. The tear-drop
shaped aperture may be complimentary to the shapes of the insert 1614 and/or cassette 1620
such that the insert 1614 and/or cassette 1620 can be oriented and/or positioned in a desired
configuration within the recess 1608.
       [00511           With continued reference to Figure 6, the insert 1614 may comprise a
solid or substantially ring-shaped sheet structure configured to cover at least a portion of the
recess 1608.    The insert 1614 may be coupled to the recess 1608 using various coupling
means, for example, adhesives, bonding agents, and/or fasteners. In some embodiments, by
virtue of the complimentary shapes of the insert 1614 and the recess 1608, the insert 1614
may be form fitted within the recess 1608 such that the engagement therebetween inhibits
longitudinal, lateral, and/or transverse motion of the insert 1614 relative to the recess 1608.
When disposed within the recess 1608, the insert 1614 can define a receiving space 1616 for
receiving the cassette 1620.
       [00521           In some embodiments, the insert 1614 may include one or more
protrusions 1651 configured to be inserted into one or more indentations 1659 (shown in
Figure 7) on the cassette 1620. The protrusions 1651 and indentations 1659 on the cassette
1620 can have complimentary shapes such that the protrusions may be received by the
indentations by sliding the cassette 1620 forward longitudinally relative to the insert 1614.
The engagement of the protrusions 1651 and corresponding indentations can result in one or
more abutments that act to arrest or inhibit longitudinal, lateral, and/or transverse movement
of the cassette 1620 relative to the insert 1614 and body 1600.
       [00531           The insert 1614 may also include a latch element 1653 that is
cantilevered from a latch plate 1655. The latch element 1653 may catch one or more surfaces
within a receptacle 1661 (shown in Figure 7) on the cassette 1620 when the cassette 1620 is
received within the insert 1614 to secure the cassette 1620 in the longitudinal direction
relative to the insert 1614. In this way, the cassette 1620 may be slid forward into the insert
1614 until the latch 1653 releasably engages a notch or other feature on the cassette such that
the cassette 1620 is aligned and secured relative to the insert 1614. To remove the cassette
1620 from the insert 1614, the latch element 1653 may be depressed by applying a force to
the cantilevered end of the latch element 1653 to disengage the latch element from the notch
or other feature of the cassette. Disengaging the latch element 1653 then will allow a user to
slide the cassette 1620 backward longitudinally relative to the insert 1614 to release the
                                               -11-

protrusions 1651 from the indentations 1659 and to remove the cassette 1620 from the body
1600.
      [00541           As shown in Figure 5, the base surface 1622 of the cassette 1620 may
be configured to substantially match the adjacent base surface 1602 of the body 1600 to
achieve a desired hydrodynamic profile of the personal watercraft.     The base surface 1622
may also include a charging port 1631 and/or activation switch 1633. Thus, the cassette 1620
may be charged when the cassette is coupled to the watercraft body 1600 or when it is
separate from the watercraft body. In embodiments when these are provided, the charger port
1631 can be disposed on an opposite side of the cassette 1620 and the activation switch 1633
can be disposed elsewhere as well if desired.
      [00551           As shown in Figures 7 and 8, the removable cassette 1620 may
comprise a drive system including one or more motors 1675. In one embodiment, the drive
system can be at least partially housed between a cassette base 1671 and a cassette cover
1657. The one or more motors 1675 can be powered by one or more batteries 1665 and can
be mounted to the cassette base 1671 by motor mounts 1677. In some embodiments, each
motor 1675 can be coupled to a motor shaft 1690 by a shaft coupler 1679, shaft bearing 1681,
bearing holder 1683, and spacer 1685. Each shaft 1690 can be coupled to an impeller 1699
that is disposed at least partially within a pump housing 1695 and a bearing 1697 can
optionally be disposed between each shaft and the impeller 1699. In this way, the one or
more motors 1675 can drive each impeller 1699 to draw water through the pump housing
1695 to propel the cassette relative to a body of water. The interior of the cassette 1620 may
comprise a hermetically sealed environment. In some embodiments, the cassette base 1671
and cassette cover 1657 are sealed together with vibrational welding.           In this way, a
waterproof seal is formed between the cassette base 1671 and cassette cover 1657.
      [00561           In some embodiments, each shaft 1690 can be disposed within a shaft
housing 1694 that is configured to limit the exposure of the shaft 1690 to objects that are
separate from the cassette 1620.      Thus, the shaft housing 1694 can protect a user from
inadvertently contacting the shaft 1690 during use and/or can protect the shaft 1690 from
contacting other objects, for example, sea grass. Additionally, the shaft housing 1694 can
improve performance of the cassette 1620 by isolating each shaft 1690 from the water that
passes through the pump housing 1695.         In some embodiments, each shaft 1690 can be
protected from exposure to the water by one or more shaft seals 1692.
                                               -12-

       [00571           The cassette 1620 can also include one or more grates 1693 disposed
over intake ports of the pump housing 1695. The grates 1693 can limit access to the impeller
1699 and shaft 1690 to protect these components and/or to prevent a user from inadvertently
contacting these components during use. In some embodiments, each pump housing 1695
and/or grate 1693 can be coupled to one or more magnetic switches (not shown) that can
deactivate the motors 1675 when the pump housing 1695 and/or grate 1693 are separated
from the cassette base 1671. Therefore, the one or more magnetic switches may prevent the
cassette from operating without the optional grate 1693 and/or pump housing in place.
       [00581           With continued reference to Figures 7 and 8, the drive system may also
include one or more motor controllers 1673 for each motor 1675, one or more relays 1687
configured to connect the one or more batteries 1665 with the one or more motor controllers
1673, an antenna 1667, and a transceiver 1669. The one or more motor controllers 1673, one
or more relays 1687, one or more batteries 1665, antenna 1667, an transceiver 1669, can be
electrically connected to each another by one or more wiring harnesses 1663. As discussed
above, the transceiver 1669 can include or be coupled to wireless transmission circuitry that is
configured to transmit electromagnetic and/or magnetic signals underwater.
       [00591           In one embodiment, a motorized cassette described above, includes a
plurality of environmental sensors located in a plurality of locations within the cassette. If
one of the plurality of sensors detects a harmful condition, water within the cassette for
example, the batteries within the cassette are effectively disconnected from the motors and are
slowly discharged. A display located on the exterior of the cassette can alert the user that the
sensors detected a harmful condition and that the device is being discharged. The display can
also notify the user when the batteries have been drained.
       [00601           Figure 9 illustrates a block diagram of a battery management system
for a motorized cassette according to one embodiment. As shown, the battery management
system can include a battery management module 1, a sensor module 2, a measurement
interface 3, a display 4, an input 5, a main intelligent module 6, and a battery 7.
       [00611           The battery management module 1 can function as a protector and/or
battery cell management device and can be coupled to one or more batteries 7 as well as the
main intelligent module 6.       The battery management module 1 can regulate and ensure
balanced cell voltages. The battery management module 1 can also control battery charging
and discharging.
                                                -13-

       [00621           The sensor module 2 can be coupled to the main intelligent module 6
and can detect one or more internal environmental conditions of the cassette such as, for
example, water, heat, shock, or smoke. The sensor module 2 may also, or in the alternative,
detect the physical battery condition, for example battery size, and/or the electronic
characteristics of the battery. In one embodiment, if sensor module 2 detects water within the
cassette, the sensor module 2 sends a signal to the main intelligent module 6.        The main
intelligent module 6 can then disable the one or more batteries (by blowing an output fuse
leading from the battery output for example) and/or trigger a slow discharge of the batteries.
       [00631           The measurement interface 3 can be coupled to the battery 7 and/or the
main intelligent module 6.      The measurement interface 3 can be compatible with testing
equipment approved by an agency such as the Department of Transportation or the Federal
Aviation Administration.       In this way, the measurement interface 3 can function as a
connection point for third party testing equipment in order measure the battery charge status
and/or verify that the battery 7 is discharged. For example, a user of a watercraft configured
to house a motorized cassette may wish to travel in an aircraft.       The user can remove the
cassette from the watercraft and manually initiate the battery discharge. The user can then
present the cassette for inspection by, for example, a dangerous goods inspector.           The
dangerous goods inspector can use standard testing equipment to connect to the measurement
interface 3 and verify that the batteries in the cassette are discharged. The cassette can then
be approved for travel on the aircraft.
       [00641           Continuing with Figure 9, the display 4 can be coupled to the main
intelligent module 6 and can visually display the status of battery. For example, the display 4
can display the battery charge level and/or status of the batteries 7. The display 4 may be an
LCD or LED display. The display 4 may include a touch screen or other user interface.
       [00651           The input 5 can be coupled to the main intelligent module 6 and can be
used to initiate the discharging of the batteries 7. For example, in one embodiment, the input
5 comprises a button that, when depressed, signals the main intelligent module 6 to initiate
discharging of the batteries 7.
       [00661           The main intelligent module 6 can monitor the battery management
module 1, the sensor module 2, and the battery 7. The main intelligent module 6 can send
data to the display 4 and can receive input from the input 5. The battery 7 may include one or
more batteries. The batteries 7 may be lithium or lithium ion batteries. The main intelligent
                                                -14-

module 6 can compare a sensor output to a threshold level and may disconnect and/or
discharge a battery if the sensor output exceeds the threshold level.
       [00671            Figure 10 is a top view of a motorized cassette 100 having a user
interface 105 for a battery management system according to one embodiment. As shown, the
interface 105 includes a display. The display may be an LCD or LED display. The interface
105 may further include one or more buttons and/or may include a touch screen portion 120.
The display may display one or more icons 110. The display can allow for a person to easily
obtain the charge status of the batteries in the cassette. In some embodiments, the display can
alert a user of the status of the batteries. For example, the display can indicate if the cassette
is safe to travel with, if the cassette is charging properly, and/or if the cassette is ready for
inspection approval by government agencies or shipping companies.
       [00681            Figure 11 illustrates sample outputs 1101-1105 of the display. In one
embodiment, the user interface 105 is a LCD touchscreen interface. The LCD touchscreen
interface can allow for a user to cycle through various options available. For example, the
LCD touchscreen interface may allow for a user to manually activate the discharging of the
batteries.
       [00691            Turning to Figures 12 and 13, a wireless wrist controller 1200 may be
configured to operate and/or control the cassette. For example, the wrist controller 1200 can
be configured to turn the motors on and off. The wrist controller 1200 can include a wrist
strap 1204, a rubber overmold 1201, an input 1202, and a display 1203. The wrist controller
1200 can be configured to operate when submerged in water for prolonged periods of time.
The display 1203 can allow for a person to wirelessly obtain the charge status of the batteries
in the cassette. In some embodiments, the display 1203 can alert a user of the status of the
batteries. For example, the display 1203 can indicate if the cassette is safe to travel with, if
the cassette is charging properly, and/or if the cassette is ready for inspection approval by
government agencies and/or shipping companies. Figure 11 illustrates sample outputs 1101
1105 of the display 1203. In some embodiments, the display 1203 further includes a touch
screen.    The input 1202 can comprise a button or switch.          As shown, the input 1202
comprises a toggle button. In some embodiments, the toggle button is used to tum the motors
of the cassette on or off.
       [00701            In some embodiments, the wireless wrist controller 1200 can
independently verify the battery status and/or charge level. In other words, the wireless wrist
controller 1200 can include testing equipment approved by an agency such as the Department
                                                -15-

of Transportation or the Federal Aviation Administration.         In this way, the wireless wrist
controller 1200 can verify that the status of the batteries within the cassette. This separate
and independent verification step can further ensure that the batteries within the cassette are
fully discharged.
       [00711           Figure 14 is a top view of a motorized cassette 1400 having a user
interface for a battery management system according to according to another embodiment.
As shown, the motorized cassette 1400 includes an interface 1401.            The interface 1401
includes a light 1420 and a button 1410 surrounded by a rubber protector 1412. The button
1410 can allow a user to toggle between various modes such as on, off, manual discharge, or
emergency discharge. The light 1420 can indicate the status of the battery within the cassette
1400. In one embodiment, the light 1420 is off when the cassette 1400 batteries are fully
discharged. In one embodiment, the light is on when the batteries have a charge.           In one
embodiment, the light 1420 flashes when the battery is being discharged. The light may flash
more often or in a different color if the emergency discharge was activated. The emergency
discharge may occur when one or more internal sensors detect a dangerous internal condition
within the cassette such as excess heat, water, smoke, or a large shock.
       [00721           Figures 15 and 16 illustrate one implementation of a schematic for
battery protection that may be implemented in the cassette illustrated above.         The battery
output includes a fuse F3 (Figure 15). Multiple water sensors, which may be adjacent traces
on printed circuit boards that are positioned in several locations within the cassette, that
become conductively connected in the presence of water, are each connected to amplifiers
(Figure 16) that have outputs that go high when water is present. When one of these triggers
goes high, pin 2 of connector J5 is pulled low, turning on Ql (Figure 15). This blows fuse F3
and discharges the batteries slowly through discharge resistors R21 and R22 (Figure 15). Q2
(Figure 15) will hold the gate of Ql low even if pin 2 of J5 is released from ground. LED D4
(Figure 15) will become lit up during this process, which may be visible to a user on the
outside of the cassette, informing the user that the battery protection procedure is in process.
