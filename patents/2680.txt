  An oligoribonucleotide having a double stranded structure
  (dsRNA), comprising two separate RNA strands, wherein one
5 strand of the dsRNA has a region I   which is complementary

  length, and wherein the target gene is a mammalian gene.
                                     4115836_1 (GHMatters) P42794.AU.4 27/02/13

        Method      and medicament          for inhibiting            the expression of
        a given gene
        The invention relates to a method in accordance with the
.5      preamble of claim 1. It furthermore relates to a
        medicament and to a use of double-stranded
        oligoribonucleotides and to a vector encoding them.
        Such     k    method      is.  .kown     from        0 99/32619.,        which        was
10      unpublished           at     the    priority         date      of     the    present
        invention.         The    known     process        aims     at    inhibiting          the
        expression of genes .in               cells      of   invertebrates.         To this
        end,      . the     doubie-stranded            *                                    must
        exhibit       a   sequence which         is     identical        with the        target.
   gene          and which .has a length                 of   at    least     50 bases.         To
        achieve        efficient        inhibition,-        the     identical ,seqIence
         must    be     30O    to -1     000 base      pairs      in    length.      Such       an
        oligoribon'ucleotide is complicated to prepare.
.20      DE 196!31 919 C2              describes         an      antisense        1NA        iith
         specific - secondary            structures,        the   antisense       RNA being
         present      .in     the     form. of      a    vector       encoding.     it.'      The
         antisense RNA .takes the               form of an RNA molecule                    which
         is  complementary to regions                  of the mRNA.          Inhibition of
 25      the ''.gene      expression        is- caused -by' binding                to      these
         regions.       This     inhibition can be employed                  in  particular
         for 'the -diagnosis              and/or       therapy        of   diseases,.          for
         example        tumor      diseases      or      viral      infections..         -     The
         disadvantage           is      that    the 'antisense             RNA      must         be
 30      introduced into the cell in an amount which is at least
         as high as the amount of the mRNA.                        The known antisense
         methods are not particularly effective.
         US 5,712,257             discloses          a       medicament          comprising
 35      mismatched          double-stranded          RNA      (dsRNA)      and    bioactive
         mismatched         fragments      of dsRNA in          the' form of a ternary
          complex together with a surfactant.                        The dsRNA      used for
          this purpose         consists      of  synthetic         nucleic acid          single
          strands       without        defined      base       sequence,        The      single

                              -2
   strands undergo irregular base pairing, also known as
   "non-Watson-Crick" base pairing, giving rise to mismatched
   double strands.  The known dsRNA is used to inhibit the
   amplification of retroviruses such as HIV. Amplification
 5 of the virus can be inhibited when non-sequence-specific
   dsRNA is introduced into the cells.  This leads to the
   induction of interferon, which is intended to inhibit
   viral amplification. The inhibitory effect, or the
   activity, of this method is poor.
10
   It is known from Fire, A et al., NATURE, Vol. 391, pp. 806
   that dsRNA whose one strand is complementary in segments
   to a nematode gene to be inhibited inhibits the expression
   of this gene highly efficiently.  It is believed that the
15 particular activity of the dsRNA used in nematode cells is
   not due to the antisense principle but possibly on
   catalytic properties of the dsRNA, or enzymes induced by
   it. - Nothing is mentioned in this paper on the activity
   of specific dsRNA with regard to inhibiting the gene
20 expression, in particular in mammalian and human cells.
   It would be advantageous if at least preferred embodiments
   of the invention were to do away with the disadvantages of
   the prior art.  In particular, it would be advantageous if
25 at least preferred embodiments of the invention provided
   as effective as possible a method, medicament or use for
   the preparation of a medicament, which method, medicament
   or use is capable of causing particularly effective
   inhibition of the expression of a given target gene.
30
   In one aspect, the invention provides a method for
   inhibiting the expression of a given target gene in a
   cell, wherein an oligoribonucleotide with double-stranded
   structure (dsRNA) which has 15 to 49 base pairs is
35 introduced into the cell, wherein one strand of the dsRNA
   has a region I with not more than 49 successive nucleotide
   pairs and which is at least in parts complementary to the

                            - 2a
  target gene and wherein a complementary region II within
  the double-stranded structure is formed by two separate
  RNA single strands.
5 In accordance with the present invention, the region I
  which is complementary to the target gene exhibits not
  more than 49 successive nucleotide pairs.

                                     -3
   Provided     in    accordance         with      the      invention       are     an
   oligoribonucleotide          or   a   vector       encoding     therefor.       At
   least   segments        of   the    oligoribonucleotide              exhibit      a
   defined nucleotide sequence. The defined segment may be
 5 limited   to   the     complementary       region        I.  However,       it   is
   also    possible         that      all     of        the     double-stranded
   oligoribonucleotide            exhibits         a      defined      nucleotide
   sequence.
10 Surprisingly,         it     has     emerged          that     an     effective
   inhibition    of    the expression of            the target gene can be
   achieved    even    when     the    complementary          region     I   is   not
   more   than   49 base       pairs     in   length.        The   procedure       of
   providing         such        oligoribonucleotides                  is        less
15 complicated.
   In    particular,          dsRNA       with       a      length       of      over
   50 nucleotide           pairs        induces            certain         cellular
   mechanisms,      for     example       the    dsRNA-dependent            protein
20 kinase   or    the     2-5A     system,      in      mammalian      and     human
   cells.    This       leads      to     the      disappearance           of     the
   interference       effect       mediated         by      the    dsRNA       which
   exhibits a     defined sequence. As a                 consequence, protein
   biosynthesis       in     the    cell     is      blocked.      The      present
25 invention overcomes this disadvantage in particular.
   Furthermore,       the     uptake      of   dsRNA        with    short      chain
   lengths     into      the     cell      or     into       the     nucleus       is
   facilitated markedly over longer-chain dsRNAs.
30
   It has proved advantageous              for the dsRNA or the vector
   to   be   present        packaged       into       micellar       structures,
   preferably     in   liposomes.       The    dsRNA       or  the    vector      can
   likewise    be   enclosed       in   viral      natural       capsids      or   in
35 chemically or enzymatically produced artificial capsids
   or  structures      derived      therefrom.         -   The   abovementioned
   features make it possible to introduce                     the dsRNA or the
   vector into given target cells.

                                 - 4
   In accordance with the invention, the dsRNA has 15 to 49 base
   pairs.   Thus, the dsRNA can be longer than the region I, which
   is complementary to the target gene.    The complementary region I
   can be located at the terminus or inserted into the dsRNA.    Such
 5 dsRNA or a vector provided for coding the same can be produced
   synthetically or enzymatically by customary methods.
   The gene to be inhibited is expediently expressed in eukaryotic
   cells.   The target gene can be selected from the following
10 group: oncogene, cytokin gene,  Id protein gene, developmental
   gene, prion gene.   It can also be expressed in pathogenic
   organisms, preferably in plasmodia.    It can be part of a virus
   or viroid which is preferably pathogenic to humans. - The
   method proposed makes it possible to produce compositions for
15 the therapy of genetically determined diseases, for example
   cancer, viral diseases or Alzheimer's disease.
   The virus or viroid can also be a virus or viroid which is
   pathogenic to animals or plant-pathogenic.    In this case, the
20 method according to the invention also permits the provision of
   compositions for treating animal or plant diseases.
    In some embodiments, segments of the dsRNA are designed as
   double-stranded.   A region II which is complementary within the
25 double-stranded structure is formed by two separate RNA single
    strands or by autocomplementary regions of a topologically
    closed RNA single strand which is preferably in circular form.
    The ends of the dsRNA can be modified to counteract degradation
30  in the cell or dissociation into the single strands.
    Dissociation takes place in particular when low concentrations
    or short chain lengths are used.   To inhibit dissociation in a
    particularly effective.fashion, the cohesion of the
    complementary region II,

                                         -5
     which     is    caused      by    the      nucleotide        pairs,       can     be
      increased      by   at    least     one,      preferably        two,     further
     chemical       linkage(s).        -     A    dsRNA      according         to    the
      invention       whose      dissociation           is     reduced       exhibits
  5  greater stability to           enzymatic and chemical degradation
     in the cell or in the organism.
     The     complementary          region         II     can    be     formed        by
     autocomplementary         regions        of   an    RNA   hairpin      loop,     in
 10  particular       when     using       a     vector      according        to     the
     invention.      To afford protection from degradation, it is
     expedient     for the nucleotides             to be chemically modified
     in    the     loop      region       between         the     double-stranded
     structure.
 15
     The   chemical        linkage       is      expediently        formed       by     a
     covalent     or    ionic    bond,     a    hydrogen      bond,    hydrophobic
     interactions,         preferably          van-der-Waals         or     stacking
     interactions,        or    by    metal-ion          coordination.          In    an
20   especially      advantageous       aspect,       it can be      formed at        at
     least one,      preferably both,           end(s) of      the complementary
     region II.
     It  has   furthermore        proved       to   be   advantageous        for    the
25  chemical      linkage     to   be    formed by        one   or more       linkage
    groups,        the       linkage          groups        preferably           being
    poly(oxyphosphinicooxy-1,3-propanediol)                        and/or        poly
    ethylene     glycol     chains.      The     chemical      linkage     can     also
    be formed by purine analogs used in place of purines in
30  the   complementary        regions       II.    It   is   also   advantageous
    for   the    chemical      linkage       to    be   formed     by   azabenzene
    units     introduced       into    the      complementary         regions       II.
    Moreover,       it    can    be   formed        by    branched      nucleotide
    analogs       used      in     place        of     nucleotides         in       the
35  complementary regions II.
    It   has   proved      expedient       to    use    at   least     one    of    the
    following      groups     for   generating         the   chemical      linkage:
    methylene        blue;       bifunctional             groups,       preferably

                                     -6
    bis(2-chloroethyl)amine;                     N-acetyl-N'-(p-glyoxyl
    benzoyl)cystamine;            4-thiouracil;           psoralene.           The
    chemical      linkage       can     furthermore         be     formed        by
    thiophosphoryl      groups       provided      at    the    ends     of    the
  5 double-stranded       region.      The    chemical      linkage      at    the
    ends of the double-stranded            region is preferably formed
    by triple-helix bonds.
    The   chemical     linkage     can     expediently       be    induced      by
10  ultraviolet light.
    The   nucleotides      of    the   dsRNA     can    be   modified.       This
    counteracts     the  activation,        in   the   cell,    of   a   double
    stranded-RNA-dependent               protein           kinase,           PKR.
15  Advantageously,      at    least    one   2'-hydroxyl       group     of  the
    nucleotides of the dsRNA in the complementary region II
    is replaced by a chemical group, preferably a                      2'-amino
    or  a   2'-methyl    group.      At   least    one    nucleotide       in   at
    least    one   strand    of   the    complementary        region     II   can
20  also be a locked nucleotide with a sugar                   ring which       is
    chemically      modified,       preferably        by    a     2'-0,      4'-C
    methylene     bridge.     Advantageously,         several     nucleotides
    are locked nucleotides.
25  A  further    especially      advantageous        embodiment       provides
    that   the   dsRNA  or    the vector       is   bound    to,    associated
    with or    surrounded by,       at least one viral          coat protein
    which originates      from a virus,         is  derived therefrom           or
    has been prepared        synthetically.        The    coat    protein     can
30  be  derived     from    polyomavirus.         The    coat    protein      can
    contain    the  polyomavirus        virus    protein 1      (VP1) and/or
    virus protein 2      (VP2). The use of such coat proteins is
    known     from,    for      example,      DE 196     18 797 Al,        whose
    disclosure       is       herewith         incorporated.           -      The
35  abovementioned      features        considerably        facilitate        the
    introduction     of   the    dsRNA    or   of   the    vector     into    the
    cell.

   When a capsid or capsid-type structure is formed from the
   coat protein, one side preferably faces the interior of
   the capsid or capsid-type structure. The construct formed
   is particularly stable.
 5
   The dsRNA can be complementary to the primary or processed
   RNA transcript of the target gene.-   The cell can be a
   vertebrate cell or a human cell.
10 At least two dsRNAs which differ from each other or at
   least one vector encoding them can be introduced into the
   cell, where at least segments of one strand of each dsRNA
   are complementary to in each case one of at least two
   different target genes.   This makes it possible
15 simultaneously to inhibit the expression of at least two
   different target genes.   In order to suppress, in the
   cell, the expression of a double-stranded-RNA-dependent
   protein kinase, PKR, one of the target genes is
   advantageously the PKR gene.   This allows effective
20 suppression of the PKR activity in the cell.
   In another aspect, the invention provides a medicament
   with at least one oligoribonucleotide with double-stranded
   structure (dsRNA) which contains 15 to 49 base pairs for
25 inhibiting the expression of a given target gene in
   mammalian cells, wherein one strand of the dsRNA has a
   region I with not more than 49 successive nucleotide pairs
   and which is at least in parts complementary to the target
   gene and where a complementary region II within the
30 double-stranded structure is formed by two separate RNA
   single strands. - Surprisingly, it has emerged that such a
   dsRNA is suitable as medicament for inhibiting the
   expression of a given gene in mammalian cells.    In
    comparison with the use of single-stranded
35 oligoribonucleotides, the inhibition is already caused at
    concentrations which are lower by at least one order of
   magnitude.   The medicament according to the invention is

   highly effective.   Lesser side effects can be expected.
   Also described herein is a medicament with at least one
   vector for coding at least one oligoribonucleotide with
 5 double-stranded structure (dsRNA) for inhibiting the
   expression of a given target gene, where one strand of the
   dsRNA has a region I where at least segments are
   complementary to the target gene. - The medicament
   proposed exhibits the abovementioned advantages.   By using
10 a vector, in particular production costs can be reduced.
   The complementary region I has not more than 49 successive
   nucleotide pairs.   Surprisingly, it has emerged that an
   effective inhibition of the expression of the target gene
15 can be achieved even when the complementary region I is
   not more than 49 base pairs in length.   The procedure of
   providing such oligoribonucleotides is less complicated.
   In another aspect, the invention provides use of an
20 oligoribonucleotide with double-stranded structure (dsRNA)
   which has 15 to 49 base pairs for the preparation of a
   medicament for inhibiting the expression of a given target
   gene in mammalian cells, wherein one strand of the dsRNA
   has a region I with not more than 49 successive nucleotide
25 pairs and which is at least in parts complementary to the
   target gene and wherein a complementary region II within
    the double-stranded structure is formed by two separate
   RNA single strands. - Surprisingly, such a dsRNA is
    suitable for preparing a medicament for inhibiting the
30  expression of a given gene.  Compared with the use of
    single-stranded oligoribonucleotides, the inhibition is
   'already caused at concentrations which are lower by one
    order of magnitude when using dsRNA. The use according to
    the invention thus makes possible the preparation of
35  particularly effective medicaments.

                                  -9
   Also described herein is the use of a vector for coding at
   least one oligoribonucleotide with double-stranded
   structure    (dsRNA) for preparing a medicament for
   inhibiting the expression of a given target gene, where
 5 one strand of the dsRNA has a region I where at least
   segments are complementary to this target gene. - The use
   of a vector makes possible a particularly effective gene
   therapy.
10 In another aspect,    the invention provides a mammalian cell
   comprising an exogenous oligoribonucleotide, wherein the
   oligoribonucleotide has a double stranded structure
    (dsRNA) comprising   two separate RNA strands,    wherein one
   strand of the dsRNA has a region I which is complementary
15 to an RNA transcript of at least a part of the target
   gene.
   In another aspect, the invention provides an
   oligoribonucleotide having a double stranded structure

   Use example 1:
   The inhibition of transcription was detected by means of
   sequence homologous dsRNA in an in vitro transcription
20 system with a nuclear extract from human HeLa cells.   The
   DNA template for this experiment was plasmid pCMV1200
   which had been linearized by means of BamRl.
   Generation of the template plasmids:
25 The plasmid shown in fig. 1 was constructed for use in the
   enzymatic synthesis of the dsRNA. To this end, a
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the "positive control
   DNA" of the HelaScribe* Nuclear Extract in vitro
   transcription kit by Promega, Madison, USA, as

   DNA template was             first carried out.                One of the primers
   used contained            the    sequence        of    an    EcoRI     cleavage        site
   and      of    the    T7    RNA    polymerase           promoter        as    shown       in
   sequence listing No.               1. The other primer contained                        the
 5 sequence        of   a   BamHI     cleavage        site      and    of   the     SP6    RNA
   polymerase promoter as shown in sequence listing No. 2.
   In    addition,         the    two     primers        had,      at    the     3'     ends,
   regions which           were     identical        with or         complementary           to
   the DNA template.             The     PCR was       carried out          by means of
10 the      "Taq    PCR     Core    Kits"       by   Qiagen,        Hilden,        Germany,
   following          the      manufacturer's              instructions.              1.5 mM
   MgCl  2 ,   in   each     case     200 gM       dNTP,      in    each    case      0.5 gM
   primer,        2.5 U      Taq     DNA      polymerase          and     approximately
   100 ng       of     "positive        control        DNA"       were     employed         as
15 template        in   PCR     buffer       in   a   volume       of    100 gl.       After
   initial denaturation of                  the template DNA by heating for
   5 minutes        at     940C,     amplification            was     carried       out     in
   30 cycles        of    denaturation          for    in    each     case     60 seconds
   at    94C,       annealing        for      60 seconds - at           50C    below       the
20 calculated           melting         point         of        the       primers          and
   polymerization           for 1.5-2 minutes at 72 0 C.                 After a final
   polymerization            of     5 minutes         at      720C,       5 gl      of     the
   reaction        were    analyzed by agarose-gel                   electrophoresis.
   The      length     of     the    DNA      fragment         amplified         thus     was
25 400 base        pairs,       340 base        pairs      corresponding            to     the
   "positive control             DNA".       The    PCR    product       was    purified,
   hydrolyzed           with        EcoRI         and        BamHI         and,        after
   repurification,           employed in          the     ligation together              with
   a pUC18 vector which had also been hydrolyzed by EcoRI
30 and     BamHI.     E.    coli    XL1-blue was           then     transformed.          The
   plasmid       obtained       (pCMV5)       carries       a    DNA   fragment        whose
   5'   end    is   flanked by the             T7 promoter         and whose         3'   end
   is    flanked       by    the     SP6     promoter.         By    linearizing          the
   plasmid       with     BamHI,     it     can   be    employed        in   vitro      with
35 the T7-RNA polymerase                for     the run-off         transcription of
   a    single-stranded            RNA      which      is     340     nucleotides           in
   length      and     shown      in    sequence        listing        No.   3.     If    the
   plasmid       is   linearized        with      EcoRI,       it    can    be    employed
   for    the    run-off      transcription          with      SP6    RNA polymerase,

   with     the      method           outlined         hereinabove,           an     RNA     23
   nucleotides           in     length        was    also      synthesized.          To   this
   end,   a DNA       shown in sequence                 listing No.        4 was ligated

   sites.
   Plasmid      pCMV1200           was    constructed           as   DNA    template       for
   the  in-vitro          transcription             with      HeLa    nuclear      extract.
10 To  this      end,      a     1   191 bp       EcoRI/BamHI          fragment       of   the

   Nuclear        Extract           in      vitro         transcription           kit     was
   amplified        by      means        of     PCR.      The      amplified       fragment
   encompasses          the     828 bp        "immediate         early"     CMV    promoter
15 and   a     363 bp          transcribable             DNA      fragment.        The     PCR
   product        was        ligated           to      the      vector       pGEM-T       via
   "T-overhang" ligation.                  A BamHI cleavage             site is located
   at   the      5'      end       of     the      fragment.         The    plasmid       was
   linearized         by       hydrolysis           with       BamHI      and      used     as

   phenol extraction.               The RNA was precipitated by addition
   of 150 gl      of 7 M ammonium acatate                     [sic]     and 1 125 gl of

    hybridization.
    Generation of the RNA double strands:
  5 For   the   hybridization,             500    4   of    the    single-stranded
    RNA which had been             stored       in ethanol       and precipitated
    were    spun   down.      The     resulting         pellet     was     dried      and
    taken    up   in    30    4     of     PIPES      buffer,      pH 6.4       in    the
    presence    of   80%    formamide,           400 mM NaCl       and    1 mM     EDTA.
 10 In each case      15 gl       of  the complementary single                 strands
                                                                              0
    were   combined     and      heated       for    10 minutes       at   85 C.      The
    reactions were subsequently incubated overnight at 500C
    and cooled to room temperature.
15  Only approximately equimolar amounts                       of  the    two single
    strands were employed in the hybridization. This                             is why
    the   dsRNA    preparations            contained        single-stranded          RNA
     (ssRNA) as contaminant.              In order to         remove these        ssRNA
    contaminants,        the        reactions          were       treated,        after
20  hybridization,            with           the        single-strand-specific
    ribonucleases bovine pancreatic RNase A and Aspergillus
    oryzae RNase      Tl.     RNase      A   is    an endoribonuclease            which
    is    specific       for        pyrimidines.            RNase      Tl      is      an
    endoribonuclease which preferentially cleaves                          at the 3'
25  side   of   guanosines.         dsRNA       is   no    substrate       for    these
    ribonucleases.       For     the    RNase       treatment,      the     reactions
    in  300 gl    of   Tris,       pH 7.4,       300 mM NaCl        and    5 mM     EDTA
    were   treated with         1.2 4       of    RNaseA     at a    concentration
    of  10 mg/ml    and    2 gl      of RNaseTl         at   a  concentration          of
30  290 ag/ml.     The   reactions          were     incubated      for     1.5 hours
    at   300C.    Thereupon,          the       RNases      were     denatured        by
    addition of     5 gl     of proteinase K at a concentration of
    20 mg/ml     and    10 4        of     20%      SDS    and    incubation         for
                           0
    30 minutes     at   37 C.       The    dsRNA was        purified      by    phenol
35  extraction and precipitated with ethanol. To verify the
    completeness       of     the      RNase        digestion,        two     control
    reactions    were    treated         with     ssRNA     analogously        to    the
    hybridization reactions.

   The    dried   pellet was        taken up       in   15 gl    of  TE   buffer,
   pH 6.5,      and    subjected       to    native       polyacrylamide        gel
   electrophoresis        on    an   8%    gel.    The    acrylamide      gel   was
   subsequently       stained      in    an    ethidium     bromide      solution
 5 and washed in a water bath. Fig.                   2 shows     the RNA which
   had been visualized in a UV transilluminator. The sense
   RNA which had been applied to                 lane 1 and the antisense
   RNA which had been applied to lane 2 showed a different
   migration behavior under the chosen conditions than the
10 dsRNA of the hybridization reaction which had been
   applied     to    lane    3.    The    RNase-treated         sense    RNA   and
   antisense     RNA which       had been applied          to   lanes 4 and 5,
   respectively, produced no visible band. This shows                         that
   the single-stranded           RNAs had been degraded completely.
15 The    RNase-treated       dsRNA     of   the    hybridization       reaction
   which had been applied to lane 6 is resistant                        to RNase
   treatment.      The band which migrates faster in the native
   gel     in  comparison       with     the    dsRNA     applied    to    lane 3
   results      from    dsRNA      which      is    free     from    ssRNA.      In
20 addition to the dominant main band, weaker bands which
   migrate faster are observed after the RNase treatment.

   fluorescent        protein        (YFP)       gene      (dsRNA-YRP),        was
   studied.     This    dsRNA    had    been generated         analogously       to
   the     dsRNA  with    sequence       homology.       The    sequence     of   a
35 strand of      this   dsRNA     can be      found in      sequence     listing
   No. 5.     Plasmid    pCMV1200      was     used as      template     for   the
   run-off transcription.           It carries the "immediate early"
   cytomegalovirus        promoter        which     is    recognized      by   the
   eukaryotic      RNA polymerase          II,   and a     transcribable       DNA

     fragment.        Transcription was carried out by means of the
    HeLa     nuclear        extract,      which      contains all           the   proteins
    which are          necessary       for     transcription.           By   addition      of
     [_--P]rGTP         to   the    transcription reaction,                 radiolabeled
  5  transcript         was     obtained.        The     [--_PIrGTP          used     had   a
    specific          activity        of      400 Ci/mmol,           10 mCi/ml.         3 mM

    rGTP,     0.4 pM       [--    P]rGTP and depending on the experiment
    1 fmol of linearized plasmid DNA and various amounts of
 10 dsRNA        in     transcription            buffer         were      employed       per
    reaction.         Each batch was made up to                   a volume of        8.5 4l
    with     H2 0.   The    reactions        were mixed carefully.                To start
    the transcription,              4 U HeLa nuclear extract                 in a volume
    of   4 gl       were     added      and     incubated         for    60 minutes        at
15  300C.      The    reaction       was    stopped      by     addition      of   87.5    Ml
    of quench mix which had been warmed                                  0
                                                                  to  30 C.     To remove
    the proteins,           the reactions were treated with 100 gl of
    phenol/chloroform/isoamyl                     alcohol           (25:24:1         v/v/v)
    saturated         with     TE   buffer,       pH    5.0,      and    the    reactions
20  were       mixed        vigorously           for      1 minute.          For      phase
    separation,          the    reactions        were    spun      for    approximately
    1 minute          at     12 000 rpm           and       the      top     phase       was
    transferred into a fresh reaction vessel.                             Each reaction
    was   treated with 250 gl of                  ethanol.        The reactions were
25  mixed     thoroughly and           incubated for at              least    15 minutes
    on   dry        ice/methanol.          To     precipitate           the     RNA,     the
    reactions         were    spun     for     20 minutes         at   12   000 rpm      and
    400C.      The     supernatant        was      discarded.         The    pellet      was
    dried     in vacuo        for    15 minutes and resuspended                  in 10 Ml
30  of   H2 0.       Each     reaction         was     treated        with      10 gl     of
    denaturing         loading      buffer.       The   free      GTP    was    separated
    from      the     transcript         formed       by     means      of    denaturing
    polyacrylamide           gel     electrophoresis            on   an    8%    gel   with
    7 M urea.        The RNA transcripts formed upon transcription
35  with      HeLa      nuclear        extract,         in      denaturing         loading
    buffer,       were    heated       for    10 minutes         at   900C     and    10 gl
    aliquots were applied immediately to                          the freshly washed
    pockets.        The     electrophoresis            was      run    at    40 mA.      The
    amount         of      the       radioactive             ssRNA       formed        upon

   obtained         from      the     following       transcription           reactions

   It     emerged      that     the    amount     of    transcript        was   reduced
   markedly         in     the     presence        of     dsRNA       with     sequence
   homology         in     comparison         with      the       control      reaction
25 without       dsRNA       and   with     the    reactions        with    dsRNA    YFP
   without sequence homology. The positive control in                              lane
   2 shows that radioactive                 transcript was           formed upon the
   in-vitro       transcription           with    HeLa     nuclear       extract.    The
   reaction       is used        for comparison with              the transcription
30 reactions which             had been      incubated        in    the   presence of
   dsRNA.      Lanes       3   to   6    show    that     the     addition     of  non
   sequentially-specific                dsRNA    YFP     had     no   effect    on   the
   amount      of    transcript        formed.      Lanes      9   to   12  show   that
   the addition           of    an  amount      of   between       1.5    and  3 gg   of
35 sequentially-specific               dsRNA     CMV5     leads      to   a  reduction
   in the amount of transcript formed.                        In order to exclude
   that     the    effects       observed      are    based not         on  the   dsRNA
   but on any contamination which might have been carried
   along accidentally during the preparation of the dsRNA,

                                          -   16
     a  further      control was         carried out.         Single-stranded         RNA
     was    transcribed         as    described         above     and    subsequently
     subjected       to    the   RNase      treatment.       It   was    demonstrated
     by  means      of    native     polyacrylamide           gel   electrophoresis
  5  that      the    ssRNA      had    been       degraded      completely.        This
     reaction was subjected              to phenol extraction and ethanol
     precipitation          and   subsequently          taken up      in   PE buffer,
     as were the hybridization reactions.                      This gave a sample
     which     contained       no   RNA     but    had    been   treated with        the
10   same    enzymes       and    buffers       as    the   dsRNA.     Lane   8   shows
     that    the     addition       of    this      sample     had    no    effect     on
     transcription.          The    reduction          of   the    transcript      upon
     addition      of     sequence-specific             dsRNA   can    therefore       be
     ascribed        unequivocally             to    the     dsRNA      itself.      The
15   reduction of         the amount        of    transcript of a gene in the
    presence        of     dsRNA     in     a    human     transcription         system
     indicates      an     inhibition        of   the    expression      of  the   gene
     in question.         This    effect       can be attributed          to  a   novel
    mechanism caused by the dsRNA.

    Use example        2:
    The   test     system used for             these    in-vivo experiments          was
     the murine       fibroblast        cell      line NIH3T3,      ATCC CRL-1658.
    The   YFP     gene     was    introduced         into   the   nuclei     with    the
25  aid    of    microinjection.            Expression       of   YFP    was   studied
    under the effect            of   simultaneously cotransfected                 dsRNA
    with    sequence homology.               This    dsRNA    YFP   shows    homology
    with    the     5'-region       of    the     YFP    gene   over    a   length    of
    315 bp.       The     nucleotide         sequence      of   a   strand     of    the
30  dsRNA       YRP      is     shown       in      sequence       listing      No.   5.
    Evaluation          under      the        fluorescence         microscope       was
    carried      out    3 hours      after       injection     with    reference      to
    the greenish-yellow fluorescence of the YFP formed.
35  Construction          of  the    template        plasmid,      and preparation
    of the dsRNA:
    A   plasmid was constructed                 following the       same principle
    as   described        in   use    example 1        to   act   as   template     for
    the production of the YFP dsRNA by means of T7                            and SP6

    shown       in    sequence       listing        No.    6   and    BamSP6_YFP        as
    shown       in     sequence       listing        No. 7,       the    desired     gene
    fragment       was     amplified       by    PCR and used          analogously      to
  5 the      above      description          for    preparing        the    dsRNA.    The
    dsRNA      YFP    obtained       is   identical         to    the  dsRNA    used    in
    use example 1 as non-sequence-specific control.
    A dsRNA       linked chemically at                the    3'   end of the     RNA as
10  shown      in   sequence       listing       No.    8   to   the   5'   end  of   the
    complementary           RNA   via    a    C18    linker group        was prepared
     (L-dsRNA).        To    this end,       synthons       modified by       disulfide
    bridges were used. The                 3'-terminal         synthon     is bound to
    the     solid     support      via   the     3'   carbon with an aliphatic
15  linker group via a disulfide bridge.                         In the 5'-terminal
    synthon       of    the   complementary          oligoribonucleotide           which
    is    complementary to           the 3'-terminal            synthon of      the one
    oligoribonucleotide,              the     5'-trityl        protecting      group is
    bound      via    a    further     aliphatic         linker     and   a   disulfide

    groups      which       form    are    brought        into    spatial     vicinity.
    The      single        strands      are      linked        to    each    other     by
25  oxidation        via     their    aliphatic        linkers      and a     disulfide
    bridge.       This     is   followed by purification with                   the aid
    of HPLC.
    Preparation of the cell cultures:
30  The      cells     were     incubated         in    DMEM     supplemented       with
    4.5 g/l       glucose,        10%    fetal       bovine       serum    in   culture
    dishes at        37 0 C under a      7.5% CO 2 atmosphere            and passaged
    before       reaching       confluence.          The     cells     were    detached
    with      trypsin/EDTA.         To  prepare         for    microinjection,        the
35  cells were transferred                into     Petri     dishes and incubated
    further until microcolonies formed.

    Microinjection:
     For the microinjection,               the culture dishes were removed
     from     the     incubator          for      approximately          10 minutes.
    Approximately          50 nuclei           were     injected        singly      per
  5  reaction       within        a      marked       area      using       the     AIS
    microinjection          system         from     Carl      Zeiss,      G6ttingen,
    Germany.      The     cells       were      subsequently         incubated      for
     three more      hours.     For     the microinjection,            borosilicate
    glass      capillaries          from       Hilgenberg       GmbH,       Malsfeld,
 10 Germany, with a diameter of less                    than 0.5 gm at         the tip
    were prepared.        The microinjection was carried out using
    a micromanipulator from Narishige                    Scientific Instrument
    Lab.,    Tokyo,    Japan.       The    injection      time was       0.8   seconds
    and    the     pressure          was      approximately          100 hPa.       The
15  transfection       was     carried        out   using     the    plasmid pCDNA
    YFP, which contains an approximately                      800 bp BamHI/EcoRI
    fragment      with     the      YFP      gene    in    vector      pcDNA3.      The
    samples     injected      into      the     nuclei    contained       0.01 gg/gl

    Approximately        100    pl     of    RNA   with     a  concentration         of
    1 yM    or,    in    the     case       of   the    L-dsRNA,       375 gM     were
    additionally added.
25  The   cells were       studied under a            fluorescence microscope
    with    excitation        with        the    light     of     the     excitation
    wavelength      of    Texas      Red,      568 nm,     or   of    YFP,    488 nm.
    Individual      cells were         documented by means            of a    digital
    camers.     Figures     4a-e     show the result          for NIH3T3        cells.
30  In the cells       shown in Fig. 4a,            sense-YFP-ssRNA has been
    injected,      in    Fig.    4b    antisense-YFP-ssRNA,             in    Fig.   4c

    The    field      on    the       left      shows     in     each     case     the
35  fluorescence       of    cells      with     excitation       at   568 nm.     The
    fluorescence       of    the     same      cells    at    an    excitation       of
    488 nm is seen on the right. The Texas Red fluorescence
    of all    the cells       shown demonstrates             that    the   injection
    solution had been applied                 successfully       into the nuclei

     shows  regions    with sequence       homology     to   the YFP     gene.
15   This  result    demonstrates      that   even    shorter dsRNAs       can
     be used for -specifically inhibiting             gene expression in
     maunals    when. .t.he   double     strands      are   stabilized      by
