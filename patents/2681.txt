                                         ABSTRACT
[0251]     The invention disclosed herein describes biomarkers useful for prognosis, selection
and monitoring of oncolytic virus therapy for patients with various types of cancer.          In
particular, the present invention provides identification of proteins whose expression patterns
are strongly predictive of the outcome of oncolytic virus therapy in a patient with cancer. The
present invention provides a method for identifying and selecting cancer patients who are likely
to be non-responsive to onocolytic virus therapy. These patients can be co-administered an
agent that stimulates a cell-mediated immune response in the patient with the oncolytic virus
or can be administered a therapy other than oncolytic virus therapy.

                                         BACKGROUND
I.      Field of Invention
[002]       The present invention relates generally to the fields of oncology and cancer therapy.
In some aspects, the present invention concerns combination therapies including oncolytic
viruses such as adenoviruses and immune modulating therapies.         In other aspects, the present
invention concerns the measurement or detection of biomarkers that distinguish responders from
non-responders to oncolytic viral therapy.
II.     Background
[003]       It is estimated that 43,800 new cases of primary brain tumor, both malignant and
nonmalignant, were diagnosed in the U.S. in 2005. It was estimated at 20,500 primary malignant
brain tumors including astrocytic (42%) were expected in 2007.             This was a more male
predominant disease with estimated 11,700 in men and 8,800 in women in 2007. There were
approximately 12,700 people who died with brain disease from these tumors estimated in the US
                                                  1

       WO 2013/112942                                                          PCT/US2013/023304
in 2007. These tumors account for 1.4% of all adult cancers and 22% of all childhood cancers.
This accounts for 2.4% of all cancer related deaths (SEER Cancer Statistics Review).
[004]       Onocolytic viruses have shown potential as anti-cancer agents. Genetic modification
of the viruses to selectively replicate in cancer cells further increases their efficacy. In gliomas,
for example, three kinds of viruses have been shown to be useful in animal models: reoviruses
that can replicate selectively in tumors with an activated ras pathway (Coffey et al., 1998);
genetically altered herpes simplex viruses (Martuza et al., 1991; Mineta et al., 1995; Andreanski
et al., 1997), including those that can be activated by the different expression of protein in
normal and cancer cells (Chase et al., 1998); and mutant adenoviruses that are unable to express
the ElB55 kDa protein and are used to treat p53-mutant tumors (Bischof et al., 1996; Heise et
al., 1997; Freytag et al., 1998; Kim et al., 1998). In all three systems, the goal is the intratumoral
spread of the virus and the ability to selectively kill cancer cells.           Genetically modified
adenoviruses that target cellular pathways at key points have both potent and selective anti
cancer effects in gliomas. Frequently tested modifications of the adenovirus include deletion of
the viral genes that interact with tumor suppressor genes, the modification of the tropism to
infect cancer cells with more potency, and the inclusion in the viral genome of elements of
transcription that are sensitive to transcription factors upregulated in cancer cells.
[005]       The role that preexisting immune conditions play and their influence in the overall
clinical outcome of oncolytic virus therapy is presently unknown. The ability to accurately
predict survival in patients treated with oncolytic viruses such as Delta-24-RGD would improve
current treatment decisions. Furthermore, it would aid in the design of new therapies that may be
tailored, with the basis of tumor properties and immune status. A significant advance in the field
of biotherapy would occur because there is presently a dramatic lack of clinical biomarkers for
cancer immunotherapy strategies.
[006]       The need for therapies effective against primary tumors of the nervous system, such
as diffuse gliomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, anaplastic mixed
oligoastrocytoma, glioblastoma, ependymomas, and anaplastic ependymomas, or any primary
brain tumor is particularly acute.

      WO 2013/112942                                                        PCT/US2013/023304
                                            SUMMARY
[007]        The present invention relates to the identification of Th1 (inflammatory) cytokines
and antibodies against tumor associated antigens as biomarkers for correlating their expression
patterns as predictors of responsiveness to treatment with oncolytic viruses in patients with
cancer.    The invention thus provides for the identification and use of expression profiles which
correlate with (and thus are able to discriminate between) patients with good or poor treatment
outcomes. In several embodiments, the invention provides expression patterns that are able to
identify patients with cancer that are likely to be non-responsive to treatment with an oncolytic
virus from those that are responsive or likely to be responsive to treatment with an oncolytic
virus.    Responsiveness may be viewed in terms of better survival outcomes over time.
Responsiveness may also be viewed in terms of reduction in tumor size according to e.g. the
RECIST criteria.
[008]        The present invention also relates to novel methods for treating cancer patients
comprising the co-administration of oncolytic virus and agents which stimulate a Th1 immune
response in the patient and/or suppress a Th2 immune response and/or suppress regulatory T
cells in the patient.
[009]        In one aspect, the present invention provides an objective means for identifying
patients with cancer as likely to respond, or not respond, to treatment with an oncolytic virus by
assaying for the expression level of one or more of the biomarkers described herein. Expression
of these biomarkers thus provides an objective means to determine cancer prognosis (treatment
outcome) with significant accuracy.       These biomarkers may be used in combination with
subjective criteria.
[010]        The biomarkers described herein are identified as correlating with oncolytic virus
treatment outcome in patients with cancer such that their expression levels are relevant to
determining appropriate treatment protocols. In one embodiment, the patient is a patient with a
high grade glioma and the oncolytic virus is an adenovirus such as Delta-24-RGD.
                                                  3

       WO 2013/112942                                                          PCT/US2013/023304
 [011]      The biomarkers described herein may be used singly with significant accuracy or in
any combination, such as in the format of a ratio of expression levels, to increase the ability to
accurately correlate an expression profile with a treatment outcome. The biomarkers can be used
to predict treatment responsiveness, survival outcome and determination and/or alteration of
therapy. The ability to identify patients likely to respond to, or likely not to respond to, oncolytic
virus therapy is conferred by the identification of an expression level of the biomarkers and not
by the methodology used to determine such expression level. Thus, the assay may utilize any
feature of a biomarker described herein as long as the assay provides a qualitative or preferably a
quantitative expression of the protein (or gene).       By way of example, a biomarker can be
measured     or   detected    by  a   variety   of methods,      including,    but not    limited    to
immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunoassays, protein arrays, reverse protein arrays, nucleic acid
arrays, mass spectroscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the like.
[012]       In several embodiments, a method for predicting whether a patient having or
suspected of having cancer will respond therapeutically to a method of treating cancer
comprising administering an oncolytic virus is provided comprising the steps of (a) determining
the level of expression of one or more Th1 biomarkers and/or one or more Th2 biomarkers
and/or one or more antibodies against one or more tumor associated antigens in a test sample
from the patient relative to a control (b) comparing the level of expression of one or more Th1
biomarkers and/or one or more Th2 biomarkers and/or one or more antibodies against one or
more tumor associated antigens in the test sample to that in the control, wherein a change in the
level of expression of one or more Th1 and/or one or more Th2 biomarkers and/or antibodies
against one or more tumor associated antigens in the test sample relative to the control sample is
predictive of the patient's treatment response to the oncolytic virus. The test samples include but
are not limited to blood, plasma, serum, tissue biopsy, and cerebrospinal fluid.            In related
embodiments, the method comprises determining the level of at least one Th1 biomarker and the
level of antibodies against at least one tumor associated antigen in step (a) and comparing these
levels to a control in step (b).
                                                   4

      WO 2013/112942                                                         PCT/US2013/023304
[013]       The expression level of the one or more biomarkers can be determined prior to,
simultaneous with or after administration of an oncolytic virus in order to predict the outcome of
the therapy. In one embodiment, a method for treating cancer in a patient is provided comprising
(a) determining the level of expression of one or more Th1 biomarkers and/or one or more Th2
biomarkers and/or one or more antibodies against one or more tumor associated antigens in a test
sample from the patient obtained prior to administration of an oncolytic virus relative to a control
(b) comparing the level of expression of one or more Thl biomarkers and/or one or more Th2
biomarkers and/or one or more antibodies against one or more tumor associated antigens in the
test sample to that in the control, wherein a change in the level of expression of one or more Thl
and/or one or more Th2 biomarkers and/or antibodies against one or more tumor associated
antigens in the test sample relative to the control sample is predictive of the patient's treatment
response to the oncolytic virus and optionally (c) administering the oncolytic virus to the patient
if the patient is determined to be likely to respond to treatment with the virus. In a preferred
embodiment, oncolytic virus is an adenovirus such as Delta-24-RGD, the test sample is a serum
sample and the levels IL-12p70 and optionally at least one additional Th1 biomarker are
determined in the sample and compared to a control.
[014]       In a related embodiment, the patient is determined as unlikely to respond to the
oncolytic virus treatment if low levels of one or more Th1 biomarkers (e.g. IL-12p70) and/or
high levels of antibodies against one or more tumor associated antigens (e.g. NLRP4) are
determined in the test sample relative to a control. For example, step (b) as described above may
comprise detecting the level of one or more Thl biomarkers and/or antibodies against one or
more tumor associated antigens in the test sample relative to the level of one or more Thl
biomarkers and/or antibodies against one or more tumor associated antigens from a subject
having the same cancer that is responsive to treatment with the oncolytic virus, wherein lower
levels of one or more Thl biomarkers and/or higher levels of antibodies against one or more
tumor associated antigens in the subject having the same cancer that is responsive to treatment
indicates that the patient is non-responsive to treatment with the oncolytic virus. Preferably, the
test sample from the patient and the sample from the subject are taken at the same time point.
Thus, the expression pattern of the biomarkers described herein is useful for the identification of
                                                  5

      WO 2013/112942                                                          PCT/US2013/023304
patients presenting with cancer that are unlikely to respond to treatment with an oncolytic virus.
These patients are thus identified as good candidates for co-administration of agents which
stimulate a Th1 immune response with an oncolytic virus.           Alternatively, these patients are
identified as good candidates for alternative treatment modalities.
[015]       In another related embodiment, the patient is determined as likely to respond to
oncolytic virus treatment if high levels of one or more Th1 biomarkers (e.g. IL-12p70) and/or
low levels of antibodies against one or more tumor associated antigens (e.g. NLRP4) are
determined in the test sample relative to a control. For example, step (b) as described above may
comprise detecting the level of one or more Th1 biomarkers and/or antibodies against one or
more tumor associated antigens in the test sample relative to the level of one or more Th1
biomarkers and/or antibodies against one or more tumor associated antigens from a subject
having the same cancer that is not responsive to treatment with the oncolytic virus, wherein
higher levels of one or more Th1 biomarkers and/or lower levels of antibodies against one or
more tumor associated antigens in the subject having the same cancer that is not responsive to
treatment indicates that the patient is responsive to treatment with the oncolytic virus.
Preferably, the test sample from the patient and the sample from the subject are taken at the same
time point. Thus, the expression pattern of the biomarkers described herein is useful for the
identification of patients presenting with cancer that that are likely to respond to treatment with
an oncolytic virus. These patients are good candidates for administration of the oncolytic virus
and may be administered the virus.
[016]       In other embodiments,         a method for evaluating a patient with cancer for
responsiveness to oncolytic viral therapy is provided comprising (a) measuring or detecting one
or more biomarkers indicative of the immunologic status of the subject in a test sample from the
subject (b) identifying, based on the levels of the one or more biomarkers, a subject having
cancer that is likely or not likely to respond to the therapy, wherein a favorable response is likely
if the immune status of the subject indicates a Thi polarization and optionally (c) administering
the subject an oncolytic viral therapy if a favorable response is likely. In certain aspects, the
biomarker is a cytokine, cell surface marker, or antibody.

       WO 2013/112942                                                       PCT/US2013/023304
 [017]      In one aspect, a method for predicting the likelihood that a subject will respond
therapeutically to a method of treating cancer by administering an oncolytic virus comprises the
following steps: (a) measuring the expression level of at least one biomarker suitable for
determining the Th1 and/or Th2 immunologic status of the subject prior to administration of the
virus (b) comparing the expression level of step (a) to a predetermined control, whereby an
increase in one or biomarkers of Th1 immune status relative to the control and/or a decrease in
one or more biomarkers of Th2 immune status relative to the control indicates an increased
likelihood that the subject will respond therapeutically to said method of treating cancer and
optionally (c) administering an oncolytic virus to the subject if an increased likelihood of
response is indicated.
[018]       In another aspect, the expression level of one or more biomarkers in a patient with
cancer is assessed at multiple time points as a means of predicting the patient's clinical outcome
wherein the patient is undergoing oncolytic virus therapy. This method comprises measuring at
least one Th1 biomarker and/or antibodies against at least one tumor associated antigen in two or
more test samples from the patient over a period of time in order to determine whether a patient
should continue treatment with the oncolytic virus or alternatively whether the patient is a
candidate for co-administration of an agent to produce a Th1 phenotype. A decrease in at least
one Th1 biomarker and/or an increase in antibodies against one or more tumor associated
antigens compared to the level of the same Th1 biomarker(s) and/or antibodies at an earlier time
point indicates that the patient is at risk for a negative outcome. Alternatively, a decrease in at
least one Th1 biomarker and/or an increase in antibodies against one or more tumor associated
antigens compared to the level of the same Th1 biomarker(s) and/or antibodies in another patient
undergoing the same treatment indicates that the patient is at risk for a negative outcome. Thus,
in one embodiment, a method for treating cancer in a patient having or suspected of having
cancer is provided comprising (a) administering an oncolytic virus (b) measuring the level of one
or more Th1 biomarkers and/or antibodies against one or more tumor associated antigens at a
first time point and at a subsequent second time point and (c) comparing the level of one or more
Th1 biomarkers and/or antibodies against one or more tumor antigens at the first time point and
the second time point wherein a decrease in one or more Th1 biomarkers and/or an increase in

antibodies against one or more tumor antigens at the second time point compared to the first time
point or compared to the level of the same Th1 biomarkers and/or antibodies in another patient
with the same cancer and administered the same oncolytic virus indicates that the patient is non
responsive to treatment with the oncolytic virus. Onocolytic virus therapy may be discontinued
in patients identified as non-responsive to the virus; alternatively, one or more agents that
produce a Th1 phenotype may be co-administered to the patient with the virus.
[019]        In one aspect, biomarkers of Th1 immune status (i.e. Th1 biomarkers) include,
without limitation, immunomodulators such as IL-1f, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, IFN-y, TNF-a,
TNF-p, GM-CSF, cleaved caspase-3, neopterin, and j2-microglobulin. Th1 biomarkers may be
used alone or in any combination according to the methods described herein. In a preferred
embodiment, the expression of at least 1, at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at
least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11 or all 12 ThI biomarkers selected from the
group consisting of IL1p, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, IFN-y, TNF-a, TNF-P, GM-CSF, cleaved
caspase-3, neopterin, and P2 microglobulin is measured in a test sample from a patient. In a
particularly preferred embodiment, the expression of IL-12 and optionally at least 1, at least 2, at
least 3 at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, or at least 10 biomarkers
selected from the group consisting of ILl P, IL-2, IL-8, IL-18, IFN-y, TNF-Ca, TNF-p, GM-CSF,
cleaved caspase-3, neopterin, and P2 microglobulin is measured in a test sample from a
patient. In other preferred embodiments, the expression of at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or all 8 Th1
biomarkers selected from the group consisting of IL1P, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12 IFN-y, TNF-a, GM
CSF, and cleaved caspase-3 is measured in a test sample from a patient. Elevated expression of
any (and preferably of the majority or all) of these biomarkers relative to a predetermined control
indicates an increased likelihood that the patient will respond to oncolytic virus therapy. It
should be understood that if, for example 10 Th1 biomarkers are assessed in a test sample from
the patient, a high level of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 of these biomarkers, in any combination, or a
high level of all 10 of these biomarkers, indicates that the patient is likely to respond favorably to
oncolytic virus therapy.

[020]       In other aspects, biomarkers of Th2 immune status (i.e. Th2 biomarkers) include,
without limitation, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, TGF-p and phosphorylated STAT3.               Th2
biomarkers may be used alone or in any combination according to the methods described herein.
Preferably, at least one, at least 2, 3, 4, 5, or at least 6 Th2 biomarkers selected from the group
consisting of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, TGF-P and phosphorylated STAT3 are measured in
a test sample from a patient. It should be understood that if, for example 5 Th2 biomarkers are
assessed in a test sample from the patient, a high level of 1, 2, 3, or 4 of these biomarkers, in any
combination, or a high level of all 5 of these biomarkers, indicates that the patient is unlikely to
respond favorably to oncolytic virus therapy.
[021]       In related embodiments, the expression of at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or all 8 Th1
biomarkers selected from the group consisting of ILlp, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-y, TNF-a, GM
CSF and cleaved caspase-3, and at least one, at least two or all three Th2 biomarkers selected
from the group consisting of IL-6, IL- 10 and phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr 705) are measured in a
test sample from a patient according to the methods of the invention. In a particularly preferred
embodiment, the methods comprise measuring the expression of IL-12 and optionally at least 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or all 7 biomarkers selected from the group consisting of ILlp, IL-2, IL-8, IFN-y,
GM-CSF, TNF-a and cleaved caspase-3, and measuring the expression of at least 1, 2, or all 3
biomarkers selected from the group consisting of IL-6, IL-10 and phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr
705).   Elevated expression of any (and preferably all) of the Th1 biomarkers and similar or
decreased expression of any (and preferably all) of the Th2 biomarkers relative to a
predetermined controls indicates an increased likelihood that the subject will respond to
oncolytic virus therapy.      Preferably, the expression of the Thl biomarkers and the Th2
biomarkers is calculated and a ratio of Thl/Th2 biomarker expression is calculated, whereby a
ratio higher than that of a predetermined control indicates an increased likelihood that the subject
will respond to oncolytic virus therapy. For example, a ratio above 0.2, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0,
2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0 or more indicates an increased likelihood that the subject will respond to
oncolytic virus therapy.      In a related embodiment, the method comprises measuring the
expression of IL-12 and optionally IL-6 or IL-10 in a test sample from the subject, wherein an
                                                    9

increased ratio of IL-i 2/IL-6 and/or IL- 12/IL-10 expression relative to a predetermined control

[022]        In another aspect, biomarkers of Thi immune status include cell surface markers
including, without limitation, CXCR3, CCR5, CCR1 and IL-12 receptor               Pl and a chains. In
other aspects, biomarkers of Th2 immune status include, without limitation, cell surface markers
including, without limitation, CXCR4, CCR3, CCR4, CCR7, CCR8, IL-I receptor and CD30.
[023]        In another aspect, biomarkers that may be measured as a means for determining the
immune status of a patient with cancer include without limitation, antibodies against tumor
associated antigens (e.g. cancer/testis antigens) selected from the group consisting of BRAF,

group consisting of CABYR, MAGEA1, MAGEA3, MAGEB6, NYESO1, PBK, SSX2, SSX5,
and ZNF165 is measured in a test sample from the subject. A high level of expression of one or
more of these tumor associated antigens compared to a control level indicates that the patient is

antibodies against 9 tumor associated antigens (biomarkers) are assessed in a test sample from
the patient, a high level of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 of these biomarkers, in any combination, or a
high level of all 9 of these biomarkers, indicates that the patient is unlikely to respond favorably
to oncolytic virus therapy.
[024]        In related embodiments, the expression of at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or all 8 Th1

SPANXA1, SSX2, SSX4, SSX5, TSGA1O, TSSK6, TULP2, XAGE2, and ZNF165 are measured
in a test sample from a patient according to the methods of the invention. In a particularly
preferred embodiment, the methods comprise measuring the expression of IL-12 and optionally
at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or all 7 biomarkers selected from the group consisting of ILl P, IL-2, IL-8,
IFN-y, GM-CSF, TNF-a and cleaved caspase-3, and measuring the expression of antibodies
against at least one, at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 7, 8, or at least 9 tumor associated antigens selected from
the group consisting of: CABYR, MAGEA1, MAGEA3, MAGEB6, NLRP4, NYESO1, PBK,
SSX2, SSX5, and ZNF165.               Elevated expression of any (and preferably all) of the Th1
biomarkers and/or decreased expression of any (and preferably all) of the antibodies against
tumor associated antigens relative to a predetermined controls indicates an increased likelihood
that the subject will respond to oncolytic virus therapy.
[025]        In a preferred embodiment, the test sample obtained from the patient is a serum
sample and the level of IL-12 and optionally at least one additional Th1 biomarker is determined
e.g. by ELISA. Alternatively or additionally the level of at least one Th2 biomarker and/or the
level of antibody against NLRP4 and optionally at least one additional tumor associated antigen
is measured in a serum sample from the patient.

[026]        In yet another aspect, the immunologic status of the patient is determined by
measuring the level of one or more Thi biomarkers and the level of antibodies against one or
more tumor antigens as described above in a test sample (e.g. serum) from a patient prior to or
during oncolytic virus therapy. Thus, a patient with a low level of one or more Thi biomarkers
(e.g. IL-12) and a high level of antibodies against one or more tumor antigens (e.g. NLRP4)
compared to a control level of Thi biomarkers and antibodies against one or more tumor
antigens is unlikely to respond to oncolytic virus therapy. Conversely, a patient with a high level
of one or more Thi biomarkers and a low level of antibodies against one or more tumor antigens
compared to a control level is likely to respond favorably to oncolytic virus therapy.
[027]        In other related aspects, the method comprises isolating lymphocytes from a tissue
sample from the subject. In one aspect, the concentration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is measured
(e.g. by flow cytometric analysis following treatment with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies)
and a ratio of CD8*/CD4+ cells in the test sample is calculated, whereby an increased ratio of
CD8*/CD4* cells in the test sample relative to a predetermined control indicates an increased
likelihood that the subject will respond to oncolytic virus therapy.            In another aspect,
lymphocytes are isolated from a tissue sample from the subject and a ratio of FoxP3-/FoxP3+
cells is calculated, whereby an increased ratio of FoxP3-/FoxP3+ cells in the test sample relative
to a predetermined control indicates an increased likelihood that the subject will respond to
oncolytic virus therapy. FoxP3 is predominantly expressed on and therefore serves as a marker
for regulatory T cells which act to suppress cell mediated immunity.          Optionally, FoxP3 is
measured along with CD25 and CD4 as a method for determining the level of regulatory T cells.
CD4+, CD8+ or regulatory T cells can be detected for example with anti-FoxP3, anti-CD4, anti
CD8, anti-CD38, and anti-HLA-DR antibodies.            Surface marker profiles specific for T cell
subsets are known in the art.
[028]        In related aspects, the method comprises measuring in at least one test sample from a
subject (i) the percentage of CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells and optionally FOXP3+ cells relative to total
lymphocytes in the sample and (ii) the level of antibodies against at least one tumor associated
antigen and/or (iii) the level of at least one Thi biomarker, whereby a percentage of CD4+ and/or
                                                   12

FoxP3+ cells greater than 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90% of total lymphocytes and a high level of antibody
against at least one tumor associated antigen and/or a low level of Th1 biomarker relative to a
predetermined control indicates that the subject is unlikely to respond to oncolytic viral therapy.
Conversely, a higher percentage of CD8+ cells relative to CD4+ and/or FoxP3+ cells and/or a low
level of antibody against at least one tumor associated antigen and/or a high level of Th1
biomarker relative to a predetermined control indicates that the subject is likely to respond to
oncolytic viral therapy.
[029]       In another embodiment, a method for treating cancer in a subject is provided
comprising the following steps: (a) administering to the subject an oncolytic virus for a treatment
period (b) measuring one or more Th1 and/or Th2 biomarkers in a test sample from the subject at
least twice during the treatment period and (c)(1) co-administering a Th1 stimulating agent with
the oncolytic virus or (c)(2) discontinuing administration of the oncolytic virus if a decrease in
the level of one or more Th1 biomarkers is detected. Optionally, one or more Th1 and/or Th2
biomarkers are measured in a test sample just before or at the beginning of the treatment period
in order to provide a baseline measurement. A reduction in one or more Th1 biomarkers during
the treatment period indicates a need for either co-administration of a Th1 stimulating agent with
the virus or termination of oncolytic virus therapy, particularly if the level of one or more Th2
biomarkers is not reduced (e.g. remains substantially the same or increases).
[030]       Test samples obtained from a subject according to the methods, include without
limitation, one or more samples obtained from tissue (e.g. tumor biopsy), cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF), lymph, blood, plasma, serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), lymph fluid,
lymphocytes, synovial fluid and urine. In particular embodiments, the test sample is obtained
from CSF or tumor tissue. In other particular embodiments, the test sample is obtained from
tumor tissue and e.g. the relative number of CD4+ and/or CD8+ cells in the sample is determined
and/or the level of one or more Th1 and/or Th2 cytokines in the sample is measured e.g. by
immunofluorescent staining of fixed and permeabilized cells from the sample with antibodies
against the Th1 and/or Th2 cytokines.       In other particular embodiments, the test sample is
                                                 13

obtained from blood and e.g. the level of one or more Th1 and/or Th2 cytokines in the sample is
measured by ELISA.
[031]        In a broad aspect, the present invention also provides a combination therapy for
treating cancer in a patient comprising co-administering the patient an oncolytic virus and one or
more agents that produce a Th1 immune phenotype. This methodology of using both oncolytic
viruses (e.g. adenoviruses) and immune stimulatory agents is counterintuitive since activating the
immune system could potentially reduce the level of oncolysis produced by viruses such as
Delta-24-RGD.      An activated immune system would be expected to clear the virus at an
accelerated rate and thus reduce the effectiveness of the oncolytic virus therapy.          Indeed,
evidence suggests that slowing the development of Th1 responses is important for the efficacy of
oncolytic therapy. The present inventors, however, have surprisingly discovered that the patients
who exhibit strong tumor responses radiographically as well as prolonged survival show virus
replication, immune stimulation, and activation of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. Contrariwise,
the present inventors have surprisingly discovered that patients demonstrating a relatively strong
Th1 profile are more likely to exhibit a positive response to oncolytic therapy.
[032]        The agent that produces a Th1 immune phenotype in the patient can be administered
prior to, during or after administration of the oncolytic virus. In one embodiment, a patient with
cancer that is determined to be at risk for not responding favorably to oncolytic virus therapy
according to any of the methods heretofore described, is co-administered with the virus one or
more Th1 stimulating agents in an amount sufficient to increase the level of one or more Th1
biomarkers of the invention and/or decrease the level of one or more Th2 biomarkers and/or
decrease the level of antibodies against one or more tumor associated antigens. In a preferred
embodiment, the patient is administered one or more agents that produce a Th1 immune
phenotype prior to administration of the oncolytic virus in order to "prime" the patient's immune
system to respond favorably to oncolytic virus therapy and therefore increase the likelihood that
the patient will have a favorable clinical outcome. In another embodiment, a patient with cancer
that is determined to be likely to respond favorably to oncolytic virus therapy according to any of
the methods heretofore described, is co-administered with the virus one or more Thl stimulating

agents in an amount sufficient to increase the level of one or more Th1 biomarkers of the
invention and/or decrease the level of one or more Th2 biomarkers and/or decrease the level of
antibodies against one or more tumor associated antigens. In a preferred embodiment, the patient
is administered one or more agents that produce a Th1 immune phenotype prior to administration
of the oncolytic virus in order "prime" the patient's immune system in order to boost the anti
tumor response to the oncolytic virus.
[033]       Certain embodiments are directed to methods of treating cancer in a patient
comprising administering (i) a replication competent oncolytic virus (e.g. adenovirus), and (ii) an
agent that upregulates or activates the cellular immune system. The agent can be administered
prior to, during or subsequent to administration of the virus. The upregulation or activation of
the cellular immune system can be accomplished by either stimulating the cellular immune
system or suppressing the inhibition of the cellular immune system. The methods can be used
for the treatment of primary tumors or tumors formed from metastasis. In certain aspects, the
virus further comprises a targeting moiety. In further aspects, the replication competent virus is
an adenovirus such as delta-24. In still a further aspect, the delta-24 adenovirus comprises a
targeting moiety. In certain aspects the targeting moiety is an RGD containing peptide. In
certain aspects, the RGD or other naturally occurring cell surface binding peptide confers an
immune privilege to the oncolytic virus enabling the virus to remain therapeutic during times of
elevated immune system activity.
[034]       In one preferred embodiment, a method for treating cancer in a patient is provided
comprising: (a) administering to the patient a cytokine (e.g. e.g. recombinant IL-12p70 or
recombinant IFN-y) or one or more agents (e.g. Revlimid or lenalidomide) to increase the
production of Th1 cytokines such as IL-12p70 or IFN-y (b) administering to the patient an
oncolytic virus (e.g. Delta-24-RGD) and optionally (c) administering to the patient an agent to
suppress regulatory T cells (e.g. temozolomide, cyclophosphamide, CCNU, BCNU, melphalan,
busulfan) and/or stimulate a cell mediated immune response (e.g. Ipilimumab, Tremelimumab,
MDX-1106, MK-3475, AMP-224, Pidilizumab, MDX-1105). Preferably the oncolytic virus is
administered by intratumoral injection into one or multiple areas of the tumor. The patient may

have been previously determined by methods of the invention to be likely to respond to oncolytic
virus therapy or alternatively may have been previously determined to be unlikely to respond to
oncolytic virus therapy.     Preferably, the cytokine or agent to increase production of Th1
cytokines is administered prior to the oncolytic virus and the agent to suppress regulatory T cells
and/or stimulate a cellular immune repsonse is administered during or subsequent to oncolytic
virus therapy. In a related embodiment, step (a) further or alternatively comprises administering
one or more agents to suppress the production of Th2 cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-4.
[035]       In certain aspects the agent that produces a Th1 phenotype is administered to the
patient 1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 hours, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more days, 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months, including all values and
ranges there between, prior to or after administration of the oncolytic virus. In a preferred
embodiment, the agent that that produces a Th1 phenotype is administered prior to
administration of the oncolytic virus and optionally is continued after administration of the virus.
In one embodiment, the agent that that produces a Th1 phenotype is administered to the patient
between 1 and 14 days prior to or after administration of the oncolytic virus.          In another
embodiment, the agent is administered between 1 and 4 weeks prior to or after administration of
the oncolytic virus. In other embodiments, the agent is simultaneously co-administered to the
patient with the oncolytic virus.
[036]       In certain aspects, an assessment of cellular immune function will be carried out prior
to, during, or after administration of the oncolytic virus or the immune activation agent e.g. by
measuring the level of one or more Th1 and/or Th2 biomarkers as described herein and/or
antibodies to one or more tumor related antigens in the blood.         Alternatively, immune cell
infiltrates such as antigen presenting cells (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells, astrocytes and
microglia), cytotoxic T cells, or natural killer cells can be detected in biopsy samples from a
tumor.
[037]       In one aspect, a concentration of tumor infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes is
assessed, wherein a patient with a high CD4+/CD8+ ratio compared to a control (indicating a Th2
profile) is simultaneously, separately or consecutively co-administered a replication competent
                                                 16

oncolytic virus and an agent that upregulates or activates the cellular immune system. In another
aspect, the relative number of Thl/Th2 CD4+ cells in a test sample (e.g. biopsy or peripheral
blood mononuclear cells) from the subject is determined by measuring co-expression of CD4 and
one more Th1 cytokines (e.g. IL-12p70 or IFN-y) and Th2 etyokines (e.g. IL-4) and determining
the relative number of ThI/Th2 CD4+ cells.         Preferably, the cells are stimulated (e.g. with
Phorbol ester plus Ionomycin), fixed, permeabilized, stained with appropriate antibodies and
subjected to flow cytometric analysis.       In one embodiment, one or more cytokine levels
indicative of a Th1 profile can be measured in the blood. serum or other fluids. In one aspect, a
patient with a low level of Th1 cytokines compared to an appropriate control or a high level of
Th2 cytokines compared to an appropriate control is co-administered a replication competent
oncolytic virus, and an agent that upregulates or activates the cellular immune system.
[038]       In a related embodiment, one or more Th1 cytokines selected from the group
consisting of ILI P, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, IFN-y, TNF-oc, TNF-$ and GM-CSF are measured.
Other Th1 biomarkers such as cleaved caspase-3, neopterin and P2 microglobulin may also be
measured as part of a Th1 profile. In another related embodiment, one or more Th2 cytokines
selected from the group consisting of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL- 10 and IL- 13 and TGF-P are measured.
Other Th2 biomarkers such as phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr 705) may also be measured as part of
a Th2 profile. In other aspects, cytokines or other biomarkers indicative of a Th1 and/or Th2
profile are monitored during oncolytic virus (e.g. adenovirus) therapy wherein a patient
exhibiting a shift from a Th1 profile to a Th2 profile during therapy is administered an agent that
upregulates or activates the cellular immune system. Therapy induced necrosis can be detect
and/or measured.
[039]       In certain embodiments the agent that produces a Th1 phenotype (upregulates or
activates the cellular immune system) is an antagonist of a suppressor of cellular immunity
(antagonist of cellular immune-suppression).     Antagonists of cellular immune-suppression are
agents that act on cells or molecules that suppress the cellular immune system. Antagonists of
cellular immune-suppression include cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4; also known as
CD152) antagonists such as Ipilimumab (also known as Yervoy TM , MDX-010 or MDX-101; a

[040]       In certain embodiments, the agent that upregulates the cellular immune system is a
cellular immune system stimulator.       An immuno-stimulator is a small molecule, peptide,
polypeptide (e.g. antibody), or cell that when introduced into a subject results in increases the
activity of cell mediated immune response. Immuno-stimulators include co-stimulatory pathway
agonists, such as CD137 agonists including without limitation BMS-663513           (an a-CD137
humanized monoclonal antibody agonist, Bristol-Myers Squibb); agonists to CD40, such as CP
870,893 (a-CD40 humanized monoclonal antibody, Pfizer); OX40 (CD 134) agonists (e.g. anti
OX40 humanized monoclonal antibodies, AgonOx and those described in US Patent Number

Celldex).
[041]       In certain aspects, an immune-stimulator is an agent that induces or stimulates

[043]       In further aspects patients with cancer can be administered one or more biological
modifiers that produce a Th1 phenotype (activate the cellular immune response) such as
cytokines (preferably recombinant) including without limitation GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-12, IL-18
and interferon-y prior to or during oncolytic virus therapy in order to improve the patient's
response to the virus. IFN-y and IL-12 are known to inhibit production of Th2 cytokines and are
therefore particularly preferred      cytokines for activating the cellular      immune response.
Alternatively, these patients can be administered one or more agents that stimulate production of
IL-12p70 and/or other Th1 cytokines such as lenalidomide (Revlimid), or pomalidomide. In a
related aspect, these patients can alternatively or additionally be administered one or more agents
that decrease T-regulatory cells such as alkylating agents including without limitation
Temozolomide, cyclophosphamide, lomustine (CCNU), bis-chloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU),

 after oncolytic virus therapy. In another related aspect, these patients can be administered one or
more agents which neutralize Th2 cytokines such IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13, particularly
 IL-4 and IL-10 prior to or during oncolytic virus therapy; because these Th2 cytokines suppress
the Th1 pathway, their neutralization should improve the patient's response to the virus.
 [044]        The present inventors have discovered that administration of an alkylating agent such
as temozolomide to a patient with cancer prior to administering an oncolytic virus such as Delta
24-RGD surprisingly increases the likelihood that the patient will respond favorably to the virus.
Without being bound by theory, it is believed that lymphopenia induced in glioma patients
following treatment with alkylating agents such as temozolomide may result in a shift in the
tumor environment from a predominantly Th2 phenotype to a Th1 phenotype, thereby
potentiating the tumor to treatment with an oncolytic virus. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of
the invention, a method for treating cancer in a patient is provided comprising administering to
the patient an alkylating agent and subsequently administering to the patient an oncolytic virus.
Preferably, the patient is a patient with a primary or metastatic brain tumor such as a glioma, the
virus is an adenovirus such as Delta-24 or Delta-24-RGD, and the alkylating agent is selected
from the group consisting of Temozolomide, cyclophosphamide, lomustine (CCNU), bis
chloroethylnitrosourea     (BCNU),     melphalan hydrochloride         and busulfan (butane-1,4-diyl
dimethanesulfonate).       In a particularly preferred embodiment, the alkylating agent is
temozolomide. The alkylating agent can be administered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 hours, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more days, 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks or
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months, including all values and ranges there between, prior to administration of
the oncolytic virus.
[045]         In other embodiments, the oncolytic virus is co-administered with one or more
adjuvants      which promote      a Th1     response    nonlimiting     examples   of which include
monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL@), QS-21 (plant extract comprising soluble triterpene glucoside

[046]       In certain aspects the cancer to be treated according to the present methods is a cancer
of the central nervous system. In related aspect, the cancer is a neuroepithelial tumor such as,
without limitation, an astrocytic tumor (e.g. astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma,
gliosarcoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, giant cell astrocytoma, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma), an
oligodendroglioma, an ependymoma, an oligoastrocytoma, a spongioblastoma, an astroblastoma,
a choroid plexus papiloma, a choroid plexus carcinoma, a gangliocytoma, a ganglioglioma, a
neurocytoma, a neuroepithelial tumor, a neuroblastoma, a pineal region tumor (such as a
pineocytoma, a pineoblastoma, or a mixed pineocytoma/pineobastoma), a medulloepithelioma, a
medulloblastoma,      a neuroblastoma     or   ganglioneuroblastoma,     a  retinoblastoma,   or  an
ependymoblastoma. In another related aspect, the cancer is a central nervous system neoplasm
such as, without limitation, a tumor of the sellar region (such as a pituitary adenoma, a pituitary
carcinoma, or a craniopharyngioma), a hematopoietic tumor (such as a primary malignant
lymphoma, a plasmacytoma, or a granulocytic sarcoma), a germ cell tumor (such as a
germinoma, an embryonal carcinoma, a yolk sac tumor, a choriocarcinoma, a teratoma or a
mixed germ cell tumor), a meningioma, a mesenchymal tumor, melanocytoma, or a tumor of
cranial or spinal nerves (such as a schwannoma, or a neurofibroma). In a particular aspect, the
cancer is a low-grade glioma (e.g. ependymoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma or mixed
glioma) or high-grade (malignant) glioma (e.g. glioblastoma multiforme). In another aspect, the
cancer is a primary or metastatic brain tumor.        In other aspects, the cancer is a primary or
metastatic brain tumor comprising brain tumor cell stem cells. In a preferred embodiment, the
cancer is a malignant glioma comprising brain tumor cell stem cells.
[047]       In other aspects, cancers to be treated according to the present methods include
without limitation, lung, ovary, breast, cervix, pancreas, stomach, colon, skin, larynx, bladder,
and prostate cancer. Preferably the cancer to be treated exhibits a disrupted Rb pathway. In yet
other aspects, the oncolytic virus is administered to treat a hyperproliferative disorder such as
metaplasias, dysplasias or hyperplasia.

[048]        In certain aspects, the oncolytic virus is an adenovirus such as Delta-24-RGD.
Oncolytic adenoviruses such as Delta-24-RGD have the ability to replicate in a variety of cell
lines including lung, breast, prostate, sarcomas and glioma stem-like cells. Thus, e.g. oncolytic
adenoviruses such as Delta-24-RGD may be administered to a patient having any cancer
permissive to replication of the virus in order to treat the cancer.

[049]        FIG. 1. Antibodies vs. Survival (Humoral vs Cellular skew). A graph depicting the
correlation between antibodies against tumor associated antigens and survival in patients with
gliomas treated with oncolytic adenovirus (Delta-24-RGD). Briefly, serum from a subset of 20
glioma patients was assessed prior to Delta-24-RGD therapy for antibodies against 31 tumor
associated antigens including BRAF, CABYR, CRISP3, CSAG2, CTAG2, DHFR, FTHL17,
GAGE1,      LDHC, MAGEA1,        MAGEA3,       MAGEA4, MAGEB6, MAPK1, MICA, MUCI,
NLRP4, NYES01, P53, PBK, PRAME, SOX2, SPANXA1,                       SSX2, SSX4, SSX5, TSGA1O,
TSSK6, TULP2, XAGE2, and ZNF165 by automated protein microarray using a modified solid
phase ELISA (Serametrix).       Over 40% of patients with fewer than 15 positive antibodies
survived more than 20 months after treatment whereas every patient with more than 15 positive
antibodies did not survive past 11 months. Moreover, those patients with fewer than 15 positive
antibodies who did not survive more than 20 months experienced an improved clinical outcome
relative to those having more than 15 positive antibodies.
[050]        FIG 2. Immunity to antigen NLRP4 vs. survival.          A graph depicting immunity to
tumor associated antigen NLRP4 as a function of survival in glioma patients treated with Delta
24-RGD.       Antibodies against NLRP4 were assessed in sera from glioma patients prior to
administering the virus and at several time points thereafter generally in monthly intervals.
Patients K, 0, I, E, L, N,    Q,  A, D and J, surviving between 1 month and 11 months post
treatment, experienced a relatively high level of antibodies against NLRP4 whereas patients P, C,
H, B, M and G, surviving from more than 12 months to more than 19 months post treatment,
experienced very low to undetectable levels of antibodies against NLRP4. Patient G exhibited a
complete response to the therapy.

[051]        FIG. 3.    Correlation of anti-tumor associated antigen antibodies with tumor
recurrence.    The upper panel is a graph depicting the correlation of antibodies against tumor
antigens with tumor recurrence in a glioma patient (Patient F). Antibodies against an array of
tumor associated antigens (those described in FIG. 1) were measured in a serum sample from the
patient at the end of Delta-24-RGD therapy and at 15 days, 1 month, 4 months and 6 months post
therapy. No antibodies were detected at the 15 day or 1 month period. However, between the
four month and six month period the number of positive antibodies jumped from two to twenty
and coincided with recurrence of the tumor. The lower panel depicts a scan of Patient F at the
end of Delta-24-RGD therapy (left) and at 6 months after therapy (right). The recurrence of
tumor can be seen in the scan at the 6 month timepoint.
[052]        FIG. 4. Comparison of Patients G and I. A heat map depicting the results of a
peptide array to detect antibodies against a panel of tumor associated antigens (those described in
FIG. 1) in sera from two glioma patients (Patient G, a complete responder (left panel), and
Patient I who progressed (right panel)) treated with Delta-42-RGD taken prior to treatment with
the virus (0 months) and one, four and six months after treatment (Patient G) and one, three and
four months after treatment (Patient I).     The results depicted in the heat map are raw data
obtained from absorbance analysis (i.e. not background subtracted). An average background of
 ~0.2 was observed and accordingly a cutoff that could be applied universally to all antigens for
positive versus negative results was 3 x background = 0.6. Patient G survived is presently still
alive over 30 months after treatment with the virus. Patient I deceased 6 months after therapy.
Patient G had a score of 0 at each time point, (negative for antibodies in the serum against all of
the 31 tumor associated antigens tested). Patient I on the other hand had a score of 10 prior to
treatment with the virus (positive for antibodies against CABYR, MAGEAl, MAGEA3,
MAGEB6, NLRP4, NYESO1, PBK, SSX2, SSX5 and ZNF165) and this number increased to 18
at the one month time point, 22 at the three month time point and 31 (i.e. antibodies against all
tumor associated antigens tested) at the four month time point. This clearly demonstrates the
usefulness of these tumor antigens as biomarkers for predicting the likelihood of response to
oncolytic virus therapy such as Delta-42-RGD.

 [053]       FIG. 5. A graph depicting the results of the peptide analysis described in FIG. 4. The
upper panel illustrates the results of serum analysis from Patient G, a complete responder. The
lower panel illustrates the results of serum analysis from Patient I who did not respond. Serum
samples were obtained and analyzed for antibodies reactive against the specified tumor
associated antigens pre-treatment (both patients) with the virus and one month, four months and
six months after treatment with the virus (Patient G) and one month, three months and four
months after treatment with the virus (Patient I). Antibody levels are on the "y" axis; antigens
are on the "x" axis. Patient G was negative for all 31 antibodies both prior to and after treatment
with the virus. Patient H was positive for 10 antibodies prior to treatment with the virus and was
positive for all 31 antibodies at the four month time point.
[054]       FIG. 6.   Brain scans from a glioma patient (Patient 30A) who exhibited very high
levels of IL-12p70 prior to treatment with Delta-42-RGD are depicted.          The upper left scan
demonstrates     the glioma in the patient prior to administering           Delta-42-RGD    therapy
(11/18/2011).    The upper middle scan demonstrates a positive response in the tumor eight days
after therapy (10/26/2011) and eleven days after therapy (10/29/2011).        The bottom left scan
demonstrates the response nearly two months after therapy (1/7/2012) and nearly three months
after therapy (2/8/2012).
[055]       FIG 7. Measurement of IL-12p70 (in picograms/ml) in patient sera samples. Figure
7 is a graph (on a logarithmic scale) depicting IL-12p70 (picograms/ml) in sera of glioma
patients treated with Delta-24-RGD prior to therapy (pre-op) and one month, two months and
three months post treatment.       Patients 12A, 30A and 33A had very high IL-12p70 levels at
baseline (prior to treatment with the virus) and these levels increased after treatment with the
virus.   Patients 12A and 30A and 33A showed a complete response to the virus and this
correlated with IL-12p70 levels both prior to and after treatment (IL-12p70 levels were over 100
fold and over 1000-fold higher in these patients relative to non-responders). On the other hand,
the remaining patients depicted on the graph exhibited low levels of IL-12p70 prior to and after
administration of the virus and did not respond to the virus. Patient 37A (not shown on the
graph) had low baseline IL-12p70 levels and was given IFN-y approximately 2 months after
                                                 24

       WO 2013/112942                                                       PCT/US2013/023304
treatment with the virus to stimulate a Th1 immune response and increase IL-12p70 levels.
Administration of IFN-y to Patient 37A caused a significant increase in IL-12p70 levels
(indicating a switch to a Th1 immune response) and corresponded with a complete response to
the virus. Thus, IL-12p70 levels (e.g. pretreatment) correlate very well with treatment outcome,
with responders having high levels of IL-12 both prior to and during therapy. Conversely, non
responders had low levels of IL-12 prior to and during therapy. Strikingly, administration of the
Th1 stimulating agent IFN-y to a patient exhibiting low IL-12p70 levels boosted IL-12p70 levels
in the patient and a complete response to the virus was observed in the patient.
                                         DESCRIPTION
 [056]      Definitions
 [057]      As used herein, the term "antigen" is a molecule capable of being bound by an
antibody or T-cell receptor. An antigen is additionally capable of inducing a humoral immune
response and/or cellular immune response leading to the production of B- and/or T
lymphocytes. The structural aspect of an antigen, e.g., three dimensional conformation or
modification (e.g., phosphorylation) that gives rise to a biological response is referred to herein
as an "antigenic determinant" or "epitope." B-lymphocytes respond to foreign antigenic
determinants via antibody production, whereas T-lymphocytes are the mediator of cellular
immunity. Thus, antigenic determinants or epitopes are those parts of an antigen that are
recognized by antibodies, or in the context of an MHC, by T-cell receptors. An antigenic
determinant need not be a contiguous sequence or segment of protein and may include various
sequences that are not immediately adjacent to one another. In certain aspects, Tau oligomers are
utilized as antigens.
[058]       The term "antibody" or "immunoglobulin" is used to include intact antibodies and
binding fragments/segments thereof. Typically, fragments compete with the intact antibody
from which they were derived for specific binding to an antigen. Fragments include separate
heavy chains, light chains Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fabc, and Fv. Fragments/segments are produced by
recombinant     DNA     techniques,  or   by   enzymatic    or  chemical    separation   of intact
                                                 25

        WO 2013/112942                                                        PCT/US2013/023304
 immunoglobulins. The term "antibody" also includes one or more immunoglobulin chains that
 are chemically conjugated to, or expressed as, fusion proteins with other proteins. The term
 "antibody" also includes a bispecific antibody. A bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an
 artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding
 sites.   Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of
hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai & Lachmann (1990); Kostelny et
 al. (1992).
 [059]        In one aspect, the term "control" or "predetermined control" as used herein refers to a
baseline level of a Th1 and/or Th2 biomarker and/or antibody against a tumor associated antigen
as determined from one, or preferably an average obtained from more than one, "normal" or
"healthy" subjects believed not to or confirmed by diagnosis not to have a cancer. Once a level
has become established for a standard population, results from test samples can be directly
compared with the predetermined control. For example, a baseline may be obtained from at least
one subject and preferably is obtained from an average of subjects, wherein the subject or
subjects have no prior history of cancer. By way of example, a level of a Th1 biomarker such as
IL-12p70 in a serum sample from a patient may be compared to the serum level of the same ThI
biomarker in an undiseased subject or an average serum level of more than one undiseased
subjects.
[060]        In another aspect, the term "control" or "predetermined control" refers to a baseline
level of a Th1 and/or Th2 biomarker and/or antibody against a tumor associated antigen as
determined from an average value in subjects having the same type of cancer as the patient to be
treated. By way of example, a level of a Th1 biomarker such as IL12p70 in a serum sample from
a patient may be compared to an average serum level obtained from multiple subjects with the
same type of cancer as the patient to be treated. Glioma patients generally exhibit IL-12p70
serum levels in the range of 10-20 picograms/ml.
[061]        In a related aspect, the term "control" or "predetermined control" refers to a level of a
Th1 and/or Th2 biomarker and/or antibody against a tumor associated antigen in one subject, or
preferably an average level of more than one subject, having the same type of cancer as the
                                                   26

      WO 2013/112942                                                          PCT/US2013/023304
patient to be treated who have been administered the same oncolytic virus and shown to have not
responded to the virus. For example, a level of a Th1 cytokine such as IL-12p70 in a serum
sample from the patient is compared to an average serum level obtained from more than subject
with the same type of cancer who did not respond to the virus, whereby a high level of the Th1
cytokine compared to the average level from non-responders indicates that the patient is likely to
respond favorably to the virus.
[062]       In another related aspect, the term "control" or "predetermined control" refers to a
level of biomarker in one subject, or preferably an average level of more than one subject, having
the same type of cancer as the patient to be treated who have been administered the same
oncolytic virus and shown to have responded well to the virus. For example, a level of a Th1
cytokine such as IL-12p70 in a serum sample from the patient is compared to an average serum
level obtained from more than subject with the same type of cancer who responded well to the
virus, whereby a low level of the Th1 cytokine compared to the average level from good
responders indicates that the patient is unlikely to respond favorably to the virus.
[063]       For purposes of comparison, the level of Th1 and/or Th2 biomarker and/or antibody
against a tumor associated antigen in a test sample to be measured is of the same type (obtained
from the same biological source) and is processed in the same way as what is used for
determination of the baseline control level. For example, if a level of IL-12p70 is determined in
by measuring the level of IL-12p70 in serum, the baseline level of IL-12p70 is determined by
measuring the level of IL-12p70 in serum from e.g. normal healthy subjects. As used herein, a
"high" level or an "increase" in the measured level of a Th1 biomarker relative to a
predetermined control means that the amount or concentration of Th1 biomarker in a test sample
is sufficiently greater in the test sample relative to the predetermined control level of Thl
biomarker. For example, an increase in the level of a Th1 biomarker relative to a predetermined
control may be any statistically significant increase which is detectable such as without
limitation, about a 1%, about a 5%, about a 10%, about a 15%, about a 20%, about a 30%, about
a 40%, about a 60%, about an 80%, about a 2-fold, about a 3-fold, about a 5-fold, about an 8
fold, about a 10-fold, about a 20-fold 50-fold, 100-fold, 200-fold, 500-fold or even 1000-fold
                                                  27

       WO 2013/112942                                                       PCT/US2013/023304
 elevation or more relative to the predetermined control. In another aspect, a "high level" of
 biomarker in a test sample compared to control may refer to a detection level of an antibody
 above a predetermined threshold wherein the control level is below the predetermined threshold.
 [064]       The term "correlate" or "correlation" or equivalents thereof refer to an association
 between expression of one or more genes or proteins and a treatment outcome of a cancer cell
 and/or cancer patient in comparison to the lack of response. The invention provides for the
 correlation between increases in expression of one or more of the herein disclosed biomarkers
 and responsiveness of a cancer patient to oncolytic virus therapy.
 [065]       The term "glioma" refers to a tumor originating in the neuroglia of the brain or spinal
 cord. Gliomas are derived from the glial cell types such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, thus
 gliomas include astrocytomas       and oligodendrogliomas,      as well as anaplastic gliomas,
 glioblastomas, and ependymomas. Astrocytomas and ependymomas can occur in all areas of the
brain and spinal cord in both children and adults. Oligodendrogliomas typically occur in the
cerebral hemispheres of adults. Other brain tumors are meningiomas, ependymomas, pineal
region tumors, choroid plexus tumors, neuroepithelial tumors, embryonal tumors, peripheral
neuroblastic tumors, tumors of cranial nerves, tumors of the hemopoietic system, germ cell
tumors, and tumors of the stellar region.
 [066]      The term "IL-12p70" or "IL-12" refers to the biologically active form of IL-12, a 70
kDa (p70) cytokine produced mainly be monocytes, macrophages, B-lymphocytes and dendritic
cells. IL-12 is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, one 40 kDa (p40) and the other 35 kDa
(p35) linked together by disulfide bonds.
[067]       As used herein the term "normal" in the context of a diagnosis or prognosis refers to
an individual or group of individuals who have not shown any symptoms of cancer and are not
known to suffer from the disorder. Preferably, the normal individual(s) is not on medication for
treating cancer and if possible has not been diagnosed with cancer or any other hyperproliferative
disorder.   "Normal" according to the invention also refers to samples isolated from normal
individuals.

      WO 2013/112942                                                          PCT/US2013/023304
[068]       The term "oncolytic virus" refers generally to any virus capable of replicating in and
killing tumor cells. Preferably, the virus is engineered e.g. to increase tumor cell selectivity.
Representative examples of oncolytic virus include without limitation, adenovirus, reovirus,
herpes simplex virus (HSV), Newcastle disease virus, poxvirus, myxoma virus, rhabdovirus,
picornavirus, influenza virus, coxsackievirus and parvovirus.      In preferred embodiments, the
oncolytic virus is a vaccinia virus (e.g. Copenhagen, Western Reserve, Wyeth strain),
rhabdovirus (e.g. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)), or adenovirus (e.g. ONYX-015, Delta-24
RGD). In a particularly preferred embodiment, the oncolytic virus is an adenovirus. A preferred
adenovirus is Delta-24-RGD. Delta-24-RGD is a tumor-selective adenovirus serotype 5 strain
comprising a 24 base-pair deletion of the ElA region that encompasses the area responsible for
binding Rb protein (nucleotides 923-946) corresponding to an eight amino-acids 120-127 in the
encoded ElA protein (Fueyo J et al., Oncogene, 19:2-12 (2000)).               Delta-24-RGD further
comprises an insertion of the RGD-4C sequence (which binds strongly to avp3 and avp5
integrins) into the H1 loop of the fiber knob protein (Pasqualini R. et al., Nat Biotechnol, 15:542
546 (1997)).    The ElA deletion increases the selectivity of the virus for cancer cells; the RGD
4C sequence increases the infectivity of the virus in gliomas.
[069]       The term "providing" is used according to its ordinary meaning to indicate "to supply
or furnish for use." In some embodiments, a protein is provided directly by administering the
protein, while in other embodiments, the protein is effectively provided by administering a
nucleic acid that encodes the protein.
[070]       The term "respond" generally means that a patient exhibits a complete or partial
response to the oncolytic therapy as defined in the Reesponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) criteria (Eisenhauer et al., European Journal of Cancer, 45:228-247 (2009),
incorporated herein by reference).     A complete response means a disappearance of all target
lesions. A partial response means at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter
(LD) of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum LD.          In particular, a response
generally refers to a complete or partial change in tumor size. Similarly, patients who fail to
respond to oncolytic therapy are those that exhibit stable disease (neither sufficient shrinkage to
                                                 29

      WO 2013/112942                                                        PCT/US2013/023304
qualify as a partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify as progressive disease) or
progressive disease (at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as
reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started). The skilled clinician/radiologist will
understand the appropriate methods for determining tumor measurements using e.g. computed
tomography (CT) or magentic resonance imaging (MRI), in conjunction with clinical
assessment.
[071]       The term "therapeutic benefit" or "treatment" refers to anything that promotes or
enhances the well-being of the subject with respect to the medical treatment of his/her condition,
which includes treatment of pre-cancer, cancer, and hyperproliferative diseases. A list of
nonexhaustive examples of this includes extension of the subject's life by any period of time,
decrease or delay in the neoplastic development of the disease, decrease in hyperproliferation,
reduction in tumor growth, delay of metastases, reduction in cancer cell or tumor cell
proliferation rate, and a decrease in pain to the subject that can be attributed to the subject's
condition. It is not necessary that the cancer be cured to accomplish a meaningful treatment, all
that is required is that the cancer be slowed to some degree or some condition associated with the
cancer is ameliorated.

[077]       Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent
from the following detailed description. It should be understood, however, that the detailed
description and the specific examples, while indicating specific embodiments of the invention,
are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit
and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed
description.
[078]       A common feature to both primary and metastatic tumors to the brain is a lack of
immunosurveillance with these tumors. The normal antigen presenting cells within the brain,
known as microglia, are frequently found to be "turned off' and therefore have a functional lack
of antigen presentation activities to the immune system. This lack of immunosurveillance is
thought to be one reason why these tumors are so difficult to treat.
[079]       Data from a phase-1 clinical trial for treating malignant glioma with an oncolytic
adenovirus (Delta-24-RGD) that replicates within primary gliomas showed unexpectedly that an
immune response was raised not only to adenoviral antigens but also cancer related antigens.
Briefly, it has been discovered that these tumor associated antigens are released (or exposed)
after the infection of Delta-24 in glioma cell lines.       In addition, this phase-1 clinical study
unexpectedly showed massive recruitment of a large population of cytotoxic T-cell infiltrates
                                                  31

      WO 2013/112942                                                          PCT/US2013/023304
with large regions of treatment related necrosis. This finding suggests a process of not only
active oncolysis with the Delta-24-RGD agent but also cell mediated cytotoxicity to the tumor
cells. Without being bound by theory it is believed that, in patients for whom treatment with
virus is successful, an initial immune response to the oncolytic virus is generated followed by a
shift in immunity towards cancer related antigens.
[080]       The present inventors have discovered that a predominant expression of Th1
(inflammatory) cytokines correlates well with a positive outcome in patients undergoing
oncolytic virus therapy; accordingly the extent of Th1 polarization in these patients can be used
to predict the outcome of oncolytic virus therapy in patients with cancers such as gliomas.
Without being bound by theory, it is proposed that patients having a predominantly Th1 cytokine
profile are primed to mount a cell-mediated antitumor immnunoresponse to oncolytic viruses. In
particular, the present inventors have surprisingly discovered that glioma patients with
measurable responses to the oncolytic adenovirus Delta-24-RGD in a positive clinical outcome
have high levels of Th1 cytokines IL-12p7O, IL-2 and IFN- y whereas responses of Th2 humoral
antibodies predicts that these patients will not respond to the virus. In the Phase I clinical study,
patients that had a complete response or a high level of response had high levels of Th1 cytokine
interleukin-12p7O pre-operatively (serum levels were highly elevated compared to the rest of the
population within the phase I trial) and this level increased after injection of the virus. The three
patients who had a complete response to the virus also had serum levels of IL- l2p70, which were
highly elevated compared to the rest of the population within this phase I trial. The use of Thl
biomarkers for predicting the response of a patient with cancer to oncolytic virus therapy is
provided.
[081]       One patient in the clinical trial that exhibited low baseline levels of IL-12p70 (i.e.
prior to treatment with Delta-24-RGD) was administered IFN-y two months after the virus was
administered. IFN-g stimulated a Th1 immune response in the patient (indicated by an increase
in IL-12 production) and corresponded with a very good response to the virus. Thus., methods
for treating cancer comprising administration of agents which stimulate or boost the Th1

       WO 2013/112942                                                        PCT/US2013/023304
response and/or suppress regulatory T cells in combination with an oncolytic virus to cancer
patients are also provided.
[082]        Malignant gliomas constitute the majority of primary cerebral malignant neoplasms.
These deadly tumors invariably recur after conventional therapy and the median survival time of
patients with glioblastoma (GBM) the most common form of malignant high-grade gliomas is 14
months.     In addition to the difficulties to drug delivery imposed by the blood-brain-barrier,
conventional chemotherapy and small-molecule approaches have been unable to significantly
improve the prognosis of these patients. Oncolytic viruses such as Delta-24-RGD have emerged
as a promising alternative to conventional therapies for the treatment of these tumors. However,
it is currently not possible to predict whether a patient will respond favorably to such treatment.
Although emerging evidence suggests immune response during virotherapy is involved in anti
tumor activity, the role that pre-existing immune conditions play during oncolytic virus treatment
and its influence in clinical outcome is currently unknown.            The present inventors have
discovered that treatment with oncolytic viruses such as Delta-24-RGD induces autophagic cell
death leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress with antigen processing and epitope presentation
in glioma-infected cells. The present inventors have also surprisingly discovered that patients
who are good responders to oncolytic virus therapy exhibit a skew to the T-cell effector response
rather than a humoral skewed response. Patients who are good responders to oncolytic virus
therapy exhibit a specific Th1 biomarker profile. These biomarkers are of value in the prognosis
and treatment of brain and other cancers including determining the optimum group of patients
with cancers such as malignant gliomas that are likely to have positive clinical outcomes when
treated with oncolytic viruses and thus significantly increase their survival and determining
whether a patient is a good candidate for an additional treatment modality. It is expected that the
present biomarker profiles are of relevance to the vast majority of solid tumors for which there is
currently a dramatic paucity of biomarkers.
[083]        Biomarkers that may be measured or detected include, without limitation, proteins
(e.g. cytokines, antibodies), cells (e.g. lymphocytes), nucleic acid, and metabolites. Proteins that
can be used as biomarkers of the likelihood for response to an oncolytic virus therapy include,

tumor associated antigens as described herein and the expression level of one or more Th1
biomarkers and optionally the expression level of one or more Th2 biomarkers may be measured
in a test sample according to the methods described herein.
[089]       Cells that can be measured or detected include CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, regulatory T
cells, microglia and the like.
[090]       CD4 T cells express the CD4 protein on their surface. Upon presentation of antigens
by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, naive CD4 T cells mainly
differentiate into Thl, Th2 or Thl7 (regulatory T cells) cells, each type secreting a different set
of cytokines to facilitate a different type of immune response. For example, Th1 cells secrete IL
2, IFN-y and TNF-p; Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13; and Thl7 cells secrete
IL-170a.
[091]       CD8 T cells (cytotoxic T cells or CTLs) express the CD8 glycoprotein at their surface
and upon presentation of antigen associated with MHC class I molecules, destroy virally infected
cells and tumor cells.
[092]       Regulatory T cells (also known as suppressor T cells or Thl7 cells) are
CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ and act to shut down T cell mediated-immunity toward the end of an
immune reaction and suppress auto-reactive T cells that escape negative selection in the thymus.
[093]       Natural killer T (NKT) cells bridge the adaptive immune system with the innate
immune system. Unlike conventional T cells that recognize peptide antigens presented by MHC
molecules, NKT cells recognize glyclolipid antigen presented by a molecule called CDld. Once
activated, these cells can produce cytokines and release cytolytic/cell killing molecules. They
are also able to recognize and eliminate some tumor cells and cells infected with viruses.
[094]       Microglia are glial cells that are the resident macrophages of the brain and spinal
cord, and the primary mediator of active immune defense in the central nervous system (CNS).

      WO 2013/112942                                                          PCT/US2013/023304
constantly scavenging the CNS for infective agents. The brain and spinal cord are considered
"immune privileged" organs in that they are separated from the rest of the body by a series of
endothelial cells known as the blood-brain barrier, which prevents most infections from reaching
the vulnerable nervous tissue. In the case where the infectious agents are directed introduced to
the brain or cross the blood-brain barrier, microglial cells must react quickly to decrease
inflammation and destroy the infectious agents before they damage the sensitive neural tissue.
Due to the unavailability of antibodies from the rest of the body (few antibodies are small
enough to cross the blood brain barrier), microglia must be able to recognize foreign bodies,
swallow them, and act as antigen-presenting cells activating T cells.
[095]       Isolation of Samples
[096]       Samples (test samples) can be obtained from a patient prior to, concurrently with, or
subsequent to treatment with an oncolytic virus from, without limitation, tissue (e.g. tumor
biopsy), cerebrospinal fluid, blood, plasma, serum, lymph, and synovial fluid.              Standard
procedures that are known in the art for obtaining such samples are used.            In a preferred
embodiment, the sample is a serum sample and the level of one or more biomarkers described
herein is determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
[097]       Procedures used to biopsy a tumor include, but are not limited to, stereotactic biopsy,
which can be done by precise introduction of a metal probe into the brain tumor, cutting a small
piece of the brain tumor, and removing it so that it can be examined. For example, the patient is
transported to the MRI or CAT scan suite, and a frame is attached to the scalp under local
anesthesia. The "pins" of the frame attach to the skull for rigid fixation (frame will not and can
not move from that point forward until completion of the biopsy). The scan (MRI or CT) is
obtained. The neurosurgeon examines the scan and determines the safest trajectory or path to the
target.   This means avoiding critical structures.     The spatial co-ordinates of the target are
determined, and the optimal path is elected. The biopsy is carried out under general anesthesia.
A small incision is created over the entry point, and a small hole is drilled through the skull. The
"dura" is perforated, and the biopsy probe is introduced slowly to the target.           The biopsy
specimen is withdrawn and placed in fluids or preservative to assess biomarkers.
                                                 38

       WO 2013/112942                                                         PCT/US2013/023304
 [098]      Once samples are obtained, the immune status of a subject is determined by
measuring or detecting or analyzing various biomarkers to produce data for the determination of
the subject's immune status (e.g. the degree of Th1 polarization) in order to determine e.g. the
susceptibility of a patient to oncolytic virus therapy, or the need for co-administration of an agent
that stimulates a Th1 immune response with the oncolytic virus therapy.
[099]       In certain embodiments, the interaction or response of the tumor to the therapy is
related to the immunologic status of the tumor or surrounding tissue, the pre-existence of anti
virus antibodies and/or the presence and degree of lymphopenia prior to treatment.               It is
envisaged that a patient having an immunologic status that suggests immunosuppression may
indicate that a tumor will be resistant to oncolytic virus therapy.
[0100]      Assessement of biomarkers
[0101]      Assessment of expression levels of the markers discussed above may be direct, as in
the use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) (including semi-quantitative or quantitative IHC) or
other antibody-based assays (Western blot, fluorescent immunoassay (FIA), fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH), radioimmunoassay (RIA), radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP), enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoassay, immunoradiometric assay, fluoroimmunoassay,
chemiluminescent assay, bioluminescent assay, gel electrophoresis), or indirectly by quantitating
the transcripts for these genes (e.g. by in situ hybridization, nuclease protection, Northern blot,
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) including reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)).             Cells, for
example, lymphocytes, can be analyzed using FACs technology or paraffin embedded tumor
sections using antibodies. Relevant methodologies are discussed below.
[0102]      Antibodies can be used in the present invention to characterize the protein content of
target cells through techniques such as immunohistochemistry, ELISAs and Western blotting.
This may provide a screen e.g. for the presence or absence of a subject likely to respond
favorably to oncolytic virus therapy and/or a need for co-administering an immune stimulating
agent with an oncolytic virus.
                                                   39

       WO 2013/112942                                                         PCT/US2013/023304
 [0103]      Immunohistochemistry is typically performed on a sample of tissue from a biopsy.
 The sample can be examined fresh or frozen. The tissue sample is sliced extremely thin, so that
 it is approximately one cell thick, then the sample is fixed onto a glass slide. The cells in the
 sample have characteristic antigens on their cell surfaces that can be used to help identify the
 specific type of cell. Antibodies against these characteristic antigens are added to the sample on
the slide and the antibodies bind wherever the antigens are present. Excess antibody is then
washed away. The antibodies that remain bound to the cell have labels that either fluoresce or
undergo a chemical reaction that makes them visible by microscope.
 [0104]      The use of antibodies in an ELISA assay is contemplated if the sample is a tissue
lysate, blood, serum or cerebrospinal fluid. For example, antibodies against the antigen to be
detected are immobilized onto a selected surface, preferably a surface exhibiting a protein
affinity such as the wells of a polystyrene microtiter plate.           After washing to remove
incompletely adsorbed material, it is desirable to bind or coat the assay plate wells with a non
specific protein that is known to be antigenically neutral with regard to the test antisera such as
bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein or solutions of powdered milk. This allows for blocking of
nonspecific adsorption sites on the immobilizing surface and thus reduced the background
caused by non-specific binding of antigen to the surface.
[0105]       After binding of antibody to the well, coating with a non-reactive material to reduce
background, and washing to remove unbound material, the immobilizing surface is contacted
with the sample to be tested in conditions conducive to immune complex (antigen/antibody)
formation.
[0106]       Following formation of specific immunocomplexes between the test sample and the
bound antibody, and subsequent washing, the occurrence and even amount of immunocomplex
formation may be determined by subjecting the same to a second antibody having specificity for
an antigen that differs from that recognized by the first antibody.         Appropriate conditions
preferably include diluting the sample with diluents such as BSA, bovine gamma globulin
(BGG) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/Tween. These added agents also tend to assist in
reduction of nonspecific background. The layered antisera is then allowed to incubate for from
                                                 40

      WO 2013/112942                                                        PCT/US2013/023304
about 2 to about 4 hours, at temperatures preferably on the order of about 250 to 27' C.
Following incubation, the antisera-contacted        surface is washed so as to remove non
immunocomplexed material. A preferred washing procedure includes washing with a solution
such as PBS/Tween, or borate buffer.
[0107]      To provide a detecting means, the second antibody will preferably have an associated
enzyme, or detectable moiety, that can be detected, e.g., will generate a color development upon
incubating with an appropriate chromogenic substrate. Thus, for example, one will desire to
contact and incubate the second antibody-bound surface with a urease or peroxidase-conjugated
anti-human IgG for a period of time and under conditions which favor the development of
immunocomplex formation (e.g. incubation for 2 hours at room temperature in a PBS-containing
solution such as PBS/Tween@).
[0108]      After incubation with a second detectable antibody, and subsequent to washing to
remove unbound material, the amount of label is quantified by incubation with a chromogenic
substrate such as urea and bromocresol purple or 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline)-6
sulfonic acid (ABTS) and H 2 0 2 , in the case of peroxidase as the enzyme label. Quantitation is
then achieved by measuring the degree of color generation, e.g. using a visible spectrum
spectrophotometer.
[0109]      The preceding format may be altered by first binding the sample to the assay plate,
then contacting the sample with a primary antibody, followed by detecting bound primary
antibody using a labeled second antibody with specificity for the primary antibody.
[0110]      Antibodies can also find use in immunoblots or Western blot analysis. The antibodies
may be used as high affinity primary reagents for the identification of proteins immobilized onto
a solid support matrix, such as nitrocellulose, nylon or combinations thereof. In conjunction
with immunoprecipitation, followed by gel electrophoresis, these may be used as a single step
reagent for use in detecting antigens against which secondary reagents used in the detection of
the antigen cause an adverse background. Immunologically-based detection methods for use in
conjunction with Western blotting include enzymatically-, radiolabel-, or fluroescently-tagged
                                                 41

       WO 2013/112942                                                         PCT/US2013/023304
 secondary antibodies against the antigen of interest are considered to be of particular use in this
regard.
 [0111]      Aspects of the methods described herein are related to one or more of (i) stimulating a
 cellular immune response in a subject in combination with administration of an oncolytic virus
 (e.g. adenovirus), (ii) antagonizing immune suppression in combination with administration of an
oncolytic virus (e.g. adenovirus), or (iii) stimulating a cellular immune response in a subject and
 antagonizing immune suppression in a subject combination with administration of an oncolytic
virus (e.g. adenovirus).
         A.     Antagonism of immune suppression
 [0112]      Immunosuppression involves an act that reduces the activation or efficacy of the
immune system. Some portions of the immune system itself have immuno-suppressive effects
on other parts of the immune system, and immunosuppression may occur as an affect of certain
diseases or conditions.        Disease related immunosuppression can occur in, for example,
malnutrition, aging, many types of cancer (such as glioma, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple
myeloma), and certain chronic infections such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
The unwanted effect in disease related immunosuppression is immunodeficiency that results in
increased susceptibility to the growth of hyperproliferative cells.
 [0113]     In certain      aspects, the therapeutic methods        described herein may reduce
immunosuppression in a subject and enhance the oncolytic effect of viral therapies. In certain
aspects, the methods may reduce the immunoregulatory T cell activity in the subject. Reducing
immunoregulatory T cell activity may be achieved by administering an agent (e.g. an alkylating
agent) to the individual that depletes or inactivates immunoregulatory T cells in the individual.
Reducing immunoregulatory T cell activity also may be achieved by using at least one antibody
that binds to the immunoregulatory T cells. Such antibody may be selected from, but not limited
to anti-CD4, anti-CD25, anti-neuropilin, and/or anti-CTLA4. Immunoregulatory T cell activity
may be reduced in the individual before, during, or after administering an oncolytic virus. The
term "depleting or inactivating in vivo immunoregulatory T cells" as used herein refers to a
reduction in the number or functional capability of immunoregulatory T cells that suppress the
                                                  42

      WO 2013/112942                                                        PCT/US2013/023304
host anti-tumor immune response. Antagonism of immune suppression can be effected through a
reduction of immunoregulatory T cells (i.e., depletion) or inactivation of anti-tumor immune
suppression function of the immunoregulatory T cells. The ultimate result of such treatment is to
reduce immunoregulatory T cell activity in the recipient of the treatment.
[0114]      Depleting    or inactivating   immunoregulatory    T cells     may be    achieved by
administering a pharmaceutical agent such as an antibody specific for the CD4 antigen, the alpha
chain subunit of the IL-2 receptor (i.e. CD25), and the like and as described herein. Also, an
antibody to gamma delta immunoregulatory T cells can be used to deplete such cells and
stimulate anti-tumor immunity. Seo et al., J. Immunol. (1999) 163:242-249. Anti-CD40 ligand,
also may be used to deplete or inactivate immunoregulatory T cells.
[0115]      Partial antibody constructs such as CTLA4Ig, a fusion protein of CTLA-4 and Fc of
immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain, can be used to inhibit the essential co-stimulatory signal for
full T cell activation via blocking the interaction between CD28 and B7 molecules. CTLA4Ig
may be administered as a pharmaceutical to render regulatory T cells nonresponsive (i.e.
inactivation). See Park et al. Pharm Res. (2003) 20(8):1239-48. An IL-2 fusion to pseudomonas
exotoxin (OnTac) is yet another agent for depleting or inactivating regulatory T cells.
[0116]      In another approach, agents may be administered that prevent the induction of CD8+
cytolytic T-lymphocyte (CTL) tumor anergy.         Agents that agonize CD137, such as agonistic
antibodies, may be used to restore the tumor cytolytic function of established anergic CTLs upon
reencountering their cognate antigen. See Wilcox et al., Blood (2004) 103:177-184. This
approach can be used to break T-cell tolerance to tumor antigens.
[0117]      Agents that agonize glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR)
ligand on CD4/CD25+ immunoregulatory T cells reverses the suppressive action of these cells.
GITR ligand agonists are described in Tone et al., PNAS (2003) 100:15059-15064; Stephens et
al. 2004 and Shimizu et al. 2002.
                                                 43

      WO 2013/112942                                                       PCT/US2013/023304
[0118]      Antibodies to neurophilin (e.g. Bruder et al. 2004) and antibodies to CTLA-4 (e.g.
Leach et al. 1996) also can be administered in vivo to deplete immunoregulatory T cells or
reduce their activity.
[0119]      Methods of removing, depleting or inactivating immunoregulatory T cells may be
used even if the methods are not limited solely to such cells.      Effort to remove, deplete or
inactivate immunoregulatory T cells may be performed multiple times during a given period of
treatment. Also, different methods may be used together (e.g., ex vivo cell removal and in vivo
depletion or inactivation).   The amount of anti-T cell antibody administered for depletion or
inactivation may be similar to the amount used in the transplantation field. See, e.g., Meiser et
al., Transplantation. (1994) 27; 58(4): 419-23.
[0120]      Immunoregulatory T cells may be removed, depleted or inactivated before, during
and/or after administration of an oncolytic virus.     Immunoregulatory T cells are preferably
removed, depleted or inactivated before administering the oncolytic virus.
        B.      Stimulation of the immune system
[0121]      The terms "enhance the cellular immune system" and "stimulate the cellular immune
system" (and different tenses of these terms) refer to the ability of an agent to stimulate the
generation of antigen-specific cytolytic activity (the activity of immune cells, particularly
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes) and/or NK cell activity, improve the cellular immune response to
antigens (through the activity of at least cytotoxic T-lymphocytes), improve immune protection
(by at least restoring the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and/or NK cells and enhancing
cytokine production), restore immune protection (by at least restoring or stimulating the activity
of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and/or NK cell activity and enhancing cytokine production) or
generate pro-inflammatory (Thl) cytokines.
[0122]      Agents which enhance the cellular immune system (or produce a Th1 phenotype)
include cytokines (preferably recombinant) representative examples of which are GM-CSF, IL-2,
IL-12, IL-18 and interferon-y.      These cytokines can be administered prior to, during, or
subsequent to oncolytic virus therapy in order to improve the patient's response to the virus.
                                                 44

      WO 2013/112942                                                    PCT/US2013/023304
Recombinant cytokines are commercially obtainable and are administered according to their
recommended dosages.        Other agents which produce a Th1 phenotype include agents which
stimulate the production of IL-12p70 and/or other Thi cytokines including without limitation
lenalidomide (Revlimid) and pomalidomide.
[0123]      Other agents which produce a Th1 phenotype include alkylating agents representative
examples     of which     are Temozolomide,     cyclophosphamide,   lomustine   (CCNU),    bis
chloroethylnitrosourea     (BCNU),    melphalan     hydrochloride, busulfan    (butane-1,4-diyl
dimethanesulfonate),     mechlorethamine    (nitrogen    mustard), chlorambucil,    ifosfamide,
streptozocin, dacarbazine (DTIC), thiotepa, altretamine (hexamethylmelamine), cisplatin,
carboplatin, and oxalaplatin. The use of these alkylating agents for treating various types of
cancer is well established and they may be used at their recommended dosages in order produce
a Thi phenotype.
[0124]      Other agents which produce a Thi phenotype include adjuvants,           nonlimiting
examples of which are monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL@), QS-21 (plant extract comprising
soluble triterpene glucoside compounds) or other saponin, oligodeoxynucleotides comprising or
consisting of CpG, and ribosomal protein extract (RPE).
[0125]      Other agents which produce a Thi phenotype include CD137 agonists such as BMS
663513, CD40 agonists, such as CP-870,893, OX40 (CD134) agonists and CD27 agonists such
as CDX-1127.
[0126]      Other agents which produce a Th1 phenotype include inhbitors of JAK-2, JAK-3,
STAT-3, or STAT-5.
[0127]      Other agents which produce a Thi phenotype include CTLA-4 antagonists (e.g.
Ipilimumab or Tremelimumab), PD-i/PD-Li - receptor antagonists (e.g. MDX-1 106, MK-3475,
AMP-224, Pidilizumab, or MDX-1 105); antibodies that specifically bind to B7-H3 such as
MGA271, and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitors such as D-1-methyl-tryptophan
(Lunate).

       WO 2013/112942                                                       PCT/US2013/023304
 [0128]      In a further embodiment, the methods for treating cancer may include adoptive
 transfer of immune cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity. As used herein "adoptive transfer"
 refers to the administration of immune cells, from another individual or from the same
 individual. These are preferably T cells, which may be activated ex vivo to enhance their ability
 to function in supporting an anti-tumor immune response. Adoptively transferred immune cells
 may be activated ex vivo by any of a variety of well known agents including, for example,
 exposure to IL-2 and/or to anti-CD3 antibodies. Ex vivo activation also may include exposure to
 a cancer cell vaccine. Such cancer cell vaccine may constitute live (but non-replicating), or
killed cancer cells from the individual to be treated or from another cancer entirely. The vaccine
 also may be a cancer cell extract or purified vaccine preparation derived from cancer cells.
 Cancer cell vaccines are well known in the art and may be prepared in accordance with well
known methods.
III.     Antibodies
 [0129]     An antagonist of an immune suppressor or a stimulator of the immune system can be
an antibody.    The term "antibody" as used herein includes immunoglobulins, which are the
product of B cells and variants thereof as well as the T cell receptor (TCR), which is the product
of T cells, and variants thereof. An immunoglobulin is a protein comprising one or more
polypeptides substantially encoded by the immunoglobulin kappa and lambda, alpha, gamma,
delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as myriad immunoglobulin variable region
genes. A typical immunoglobulin structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer
is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one "light" (about 25
kD) and one "heavy" chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable
region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition.
The terms variable light chain (VL) and variable heavy chain (VH) refer to these light and heavy
chains respectively.
[0130]      Recombinant antibodies may be conventional full length antibodies, antibody
fragments known from proteolytic digestion, unique antibody fragments such as Fv or single
chain Fv (scFv), domain deleted antibodies, and the like. An Fv antibody is about 50 Kd in size
                                                 46

      WO 2013/112942                                                       PCT/US2013/023304
 and comprises the variable regions of the light and heavy chain. A single chain Fv ("scFv")
 polypeptide is a covalently linked VH::VL heterodimer which may be expressed from a nucleic
 acid including VH- and VL-encoding sequences either joined directly or joined by a peptide
 encoding linker. See Huston, et al. (1988) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:5879-5883. A number
 of structures for converting the naturally aggregated, but chemically separated light and heavy
 polypeptide chains from an antibody V region into an scFv molecule which will fold into a three
 dimensional structure substantially similar to the structure of an antigen-binding site. See, e.g.
 U.S. Patents 5,091,513; 5,132,405; and 4,956,778.
 [0131]      An antibody may be a non-human antibody, a human antibody, a humanized antibody
or a chimeric antibody, the latter comprising human and non-human antibody sequence. As is
known in the art, chimeric antibody is prepared by exchanging a non-human constant region
(heavy chain, light chain or both) with a human constant region antibody. See e.g. U.S. Patent
4,816,567. Methods of making humanized antibodies from non-human antibodies such as from
murine antibodies are also well known (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 5,565,332).
IV.      Oncolytic Virus
[0132]       Oncolytic viruses that can be administered according to the methods of the invention
include, without limitation, adenoviruses (e.g. Delta-24, Delta-24-RGD, ICOVIR-5, ICOVIR-7,
Onyx-015, ColoAdl, H1O,         AD5/3-D24-GMCSF),       reoviruses, herpes simplex virus (HSV;
OncoVEX GMCSF), Newcastle Disease virus, measles viruses, retroviruses (e.g. influenza
viruses), poxviruses (e.g. vaccinia virus including Copenhagen, Western Reserve, Wyeth
strains), myxoma viruses, rhabdoviruses (e..g vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)), picornaviruses
(e.g. Seneca Valley virus; SVV-001), coxsackievirus and parvovirus.
[0133]       In preferred embodiments, the oncolytic virus is an adenovirus including members of
any of the 57 human serotypes thereof (HAdV- 1 to 57). In one aspect, the adenovirus is an Ad5
serotype. In other aspects, the adenovirus is hybrid serotype which may or may not comprise an
Ad5 component. Non-limiting examples of adenoviruses that may be administered according to
the present methods include Delta-24, Delta-24-RGD, ICOVIR-5, ICOVIR-7, ONYX-015,
ColoAdl, H101 and AD5/3-D24-GMCSF.           Onyx-015 is a hybrid of virus serotype Ad2 and Ad5

with deletions in the E1B-55K and E3B regions to enhance cancer selectivity.             HI0    is a
modified version of Onyx-015. ICOVIR-5 and ICOVIR-7 comprise an Rb-binding site deletion
of ElA and a replacement of the ElA promoter by an E2F promoter. ColoAdl is a chimeric
Add1lp/Ad3 serotype.        AD5/3-D24-GMCSF        (CGTG-102) is a serotype 5/3 capsid-modified
adenovirus encoding GM-CSF (the Ad5 capsid protein knob is replaced with a knob domain
from serotype 3).
 [0134]      In one particularly preferred embodiment, the oncolytic virus is Delta-24 or Delta-24
RGD.     Delta-24 is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20030138405, and
20060147420, each of which are incorporated herein by reference. The Delta-24 adenovirus is
derived from adenovirus type 5 (Ad-5) and contains a 24-base-pair deletion within the CR2
portion of the ElA gene. Delta-24-RGD further comprises an insertion of the RGD-4C sequence
(which binds strongly to avp3 and cvp5 integrins) into the HI loop of the fiber knob protein
(Pasqualini R. et al., Nat Biotechnol, 15:542-546 (1997)).
[0135]       Significant antitumor effects of Delta-24 have been shown in cell culture systems and
in malignant glioma xenograft models.        Currently delta-24 is showing anti-tumor efficacy in
clinical trials. Conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRADs), such as Delta-24, have several
properties that make them candidates for use as biotherapeutic agents. One such property is the
ability to replicate in a permissive cell or tissue, which amplifies the original input dose of the
oncolytic virus and spreads the virus to adjacent tumor cells providing a direct antitumor effect.
[0136]       The in vitro and in vivo oncolytic effects of delta-24 adenovirus have been
demonstrated. Generally, adenovirus is a 36 kb, linear, double-stranded DNA virus (Grunhaus
and Horwitz, 1992). Adenoviral infection of host cells results in adenoviral DNA being
maintained episomally, which reduces the potential genotoxicity associated with integrating
vectors.    Also, adenoviruses are structurally stable, and no genome rearrangement has been
detected after extensive amplification.     Adenovirus can infect virtually most epithelial cells
regardless of their cell cycle stage. So far, adenoviral infection appears to be linked only to mild
disease such as acute respiratory disease in humans.
                                                  48

       WO 2013/112942                                                        PCT/US2013/023304
 [0137]       Several factors favor the use of oncolytic adenoviruses for the treatment of brain
tumors. First, gliomas are typically localized, and therefore an efficient local approach should be
enough to cure the disease.       Second, gliomas harbor several populations of cells expressing
different genetic abnormalities (Sidransky et al., 1992; Collins and James, 1993; Furnari et al.,
 1995; Kyritsis et al., 1996). Thus, the spectrum of tumors sensitive to the transfer of a single
gene to cancer cells may be limited. Third, replication competent adenoviruses can infect and
destroy cancer cells that are arrested in Go. Since gliomas invariably include non-cycling cells,
this property is important. Finally, the p16-Rb pathway is abnormal in the majority of gliomas
(Hamel et al., 1993; Henson et al., 1994; Hirvonen et al., 1994; Jen et al., 1994; Schmidt et al.,
 1994; Costello et al., 1996; Fueyo et al., 1996b; Kyritsis et al., 1996; Ueki et al., 1996; Costello
et al., 1997), thus making the delta-24 strategy appropriate for most of these tumors. Although
the loss of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene function has been associated with the
causes of various types of tumors and is not limited to treatment of gliomas.
[0138]       If an adenovirus has been mutated so that it is unable to replicate or is conditionally
replicative (replication-competent under certain conditions), a helper cell may be required for
viral replication.   When required, helper cell lines may be derived from human cells such as
human embryonic kidney cells, muscle cells, hematopoietic cells or other human embryonic
mesenchymal or epithelial cells. Alternatively, the helper cells may be derived from the cells of
other mammalian species that are permissive for human adenovirus.           Such cells include, for
example Vero cells or other monkey embryonic mesenchymal or epithelial cells. In certain
aspects a helper cell line is 293.    Various methods of culturing host and helper cells may be
found in the art, for example Racher et al., 1995.
[0139]       In certain aspects, the adenovirus is typically replication-competent in cells with a
mutant Rb pathway.        After transfection, adenoviral plaques are isolated from the agarose
overlaid cells and the viral particles are expanded for analysis. For detailed protocols the skilled
artisan is referred to Graham and Prevac, 1991.
[0140]       Alternative technologies for the generation of adenovirus vectors include utilization
of the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) system, in vivo bacterial recombination in a
                                                 49

      WO 2013/112942                                                          PCT/US2013/023304
recA+bacterial strain utilizing two plasmids containing complementary adenoviral sequences,
 and the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) system (PCT publications 95/27071 and 96/33280,
which are incorporated herein by reference).
 [0141]      Adenovirus is easy to grow and manipulate and exhibits broad host range in vitro and
in vivo. This group of viruses can be obtained in high titers (e.g., 109-10" plaque forming units
(pfu) per ml), and they are highly infective. The life cycle of adenovirus does not require
integration into the host cell genome.
 [0142]      Modifications of oncolytic adenovirus described herein may be made to improve the
ability of the oncolytic adenovirus to treat cancer.         Such modifications of an oncolytic
adenovirus have been described by Jiang et al. (Curr Gene Ther. 2009 Oct 9(5):422-427), see
also U.S. Patent Application No. 20060147420, each of which are incorporated herein by
reference.
 [0143]     The absence or the presence of low levels of the coxsackievirus and adenovirus
receptor (CAR) on several tumor types can limit the efficacy of the oncolytic adenovirus.
Various peptide motifs may be added to the fiber knob, for instance an RGD motif (RGD
sequences mimic the normal ligands of cell surface integrins), Tat motif, polylysine motif, NGR
motif, CTT motif, CNGRL motif, CPRECES motif or a strept-tag motif (Rouslahti and Rajotte,
2000). A motif can be inserted into the HI loop of the adenovirus fiber protein. Modifying the
capsid allows CAR independent target cell infection.         This allows higher replication, more
efficient infection, and increased lysis of tumor cells (Suzuki et al., 2001, incorporated herein by
reference). Peptide sequences that bind specific human glioma receptors such as EGFR or uPR
may also be added.       Specific receptors found exclusively or preferentially on the surface of
cancer cells may be used as a target for adenoviral binding and infection, such as EGFRvIII.
[0144]      Oncolytic viruses according to the invention may be administered locally or
systemically. For example, without limitation, oncolytic viruses according to the invention can
be administered intravascularly (intraarterially or intravenously), intratumorally, intramuscularly,
                                                  50

        WO 2013/112942                                                        PCT/US2013/023304
intradermally, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, orally, parenterally, intranasally, intratracheally,
percutaneously, intraspinally, ocularly, or intracranially.
 [0145]        Oncolytic viruses according to the invention may be administered in a single
administration or multiple administrations. The virus may be administered at dosage of 1 x 105
plaque forming units (PFU), 5 x 105 PFU, at least 1 x 106 PFU, 5 x 106 or about 5 x 106 PFU, 1 x
 107 , at least 1 x 107 PFU, 1 x 108 or about 1 x 108 PFU, at least 1 x 108 PFU, about or at least 5 x
 108 PFU, 1 x 109 or at least 1 x 109 PFU, 5 x 109 or at least 5 x 109 PFU, 1 x 1010 PFU or at least
 1 x 1010 PFU, 5 x 1010 or at least 5 x 1010 PFU, 1 x 1011 or at least 1 x10", 1 x 1012 or at least 1 x
 102, 1 x 10" or at least 1 x 1013 . For example, the virus may be administered at a dosage of
between about 107-1013, between about 108-1013, between about 109-1012 or between about 108
    12
10
[0146]         Oncolytic viruses according to the invention may also be administered in a cellular
carrier. In this respect, neuronal and mesenchymal stem cells have high migratory potential yet
remain confined to tumor tissue. A subpopulation of adult mesenchymal cells (bone marrow
derived tumor infiltrating cells or BM-TICs) has been shown, following injection into gliomas,
to infiltrate the entire tumor.      Thus, oncolytic viruses according to the invention can be
administered in a virus-producing neuronal or mesenchymal stem cell (e.g. BM-TIC) carrier (e.g.
by injection of the carrier cell into the tumor).
          A.       Combination Therapies
[0147]        Additional therapies may be combined with any of the methods of the invention
heretofore described in order to increase the killing of cancer cells, the inhibition of cancer cell
growth, the inhibition of angiogenesis or otherwise improve the reverse or reduction of
malignant phenotype of tumor cells.         These compositions would be provided in a combined
amount effective to kill or inhibit proliferation of the cell. This process may involve contacting
the cells with the expression construct and the agent(s) or factor(s) at the same time. This may
be achieved by contacting the cell with a single composition or pharmacological formulation that
includes both agents, or by contacting the cell with two distinct compositions or formulations, at
                                                   51

       WO 2013/112942                                                         PCT/US2013/023304
 the same time, wherein one composition includes the oncolytic virus and the other includes a
 second agent therapy.
 [0148]      Alternatively, the treatment may precede or follow the other agent or treatment by
 intervals ranging from minutes to weeks.           In embodiments where the agents are applied
 separately to the cell, one would generally ensure that a significant period of time did not expire
 between each delivery, such that the agents would still be able to exert an advantageously
 combined effect on the cell. In such instances, it is contemplated that one would contact the cell
with both modalities within about 12-24 hours of each other and, more preferably, within about
 6-12 hours of each other, with a delay time of only about 12 hours being most preferred. In
 some situations, it may be desirable to extend the time period for treatment significantly,
however, where several days (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7) to several weeks (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8) to
 several months (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8) lapse between the respective administrations.
 [0149]      It also is conceivable that more than one administration of either agent will be
desired.   Various combinations may be employed, e.g. where one or more oncolytic virus
treatment is administered before the administration of a second agent; or the second agent may
be administered prior to oncolytic virus administration. Successive administration can include
one or more administration of the oncolytic virus therapy or second agent. Again, to achieve cell
killing, both agents are delivered to a cell in a combined amount effective to kill the cell. For
example, the combination of Delta-24 or Delta-24-RGD and immune modulator.
[0150]      Alternative Cancer Therapies
[0151]      In accordance with certain embodiments of the present invention, methods for
treating cancer are provided that can be used in conjunction with oncolytic virus therapy once a
subject is identified as a responder or likely to respond to such therapy (e.g. delta-24-RGD
therapy). Such therapies may be utilized when the assays of the present invention indicate that a
subject is unlikely to respond to treatment with a replication competent oncolytic virus such as
adenovirus (e.g. delta-24-RGD). Alternatively, such therapies may be utilized in combination
with replication competent oncolytic virus such as adenovirus in the case that a subject is
                                                    52

      WO 2013/112942                                                         PCT/US2013/023304
identified by the present methods as unlikely to respond to treatment with only replication
competent oncolytic virus.
 [0152]     Surgery
 [0153]     Approximately 60% of persons with cancer will undergo surgery of some type, which
includes preventative, diagnostic, staging, curative and palliative surgery. Curative surgery is a
cancer treatment that may be used in conjunction with other therapies, such as the treatment of
the present invention, chemotherapy,          radiotherapy,   hormonal    therapy,   gene therapy,
immunotherapy and/or alternative therapies.
[0154]      Curative surgery includes resection in which all or part of cancerous tissue is
physically removed, excised and/or destroyed. Tumor resection refers to physical removal of at
least part of a tumor. In addition to tumor resection, treatment by surgery includes laser surgery,
cryosurgery, electrosurgery, and microscopically controlled surgery (Mohs' surgery).            It is
further contemplated that the present invention may be used in conjunction with removal of
superficial cancers, precancers, or incidental amounts of normal tissue.
[0155]      In certain aspects, a therapy is administered by intratumoral injection prior to surgery
or upon excision of a part of or all of cancerous cells, tissue or tumor. Treatment may also be
accomplished by perfusion, direct injection or local application of these areas with an additional
anti-cancer therapy. Such treatment may be repeated, for example, every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7
days, or every 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks or every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 months.
These treatments may be of varying dosages.
[0156]      Chemotherapy
[0157]      A wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents may be used in accordance with the
present invention.    The term "chemotherapy" refers to the use of drugs to treat cancer. A
"chemotherapeutic agent" is used to connote a compound or composition that is administered in
the treatment of cancer. These agents or drugs are categorized by their mode of activity within a
cell, for example, whether and at what stage they affect the cell cycle. Alternatively, an agent
                                                 53

      WO 2013/112942                                                         PCT/US2013/023304
may be characterized based on its ability to directly cross-link DNA, to intercalate into DNA, or
to induce chromosomal and mitotic aberrations by affecting nucleic acid synthesis.              Most
chemotherapeutic agents fall within the following categories: alkylating agents, antimetabolites,
antitumor antibiotics, topoisomerase inhibitors, and mitotic inhibitors.
[0158]      Alkylating agents direct interact with genomic DNA to prevent the cancer cell from
proliferating. This category of drugs include agents that affect all phases of the cell cycle and are
commonly used to treat chronic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease,
malignant melanoma, multiple myeloma, and particular cancers of the breast, lung, and ovary.
They include nitrogen mustards such as mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard), chlorambucil,
cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), ifosfamide and melphalan, nitrosoureas such as streptozocin,
carmustine (BCNU) and lomustine, alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan, triazines such as
dacarbzine (DTIC) and temozolomide           (Temodar@), ethylenimines such as thiotepa and
altretamine (hexamethylmelamine), and platinum drugs such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and
oxalaplatin.
[0159]      Antimetabolites disrupt DNA and RNA synthesis.           Unlike alkylating agents, they
specifically influence the cell cycle during S phase. They have been used to combat chronic
leukemias, and tumors of the breast, ovary and gastrointestinal tract. Antimetabolites include 5
fluorouracil (5-FU), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), capecitabine (Xeloda@), cladribine, clofarabine,
cytarabine    (Ara-C@),    floxuridine,  fludarabine,   gemcitabine     (Gemzar@),      hydroxyruea,
methotrexate, pemetrexed, pentostatin and thioguanine.
[0160]      Antitumor antibiotics have both antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity.        These drugs
also interfere with DNA by chemically inhibiting enzymes and mitosis or altering cellular
membranes. These agents work in all phases of the cell cycle and are used to treat a variety of
cancers.      Representative   examples    include  daunorubicin,     doxorubicin   (Adriamycin),
epirubicin,   idarubicin,  actinomycin-D,    bleomycin   and mitomycin-C.          Generally, these
compounds are administered by bolus i.v. injections at doses ranging from 25-100 mg/kg
                                                 54

      WO 2013/112942                                                        PCT/US2013/023304
 [0161]     Topoisomerase inhibitors interfere with topoisomerases, enzymes which help separate
DNA strands so they can be copied and are used to treat certain leukemias, as well as lung,
ovarian, gastrointestinal and other cancers and include topotecan, irinotecan, etoposide (VP- 16)
and teniposide.
 [0162]     Mitotic inhibitors, often plant alkaloids, work during M phase of the cell cycle and
prevent mitosis or inhibit enzymes from producing proteins required for cell reproduction.
Representative examples include taxanes such as paclitaxel (Taxol@) and docetaxel (Taxotere@),
epothilones such as ixabepilone (Ixempra@), vinca alkaloids such as vinblastine (Velban),
vincristine (Onocovin@) and vinorelbine (Navelbine), and Estramustine (Emeyt).
[0163]      Other   chemotherapeutic     agents  include   targeted therapies   such as imatinib
(Gleevec), gefitinib     (Iressa@),   sunitinib (Sutent), sorafenib    (Nexavar), bortezomib
(Velcade), bevacizumab (Avastin), trastuzumab (Herceptin), cetuximab (Erbitux), and
panitumumab (Vectibix), hormone therapies including antiestrogens such as fulvestrant
(Faslodex), tamoxifen, toremifine, aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole, exemstane and
letrozole, progestins such as megestrol acetate, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone and
immunotherapies such as antibodies against tumor specific antigens (e.g. prostate specific
antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, urinary tumor associated antigen, fetal antigen, tyrosinase
(p97), gp68, TAG-72, HMFG, Sialyl Lewis Antigen, MucA, MucB, PLAP, estrogen receptor,
laminin reeptor, erb B and p 1 55) which may be conjugated to a drug or toxin (e.g. radionuclide,
ricin A chain, cholera toxin, pertussis toxin).
[0164]      Radiotherapy
[0165]      Radiotherapy, also called radiation therapy, is the treatment of cancer and other
diseases with ionizing radiation which may be used to treat localized solid tumors such as
cancers of the skin, tongue, larynx, brain, breast or cervix, or may be used to treat cancers of the
blood-forming cells (leukemia) and lymphatic system (lymphoma). Radiation therapy includes,
without limitation, the use of y-rays, X-rays and/or the directed delivery of radioisotopes to
tumor cells. Other forms of DNA damaging factors are contemplated such as microwaves and
                                                 55

      WO 2013/112942                                                        PCT/US2013/023304
UV-irradiation.     Dosage ranges for X-rays range from daily doses of 50-200 roentgens for
prolonged periods of time (3 to 4 weeks), to single doses of 2000-6000 roentgens.
 [0166]     Radiotherapy also comprises the use of radiolabeled antibodies to deliver doses of
radiation directly to the cancer site (e.g. radioimmunotherapy, conformal radiotherapy), high
resolution intensity modulated radiotherapy, and stereotactic radio-surgery. Stereotactic radio
surgery (gamma knife) for brain and other tumors employs precisely targeted beams of gamma
radiotherapy from hundreds of different angles.      Only one session, taking about 4-5 hours is
required.
V.      Pharmaceutical compositions
[0167]      Cells, viruses, polypeptides, peptides, and compounds (i.e, therapeutic agents)
described herein can be administered as a pharmaceutical or medicament formulated with a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Accordingly, the therapeutic agents may be used in the
manufacture of a medicament or pharmaceutical composition. Pharmaceutical compositions of
the invention may be        formulated   as solutions or lyophilized powders        for parenteral
administration.    Powders may be reconstituted by addition of a suitable diluent or other
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier prior to use. Liquid formulations may be buffered, isotonic,
aqueous solutions. Powders also may be sprayed in dry form. Examples of suitable diluents are
normal isotonic saline solution, standard 5% dextrose in water, or buffered sodium or ammonium
acetate solution. Such formulations are especially suitable for parenteral administration, but may
also be used for oral administration or contained in a metered dose inhaler or nebulizer for
insufflation. It may be desirable to add excipients such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxy
cellulose, acacia, polyethylene glycol, mannitol, sodium chloride, sodium citrate, and the like.
[0168]      Alternately, therapeutic agents may be encapsulated, tableted or prepared in an
emulsion or syrup for oral administration. Pharmaceutically acceptable solid or liquid carriers
may be added to enhance or stabilize the composition, or to facilitate preparation of the
composition.     Solid carriers include starch, lactose, calcium sulfate dihydrate, terra alba,
magnesium stearate or stearic acid, talc, pectin, acacia, agar or gelatin. Liquid carriers include
syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, saline and water. The carrier may also include a sustained release
                                                 56

       WO 2013/112942                                                         PCT/US2013/023304
 material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone or with a wax. The amount
 of solid carrier varies but, preferably, will be between about 20 mg to about 1 g per dosage unit.
 The pharmaceutical preparations are made following the conventional techniques of pharmacy
 involving milling, mixing, granulating, and compressing, when necessary, for tablet forms; or
 milling, mixing and filling for hard gelatin capsule forms. When a liquid carrier is used, the
 preparation may be in the form of a syrup, elixir, emulsion, or an aqueous or non-aqueous
 suspension.     For rectal administration, the invention compounds may be combined with
 excipients such as cocoa butter, glycerin, gelatin, or polyethylene glycols and molded into a
 suppository.
 [0169]      Therapeutic agents may be formulated to include other medically useful drugs or
biological agents. The therapeutic agents also may be administered in conjunction with the
administration of other drugs or biological agents useful for the disease or condition to which the
invention compounds are directed.
 [0170]      As employed herein, the phrase "an effective amount," refers to a dose sufficient to
provide concentrations high enough to impart a beneficial effect on the recipient thereof. The
specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular subject will depend upon a variety
of factors including the disorder being treated, the severity of the disorder, the activity of the
specific compound, the route of administration, the rate of clearance of the compound, the
duration of treatment, the drugs used in combination or coincident with the compound, the age,
body weight, sex, diet, and general health of the subject, and like factors well known in the
medical arts and sciences. Various general considerations taken into account in determining the
"therapeutically effective amount" are known to those of skill in the art and are described, e.g., in

                                   Example 1 - Phase I Clinical Study
 [0173]       A Phase I, dose-escalation, two-arm clinical trial of conditionally replication
competent adenovirus (Delta-24-RGD) for treatment of malignant gliomas has recently been
completed. Arm A of the study tested direct intratumoral injection of a single dose of Delta-24
RGD into a growing area of a recurrent glioma. Arm B tested intratumoral administration of a
divided dose into the resection bed following removal of a recurrent glioma. The A arm study
started at a dose of 1 x 107 viral particles (vp) and escalated in half log increments through 3 x
 1010 vp; no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached because no dose-limiting toxicities
were found, nor were any serious adverse events (SAEs) reported. The Phase I trial showed
clear evidence of tumor response and good survival in both A and B arms after reaching the
relatively low dose of 3 x 108 vp. The Phase I A arm data (n=24) shows a high response rate by
MRI (30-40%), as evidenced by tumor shrinkage and characteristic changes ("signature
changes") on MRI.         The evidence that these signature changes are relevant is derived from
pathology reports on surgically resected tumors. Two tumors were resected several months after
Delta-24-RGD therapy in response to what appeared to be tumor progression. In both instances,
pathologists reported that the tumors were 80% and 90% dead (necrotic) with the remaining
tumor infiltrated by predominantly CD8 T cells. As a practical matter, the signature changes on
                                                    58

        WO 2013/112942                                                         PCT/US2013/023304
  MRI elicited by intratumoral delivery of Delta-24-RGD can be used as an early indicator of
  clinical response without having to rely upon accurate measurements of tumor size.
  [0174]      Delta-24-RGD is an adenovirus that has been engineered to infect cells lacking the
  Rb tumor suppressor gene, a condition unique to tumor cells, with high selectivity. In theory,
  adenovirus propagation in the tumor mass results in a series of infection-replication-lysis
  infection events that will generate a wave of propagation, to potentially eradicate the tumor mass.
  Oncolytic viruses such as adenoviruses, therefore, hold a unique promise of overcoming the
  resistance of gliomas to convention therapies and circumvent the inaccessibility of tumor for
  surgery and the trend of resistance of cancer cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A goal of
 the Phase I study was to find the maximum tolerable dose of Delta-24-RGD administered by
 intratumoral injection and into the post-resection cavity in patients with recurrent malignant
 glioma. Results from this trial revealed that the intratumoral injection of the virus instigated an
 initial phase of oncolysis followed by a delayed inflammatory (Th1 polarized) response that
 ultimately resulted in tumor shrinkage with complete regression in a subset of these patients.
 This is the first evidence that patients with gliomas develop an immune response after exposure
 to oncolytic virus such as Delta-24-RGD and that this immune response can be used as the basis
 for predicting success of the treatment.
 [0175]       Although the results described herein were obtained in patients with high-grade
 gliomas, the ability of oncolytic viruses in general (and Delta-24-RGD virus in particular) to
 replicate in multiple tumor types has been demonstrated, including without limitation breast
 carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, large cell lung carcinoma and sarcomas. The data presented
herein on the treatment of gliomas is expected to be relevant to the vast majority of other solid
tumors.
 [0176]       A finding that was completely unexpected and unique during the phase I clinical trial
using Delta-24-RGD was that at least 2 patients who had been previously treated with (and
failed) Temozolomide and radiation therapy had a minimum of what appeared to be complete
radiographic responses based on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. These patients
had classic tumor response by MRI; one showed dramatic changes on MRI without shrinking
                                                  59

       WO 2013/112942                                                       PCT/US2013/023304
 and upon subsequent resection, the tumor was reported by pathology to be 90% necrotic with the
 rest infiltrated with immune cells. One of these patients is still alive and well over 2 % years
 after treatment with a single injection of the virus. This was a striking finding and what was
more unexpected was that the 2 patients who had these complete responses also had serum levels
of IL- 12p70, which were highly elevated compared to the rest of the population within this phase
I trial. These IL-12p70 levels of cytokine correlate very well with the hypothesis that a T-helper
one (Th-1) polarization is necessary for optimal action of the oncolytic adenovirus. In fact, all
patients who responded to treatment with Delta-24-RGD had significantly elevated IL-12p7O
levels prior to and after treatment with the virus (100% correlation). This data is also consistent
with the finding, discussed below, that the serum of these patients with complete responses had
very low levels of antibodies against cancer-related antigens. Moreover, analysis of resected
tumors from patients that responded to the virus during the Phase 1 study demonstrated an
infiltration of macrophages at two weeks post-treatment followed by CD8 T cells at several
months.
[0177]        This data suggests that stimulation of a Th1 phenotype (i.e. high levels of Th1
cytokines such as IL-12) in a patient, for example by administering a Th1 cytokine such as
human recombinant IL-12p70, IL-2, IFN-y or an agent which stimulates IL-12p70 production
such as Revlimid or lenalidomide prior to or after administration of an oncolytic virus such as
Delta-24-RGD could potentially be used to augment the patient's response to the effects of the
virus. Thus, one patient with low baseline IL-12p70 levels was administered IFN-y 2 months
after receiving Delta-24-RGD       (2 million units of interferon gamma-lb (Actimmune@)
subcutaneously on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, continuously) in order to produce a Thl
phenotype and accordingly augment the anti-tumor effects of the virus. The patient responded
very well to the virus and appears to be a complete responder, thus providing a proof of
principle. Suppression of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 could also represent a
novel strategy for augmenting the effects of oncolytic viruses.
[0178]       The present inventors have also discovered that patients who had a high level of
antibodies against cancer related antigens prior to receiving Delta-24-RGD or who developed an
                                                 60

      WO 2013/112942                                                           PCT/US2013/023304
 increase in circulating auto-antibodies to cancer antigens during oncolytic virus therapy did not
 exhibit a response to the virus. Conversely, the serum of patients who were complete responders
had very low levels of antibodies against cancer related antigens. A 100% correlation was again
 observed, consistent with the correlation between IL-12p70 and response to the virus. Thus, a T
helper-one (Th-1) polarization is necessary for optimal action of the oncolytic adenovirus.
Briefly, sera of patients entering the Phase I clinical trial were tested for the presence or absence
of antibodies against 31 distinct cancer related antigens both prior to receiving Delta-24-RGD
and also for the development of antibodies post-treatment.          These cancer antigens included
cancer/testis antigens, a class of tumor antigens whose expression is normally restricted to germ
lines but are activated in a wide range of cancer types, often encoding antigens that are
immunogenic in cancer patients. Currently there are no systemic studies on the presence of these
antibodies against cancer antigens in patients with glioma. The present inventors have obtained
the first evidence that patients with glioma have developed an immune response against cancer
antigens.    Surprisingly, serum from patients with tumors that had a radiographic response to
Delta-24-RGD had low or no humoral antibody response to the defined set of antigens. The lack
of antibody response in patients who respond to Delta-24-RGD is consistent with the
requirement of a Th1 polarized immune system to respond to the virus.
[0179]       These unique findings have extremely broad implications: (1) high levels of Th1
cytokines such as IL-12p7O and/or low levels of antibodies to cancer related antigens provides a
novel set of biomarkers which can be used to identify a subset of patients who will respond to
oncolytic virus (e.g. adenovirus) therapy and (2) administration of agents which produce a Th1
immune phenotype (i.e. increase the levels of IL-12p70 and other Th1 cytokines) can be co
administered prior to or after administration of an oncolytic virus in order to augment oncolytic
virus therapy. For instance, recombinant human IL-12p70 (or interferon-gamma or an agent
which stimulates production of these cytokines such as Revlimid) could be administered to
cancer patients systematically to augment the effect of oncolytic viruses such as adenovirus and
thereby increase antitumor activity and improve treatment outcome.

      WO 2013/112942                                                           PCT/US2013/023304
 [0180]      The present inventors have thus discovered that a predominant expression of Th1
 cytokines can be used to predict the outcome of oncolytic virus therapy in patients with cancers
 such as gliomas. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is proposed that a subset of patients
with cancer having a predominantly Th1 cytokine profile are primed to mount a cell-mediated
antitumor immnunoresponse. In particular, the present inventors have surprisingly discovered
that glioma patients with measurable responses to Delta-24-RGD in a positive clinical outcome
have high levels of Th1 cytokines IL-12p70, IL-2 and IFN- y whereas a high level of antibodies
against tumor associated antigens seems to predict patients who will not respond to the virus.
The patients that had a complete response or a high level of response had high levels of Th1
cytokine interleukin-12p7O pre-operatively (serum levels were highly elevated compared to the
rest of the population within the phase I trial) and this level increased after injection of the virus.
The two patients who had complete responses also had serum levels of IL-12p70, which were
highly elevated compared to the rest of the population within this phase I trial.
[0181]      The role of other proinflammatory Th1 cytokines (e.g. IFN-y) and anti-inflammatory
Th2 cytokines (e.g. IL-4 and IL-10) in the response of glioma patients to treatment with the
oncolytic adenovirus Delta-24-RGD was investigated.          The role of phosphoproteins (phospho
STAT3 (Tyr 705)) and cleaved caspase-3 were also examined.               Phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705).
Thus, phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) and cleaved caspase-3 in cell lysates and GM-CSF, IFNy, ILl P,
IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40 and TNFa levels in cell culture media were determined using
custom-coated multispot plates and a Sector Imager 6000 according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Meso Scale with minor modifications).         For quantitation of cytokines, cell culture
media were collected and stored at -80'C. For cleaved caspase-3 and phospho-STAT3 (Tyr 705)
quantitation,  cells subjected to experimental       manipulations     were washed with ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by placing on ice in MSD complete lysis buffer (150
mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM NaF,
MSD phosphatase inhibitor I, MSD phosphatase inhibitor II, and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail)
with occasional vortex-mixing for 30 min. Following centrifugation at 17,968 g for 10 min at
4'C the supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined and the cleared
lysates were stored at -80'C.

      WO 2013/112942                                                       PCT/US2013/023304
 [0182]      Electrochemiluminescence assays were performed on biological duplicate samples
using capture antibody precoated 96-well multispot plates from Meso Scale Discovery (MSD;
 Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, plates were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with shaking
and washed four times with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20. Fifteen micrograms of
protein or twenty-five microliters of supernatant or calibrator was added to each well and
incubated with shaking for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4'C. Plates were washed
and then specific protein levels were quantitated by adding 25 pl of 1 tg/ml specific detection
antibody labeled with MSD SULFO-TAG reagent to each well and incubated with shaking for 2
hours at room temperature. Plates were washed four times with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1%
Tween-20 as before, 150 pl of 2x or 1 x read buffer was added, and the plates were immediately
read using the SECTOR Imager 6000, and data were quantitated using Discovery Workbench
and SOFTmax PRO 4.0.
 [0183]     Data obtained to date has demonstrated that a predominant expression of Th1
cytokines predicts a patient's clinical outcome. Without being bound by theory, it is proposed
that a subset of patients with cancer having a predominantly Thl cytokine profile are primed to
mount a cell-mediated antitumor immnunorespons. In particular, the present study demonstrates
a Thl -driven immune response by cytokines IL-12 and IFN-y in glioma patients correlates with a
measurable response to Delta-24-RGD and positive clinical outcome, whereas a high level of
antibodies against tumor asociated antigens seems to predict patients who will not respond to the
virus. The response of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 are not involved during Delta-24-RGD
treatment and their expression levels do not appear to be relevant for clinical outcome. Thus, a
skew of the immune response from humoral (as measured by e.g. autoantibody titration) to
cellular (as documented e.g. by cytokine analyses) can be used to predict patients that are likely
to be responders to oncolytic viruses such as Delta-24-RGD.
[0184]      An alternative or additional strategy for augmenting the effects of oncolytic viruses
such as Delta-24-RGD is to decrease the level of or suppress the T-regulatory cells also known
as T-regs which can be accomplished by a number of chemotherapy agents, including a number
of alkylating agents such as Temozolomide and cyclophosphamide. The highly Th1 polarized
                                                63

      WO 2013/112942                                                        PCT/US2013/023304
immune systems prior to and during therapy in the two complete responders who had previously
failed temozolomide therapy indicates that an agent that suppresses T-regulatory cells could be
administered to a glioma or other cancer patient prior to oncolytic virus therapy in order to prime
the patient's immune system to respond to the virus. Alternatively, an agent that suppresses T
regulatory cells could be administered after administration of the virus.
[0185]      Taking advantage of the discoveries described herein, a "perfect storm" treatment is
envisioned or embodied by the use of an oncolytic virus such as Delta-24-RGD comprising (a)
pre-administration of an IL-12 stimulating agent such as recombinant human IL-12p70 or IFN-y
or agents such as Revlimid (lenalinamide) to stimulate IL-12p70 production prior to
administering the virus (b) injection of the virus into multiple areas of the tumor to achieve
maximal oncolysis and optionally (c) administering to the patient an agent which can reduce the
T-reg population in the proliferate case and/or stimulate a cell mediated immune response. For
example, Temozolomide can be used to reduce T-reg populations in a potentially a dose-dense
fashion which would be 7 days on and 7 days off or 21 days on and 7 days off or standard
dosing, five days on, 23 days off of the drug. This combination therapy would first increase Thi
cytokines, which drive the Thi or T-helper 1 response, which mediates T-cell effector cells. The
introduction of Delta-24-RGD into the tumor mass then creates an "antigen burst" of both viral
antigens and presumably cancer-related antigens, as the tumor cells are lysed.              Finally,
administration of agents that stimulate a cell mediated immune response against tumor related
antigens such as CTLA-4 antagonists such as Ipilimumab and PD-i/PD-Li receptor antagonists
stimulate and keep the T-cells mediated clones replicating and active.
     Example 2 - Phase IB clincial trial: Co-administration of an oncolytic virus with a Thl

[0186]      A phase 1B clinical study is underway designed to determine the maximum tolerated
dose of Delta-24-RGD, administered by intratumoral injection and into the post-resection cavity
concurrent with Ipilimumab, administered intravenously, as well as the dose limiting toxicities
and anti-tumor activity of the combination.

[0187]      Ipilimumab is a fully human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA-4)-blocking
IgGlk monoclonal antibody (formerly MDX-010).           CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T cell
activation. CTLA-4 functions as an immune checkpoint by exerting an inhibitory control on T
cell activation and blocking this particular pathway.       Blockade with ipilimumab allows the
immune response to persist. Ipilimumab binds to CTLA-4 and blocks interaction of CTLA-4
with its ligands CD80/CD86.       CTLA-4 blockade has been shown to augment T-cell activation
and proliferation; the mechanism of action of ipilimumab may occur through T-cell mediated
anti tumor immune responses. Briefly, ipilimumab blocks the regulatory feedback loop mediated
by CTLA-4 and thereby effectively stimulates T-cell proliferation and secretion of IL-2.
Ipilimumab has gained regulatory approval by the FDA for treatment of unresectable or
metastatic melanoma. During a Phase 3 clinical trial in which patients with these cancers were
administered either gp100 (a peptide vaccine comprising a melanoma-associated antigen),
ipilimumab or a combination of both.         Patients treated with ipilimumab alone had a 34%
reduction in risk of death over the gplOO arm but no difference in median overall survival (OS)
was observed between ipilimumab alone and the combination of gp100 + ipilimumab.

[0192]      Treatment Plan - Study Overview
[0193]      This study will have a limited phase IB component with the combination of
ipilimumab with Delta-24-RGD-4C for the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma.
Study patients will require biopsy-confirmed recurrent tumor and will allow two prior therapies
or two prior tumor recurrences.
[0194]      Patients with biopsy-confirmed first or section recurrence of GBM will be consented
and administered an initial intratumoral or resection bed injection of 3 X 1010 vp Delta-24-RGD
in 1 ml. Patients will be monitored for viral shedding at a variety of time points and for tumor
response by MRI at two and four weeks to look for "signature" evidence of tumor destruction on
MRI. Patients who show no evidence of changes on MRI will be offered an additional dose of
Delta-24-RGD, followed by the option of a third dose at two months post treatment.            This
strategy will control for the possibility that Delta-24-RGD may be delivered sub-optimally
during a single injection. Sub-optimal delivery could be due to: (1) missing or not selecting an
enhancing area of the tumor, (2) reflux of virus out of the tumor due to intratumoral pressure, (3)
genetic alterations in the tumor that make it unable to support robust Delta-24-RGD replication,
or (4) immune suppression due to prior toxic chemotherapy or corticosteroids that may affect the
ability of Delta-24-RGD to establish an antitumor response.
[0195]      All patients will be monitored for tumor response, safety, progression-free and overall
survival and quality of life assessments.      Besides all of the standard blood measurements,
including Ad seroconversion, we will also catalog the appearance (or disappearance) of serum
                                                 67

anti-tumor antibodies using a proprietary assay developed by Serametrix (Carlsbad, CA), as well
as cytokine assays.
[0196]      Dose Escalation - Phase I
[0197]      The dosing of Delta-24-RGD-4C ,will be given at one log less than the highest dose
which was safely given during the previous phase I study of Delta-24-RGD-4C as a single agent,
that being a dose of 3 x 109 viral particles per ml given as a one ml injection into the tumor bed
by a stereotactic framed delivery system. (The highest dose given during the previous phase I
single-agent study was 3 x 1010 viral particles per ml). The phase I component will be based on a
3 x 3 design, whereas if no toxicity is seen in the first 3 patients greater than grade 1 or 2, then
the patients may escalate to the next dose which will be 1 x 1010 viral particles per ml given in 1
ml injection volume, again by stereotactic framed delivery method. Again, if there is no toxicity
greater than 1 or 2 at this dose level then we will reach the maximum dose for this trial which
will be 3 x 1010 viral particles per ml given on day 28 after starting the temozolomide dosing.
The patients will be allowed to have up to 3 total injections of the virus on subsequent monthly
courses 2 and 3, again given at day 21 after starting a new course of temozolomide. Once the
highest dose combination is reached, assuming there is no toxicity greater than grade 1 or 2, then
the phase II component of this combination clinical trial will commence.
[0198]      All Subjects
[0199]      After virus administration and surgical procedures, all subjects will be transferred to
the ICU until stable. Subjects may then be transferred to an in-patient or Step-Down unit based
on the primary surgeon's decision.       After 3 days, final discharge of subjects will be at the
discretion of the Investigator. Subjects will be placed on contact isolation for the duration of
their post-operative hospitalization and managed per institutional policies for adenovirus
infection.
[0200]     Dosing and Dose-Escalation

      WO 2013/112942                                                           PCT/US2013/023304
[0201]    Safety Stopping Rules - The primary safety variable will be the proportion of subjects
who experience any grade 3 or greater toxicity that are at least possibly related to Delta-24
RGD-4C (and not to the surgical procedure).
[0202]    The toxicity rate will be no greater than 30% for any dose level. If the number of
subjects who experience grade 3 or greater toxicity that are deemed to be at least possibly related
to Delta-24-RGD-4C is greater than or equal to the subject probabilities above who received
Delta-24-RGD-4C, then the dose will be considered too toxic and the subjects exhibiting DLT
attributable to Delta-24-RGD-4C will be reviewed by Principal Investigator.
[0203]    Additional study-stopping criteria include (a) death that is at least possibly attributable
to Delta-24-RGD-4C, (b) severe allergic reactions at least possibly attributed to Delta-24-RGD
4C (CTC Grade 3 or 4), and/or (c) DLT in > two patients at the lowest dose level.
[0204]    Dose Interruption - Delta-24-RGD-4C administration should be interrupted if the
subject develops symptoms of decreased cerebral function or cardiovascular perfusion or if there
are signs of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis.   Signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis include rash,
hives, changes in blood pressure, and shortness of breath in subjects not under general
anesthesia. Delta-24-RGD-4C administration will also be interrupted for any adverse event that,
in the Investigator's opinion, warrants interruption.   In addition, if it appears at that ventricular
penetration has occurred, the procedure will be aborted and no further Delta-24-RGD-4C will be
administered.
 [0205]   Corticosteroids and Anticonvulsants - Decadron will be used in the study because the
greatest challenge in viral gene therapy has been the immune response to the virus itself.
 Steroids will also control brain inflammation and edema. The total daily steroid dose (expressed
in mg decadron/day) will be recorded the day before surgery. The dose will be adjusted at the
discretion of the Investigator, with the exception that all subjects will receive 10 mg IV just prior
to surgery. "Surgery" includes both stereotactic injection and open craniotomy. Efforts will be
made to reduce the steroid dose to the minimal clinically efficacious dose. Anticonvulsants will
be administered at the discretion of the Investigator.

 [0208]    Study Procedures
 [0209]    All patients must have signed the IRB-approved informed consent form before the
initiation of any study-related evaluations. In addition, the institution's surgical consent form for
invasive procedures will be signed.
 [0210]    Patients will have a complete history (including details of prior tumor therapy and
 concurrent non-malignant disease) and evaluation of all neurological symptoms within 2 weeks
prior to the Day 0/Baseline procedure.       Additionally, they will undergo a complete physical
 examination including a general examination and a neurological examination. Vital sign

measurements and weight will be recorded and Karnofsky performance status score determined.
Routine baseline laboratory testing will occur within two weeks of Day 0/Baseline procedure.
These tests will be evaluated as baseline and for surgical clearance.
[0211]    Finally, all subjects will undergo MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium
administration within two weeks prior to the Day 0/Baseline procedure. Preliminary decisions
regarding the eligibility of the subject for gene transfer therapy and the injections and/or
procedures required for each subject will be decided based on the scan results.
[0212]     Special Pretreatment Laboratory Assessments - All subjects will undergo special
laboratory studies; Serum will be tested for anti-AdV5 antibody titer (ELISA); Additional serum
will be tested for antibodies to specific cancer-related antigens (CRA) as well as cytokine profile
using ELISA based MSD; Peripheral blood will be subject to flow cytometry (at the P.I.
discretion); Serum pregnancy testing will be performed for females of childbearing potential;
HIV-1 testing will be performed on all subjects; Hepatitis screening serology: hepatitis A, B
[core antibody and surface antigen], C and D [Delta virus]; The following will be used to test
serum, nasopharyngeal secretions, and urine for viral dissemination; and PCR for AdV DNA
specific to Delta-24-RGD-4C and wild-type AdV.
[0213]     Evaluation after Surgical Procedures - Within 36 hours after stereotactic biopsy,
subjects will have a CT scan to assess for the presence of hematoma. While the subject is in the
hospital, daily assessments will be conducted including short neurologic evaluation, Karnofsky
performance status,vital sign measurements, determination of adverse signs or symptoms
(clinical toxicity) and corticosteroid dose. On the day after all surgical procedures serum, urine,
and nasopharyngeal secretions will be collected for monitoring virus dissemination and serum
anti-AdV5 antibody titer determination. Within 24 hours after a procedure, subjects will have
 serum chemistry and hematological studies performed.
 [0214]    Evaluation after Craniotomy: An MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium will be
performed for all subjects within 48 hours after craniotomy to assess the extent of resection
 and/or adverse effects of intramural injection.

[0215]    Evaluation after Discharge: Patients can be discharged within 3 days of the procedure.
Subjects will then be evaluated on day 28 (+/- 2 days) and months 2 (+/- 4 days), 3 (+/- 4 days),
and 4 (+/- 4 days). Thereafter, follow-up will occur every two months (+/- 7 days).
[0216]    Follow-Up Assessments - During outpatient follow-up, each subject will undergo a
complete physical and neurological examination, assessment of Karnofsky performance status,
weight, vital sign measurements, determination of adverse events and an evaluation of steroid
and concomitant medication use. An MRI of the brain, without and with gadolinium will be
performed. Clinical safety labs will also be performed and samples of serum, urine, and
nasopharyngeal secretions obtained for the shedding of systemic AdV. Finally, serum will be
collected for anti-AdV5 antibody titer determination.
[0217]    Specimen Analysis - All laboratory tests will be recorded on the appropriate
CRF/worksheet record or electronic database. If unscheduled laboratory tests are performed
based on clinical judgment, the results of these tests must also be recorded. Biopsy samples will
be collected at the time of stereotactic biopsy. One portion of the biopsy specimen will be frozen
in OCT media and another will be fixed in formalin and paraffin-embedded. Remaining biopsy
samples will be flash-frozen. The tumor biopsy specimen will be analyzed for the following: H
& E staining
[0218]    Specimens for Virus Dissemination Studies - Virus shedding and dissemination will be
monitored at the indicated time points in nasopharyngeal secretions, urine and serum. Virus
dissemination will be determined by PCR analysis of Delta-24-RGD-4C and wild-type AdV
DNA, and culture as required, by noting the appearance of a CPE in a 293 cell-based assay
following the addition of a subject sample. The 293 cell line provides the El protein in trans,
thus supporting the replication of El-deficient Delta-24-RGD-4C.          Confirmation of CPE in
select samples as adenoviral-derived will be determined by an ELISA-based assay for hexon
protein. Samples will be tested for the presence of replication-competent adenovirus (RCA) by a
CPE assay in a 293, cell line that does not provide the El proteins in trans.

[0220]    The primary objective of the phase I portion of this study is to determine the MTD for
the combination of ipilimumab and Delta-24-RGD.
[0221]    Phase I:Three patients are entered per dose level if no DLT is encountered in these 3
patients. If DLT is encountered, the cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. A maximum of 4
higher-dose cohorts are expected.      If DLT is found at the starting dose, a maximum of two
lower-dose cohorts can be explored. At least 6 patients will be treated at the recommended dose
(or MTD-1) level.     Hence, at least 9 and maximum 12 (two dose levels of virus escalation)
patients will be treated in this portion. Patients treated at the MTD in the phase I portion of this
study the number of subjects may be expanded for a preliminary Phase II component.
[0222]    For the current single-stage trial, the hypotheses to be tested are HO: p < p0 versus Hi:
p > pl, where p is the probability of remaining alive and free from progression at 6 months. If
the value of p0 (uninterestingly low response) will be set at 20% and pl at 40%, a trial with 40
patients will give acceptable error rates for the hypothesis testing and precision for estimation
(with alpha of 5% and power of 87%). The trial will be successful (null hypothesis rejected)
when 13 or more patients are alive and progression-free at 6 months.
[0223]    To assure adequate accrual of evaluable patients, the sample size will be increase by
 10% (4 additional patients). Therefore a total of 44 patients will be enrolled.
[0224]    Adverse Events Definitions
[0225]    For this protocol, an adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign,
symptom, disease, syndrome, intercurrent illness, abnormal laboratory finding) that emerges or
worsens relative to pre-injection baseline, during the administration or follow-up periods in a
subject in a clinical investigation who has been administered an investigational product.        The
untoward medical       occurrence may not necessarily have           a causal    relationship to the
administration of the product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign
(including an abnormal laboratory result), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal
(investigational) product.
                                                   73

      WO 2013/112942                                                         PCT/US2013/023304
[0226]    Common events/symptoms surrounding surgical procedures (e.g., pain, headache,
standard blood pressure variations even if requiring antihypertensive medication, constipation,
etc.) are within normal practice.      Chronic, underlying, disease-related conditions that remain
unchanged from baseline will not be considered as AEs. Exacerbations of underlying chronic
conditions will be assessed for "seriousness" and if they are determined to be "serious" using the
regulatory definition, will be reported as Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) on the appropriate
forms.
[0227]    Disability:    A substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life
functions.
[0228]    Life-threatening adverse event: Any adverse drug experience that, in the view of the
Investigator, places the subject at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it
does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.
[0229]    Unexpected adverse event: Any adverse drug experience, the specificity or severity of
which is not consistent with the current Investigator Brochure; or if an Investigator Brochure is
not required or available, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the risk
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application,
as amended. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue
of greater severity) if the Investigator Brochure or other product literature only referred to
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.      Similarly, cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by
virtue of greater specificity) if the Investigator Brochure only listed cerebral vascular accidents.
"Unexpected," as used in this definition, refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been
previously observed (e.g., included in the Investigator Brochure) rather than from the perspective
of such an experience not being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the
investigational product.
[0230]    Associated with the use of the Investigational drug (Causality i.e., investigational study
drug-related): There is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have been caused by the
                                                   74

investigational agent. The Principal Investigator must review each adverse event and determine
whether or not it is related to the investigational agent.
[0231]    Serious Adverse Events - An adverse event occurring at any dose (including overdose)
should be classified as SERIOUS if: (1) It resulted in death (i.e., the AE caused or led to death)
(2) It was life-threatening (i.e., the AE placed the subject at immediate risk of death; it does not
apply to an AE that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe) (3) It
required or prolonged in-subject hospitalization (i.e., the AE required at least a 24-hour in
subject hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization beyond the expected length of stay.
Hospitalizations for elective medical/surgical procedures, scheduled treatments, or routine
check-ups are not SAEs by this criterion)NOTE: The illness leading to the surgical or diagnostic
procedure should be recorded as the AE or SAE, not the procedure itself. The procedure should
be captured in the case narrative as part of the action taken in response to the illness.
[0232]    It was disabling (i.e., the AE resulted in a substantial disruption of the subject's ability
to carry out normal life functions)
[0233]    It is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a
subject exposed to the molecule or Investigational drug before conception or during pregnancy)
[0234]    It does not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject or may
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (i.e., is a
significant or important medical event)
 [0235]   Note: The causality of the serious Adverse Events must also be determined given that
the patients will be undergoing invasive surgical procedures that can in and of themselves lead to
untoward events or poor outcomes. Only those events deemed possibly or probably related to
the study drug will be considered as DLTs.
 [0236]   Serious adverse events will be captured from the time the patient signs consent until 30
days after the last dose of drug. Serious adverse events must be followed until clinical recovery

is complete and laboratory test have returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized,
or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.
[0237]    Safety
[0238]    All subjects who received any Delta-24-RGD-4C will be included in the safety
analysis. Subjects who do not complete the study for whatever reason will have all available
data up until the time of termination included in the safety analysis.
[0239]    Adverse events will be summarized both overall and by dose group and tabulated by
severity, relationship to Delta-24-RGD-4C and causality.          The number and percentage of
subjects experiencing adverse events will be tabulated by body system/preferred term both
overall and by dose group.      When an adverse event occurs more than once, the maximum
severity and causality will be counted. Additionally, serious adverse events, adverse events that
are possibly related to Delta-24-RGD-4C and adverse events that are unrelated to Delta-24
RGD-4C will be summarized separately.           Concurrent illnesses will be listed and may be
examined as possible confounders in the treatment response relationship.              Concomitant
medications and therapies will also be listed, as will previous treatments for malignant glioma.
Any potentially related side effects will be analyzed. Data listings for all adverse events will be
provided by subject.
[0240]    Vital Sign Measurements - Vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart rate,
respiratory rate and temperature) results will be presented in data listings by visit, dose cohort
and time interval, as appropriate. Summary data including univariate statistics of mean, standard
error and median will also be presented.
[0241]    Physical and Neurological Examinations/Performance Status - Physical findings will be
summarized for each subject by visit and dose cohort. Longitudinal analyses of tumor-related
neurological symptoms, performance status and weight may also be performed. Summary data
including univariate statistics of mean, standard error and median will also be presented as
appropriate.   Time to disease progression and performance status less than 60 will also be
evaluated.

[0242]    MRI Scans - MRI scans will be evaluated by the Investigator and descriptive statistics
will be reported. Results will be reported by subject visit and dose cohort and/or as appropriate.
[0243]    Clinical Laboratory Results - Descriptive statistics for selected laboratory parameters
will be presented overall and by subject by study day and dose group. For the same laboratory
parameters, shift tables may be presented showing the number and percent of subjects with high,
normal, and low (or normal/ abnormal) laboratory results at baseline and post-Delta-24-RGD-4C
injection by dose cohort. Group means, medians and standard errors will be calculated for the
various laboratory parameters.      Laboratory values will also be listed by subject and those
exceeding a normal reference range will be flagged.
[0244]    Efficacy
[0245]    In this study, tumor response will be evaluated according to the MacDonald criteria (i.e.
based on 2D measurements).        In order to be comparable to previously published studies, the
thresholds for partial response and progressive disease are 50% and 25%, respectively.
[0246]    Tumor response will be the change in the size of brain lesions from baseline (within 4
days post Delta-24-RGD-4C administration) compared to 7 days post Delta-24-RGD-4C
administration, 14, 21, 28 days, 2, 3 and 4 months and every two months thereafter following the
last injection of virus. Changes in clinical disease status and steroid administration will be
considered when reviewing changes in tumor size. Measurements obtained at these study time
points will also be analyzed with consideration of any anti-tumor cancer therapies and
timeframes administered. Brain tumor size will be calculated from MRI scans.
 [0247]   Subjects developing new rim enhancement in a previously non-enhancing area of the
tumor bed (e.g. as is commonly seen on post-gadolinium T1-weighted MRI beginning several
days after a gross total resection) will not be considered to have developed progressive disease
unless the maximum diameter of the enhancing rim exceeds 10 mm or an area of nodular
enhancement develops. In cases judged to be indeterminate by the PI, a stereotactic biopsy may
be performed to determine if progression has occurred. Additionally, measurement of the areas
                                                 77

of contrast enhancement will be determined and compared to the sum of the products of
perpendicular diameters of all lesions using WHO criteria.
[0248]    Time to disease progression will be calculated from the time of initiation of Delta-24
RGD-4C administration at tumor injection as well as resection until evidence of progression by
clinical exam, performance status, and/or MRI. The Investigators will read the MRI, as needed,
for the purpose of clinical assessment.
[0249]    Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize survival data. According to Brem et al,
the 6-month historical survival rate is 35% for subjects with recurrent malignant glioblastoma.
[0250]      The percentage of subjects with improved or stable symptoms at the end of the
injection of each study phase will also be summarized using 95% confidence intervals. The
change in Karnofsky score will also be summarized with univariate statistics. Time to disease
progression and KPS < 60 may also be evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier analytical method.
