        Field of The Invention
        The present invention is directed to carrier systems comprising ether-lipids
5       conjugated to one or more bioactive ligands (and exposed on the surface of
        the carrier system) for use in targeted delivery and/or antigen display
         systems, which carrier systems may comprise one or more further bioactive
         agents. The present invention is further directed to methods of their
         preparation and their uses in medical applications, such as targeted
10       delivery of said bioactive agents to specific tissues or cells and antigen
         display systems for the study, diagnosis, and treatment of traits, diseases
         and conditions that respond to said bioactive agents.
         Background of the Invention
 15      Molecular recognition, such as between receptor ligand , antigen-antibody,
         DNA-protein, sugar-lectin, RNA-ribosome, etc. is an important principle
         underlying many biological systems and is being applied to many artificially
         created biological systems for use in medical applications, such as in
         artificial (micro- or nano-) particulate systems including polymeric beads,
 20      vesicular lipids, microemulsions, and the like.
          One important example of a molecular recognition based application is the
          use of targeted delivery of diagnostic or therapeutic compounds, such as
          antiviral, chemotherapeutic or imaging agents, to specific sites, which
          allows to overcome the limitations associated with nonspecific delivery
 25       (such as in vivo clearance time, potential toxicity, problems associated with
          membrane transport of an agent and the like) and thus greatly increases
          their effectiveness. Various recognition-based strategies have been used to
          improve the delivery of compounds into the intracellular environment (i.e. to
          specific cell compartments) of a target cell to exert its biological activity, in
  30       particular delivery through specific transporters involving the use of
           biological or artificial carriers, such as viral vectors, cationic polymers, such

  WO 2013/135359                                                     PCT/EP2013/000698

       as polylysine, polyarginine and the like (see, e.g. WO 79/00515, WO
       98/52614), lipid carriers, and various other conjugate systems.
       One widely used approach involves the use of lipid vesicles as artificial
       carriers, e.g. liposomes and micelles, which have been extensively
5      developed and analyzed as drug delivery vehicles due to their ability to
       reduce systemic exposure of a bioactive agent, thereby overcoming
       problems associated with degradation, solubility, etc. and providing an
       increase in blood circulation times. Actively targeted delivery of a bioactive
       agent involves derivatizing the lipids of the lipid vesicle (either prior or after
10     vesicle formation) with a targeting ligand that serves to direct (or target) the
       vesicle to specific cell types such as cancer cells or cells specific to
        particular tissues and organs, such as hepatocytes, after in vivo
        administration (see, for example, US 6,316,024 and US 6,214,388; Allen et
        al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1237:99-108 (1995); Blume et al., Biochim.
15      Biophys. Acta, 1149:180- 184 (1993)). This may be accomplished by
        utilizing receptors that are overexpressed in specific cell types, which
        include for example folic acid receptor (FR) (overexpressed in a variety of
        neoplastic tissues, including breast, ovarian, cervical, colorectal, renal, and
        nasoparyngeal tumors), transferrin receptor (TfR) (overexpressed on
 20     metastatic and drug resistant cells of most carcinomas, sarcomas and
        some lymphomas and leukaemias), epidermal growth factor receptor
        (EGFR) (overexpressed in anaplastic thyroid cancer and breast, lung and
        colorectal tumors), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 and 2
        (VEGFR-1/2) (highly expressed on endothelial cells in tumor
 25      neovasculature), metastin receptor (overexpressed in papillary thyroid
        cancer), ErbB family receptor tyrosine kinases (overexpressed in a
         significant subset of breast cancers), human epidermal growth factor
         receptor-2 (Her2/neu) (overexpressed in breast cancers), tyrosine kinase
         18-receptor (c-Kit) (overexpressed in sarcomatoid renal carcinomas), HGF
 30      receptor c-Met (overexpressed in esophageal adenocarcinoma), CXCR4
         and CCR7 (overexpressed in breast cancer), endothelin-A receptor
         (overexpressed in prostate cancer), peroxisome proliferator activated

  WO 2013/135359                                                     PCT/EP2013/000698
                                               -3
        receptor delta (PPAR-delta) (overexpressed in most colorectal cancer
       tumors), PDGFR A (overexpressed in ovarian carcinomas), BAG-1
        (overexpressed in various lung cancers), soluble type Il TGF beta receptor
        (overexpressed in pancreatic cancer), asialoglycoprotein receptor
5       (overexpressed on hepatocytes), avP3 integrin receptor (overexpressed in
        growing tumor vascularture), legumain (a clan CD cysteine protease
        enriched in solid tumor tissue and overexpressed on TAMs, tumor
        associated macrophages), etc.
        Any agent which selectively binds to such a specific receptor cell or tissue
10      to be treated or assayed may be attached to a lipid vesicle and act as a
        targeting or receptor ligand. Typically, such targeting ligands have been
        attached to a lipid or lipid vesicle surface through a long chain (e.g.
         polymeric) linker. For example folic acid based conjugates have been used
        to provide a targeted delivery approach of a therapeutic compound useful
15      for the treatment and/or diagnosis of a disease, allowing a reduction in the
         required dose of therapeutic compounds (see e.g. WO 02/094185, US
         6,335,434, WO 99/66063, US 5,416016). Likewise, the use of galactose
         and galactosamine-based conjugates to transport exogenous compounds
         across cell membranes can provide a targeted delivery approach to the
 20      treatment of liver disease such as HBV and HCV infection or hepatocellular
         carcinoma while allowing a reduction in the required dose of therapeutic
         compounds required for treatment (see e.g. US 6,030,954,.
         Another important example of a molecular recognition based aplication is
         the use of antigen display systems which involve presentation of both "self'
 25       and "foreign" proteins (antigens) to the immune system to generate T cell
          activation, modulation or tolerance. The receptor ligand interactions in
          antigen-presenting systems that contribute to the desired immune response
          or absence thereof are complex and difficult to assess, being influenced by
          various parameters such as ligand densities, presence of coreceptors,
 30       receptor ligand affinities and surface conditions. Thus a widely used
          approach involved using naturally occurring human cells (or parts thereof)

  WO 2013/135359                                                     PCT/EP2013/000698
                                               -4
       whose primary function is antigen processing and presentation. But, while
        live cell based systems may be optimal for mimicking cell-cell interaction to
        achieve the desired induction of tolerance or immune response, they are
        dependent on a regulated expression of the surface molecules including
5       possibly expression of additional "costimulatory" and/or adhesion molecules
        on its surface membrane at a sufficient therapeutic level. Currently known
        artificial systems range from genetically engineered subcellular antigen
        presenting vesicles, which carry the molecules required for antigen
        presentation and T-lymphocyte activation or inhibition on their surface (WO
10      03/039594) to systems on the basis of cell-sized, biodegradable
        microspheres based, antigen presenting system (WO 07/087341).
         Clearly, there are still drawbacks to the above, molecular recognition based
        technologies and there remains a need in the art for a versatile and efficient
         artificial carrier system for use in molecular recognition based applications
 15      such as targeted delivery or antigen presentation, including simple and
         economic methods of their preparation.
         The present application provides conjugates comprising ether-lipids having
         one or more covalently attached bioactive ligands as well as various carrier
         systems comprising these conjugates (and optionally further comprising
 20      one or more bioactive agents), which allow to overcome the limitations
         described above.
          Summary of the Invention

 20
         As used herein, the term "bioactive" refers to an ability to elicit a biological
         response that is sought in a cell, tissue, system, and/or subject (including a
         human being). The term "biological response" refers to the physiological
          reaction of a cell to a stimulus, and thus could be any cellular, neurological,
 25      chemical, inflammatory, immunologic or pathologic biological response,
          process or reaction by the subject. The response, process or reaction can
          be chemical, cellular, neurological, psychological or the like.
          Thus, the term "bioactive ligand or bioactive ligand group" or simply "ligand"
          or "ligand group" as used herein refers to a ligand which elicits such a
  30      biological response and which is used for covalent attachment to an ether
          lipid of general formula I either directly or via a spacer group (using
          standard chemical coupling techniques). A bioactive ligand may be a

   WO 2013/135359                                                     PCT/EP2013/000698
                                                -9
        targeting ligand, an antigenic ligand, a therapeutic ligand or a diagnostic
        ligand.
        The term "bioactive agent" or simply "agent" as used herein refers to any
        synthetic or naturally occurring compound (in free form, salt form or
5        solvated or hydrated form) having a biological activity, such as a targeting
         agent, an antigenic agent, a therapeutic agent or a diagnostic agent,
         preferably a therapeutic agent or a diagnostic agent.
         It is understood that the definitions of the various bioactive agent groups
         and bioactive ligand groups may be overlapping.
10
         Thus, the expression "targeting" used in conjunction with "agent" or "ligand"
         (for uses in targeted delivery systems) refers to a compound which is
         capable of interacting with a complementary binding moiety at a desired
         location and/or under desired conditions. For example, complementary
 15      binding moieties can be ligands and anti-ligands (e.g. streptavidin and
         biotin, protein A or G and Fc region of immunoglobulins), ligands and
         receptors (e.g. small molecule ligands and their receptors, or sugar-lectin
         interactions), phage display-derived peptides, complementary nucleic acids
         (e.g. DNA hybrids, RNA hybrids, DNA/RNA hybrids, etc.), and aptamers.
 20      Other exemplary complementary binding moieties include, but are not
          limited to, moieties exhibiting complementary charges, hydrophobicity,
          hydrogen bonding, covalent bonding, Van der Waals forces, reactive
          chemistries, electrostatic interactions, magnetic interactions, etc.
         A "targeting ligand" or "targeting agent" specific for a particular receptor (a
 25       receptor agent or ligand) refers to any compound which is a specific binding
          partner of a specific binding pair, wherein the other binding partner is a
          receptor. The receptor may be present attached to a cell membrane or
          surface or in soluble form and may be present intracellularly and/or
          extracellularly in a subject, preferably a mammalian subject, e.g. a human
  30      or animal. Examples of a receptor include, without limitation, membrane
           receptors, soluble receptors, cloned or recombinant receptors, clan CD
           cysteine protease and other proteases and other enzymes, hormone

         of a receptor agent or ligand for use in the present invention will be
         determined by the nature of the disease, condition, or infection to be
          assayed and/or treated. Preferred receptor agents or ligands include
          vitamins (e.g. folic acid or fragments thereof), pteroic acid derivatives,

       The term "pteroyl" or "pteroic acid" as used herein represents a condensed
       pyrimidine heterocycle, which is linked to an aminobenzoyl moiety. As used
       herein a "condensed pyrimidine heterocycle" includes a pyrimidine fused
5      with a further 5- or 6-membered heterocycle, resulting in a pteridine or a
       pyrrolopyrimidine bicycle. Conjugation of a pteroyl group to one or more of
       the reactive sites on the headgroup of an ether lipid (N- or Y-group) will
       result in a folate structure, wherein the headgroup represents the glutamic
       acid part or a derivative thereof. Exemplary folate structures are based on a
10     folate skeleton, i.e. pteroyl-glutamic acid resp. N-[4-[[(2-amino-1,4-dihydro
       4-oxo-6-pteridinyl) methyl]amino]benzoyl]-L-g lutamic acid, and derivatives
       thereof. Such folate derivatives include folates having optional substituents
        on reactive or non-reactive sites and/or wherein selected atoms have been
        replaced, e.g. selected heteroatoms, preferably one or two, have been
 15     replaced by carbon atoms (such as in deaza and dideaza analogs).
        Examples are optionally substituted folic acid, folinic acid, pteropolyglutamic
        acid, and folate receptor-binding pteridines such as tetrahydropterins,
        dihydrofolates, tetrahydrofolates, and their deaza and dideaza analogs.
        Folic acid, 5-methyl-(6S)-tetrahydrofolic acid and 5-formyl-(6S)
 20     tetrahydrofolic acid are the preferred basic structures used for the
        compounds of this invention. The terms "deaza" and "dideaza" analogs
         refers to the art recognized analogs having a carbon atom substituted for
         one or two nitrogen atoms in the naturally occurring folic acid structure. For
         example, the deaza analogs include the 1-deaza, 3-deaza, 5-deaza, 8
 25      deaza, and 1O-deaza analogs. The dideaza analogs include, for example,
         1,5-dideaza, 5,10-dideaza, 8,10-dideaza, and 5,8-dideaza analogs.
         Preferred deaza analogs compounds include N-[4-[2-[(6R)-2-amino
         1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-4-oxopyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl]ethyl]benzoyl]-L
         glutamic acid (Lometrexol) and N-[4-[1-[(2,4-diamino-6
 30      pteridinyl)methyl]propyl]benzoyll-L-glutamic acid (Edatrexate). In each of
         the above folate structure the glutamic acid portion is the portion
         corresponding to the headgroup of the etherlipid and thus each of the

   WO 2013/135359                                                     PCT/EP2013/000698
                                               - 12
        above folate structures may also include the structures comprising the
        various glutamic acid derivatives corresponding to the headgroup.
        The term "peptide" as used herein represents an oligopeptide consisting of
5        1 to 30, preferably of 2 to 20, most preferably of 3 to 10 amino acids.
         Peptides are typically connected through their N-terminus, C-terminus
         and/or through their side chains to the reactive positions at the head group
         (i.e. N- and/or Y-group) of an ether-lipid. Peptides may contain disulfide
         bridges as well as ester linkages. Furthermore, peptides may bear
10       protecting groups at the N-terminus, C-terminus and in the side chains. The
         term "amino acid" includes natural occurring L-amino acids, D-amino acids,
         synthetic amino acids, beta amino acids and homologues thereof.
          Preferred peptides as defined above for use in the present application
          include e.g. cell-specific ligands such as the RGD-peptide, NGR-peptide,
 15      ATWLPPR-peptide, APRPG-peptide, SMSIARL-peptide, TAASGVRSMH
          peptide, LTLRWVGLMS-peptide, CDSDSDITWDQLWDLMK-peptide,
          GPLPLR-peptide, HWGF-peptide, and derivatives thereof (wherein the
          designation of the peptide is given in the single letter amino acid code),
          preferably the RGD peptide (i.e. the tripeptide amino acid sequence
 20       arginine-glycine-aspartic acid or Arg-Gly-Asp) and derivatives thereof.
          Derivatives of the RGD peptide include any structural modification to the
          peptide including a peptide containing the RGD sequence, as well as non
           peptidic compounds comprising the RGD peptide.
 25       The term "aza-peptide" as used herein refers to peptide analogs having a
           nitrogen atom substituted for one or more carbon atoms in the naturally
           occurring peptide structure. Aza-peptides typically consist of 1 to 30,
           preferably of 2 to 20, most preferably of 3 to 10 amino acids having a
           nitrogen atom substituted for at least one of the sp3-hybridized carbons,
  30       preferably for a carbon atom in alpha position of an amino acid, most
           preferably for the carbon atom in alpha position of the amino acid at the C
           terminus. Aza-peptides are connected through their N-terminus, C-terminus

  WO 2013/135359                                                     PCT/EP2013/000698
                                               - 13
        and/or through their side chains to the reactive positions at the head group
        (i.e. N- and/or Y-group) of the ether-lipid. Aza-peptides may contain
        disulfide bridges as well as ester linkages. Furthermore, aza-peptides may
        bear protecting groups at the N-terminus, C-terminus and in the side
5       chains. Preferred aza-peptides are derivatives of 2-azaasparagine, such as
        Cbz-alanylalanyl-2-azaasparagine (also known as RR1 1a) (Ekici et al.,
        2004, J. Med. Chem. 47, 1889-1892; WO 2012/031175 A9).
        In other embodiments a targeting agent or ligand may also represent or
10      comprise at least one blocking moiety. As used herein, the term "blocking
        moiety" refers to moieties which mask, block, cloak, and/or sterically inhibit
        the activity, self-recognition, and/or self-assembly of complementary
         binding moieties. For example, a blocking moiety is capable of blocking the
         ability of complementary binding moieties to interact with one another prior
 15     to a desired condition or time, when the blocking moiety is removed. A
         blocking moiety can include polymeric entities, such as polaxamines;
         poloxamers; polyethylene glycol (PEG); poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)(PLGA),
         peptides; synthetic polymers and the like.
 20      As used herein, the expression "antigen(ic)" used in conjunction with
         "agent" or "ligand" refers to a compound which provokes an immune
         response against itself or portions thereof. The term "immune response"
         refers to recognition of an antigen or parts thereof by an immune effector
         cell. This includes T cell mediated and/or B cell mediated immune
 25      responses that are influenced by modulation of T cell co-stimulation. The
         term immune response further includes immune responses that are
         indirectly effected by T cell activation such as antibody production (humoral
         responses) and the activation of other immune effector cells including, but
          not limited to, monocytes, macrophages, NK cells and cytotoxic T
 30       lymphocytes (CTLs), for example CTL lines, CTL clones, and CTLs from
         tumor, inflammatory, or other infiltrates. Certain diseased tissue express
          specific antigens and CTLs specific for these antigens have been identified.

  WO 2013/135359                                                     PCT/EP2013/000698

        For example, approximately 80% of melanomas express the antigen known
        as gp-1 00. One of the most effective and desirable procedures to prevent
        microbial infections and pathogenic processes and thus combat such
        diseases are vaccines, which cause a stimulation of an immune response
5       in a host organism prior to an actual infection or onset of a disease by
        introducing antigens or immunogens into the host organism.
        A skilled person will understand that any macromolecule, including virtually
        any biological molecule (proteins, peptides, lipids, lipoproteins, glycans,
        glycoproteins, nucleic acids derivatives, such as oligonucleotides,
10      polynucleotides, genomic or recombinant DNA) may serve as an antigen.
        An antigen may be synthesized chemically or biologically, or may be
        derived from recombinant or genomic DNA or can be derived from a
        biological sample, such as a tissue sample, a tumor sample, a cell or a
        biological fluid. Antigens may include, but are not limited to, viral antigens,
 15     bacterial antigens, fungal antigens, protozoal and other parasitic antigens,
        tumor antigens, antigens involved in autoimmune disease, addiction, allergy
        and graft rejection, and other miscellaneous antigens. Representative
        examples of an antigen may be a protein or peptide of bacterial, fungal,
         protozoan, or viral origin, or a fragment derived from these antigens, which
 20      include, but are not limited to, Streptococcus species, Candida species,
         Brucella species, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Pseudomonas
         species, Bordetella species, Clostridium species, Norwalkvirus, Bacillus
         anthracis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus
         (UV), Chlamydia species, human Papillomaviruses, Influenza virus,
 25      Paramyxovirus species, Herpes virus, Cytomegalovirus, Varicella-Zoster
         virus, Epstein-Barr virus,Hepatitis viruses, Plasmodium species,
         Trichomonas species, sexually transmitted disease agents, viral
         encephalitis agents, protozoan disease agents, fungal disease agents,
          bacterial disease agents, cancer cells, or mixtures thereof.
 30       Immunization of a subject may be enhanced by the use of multiple copies
          of an antigen as a multivalent display and is desirable in case of antigen
          ligands such as small peptides or carbohydrates, that are difficult to

  WO 2013/135359                                                         PCT/EP2013/000698

        administer and generally fail to elicit an effective immune response due to
        the hapten-related size issues. Thus, as used herein, the term "multivalent"
        refers to the display of more than one copy or type of antigen on a carrier
        system.
5       The term "antigen-presenting system" or "antigen display system" as used
         herein refers to a naturally occurring or synthetic system, which (i) can
         present at least one antigen (or part thereof) in such a way that the at least
         one antigen (or part thereof) can be recognized or bound by an immune
         effector molecule, e.g. a T-cell antigen receptor on the surface of a T cell,
10       or (ii) is capable of presenting at least one antigen (or part thereof) in the
         form of an antigen-MHC complex recognizable by specific effector cells of
         the immune system, and thereby inducing an effective cellular immune
         response against the antigen (or part thereof) being presented. In the
         context of the present invention, the term "recognized" refers to (i) a lipid
15       compound conjugated to at least one antigenic ligand (or a composition or
         formulation thereof) which is recognized and bound by an immune effector
         cell wherein such binding is sufficient to initiate an effective immune
          response, or to (ii) a lipid compound conjugated to at least one targeting
          ligand (or a composition or formulation thereof) which is recognized and
20        bound by its corresponding receptor or to a combination of both (a) and (b).
         Assays for determining whether a targeting or an antigenic ligand is
          recognized by a receptor or an immune effector cell, respectively, are
          known in the art and are described herein.
 25       As used herein, the expression "therapeutic" used in conjunction with
          ''agent" or "ligand" refers to a compound which is capable of exerting a
          biological effect in vitro and/or in vivo that is therapeutic in nature. A
          therapeutic ligand may be neutral or positively or negatively charged.
          Examples of suitable bioactive agents include pharmaceuticals and drugs,
 30       synthetic organic molecules, proteins, vitamins, steroids, siRNA, miRNA,
          adjuvants and genetic material.

       The term "genetic material" refers generally to nucleosides, nucleotides,
       and polynucleotides, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic
       acid (RNA). The genetic material may be made by synthetic chemical
        methodology known to one of ordinary skill in the art, or by the use of
5       recombinant technology, or by a combination of the two. The DNA and RNA
        may optionally comprise unnatural nucleotides and may be single or double
        stranded. "Genetic material" refers also to sense and anti-sense DNA and
        RNA, that is, a nucleotide sequence which is complementary to a specific
        sequence of nucleotides in DNA and/or RNA.
10
        The term "pharmaceutical" or "drug" refers to any therapeutic or
        prophylactic agent which is used in the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation,
        treatment or cure of a disease or injury in a patient. It is understood that the
        bioactive agents to be entrapped or embedded in the lipid compositions or
 15     attached to or adsorbed onto the surface of the lipid compositions of the
         invention are not restricted to any particular class of biologically active
         material in terms of physicochemical properties, molecular size or the
        source of origin, i.e. synthetic, biotechnological materials, etc. Thus the
         pharmaceutical may be, for example, chosen from any of the following
 20     therapeutic class: analgesic, anesthetic, anti-Alzheimer's, anti-asthma
         agent, anti-Parkinsonism, antiallergic, antianginal, antiarrhythmic,

        classes can be used in the previously mentioned compositions.
        As used herein, the expression "diagnostic" used in conjunction with "agent"
        or "ligand" refers to a compound which is capable of diagnosing the
10      presence or absence of a disease in a patient. The diagnostic agents may
         be neutral or positively or negatively charged. Examples of suitable
        diagnostic agents include, synthetic organic molecules and heavy metal
         complexes, such as contrast agents for use in connection with magnetic
         resonance imaging, ultrasound or computed tomography of a patient.
15
         The choice of a targeting or antigenic or therapeutic or diagnostic ligand or
         agent for use with the carrier systems of the present invention will be
         determined by the nature of the disease, condition, or infection to be
         assayed and/or treated.

         the invention, which comprise a linear, bifunctional amino acid at the head
          group, more specifically a 2-amino-alkanedioic acid (having up to six
          carbon atoms), such as aspartic acid, glutamic acid, etc., and which are
          conjugated at coupling sites of the head group to one or more bioactive
 30       ligands to form a "lipid-ligand conjugate". The term "ether-lipid (compound)"
          or "lipid (compound)" as used herein refers to the precursor, i.e. the
          corresponding lipid prior to conjugation to one or more bioactive ligands.

         The term "spacer" or "spacer group" (or groups S1, S2 , S 3) as used herein
         refers to a bivalent branched or unbranched chemical group which allows to
         link an ether-lipid of the invention to one or more bioactive ligands X1 , X2,
         X3 in sufficient distance to eliminate any undesired interaction between

        biological activity of the ligand (such as affinity binding of ligands to their
        target). Depending on the intended use of a conjugate of ether-lipid and
        bioactive ligand, the spacer groups may be of different length and may be
        (hydrolytically, enzymatically and chemically) stable or may include a
5       cleavable linkage. Cleavable linkages of the invention may be selected to
        be cleaved via any form of cleavable chemistry, e.g. chemical, enzymatic,
         hydrolytic and the like. Exemplary cleavable linkers include, but are not
         limited to, protease cleavable peptide linkers, nuclease sensitive nucleic
         acid linkers, lipase sensitive lipid linkers, glycosidase sensitive
10       carbohydrate linkers, pH sensitive linkers, hypoxia sensitive linkers, photo
         cleavable linkers, heat-labile linkers, enzyme cleavable linkers, ultrasound
         sensitive linkers, x-ray cleavable linkers, etc.
         It is understood that the spacers may or may not be end-group activated to
15       allow for linkage of the spacer modified compound of the invention to a
         further moiety, such as bioactive group.
         In specific embodiments, a "spacer group" (or groups S1, S2, S 3) represents
         a short spacer group or a long-chain spacer group selected from an
20       alkylene chain optionally comprising one or more of the groups selected
         from ketone, ester, ether, amino, amide, amidine, imide, carbamate or
         thiocarbamate functions, glycerol, urea, thiourea, double bonds or aromatic
          rings.
 25       More specifically, a short spacer group (or groups S1, S2 , S3) may be
          chosen from (C1-C12)alkyl, (C2-C12)alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl.
          A long-chain spacer group (or groups S1, S2 , S3 ) may be chosen from
          polymeric radicals of formula -W-(CH 2 -)k-W'-, wherein k is an integer
          between 13 and 3000, and W and W' are reactive groups able to react with
 30       amino, carboxyl, hydroxy or thio groups and wherein one or more of the
          non-adjacent CH 2 groups may independently be replaced by aryl,
          heteroaryl, -CH=CH-, -C=C-, or a hydrophilic (or polar) group selected from

  WO 2013/135359                                                     PCT/EP2013/000698

        CO-NR'-, -NR'-CO-NR'-, and -0-CO-0-, wherein R' represents hydrogen or
        (Cl-C12)alkyl. It is understood that replacing more than one non-adjacent
        CH 2 group by the same group may yield in polymeric chain having a
5       specific repeating unit (e.g. a polyester, polyether, polyimide, etc).
        Preferred spacer groups include hydrophilic polymeric radicals (with an
        increased affinity for aqueous solutions), i.e. polymers containing repeating
        structural units that comprise one or more of the above hydrophilic (or
        polar) groups in their alkylene backbone. Typical examples of hydrophilic
10      polymeric radicals include polyoxy(C2-C3)alkylenes (e.g. polyethylene glycol
        (PEG) or polypropylene glycol (PPG)), polysaccharides (e.g. dextran,
        pullulan, chitosan, hyaluronic acid), polyamides (e.g. polyamino acids,
        semisynthetic peptides and polynucleotides); polysialic acid, polyesters
        (e.g. polylactide (PLA), polylactid-co-glycolid (PLGA)), polycarbonates,
 15     polyethyleneimines (PEI), polyimides polyvinyl acetate (PVA).
        A preferred spacer is "PEG" or "polyethylene glycol", which encompasses
        any water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide). Typically, "PEG" means a polymer
        that contains a majority, e.g. > 50%, of subunits that are -CH    2CH 20-.
         Different forms of PEG may differ in molecular weights, structures or
 20     geometries (e.g., branched, linear, forked PEGs, multifunctional, and the
         like). PEGs for use in the present invention may preferably comprise one of
         the two following structures: "-O(CH2CH20)m-" or "
         CH 2CH 2 (CH 2CH 2 )m-CH 2CH2-," where m is 3 to 3000, and the
         terminal groups and architecture of the overall PEG may vary. As indicated
 25      above, depending on its use, PEG may be in end-capped form. When PEG
         is defined as "-O(CH2CH 20)m-" the end capping group is generally a
         carbon-containing group typically comprised of 1-20 carbons and is
         preferably alkyl (e.g., methyl, ethyl or benzyl) although saturated and
         unsaturated forms thereof, as well as aryl, heteroaryl, cyclyl, heterocyclyl,
 30      and substituted forms of any of the foregoing are also envisioned. When
         PEG is defined as "-C     2 H 2 0(CH 2CH 2 O)m-CH 2CH 2-", the end capping
         group is generally a carbon-containing group typically comprised of 1-20

                                             - 32
        carbon atoms and an oxygen atom that is covalently bonded to the group
        and is available for covalently bonding to one terminus of the PEG. In this
        case, the group is typically alkoxy (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy or benzyloxy) and
        with respect to the carbon-containing group can optionally be saturated and
5       unsaturated, as well as aryl, heteroaryl, cyclyl, heterocyclyl, and substituted
        forms of any of the foregoing. The other ("non-end-capped") terminus is
        typically a hydroxyl, amine or an activated group that can be subjected to
        further chemical modification when PEG is defined as "
        CH 2 CH 2 O(CH 2CH 20)m-CH2CH 2-"       In addition, the end-capping group can
10      also be a silane.
        A review for the preparation of various end-group functionalized or
        activated PEG is known in the art (see for example Zalipsky S., Bioconjug.
        Chem., 6,150-165 (1995)).

         Methods for conjugating a bioactive ligand (X1 and/or X2 and/or X 3) to an
        ether-lipid (i.e. compounds of formula I wherein X 1, X2 , X3 are H) include
         covalent binding of one or more bioactive ligands X1, X2 , X3 to one or more
         of the reactive positions at the head group (i.e. N- and/or Y-group) of one or
20       more individual ether-lipid. Thus, one bioactive ligand may be attached to
         one or more sites of one individual ether-lipid or to more than one site of
         more than one individual ether-lipid. Alternatively, two or three bioactive
         ligands are attached to the coupling sites of one individual ether-lipid. The
         one or more bioactive groups maybe attached directly to the ether-lipid or
 25      via a spacer group.
         Typically, methods for linking may generally include the steps of:
         a) providing a lipid compound of formula 1,wherein X1 , X2 , X3 are H,
         carrying one or more coupling sites on one or more of groups S1, S2 , S 3 ,

         with the one or more coupling sites, and

        c) reacting the lipid compound with the antigen to obtain a ligand-lipid
        conjugate.
        The term "coupling site" or "coupling group", as used herein, refers to a
5       reactive or functional group capable of reacting with a corresponding
        reactive or functional group (or two coupling partners) in a coupling reaction
        to form a covalent bond (C-C, C-0, C-N, C-S-linkage).
        The choice of conjugation (or coupling) method depends on various factors,
        such as the nature of the bioactive ligand to be attached, i.e. physical
10      attributes (e.g. size, charge, etc.), the nature of the reactive groups present
        on the bioactive ligand, and the like.
         In some embodiments, conjugation is carried out in the presence of a
         bifunctional agent (i.e., an agent with two functional (end)groups),
         preferably a heterobifunctional agent (i.e., an agent with two different
 15     functional (end)groups). The use of such a (hetero)bifunctional agent
         results in a lipid-ligand conjugate wherein lipid and ligand may be directly
         linked to each other or separated by a spacer. Typical functional groups
         include, but are not limited to, groups such as succinimidyl esters,
         maleimides, and pyridyldisulfides. In some embodiments, the bifunctional
 20      agent is selected from, but not limited to, e.g., carbodiimides, N
         hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidosalicylic acid (NHS-ASA), dimethyl
         pimelimidate dihydrochloride (DMP), dimethylsuberimidate (DMS), 3,3'
         dithiobispropionimidate (DTBP), N-Succinimidyl 3-[2-pyridyldithio]
         propionamido (SPDP), succimidyl a-methylbutanoate, biotinamidohexanoyl
 25      6-amino-hexanoic acid N-hydroxy-succinimide ester (SMCC), succinimidyl
          [(N-maleimidopropionamido)-dodecaethyleneglycol]ester (NH S-PEO12),
          N-succinimidyl (4-iodoacetyl) aminobenzoate (SIAB), N-succinimidyl S
          acetylthioacetate (SATA), m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester
          (MBS) and N-0L-maleimidobutyryloxy-succinimide ester (GMBS),
 30       succinmidyl dicarbonyl pentane or disuccinimidyl suberate. In other
          embodiments, the bifunctional agent is Traut's Reagent 2-iminothiolane in
          combination with SPDP. In still a further embodiment the linker is. In a

       further embodiment, the bifunctional agent is selected among those
        disclosed in The Pierce Products Catalogue (Pierce Chemical Company,
        USA) and the Double Agents TM Cross-Linking Reagents Selection Guide
        (Pierce Chemical Company), which are herein incorporated by reference.
5       Preferred conjugation methods include carbodiimide-mediated amide
        formation and active ester maleimide-mediated amine and sulfhydryl
        coupling, and the like.
        For example, a thiol-containing molecule may be reacted with an amine
        containing molecule using a heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent, e.g., a
10      reagent containing both a succinimidyl ester and either a maleimide, a
         pyridyldisulfide, or an iodoacetamide. Amine-carboxylic acid and thiol
        carboxylic acid cross-linking, maleimide-sulfhydryl coupling chemistries
         (e.g., the maleimidobenzoyl-N-hyd roxysuccinimide ester (MBS) method),
         etc., may be used.
15       Polypeptides can conveniently be conjugated to an etherlipid via amine or
        thiol groups in lysine or cysteine side chains respectively, or by an N
         terminal amino group. Likewise, oligonucleotides can conveniently be
         conjugated to an etherlipid through a unique reactive group on the 3' or 5'
         end, e.g. a sulfhydryl, amino, phosphate group or the like. Reactive
20       sulfhydryl groups may be coupled to a lipid of formula I having a free amino
         group (e.g. groups N and Y) through the use of reagents such as (i) N
         succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) and long chain SPDP (Ic
         SPDP) yielding a cleavable disulfide bond between the lipid and the
         oligonucleotide or polypeptide, or (ii) succinimidyl-iodoacetate to produce
 25      non-cleavable bonds between the lipid and oligonucleotide or polypeptide.
         These and other conjugation techniques are known in the art (see e.g. U.S.
          Pat. No. 5,512,439; WO 01/22995; Greg Hernanson "Bioconjugate
         Techniques," Academic Press, 1996; Gordon Bickerstaff "Immobilization of
          Enzymes and Cells," Humana Press, 1997).
 30      A skilled person will know which functional group or functional groups (e.g.,

        occur with a bioactive ligand according to the above described conjugation
        methods.
        Additional general information on conjugation methods can be found e.g. in
        "Cross-Linking," Pierce Chemical Technical Library, available at the Pierce
5       web site and originally published in the 1994-95 Pierce Catalog, and

        Molar ratios to be used in conjugating one or more ligands to an ether-lipid
10      compound of formula I may be readily optimized by a skilled person.
        Typically, it may range from about 1:1 to about 10:1 lipid compound to
        ligand.
         In the general method presented above, any suitable method may be used
        to purify an intermediate conjugated compound, such as by preparative
15       reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC), by membrane filtration, such as
         ultrafiltration or diafiltration. Unreacted reactants may be removed by size
        exclusion chromatography, such as gel filtration, or equilibrium dialysis. The
        final conjugate may also be purified using any suitable means, including for
         instance gel filtration, membrane filtration, such as ultrafiltration, or ion
20       exchange chromatography, or a combination thereof.
         The lipid-ligand conjugates of the invention are particularly suitable for use
         in the preparation of lipidic or nanoparticulate carrier systems, such as
         liposomes, micelles and nanoparticles.
 25      B. Lipidic carrier systems
         In a further aspect the invention is directed to a lipidic carrier system
         comprising one or more lipid-ligand conjugates of the invention optionally in
         combination with other co-lipids.
          Exemplary lipidic carrier systems preferably include lipid(ic) vesicles. The
 30      term "lipid(ic) vesicle" (or present vesicles or vesicles of the invention) is
          used interchangeably with the expression lipidic carrier systems and refers
         to a spherical entity which is characterized by the presence of an internal

  WO 2013/135359                                                      PCT/EP2013/000698
                                                - 36
       void. Typically, vesicles of the invention are formed from one or more lipid
        ligand conjugates optionally in combination with other synthetic or naturally
        occurring lipids (co-lipids). In any given vesicle of the invention, the lipids
        may be in the form of a monolayer or a bilayer. In the case of more than
5       one mono- or bilayer, the mono- or bilayers are generally concentric. The
        present vesicles include such entities commonly referred to as liposomes
        (i.e. a vesicle including one or more concentrically ordered lipid bilayer(s)
        with an internal void), micelles (i.e. a vesicle including a single lipid
        monolayer with an internal void), and the like. Thus, the lipids may be used
10      to form a unilamellar vesicle (comprised of one monolayer or bilayer), an
        oligolamellar vesicle (comprised of about two or about three monolayers or
        bilayers) or a multilamellar vesicle (comprised of more than about three
        monolayers or bilayers).
        The internal void of the vesicles are generally filled with a liquid, including,
 15     for example, an aqueous liquid, a gas, a gaseous precursor, and/or a solid
         material, including, for example, one or more bioactive agents, see also
         hereinafter.
         In some embodiments the ligand of the lipid-ligand conjugate is a targeting
         ligand (to yield a targeted lipidic carrier system or targeted liposome). In
 20      other embodiments the ligand of the lipid-ligand conjugate is an antigenic
         ligand (to yield an antigenic lipidic carrier system or antigenic liposome).
         Thus the present invention is specifically directed towards a targeted lipid
         vesicles (such as a targeted liposome or micelle), comprising a lipid-ligand
         conjugate of formula 1,wherein one or more of groups X 1, X2 , X3 are a
 25      targeting ligand, optionally in combination with other co-lipids.
         Alternatively, the present invention is specifically directed towards an
         antigenic lipid vesicles (such as an antigenic liposome or micelle),
         comprising a lipid-ligand conjugate of formula I, wherein one or more of
         groups X1, X2 , X3 are an antigenic ligand, optionally in combination with
 30       other co-lipids.
          In specific embodiments the present invention is also directed towards a
          mixed lipid vesicles (such as a mixed liposome or micelle), comprising a

  WO 2013/135359                                                       PCT/EP2013/000698
                                                - 37
        lipid-ligand conjugate of formula 1,wherein one or more of groups X1, X2 , X 3
        are an antigenic ligand and a targeting ligand, optionally in combination with
        other co-lipids.
        In specific embodiments the lipid vesicles of the invention (i.e. targeted,
5       antigenic or mixed) further comprise one or more bioactive agents, such as
        a therapeutic or a diagnostic or an antigenic agent, preferably a therapeutic
        or a diagnostic agent, either (a) enclosed within the internal void of the lipid
        vesicles of the invention, (b) integrated within the layer(s) or wall(s) of the
        lipid vesicles of the invention, for example, by being interspersed among
10      lipids which are contained within the layer(s) or wall(s) of the lipid vesicles
        of the invention, or (c) exposed on the surface of the lipid vesicles of the
        invention, whereby the surface exposure is achieved through various
        chemical interactions, such as electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding,
        van der Waal's forces or covalent bonding resulting in attachment or
15      adsorption and the like..
        A skilled person will understand that all combinations are contemplated
        within this invention, such as a targeted lipid vesicle comprising an
         enclosed antigenic agent, etc.
         In specific embodiments the lipid vesicles of the invention comprising an
20       antigenic ligand and/or agent may further comprise one or more, preferably
         one adjuvant either (a) enclosed within the internal void of said lipid
         vesicles, (b) integrated within the layer(s) or wall(s) of said lipid vesicles, for
         example, by being interspersed among lipids which are contained within the
         layer(s) or wall(s) of said lipid vesicles, or (c) exposed on the surface of
 25      said lipid vesicles, whereby its surface exposure is achieved through
         various chemical interactions, such as electrostatic interactions, hydrogen
         bonding, van der Waal's forces or covalent bonding.
          Preferably, the one or more adjuvants are enclosed within the internal void.
         The term "co-lipid" or "vesicle-forming (co-)lipid" as used herein refers to
 30       lipids which may optionally be present as additional lipids in the lipid
         vesicles of the invention and may include acyclic and cyclic, saturated or
          unsaturated lipids of natural or synthetic origin. As used herein a co-lipid

       the route of administration.
        In one embodiment a lipid vesicle of the invention may comprise lipid-ligand
        conjugates of the invention and other vesicle-forming lipids (co-lipids)
5       preferably in a ratio from 1:1'000 to 1:1, preferably 1:500 to 1:50.
        In further embodiments of the invention, the lipid vesicles may comprises
        one or more lipid-ligand conjugates wherein the ether-lipid of the conjugate
        comprises unsaturated hydrocarbon chains, which may be crosslinked or
        polymerized to form polymerized lipid vesicles.
10
        As used herein, the term "polymerized lipid vesicles" and (in particular a
        polymerized liposome) means a lipid vesicle in which the constituent lipids
        are covalently bonded to each other by intermolecular interactions. The
         lipids can be bound together within a single layer of the lipid bilayer (the
15       leaflets) and/or bound together between the two layers of the bilayer.
         Polymerizing the lipid layer structure makes the assembly dramatically
         more resistant to enzymatic breakdown by acids, bile salts or enzymes
         present in vivo. In addition, controlling the degree of polymerization and the
         degradation rate (by choosing specific ratios of lipid-ligand conjugates
20       having cleavable or polymerizable hydrocarbon chains), the stability as well
         as "leakiness" (by generating pores of a desired size) can be tuned
         according to the desired escape rate of an optionally enclosed bioactive
         agent. Thus the design of a lipid vesicle allows modulating the optimal
         escape rate of e.g. any encapsulated antigen agent at specific immune
 25      uptake sites, or any encapsulated therapeutic agent at specific tissue or cell
         sites, etc.
         As those skilled in the art will recognize, lipidic carrier systems in form of
         vesicles such as liposomes, micelles, or other vesicles, may be readily
          prepared from lipid-ligand conjugates of the invention using standard
 30       conditions known in the art.
          Depending on the desired physical properties, lipid vesicles may be
          prepared from lipid-ligand conjugates optionally in combination with one or

        more co-lipids including stabilizing lipids. The particular stabilizing
        compounds which are ultimately combined with the present lipid-ligand
        conjugates may be selected as desired to optimize the properties of the
        resulting lipid vesicles (and are readily identifiable by one skilled in the art
5       without undue experimentation).
        Micellar compositions according to the invention may be prepared using
        any one of a variety of conventional micellar preparatory methods which will
        be apparent to those skilled in the art. These methods typically involve
        suspension of a lipid-ligand conjugate in an organic solvent, evaporation of
10      the solvent, resuspension in an aqueous medium, sonication and
        centrifugation. The foregoing methods, as well as others, are discussed, for
        example, in Canfield et al., Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 189, pp. 418-422

 25      micellar compositions, in addition to those exemplified above, would be
         apparent to one skilled in the art based on the present disclosure.
         Liposomal compositions of the invention are particularly preferred as they
         are particularly effective as carriers for the delivery of bioactive agents to
         tissues and cells or as antigen presenting carriers.
 30       Liposomal compositions may comprise one or more lipid-ligand conjugates
         optionally in combination with one or more further co-lipids and/or one or
          more stabilizing compounds. The lipid-ligand conjugates (and co-lipids)

        may be in the form of a monolayer or bilayer, and the mono- or bilayer lipids
        may be used to form one or more mono- or bilayers. In the case of more
        than one mono- or bilayer, the mono- or bilayers are generally concentric.
        Thus, the lipid-ligand conjugates (and co-lipids) may be used to form a
5       unilamellar liposome (comprised of one monolayer or bilayer), an
        oligolamellar liposome (comprised of two or three monolayers or bilayers)
        or a multilamellar liposome (comprised of more than three monolayers or
        bilayers).
        The selection of suitable co-lipids and stabilizing compounds in the
10      preparation of liposomal lipid compositions of the invention would be
        apparent to a person skilled in the art and can be achieved without undue
        experimentation, based on the present disclosure.
         Other materials for use in the preparation of liposomal lipid compositions of
        the invention, in addition to those exemplified above, would be apparent to
15       one skilled in the art based on the present disclosure.
         The amount of stabilizing material, such as, for example, additional
         amphipathic compound, which is combined with the present lipid-ligand
         conjugates may vary depending upon a variety of factors, including the
         specific lipid-ligand conjugate(s) of the invention selected, the specific
 20      stabilizing material(s) selected, the particular use for which it is being
         employed, the mode of delivery, and the like. The amount of stabilizing
         material to be combined with the present lipid-ligand conjugates and the
         ratio of stabilizing material to lipid-ligand conjugates, will vary and is readily
         determinable by one skilled in the art based on the present disclosure.
 25      Typically ratios higher than about 4:1, 3:1 or 2:1, of lipid-ligand conjugate to
         stabilizing lipid, are preferred.
         A wide variety of methods are available in connection with the preparation
         of liposomal compositions of the invention. Accordingly, the liposomes may
         be prepared using any one of a variety of conventional liposome
 30      preparatory techniques which will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
         These techniques include ethanol injection, thin film technique,
          homogenizing, solvent dialysis, forced hydration, reverse phase

        evaporation, microemulsification and simple freeze-thawing, Using e.g.
        conventional microemulsification equipment. Additional methods for the
        preparation of liposomal compositions of the invention from the lipid-ligand
        conjugates of the present invention include, for example, sonication,
5       chelate dialysis, homogenization, solvent infusion, spontaneous formation,
        solvent vaporization, controlled detergent dialysis, and others, each
        involving the preparation of liposomes in various ways. Typically, methods
        which involve ethanol injection, thin film technique, homogenizing and
        extrusion are preferred in connection with the preparation of liposomal
10      compositions of the invention from the lipid-ligand conjugates of the present
        invention.
        The size of the liposomes can be adjusted, if desired, by a variety of
        techniques, including extrusion, filtration, sonication and homogenization.
        Other methods for adjusting the size of the liposomes and for modulating
15      the resultant liposomal biodistribution and clearance of the liposomes would
        be apparent to one skilled in the art based on the present disclosure.
        Preferably, the size of the liposomes is adjusted by extrusion under
        pressure through pores of a defined size. The liposomal compositions of
        the invention may be of any size, preferably less than about 200 nanometer
20      (nm) in outside diameter.
        As those skilled in the art will recognize, any of the lipid-ligand conjugates
         and lipidic carrier systems comprising the lipid-ligand conjugates of the
         invention may be lyophilized for storage, and reconstituted in, for example,
         an aqueous medium (such as sterile water or phosphate buffered solution,
 25      or aqueous saline solution), preferably under vigorous agitation. If
         necessary, additives may be included to prevent agglutination or fusion of
         the lipids as a result of lyophilisation. Useful additives include, without
         limitation, sorbitol, mannitol, sodium chloride, glucose, trehalose,
         polyvinylpyrrolidone and poly(ethylene glycol), for example, PEG 400.

        Nanoparticulate carrier systems may exist in any shape and any
       morphology. Examples of nanoparticulate carrier systems include
        nanoparticles, nanopowders, nanoclusters, nanocrystals, nanospheres,
        nanofibers, nanotubes and other geometries. Nanoparticulate vesicular
5       compositions or nanoparticles are typically small particles having typically a
        diameter of less than 1 micron, preferably in the range of about 25-1000
        nm, more preferably in the range of about 50-300nm, most preferably in the
        range of about 60-200 nm. A nanosphere refers to a type of nanoparticle
        that is approximately spherical in shape and has a hollow core. Typically,
10      nanoparticles have a matrix core structure which may be formed using all
        types of materials and structures, including inorganic materials, such as
        metals, and organic materials, such as polymers including physiologically
        acceptable polymers. Non-limiting examples of such polymers include, for
        example, polyesters (such as poly(lactic acid), poly(L-lysine), poly(glycolic
15      acid) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)), poly(lactic acid-co-lysine), poly(lactic
         acid-graft-lysine), polyanhydrides (such as poly(fatty acid dimer),

         poly(cyanoacrylates), poly(styrenes), poly(vinyl chloride), polyvinyl fluoride),
 25      polyvinyl imidazole), chlorosulfonated polyolefins, polyethylene oxide,
         copolymers, polystyrene, and blends or co-polymers thereof. The

          polyethylenimine, chitosan, chitin, dextran sulfate, heparin, chondroitin
 30       sulfate, gelatin, etc. as well as their derivatives, co-polymers, and mixtures
          thereof. A non-limiting method for making nanoparticles is described e.g. in
          U.S. Publication 2003/0138490. In another embodiment the core material

  WO 2013/135359                                                     PCT/EP2013/000698
                                              -45
        may be selected from metals, alloys, metalloids, metal compounds such as
        metal oxides, inorganic compounds, and carbon-based materials, in
        particular carbon nanotubes, one- dimensional nanoparticles of fullerene
        C60, and three-dimensional nanoparticles of fullerene C70 . Suitable
5       examples of metals include, but are not limited to, noble or a platinum metal
        such as Ag, Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir, Ru, and Os, transition metals such as Ti, Cr,
        Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ta, W, Re, and main group metals such
        as Al, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Sn, Sb, Bi, Te. It will be appreciated that some main
        group metals, in particular Si and Ge, are also commonly referred to as
10      metalloids. Suitable examples of alloys include, but are not limited to, alloys
        of noble or platinum metal and transition metals, in particular alloys of silver
        and transition metals such as Ag/Ni, Ag/Cu, Ag/Co, and platinum and
        transition metals such as Pt/Cu, or noble or platinum alloys such as Ru/Pt.
        Non-limiting examples of inorganic compounds include, but are not limited,
 15     to Si0 2 , metal compounds, in particular metal oxides such as TiO 2 and iron
        oxides. Nanoparticles may also comprise intrinsic fluorescent or
         luminescent moieties, plasmon resonant moieties, and magnetic moieties,
        which provide such nanoparticles with detectable electrical, magnetic,
         and/or optical properties.
 20     A skilled person will know that the choice of material may depend on the
         intended use of the nanoparticle.
         In one embodiment, the invention is directed towards a nanoparticle
         comprising one or more lipid-ligand conjugates. The one or more lipid
         conjugates may be entangled, embedded, incorporated, encapsulated,
 25      adsorbed or bound to the surface, or otherwise associated with the
         nanoparticle.
          In one specific embodiment the lipid-ligand conjugate may be associated to
         a nanoparticle in form of a coating, through intermolecular forces such as
         Van-der-Waals forces, ionic interactions, hydrophobic interactions,
 30       optionally in combination with other co-lipids.
         Alternatively, nanoparticles may optionally include one or more functional
          groups, such as, for example, a carboxyl, sulhydryl, hydroxyl, or amino

  WO 2013/135359                                                     PCT/EP2013/000698
                                              -46
       group, for covalently linking one or more lipid-ligand conjugates (or other
        compounds, such as spacers) to the surface of the nanoparticles, optionally
        in combination with other co-lipids.
        Nanoparticles of the invention may also be grouped together (optionally
5       with a dispersing agent) to form a nanocluster. The independent formulation
        of each nanoparticle type before cluster formation and a special
        arrangement of nanoparticles within the cluster may allow controlling the
        retention and concentration of a lipid-ligand conjugate and thus of the
        bioactive agent.
10      In some embodiments, the nanoparticles may further comprise an
        additional bioactive agent entrapped, embedded, or encapsulated within the
        solid matrix core of the nanoparticle.
         In preferred embodiments, the lipid-ligand coated nanoparticles may be
        formed from nanosized core particles and one or more lipid-ligand
15       conjugates of the present invention and optionally one or more co-lipids. In
         any given lipid-ligand coated nanoparticle, the lipid-ligand conjugates may
         be in the form of a monolayer or a bilayer. In the case of more than one
         mono- or bilayer, the mono- or bilayers are generally concentric. Coating of
         the nanoparticles is preferably carried out in a solution comprising the lipid
20       ligand conjugates of the invention and by allowing sufficient time to allow
         the lipid-ligand conjugates to coat the nanoparticles.
         In some embodiments, the one or more ligands of the one or more lipid
         ligand conjugates are one or more antigenic ligands.
         The amount of antigenic ligand per nanoparticle (or surface density of the
 25      antigenic ligand) to induce an immune response depends on many factors,
         such as the nature of the immune response itself (humoral vs. cell
          mediated), the immunogenicity of the antigen ligand, the immunogenic
          constitution of the challenged organism, and the administration route and
          duration of exposure to the antigen.
 30       Clearly, immunization of a subject may be enhanced by the use of multiple
          copies of an antigen as a multivalent display thereby increasing site
          specifically antigen concentration and thus inducing a long-lasting immune

  WO 2013/135359                                                      PCT/EP2013/000698
                                                 -47
        responses. It is particularly desirable in case of antigen ligands such as
       small peptides or carbohydrates, that are difficult to administer and
       generally fail to elicit an effective immune response due to the hapten
        related size issues.
5       Thus, in some embodiments the nanoparticle displays single or multiple
        copies of one antigen ligand or a combination of different antigen ligands on
        its surface (in form of a multivalent display). As used herein, the term
        "multivalent" refers to the display of more than one copy or type of antigen
        on a carrier system.
10      More specifically, the present invention relates to a nanoparticle comprising
        a solid core which is coated by at least one lipid-ligand conjugate of formula
         1,wherein one or more of X1, X2 , X3 are an antigenic ligand, and optionally
        other matrix or co-lipids.
         Immunization may be further improved by including targeting ligands to
15       direct the nanoparticle to the appropriate immune cell or location.
         Compounds which may act as targeting ligands are compounds that
         interfere with the adherence of pathogens to host cells and thus successful
         colonization. Examples of such compounds may include the tetanus toxoid;
         P pili of E. coli; type IV pili of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria species,
20       Moraxella species, EPEC, or Vibrio cholerae; fimbrial genes and several a
         fimbrial adhesins, including FHA, pertactin, pertussis toxinand BrkA of
         Bordetella pertussis; and SipB-D of Salmonella typhimurium;and the
         adenovirus adhesion; the Reovirus sigma-1 protein which targets the M
         cell.
 25      Thus, the invention also refers to a nanoparticle comprising a solid core
         which is coated by at least one lipid-ligand conjugate of formula 1,wherein
          one or more of X1, X2 , X3 are an antigenic ligand and/or a targeting ligand,
          and optionally other matrix or co-lipids.
          In other embodiments a lipid-ligand coated nanoparticle further comprises a
 30       single antigenic agent or a combination of antigenic agents (multivalent)
          enclosed or embedded within the solid core of the nanoparticle.

  WO 2013/135359                                                      PCT/EP2013/000698

       Thus, the invention also refers to a nanoparticle comprising a solid core,
       which is coated by at least one lipid-ligand conjugate of formula 1,wherein
       one or more of X1, X2 , X3 are an antigenic ligand and/or a targeting ligand,
        and optionally other matrix or co-lipids, and wherein the solid core
5       optionally comprises one or more further antigenic agents.
        In yet other embodiments the nanoparticle further comprises one or more
        adjuvants enclosed, embedded or dispersed within the solid core of the
        nanoparticle.
        As used herein the term "adjuvant" refers to any material capable of
10      enhancing a humoral and/or cellular immune response to a specific antigen.
        Suitable adjuvants may be displayed on the surface of a nanoparticle,
        intercalated into a nanoparticle wall or encapsulated into a nanoparticle
        interior. Examples of adjuvants that may be used to promote the production
        of serum and/or mucosal antibodies as well as cell-mediated immune
 15     responses against co-administered antigens include E. coli heat-labile
        enterotoxin holotoxin (LT) and Vibrio cholerae enterotoxin (CT) as well as
        the KPL adjuvant (derived from the cell wall of Salmonella Minnesota).
        As used herein, the terms "displayed" or "surface exposed" refer to any
         ligand that is present at the external surface of a carrier system such as a
20       lipidic vesicle or a nanoparticle and thus is accessible for recognition.
        A variety of diseases and disorders may be treated by such nanoparticle
         vaccine constructs or assemblies, including: inflammatory diseases,
         infectious diseases, cancer, genetic disorders, organ transplant rejection,
         autoimmune diseases and immunological disorders.
 25      Thus the invention also encompasses a vaccine comprising multivalent
         nanoparticles comprising a solid core and one or more surface exposed
         lipid-ligand conjugates, wherein the ligand is one or more antigenic and/or
         targeting ligands, further optionally comprising an adjuvant and/or a further
         antigenic agent embedded in the solid core of the nanoparticles.
 30       In further embodiments, the one or more ligands of the one or more lipid
          ligand conjugates are one or more therapeutic or diagnostic agent.

       Methods of production of a nanoparticle of the invention comprising a
       surface exposed lipid-ligand conjugate include the steps of (a) providing a
       nanoparticle and (b) associating the one or more lipid-ligand conjugates to
       the nanoparticle through adsorption or attachment to form a lipid-ligand
5      coated nanoparticle. Alternatively the methods include the steps of (a)
        providing a nanoparticle, (b) associating the one or more ether-lipids to the
        nanoparticle through adsorption or attachement to form a lipid-coated
        nanoparticle and (c) covalently linking the one or more bioactive ligands to
        the one or more ether-lipids associated with the surface of the nanoparticle
10      to form a lipid-ligand coated nanoparticle. The (preformed) lipid-coated
        nanoparticles are part of an application filed concurrently, which is
        incorporated herein in its entirety.
        Typical methods to fabricate nanoparticles of suitable size include
        vaporization methods (e.g., free jet expansion, laser vaporization, spark
 15     erosion, electro explosion and chemical vapor deposition), physical
        methods involving mechanical attrition (e.g., the pearimilling technology,
         Elan Nanosystems, Ireland), and interfacial deposition following solvent
        displacement.
         In further embodiments, the invention is also directed towards a
 20      nanosphere comprising one or more lipid-ligand conjugates. As opposed to
         a nanoparticle, a nanosphere as a hollow interior, which may easily be used
         to enclose and subsequently deliver one or more bioactive agents to cells
         or tissues of interest. The release rate of such encapsulated bioactive
         agent(s) can be modulated, for example, by known techniques.

       therapeutic effect to be achieved.
        By way of general guidance, the ratio of lipid-ligand conjugate in the carrier
        system will vary from between 0.05 to 5 mole %, with a ratio of 0.1 to 2
5       mole % being more preferred, and between about 0.01 mg and about 10
        mg of the particular antigenic, therapeutic or diagnostic agent each per
        kilogram of patient body weight, may be suitable to be administered,
        although higher and lower amounts can be used.
10      E. Methods of Use
        As indicated above, in one specific embodiment the targeted lipid-ligand
        conjugates and in particular the targeted vesicles (i.e. liposomes and
        micelles) and targeted nanoparticles comprising these, as well as the
         respective pharmaceutical compositions thereof, are particularly suitable for
15       use as carriers for a targeted delivery of one or more bioactive agents,
         preferably therapeutic, diagnostic and/or antigenic agents.
        Thus, the targeted lipid-ligand conjugates of the present invention are
         particularly applicable for use in vitro and/or in vivo in methods for the
         treatment of diseases, for which a targeted delivery of one or more specific
20       bioactive agents, preferably therapeutic, diagnostic and/or antigenic agents,
         to tissues or cells is desirable or required.
         In the case of targeted nanoparticles and pharmaceutical compositions
         thereof, the one or more bioactive agent is preferably entrapped within the
         solid core.
 25      In the case of targeted lipid vesicles and pharmaceutical compositions
         thereof, the one or more bioactive agent is preferably enclosed within the
         internal void, or incorporated into the lipid bilayer.
          In further aspects, the present invention also encompasses methods for
         transport of a diagnostic or biologically active compound across a
 30       membrane, in particular methods for intracellular delivery of one or more

        In another specific embodiment the antigenic vesicles (i.e. liposomes and
        micelles) and antigenic nanoparticles comprising these, as well as the
        respective pharmaceutical compositions thereof, are particularly suitable for
        use as antigen display systems. Thus, the antigenic lipid-ligand conjugates
5       of the present invention are particularly applicable e.g. for use in
        immunization methods and/or for in vitro/in vivo diagnostic applications.
        Optionally the antigenic vesicles (i.e. liposomes and micelles) and antigenic
        nanoparticles may further comprise one or more bioactive agents. In case
        of antigenic nanoparticles, the one or more bioactive agent is preferably
10      entrapped within the solid core. In the case of targeted lipid vesicles and
        pharmaceutical compositions thereof, the one or more bioactive agent is
        preferably enclosed within the internal void, or incorporated into the lipid
        bilayer.

         administering subsequently said antigen presenting cells to the subject.
 25      Other aspects of the invention include methods for transport of a
         biologically active compound across a membrane and/or methods of
         delivery of a biologically active compound into a cell using carrier systems
         of the invention.
         Further applications that are contemplated include e.g. in vitro application
 30      for growth promotion and differentiation of cells as well as modification of
         expression profiles and post-translational modification patterns of biological

       the reaction mixture is extracted three times with diisopropylether. The
       product containing aqueous layer is adjusted to pH 2 with HCI and the
5      product is extracted with ethyl acetate three times. The combined organic
       layers are washed with H2 0 to neutral pH. The ethyl acetate is evaporated

        The solid phase peptide synthesis is carried out following the Fmoc/tBu
        strategy (Atherton E., et.al., J.Chem. Soc., Chem. Comm. , 539 (1978)), H
        Gly-2-CITrt (46 g, 34.5 mmole) is used as the base resin, coupling is
 15     performed by Fmoc-Xaa-OH/DIC/HOBt (2 eq. : 4 eq. : 3 eq.) over night, the
        removal of the Fmoc protection is achieved by 20 % piperidine in DMF after
        5 and 10 min. Alternating washing steps three times with
        dimethylformamide/isopropanol are employed after each coupling and de
        protection step respectively. The amino acid derivatives used in their
 20     chronological order are Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-D-Val-OH, Fmoc
         homoGlu(OBzl)-OH and Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH. The Fmoc-SPPS yields 73.4
         g of linear peptide resin (weight gain of the resin 27.4 g, 87 % of the theory,
        theory = 31.5 g).

10      (24.9 g, 47.8 mmole) and HOnig's base (16.4 ml, 95.6 mmole) in 5 L DMF.
        The resulting solution is stirred over night. The DMF is removed in vacuo
        and the obtained oil dissolved under reflux in 1.8 L ethanol and crystallized
        by the addition of 3.2 L of water at -18 *C. The precipitate is filtered off and
        washed with water and ether. In addition it is further purified by silica gel
