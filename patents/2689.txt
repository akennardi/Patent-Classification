     SIGMOIDOSCOPE WITH INTEGRAL ILLUMINATING ASSEMBLY
            The present invention relates to a medical instrument, and more
   particularly to a sigmoidoscope with an integral illuminating assembly.
   2. Description of Related Art
 5          With reference to Fig. 7, a conventional sigmoidoscope has an optic
   head 90 with a front end and a rear end, an eyepiece 91 disposed at the rear end of
   the optic head 90, and a coupling mount 92 disposed at the front end of the optic
   head 90. The coupling mount 92 is designed for assembling a disposable
   speculum 93. The speculum 93 is light-permeable and has a guiding tube 94. A
10 spigot 95 is disposed on the coupling mount 92 for introducing fluid to clean
   inside of an instrument. A handle 96 is connected to the optic head 90 for
   assembling an illuminating assembly. The illuminating assembly may be an
   optic fiber 97 and is inserted in the handle 96 for illumination.
            Light emitted by the illuminating assembly assembled in the handle 96 is
15 refracted by a prism and then projected to the guiding tube 94 of the speculum 93
   for illumination when the conventional sigmoidoscope is being inserted into a
   human body.
            The conventional sigmoidoscope has drawbacks as follows:
            1.    The illuminating assembly assembled in the handle 96 has to be
20 manually turned on or off by the medical personnel and is inconvenient for
   operating as the medical personnel is simultaneously engaged in administration
   of medication or other clinical activities.
            2.    Light emitted by the illuminating assembly assembled in the
   handle 96 projected to the guiding tube 94 of the speculum 93 is refracted by the

                                             2
   prism at first. Therefore, the conventional sigmoidoscope has a problem of
   uneven illumination and is defective in inspection.
            To overcome the shortcomings of the conventional sigmoidoscope, the
   present invention provides a sigmoidoscope with an integral illuminating
 5 assembly to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned problems.
            The main objective         of the present    invention is to provide a
   sigmoidoscope     with an integral illuminating        assembly that is able to
   simultaneously emit light when the speculum assembly is being assembled.
            The sigmoidoscope comprises a main body and an illuminating
10 assembly. The main body has an optic head. The optic head has a channel
   extending through the optic head and a positioning recess disposed at a middle
   portion of the optic head. The illuminating assembly has a circuit board, multiple
   light emitting elements, and a tact switch. The circuit board is disposed in the
   positioning recess and has a central hole aligned with the channel. The multiple
15 light emitting elements are annularly mounted to the circuit board at intervals
   and are electrically connected to the circuit board. The tact switch is mounted to
   the circuit board, is electrically connected to the circuit board, and has a pushing
   button extending over a rim of the central hole. The pushing button can be
   pressed by an inserting tube of a speculum assembly that is inserted into the
20 central hole.
            Other objects, advantages, and novel features of the invention will
   become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in
   conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

   circuit board 21, multiple light emitting elements 22, a tact switch 23, two wires
   24, two electrodes 25, and at least one battery 30. The circuit board 21 is
   disposed in the positioning recess 114 and has an annular outline and a central
   hole 211. The central hole 211 is aligned with the channel 111. The multiple light
 5 emitting elements 22 are annularly mounted to the circuit board 21 at intervals
   and face to the front end of the optic head 11. The multiple light emitting
   elements 22 are electrically connected to the circuit board 21. The multiple light
   emitting elements 22 are six in amount. The six light emitting elements 22 may
   be dual in-line package light emitting diodes or surface mount device light
10 emitting diodes.
            The tact switch 23 is mounted to the circuit board 21 for turning on or off
   the six light emitting elements 22. The tact switch 23 has a pushing button 231
   extending over a rim of the central hole 211. The two wires 24 are electrically

   be fastened to the assembling mount 123. The at least one battery 30 is held in
   the receiving recess 151, contacts the two electrodes 25, and is electrically
   connected to the two electrodes 25. In the embodiment of the present invention,
20 the at least one battery 30 is two in amount. The two batteries 30 are button cell
   batteries.
            The speculum assembly 40 has a blocking unit 41, a speculum 42, an
   inserting tube 43 connected to the speculum 42, and an inspection channel
   disposed along an axis of the speculum assembly 40. The speculum 42 is

                                               7
   light-permeable.
             The blocking unit 41 of the speculum assembly 40 has two engaging
   portions 411. The speculum 42 is integrally formed on the blocking unit 41. The
   inserting tube 43 is opaque and is connected to the blocking unit 41. The
 5 inserting tube 43 is inserted into the speculum 42 through the blocking unit 41.
   The blocking unit 41 is disposed between the speculum 42 and the inserting tube
   43. With reference to Figs. 1 and 5, the speculum assembly 40 is mounted to the
   main body 10. The two engaging portions 411 respectively engage with the two
   engaging indentions 118 to secure the speculum assembly 40 onto the main body
10 10. With reference to Figs. 1, 2, and 5, the inserting tube 43 passes through the
   circuit board 21 and then is inserted into the coupling sleeve 13. Since the
   coupling sleeve 13 is made of a flexible material, the inserting tube 43 may be
   securely mounted to the optic head 11 conveniently.
             With reference to Figs. 3, 4, and 5, the pushing button 231 of the tact
15 switch 23 of the illuminating assembly 20 extends into the central hole 211 of the
   circuit board 21. When the inserting tube 43 passes through the circuit board 21
   and presses the pushing button 231, the tact switch 23 turns on the six light
   emitting elements 22 to emit light.
             With reference to Fig. 6, the six light emitting elements 22 are surface
20 mount device light emitting diodes.
             With reference to Figs. I to 5, the central hole 211 of the circuit board 21
   of the illuminating assembly 20 is aligned with the channel 111 of the optic head
   11. The pushing button 231 extends over the rim of the central hole 211 of the
   circuit board 21 and extends into the central hole 211. When the inserting tube 43

                                              8
   of the speculum assembly 40 is inserted into the coupling sleeve 13 to mount to
   the main body 10, the six light emitting elements 22 are turned on
   simultaneously and manual switching is not needed. The six light emitting
   elements 22 annularly mounted to the circuit board 21 with the opaque inserting
 5 tube 43 allow light emitted by the six light emitting elements 22 to be evenly
   emitted to the speculum 42 of the speculum assembly 40. The sigmoidoscope in
   accordance with the present invention provides an even and bright illumination.
