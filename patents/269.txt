                                                Abstract
     A method to provide additional gaming network functionality links a user's gaming
      network identity with the user's social network identity. Linkage of the user's gaming
      network and social network identities establishes a two way communication link by
      which a gaming (social) network service can obtain information from, and send
      information to, a social (gaming) network service on behalf of the user. The gaming
      (social) network service may obtain information regarding the social (gaming) network
      relationships of the user's social (gaming) network identity and suggest gaming (social)
      network relationships to the user based on the social (gaming) network relationships.
     The gaming (social) network service additionally enables a user having linked identities
      to post gaming (social) network related messages as social (gaming) network messages
      via their social (gaming) network identity.

        Utilizing a Social Network Account to Provide Additional Functionality to a
                                       Gaming Network Account
                                                 Background
      [0001]         This disclosure relates generally to a technique for integrating a user's
      social network account with the user's gaming network account to provide additional
      gaming network functionality.
      [0002]         With the advancement in processing power and functionality of mobile
      devices, video game applications, which were once reserved for stand-alone gaming
      systems, have become an extremely popular category of applications for these devices.
      Based on the popularity of gaming applications and the connected nature of the mobile
      devices on which they are often executed, a relatively recent development is a gaming
      network service that allows users to establish relationships with friends, initiate games
      with these friends, and track game statistics with respect to friends and other game
      users from within the gaming network. Developers of gaming applications that are
      compatible with the gaming network provide functionality in the gaming application that
      enables the application to interface with the gaming network to provide scores,
      statistics, and the ability to initiate the game from within the gaming network. One
      example of this type of gaming network is the Apple® Game Center service. (APPLE is a
      registered trademark of Apple Inc.)
      [0003]         A gaming network is a type of social network in that it allows users to
      establish relationships with friends and to compete against and compare game statistics
      with these friends. While a gaming network allows a user to establish relationships and
                                                     -1 -

.002178043
      control their gaming experience from a single location, some users may not utilize the
      full capability that a gaming network provides. For example, a user may not be aware
      of acquaintances that also have gaming network identities.
      [0004]          In order to facilitate the establishment of gaming network relationships, a
      gaming network service may provide automatic friend recommendations based on
      various factors. For example, the gaming network may recognize an overlap in the
      friends of two gaming network users and may provide friend recommendations to one
      of the users based on friends of the other. In addition, the gaming network service may
      obtain contacts from an email account of a user and search for gaming network users
      associated with any of the obtained email addresses. The gaming network might also
      allow a user to manually search for gaming network friends by email address, user
      identity, etc. While these methods may allow a user to establish relationships over time,
      it would be beneficial to provide another mechanism to facilitate the establishment of
      gaming network relationships.
      [0005]          A gaming network user having a gaming network identity may also be a
      social network user having a different social network identity. Example social networks
      may include Facebook*, Twitter®, and LinkedIn*. (FACEBOOK is a registered trademark
      of Facebook, Inc. TWITTER is a registered trademark of Twitter, Inc. LINKEDIN is a
      registered trademark of LinkedIn Corporation.) Oftentimes, it will be the case that the
      user has a much more established set of relationships in the social network than in the
      gaming network. For example, a new user of a gaming network may have very few
      gaming network friends but may have hundreds or thousands of social network friends.
                                                     - 2-

002178043
     Many of the user's social network friends may also have gaming network identities and
     may be in a similar situation of having relatively few gaming network friends. It would
     be beneficial to take advantage of a user's already established social network
     relationships and the functionality of the social network to maximize a user's gaming
     network experience.
                                              Summary
     [0006]         In one embodiment, a method includes determining, by a client-side
     gaming network application, that a user of a device on which the application is installed
     has both a gaming network identity and a social network identity. The client-side
     gaming network application may then send a request to a server-side gaming network
     application to link the user's gaming network and social network identities and receive,
     in response, one or more gaming network relationship recommendations based on
     social network relationships of the user's social network identity.
     [0007]         In another embodiment, a computer program product includes
     instructions to cause a processor to receive a request to link a user's gaming network
     and social network identities, obtain access to the user's social network account, and
     receive a relationship map that includes social network identities that have a social
     network relationship with the user's social network identity.
     [0008]         In still another embodiment, a device includes program code stored in a
     memory of the device that causes the device's processor(s) to send a request to link a
     gaming network identity with a social network identity of the device's user, receive an
                                                 -3-

      indication that the gaming network identity and the social network identity were
      successfully linked, and allow the user to send a gaming network related message to be
      communicated as a social network message via the user's social network identity.

                                           Detailed Description
      [0014]         This disclosure pertains to systems, methods, devices, and computer
      program products for integrating the functionality of a social network with the
      functionality of a gaming network. In general, techniques are disclosed for linking a
      user's gaming network identity with the user's social network identity. More particularly,
      the linking of a user's gaming network identity with the user's social network identity
      can enable two way communications between the gaming network service and the
      social network service so that the gaming network service can obtain information from,
      and deliver information to, the social network service.
      [0015]         In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous
      specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the
      inventive concept. As part of this description, some of this disclosure's drawings
      represent structures and devices in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the
      invention. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are
      described in this specification. Moreover, the language used in this disclosure has been
      principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and may not have been
      selected to delineate or circumscribe the inventive subject matter, resort to the claims
      being necessary to determine such inventive subject matter. Reference in this
      disclosure to "one embodiment" or to "an embodiment" means that a particular feature,
      structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in
      at least one embodiment of the invention, and multiple references to "one embodiment"
                                                     - 5-

.002178043
      or "an embodiment" should not be understood as necessarily all referring to the same
      embodiment.
      [0016]         It will be appreciated that in the development of any actual
      implementation (as in any development project), numerous decisions must be made to
      achieve the developers' specific goals (e.g., compliance with system- and business
      related constraints), and that these goals will vary from one implementation to another.
      It will also be appreciated that such development efforts might be complex and time
      consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill
      in the design of gaming network services having the benefit of this disclosure.
      [0017]          Referring to FIG. 1, a block diagram illustrates the relationships between
      various gaming network 105 and social network 110 identities. As used herein, gaming
      network 105 and social network 110 refer to the functionality provided by a gaming
      network service and a social network service, respectively, in providing a forum in
      which users can interact with their applications and with other users. As will be
      described below, some functionality provided by these services will be implemented by
      a server-side application while other functionality will be implemented by a client-side
      application.
      [0018]         In FIG. 1, identities on a common horizontal line represent the identities
      of a single user. For example, user 115 has a gaming network identity A and a social
      network identity A*. The solid lines within each of gaming network 105 and social
      network 110 represent existing relationships between the various identities. The
      dashed lines represent potential new relationships for user 115 in gaming network 105
                                                    -6-

002178043
     based on the linkage of user 115's gaming network identity A with their social network
     identity A*. Finally, the lines between a gaming network identity and a social network
     identity represent linked identities.
     [0019]         In the relatively simple example illustrated, user 115 has a more
     established set of relationships in social network 110 than in gaming network 105. For
     example, in social network 110, user 115 has direct relationships with user 120 (B*),
     user 125 (C*), user 130 (E*), user 135 (F*), and user 140 (G*). Conversely, in
     gaming network 105, user 115 has direct relationships with only user 120 (B) and
     user 145 (I). Users 115 (A/A*), 120 (B/B*), 125 (C/C*), 130 (E/E*), and 140 (G/G*)
     have both a social network identity and a gaming network identity. Users 150 (D*) and
     135 (F*) have a social network identity but have not yet established a gaming network
     identity. Likewise, users 155 (H) and 145 (I) have a gaming network identity but have
     not established a social network identity. Of the five users (115, 120, 125, 130, and
     140) having both a social network identity and a gaming network identity, users 120
     (B/B*), 125 (C/C*), and 140 (G/G*) have linked their social network and gaming
     network identities. User 115 (A/A*) is considering linking their social network and
     gaming network identities (illustrated by the dashed line between gaming network
     identity A and social network identity A*).
     [0020]         Based on the linkage of user 115's gaming network identity and social
     network identity, gaming network 105 may automatically suggest several relationships
     to user 115. When user 115 selects to link their gaming network identity A with their
     social network identity A*, user 115's gaming network account obtains a relationship
                                                  -7-

002178043
     map from user 115's social network account. The relationship map identifies user
     115's direct social network relationships with user 120, user 125, user 130, user 135,
     and user 140 along with those users' social network identities. Because users 125 and
     140 have linked their gaming network and social network identities, gaming network
     105 can recognize user 125 as gaming network identity C and user 140 as gaming
     network identity G. Moreover, because users 125 and 140 have a direct social
     networking relationship with user 115, gaming network 105 may suggest that user
     115 form a gaming network relationship with those users.
     [0021]          In one embodiment, gaming network 105 records may be maintained in a
     global data store that associates a gaming network identity with a social network
     identity for each user that has linked their gaming network and social network
     identities. Each identity may uniquely identify a user in a particular network (e.g., A*
     uniquely identifies user 115 in social network 110). In one embodiment, in response to
     a user linking their gaming network and social network identities, gaming network 105
     may query the data store for each of the social network identities identified in an
     obtained relationship map as having a direct relationship with the user. Therefore, in
     the case illustrated in FIG. 1, a data store may be queried for social network identities
     B*, C*, E*, F*, and G* in response to obtaining user 115's social network relationship
     map and may identify matches for B*, C*, and G*, corresponding to users 120, 125,
     and 140 and gaming network 105 identities B, C, and G.
     [0022]          In another embodiment, gaming network 105 may suggest additional
     ancillary relationships based on the linking of user 115's social network identity A* with
                                                  -8-

.002178043
      their gaming network identity A. For example, based on the recognition of user 125 as
      having a direct social network relationship with user 115, and based on user 125's
      direct gaming network relationship with user 155, gaming network 105 may
      additionally suggest a relationship between users 115 and 155 according to a "friend
      of a friend" matching feature.
      [0023]        As illustrated, the linkage of user 115's gaming network identity A with
      their social network identity A* may facilitate the creation of several gaming network
      relationships. For purposes of clarity, the illustrated embodiment includes a small
      number of gaming network and social network relationships. In reality, a user may have
      hundreds or thousands of social network relationships, which may facilitate the creation
      of many more gaming network relationships than are illustrated in FIG. 1. It should be
      noted that although user 130 has a direct social network relationship with user 115,
      gaming network 105 may not be able to suggest a gaming network relationship
      between users 115 and 130 because user 130 has not linked their gaming network
      and social network identities (E and E*, respectively). For example, although user 115's
      relationship map may indicate a direct relationship with user 130, a query of the
      gaming network 105 data store for user 130's social network identity E* may not
      return a match because user 130 has not linked their gaming network and social
      network identities. While this represents a missed opportunity to create a gaming
      network relationship, additional functionality of the linking of social network and gaming
      network identities may foster the creation of this relationship as described in greater
      detail below. This additional functionality might also induce users of social network 110
                                                    -9-

.002178043
      to create a gaming network identity. For example, as will also be described in greater
      detail below, user 135 may be induced to create a gaming network identity based on
      user 115's linkage of their gaming network and social network identities.
      [0024]         Referring to FIG. 2, a block diagram illustrates a process by which the
      linking of a user's gaming network identity and social network identity may be initiated
      from device 205 in accordance with one embodiment. Device 205 may be a personal
      digital assistant (PDA), personal music player, mobile telephone, notebook, laptop,
      desktop or a tablet computer and is described in greater detail below with respect to
      FIG. 5. Device 205 has installed thereon client-side gaming network application 210
      (hereinafter gaming network application 210) and client-side social network application
      215 (hereinafter social network application 215). As set forth above, gaming network
      application 210 may allow the user to initiate and track multiple gaming applications
      installed on device 205 through gaming network 105. Likewise, social network
      application 215 may allow the user to communicate with acquaintances via social
      network 110.
      [0025]         At 220, gaming network application 210 obtains a user's social network
      credentials. Social network credentials may be any identifying information that allows a
      user to interact via social network 110 using a particular social network identity. In one
      embodiment, the user's social network credentials may include a username and
      password combination. In one embodiment, gaming network application 210 may
      attempt to obtain the user's social network credentials at the request of the user. In
      another embodiment, gaming network application 210 may attempt to obtain the
                                                  - 10 -

002178043
     user's social network credentials without being requested to do so by the user. In the
     illustrated embodiment, gaming network application 210 obtains the user's social
     network credentials directly from social network application 215. Social network
     application 215 may store the user's social network credentials such that the user may
     not have to enter the credentials each time they wish to communicate via social
     network 110. Thus, gaming network application 210 may request the credentials
     directly from social network application 215. Before providing the credentials to gaming
     network application 210, social network application 215 may prompt the user to
     consent to the sharing of the credentials with gaming network application 210.
     [0026]         In another embodiment, the user's social network credentials may not be
     obtained directly from social network application 215. For example, in one
     embodiment, gaming network application 210 may obtain the user's social network
     credentials as a direct input from the user. The social network credentials may be
     obtained in this manner in response to a request by the user to link the user's gaming
     network identity with their social network identity. As such, it is not necessary that
     social network application 215 be installed on device 205. In another embodiment,
     gaming network application 210 may search a predefined memory location of device
     205 that is utilized to store social network credentials. In such an embodiment, gaming
     network application 210 may search for the user's social network credentials upon
     installation of gaming network application 210 on device 205, when gaming network
     application 210 is launched for a first time, each time gaming network application 210
     is launched, or at any other appropriate times. In response to obtaining the user's social
                                                 - 11 -

.002178043
      network credentials, gaming network application 210 may determine that the user has
      both a gaming network identity and a social network identity and may prompt the user
      to link their gaming network identity with their social network identity.
      [0027]         When a user of device 205 consents to linking their gaming network
      identity with their social network identity, gaming network application 210 may cause
      device 205 to transmit a request 225 to obtain gaming network specific credentials to
      social network server 230 via network 235. Request 225 may include the user's social
      network credentials and can be provided to server-side social network application 230'
      executing on social network server 230. In one embodiment, the user's social network
      credentials may be transmitted in an encrypted form. Network 235 may take any form
      including, but not limited to, a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN)
      such as the Internet. Further, network 235 may use any desired technology (wired,
      wireless or a combination thereof) and protocol (e.g., transmission control protocol,
     TCP).
      [0028]         In response to receiving request 225, server-side social network
      application 230' can authenticate the user based on the provided social network
      credentials. If the user is properly authenticated, server-side social network application
      230' may generate the requested gaming network specific credentials. In one
      embodiment, the gaming network specific credentials are randomly generated by
      server-side social network application 230'. The gaming network specific credentials
      uniquely identify a user's social network identity and can be used by server-side gaming
      network application 240' executing on gaming network server 240 to communicate
                                                   - 12 -

.002178043
      directly with server-side social network application 230' on behalf of the user. For
      example, the gaming network specific credentials may allow server-side gaming
      network application 240' to obtain the user's social network relationship map and to
      create social network messages using the user's social network identity. The gaming
      network specific credentials may be transmitted to device 205 as response 245.
     Although FIG. 2 illustrates gaming network application 210 as communicating with
      social network server 230 to obtain gaming network specific credentials, alternate
      means of obtaining these credentials will be understood by those of skill in the art. For
      example, social network application 215 may perform this operation on behalf of
      gaming network application 210. That is, gaming network application 210 may simply
      request gaming network specific credentials from social network application 215 and
      social network application may obtain the gaming network specific credentials and
      provide them to gaming network application 210. In such an embodiment, gaming
      network application 210 would not need to obtain the user's social network credentials.
      [0029]         Regardless of the mechanism utilized to obtain gaming network specific
      credentials, gaming network application 210 can send request 250 to server-side
      gaming network application 240' executing on gaming network server 240 to initiate
      the linkage of the user's gaming network and social network identities. In one
      embodiment, request 250 will include the user's gaming network identity as well as the
      gaming network specific credentials to be utilized by server-side gaming network
      application 240' to communicate with server-side social network application 230' on
      behalf of the user.

002178043
     [0030]        In one embodiment, upon receiving request 250, server-side gaming
     network application 240' may send request 255 for a token to server-side social
     network application 230'. In the depicted embodiment, communications between social
     network server 230 and gaming network server 240 are illustrated as occurring over
     common network 235. In an alternate embodiment, social network server 230 and
     gaming network server 240 may be connected via a separate network from that used
     for communications with device 205. Request 255 can include authentication
     information that uniquely identifies gaming network server 240 to social network server
     230.
     [0031]        If server-side social network application 230' properly authenticates
     gaming network server 240, server-side social network application 230' may send
     response 260 that includes a gaming network server token. In one embodiment, the
     gaming network server token is transmitted in an encrypted form. In another
     embodiment, the gaming network server token is a data string that can be presented
     along with a user's gaming network specific credentials before the server-side social
     network application will perform any actions requested by the server-side gaming
     network application. This ensures that only predefined devices (e.g., gaming network
     server 240) that are capable of presenting proper authentication information to server
     side social network application 230' will be permitted to act on behalf of a user in social
     network 110 by presenting both the server token and the user's gaming network
     specific credentials. In the depicted embodiment, the token provided in response 260 is
     unique to a specific user. That is, server 240 provides authentication information to
                                                 - 14 -

002178043
     server 230 and server-side social network application 230' generates a unique token
     for each different user that requests to link their social network and gaming network
     identities. In an alternate embodiment, server authentication operation 255/260 may
     only be performed once or may be performed at predefined time intervals. In such an
     embodiment, server-side gaming network application 240' may use a single token for
     all interactions with server-side social network application 230'.
     [0032]         Server-side gaming network application 240' may then send request 265
     to link the user's gaming network identity with their social network identity to server
     side social network application 230'. Request 265 can include the user's gaming
     network specific credentials as well as the gaming network server token. Because the
     gaming network specific credentials uniquely identify the user's social network identity
     as discussed above, server-side social network application 230' can utilize the gaming
     network specific credentials to access the user's social network account. That is, the
     gaming network specific credentials may allow server-side gaming network application
     240' to obtain access to information relating to the user's social network identity as
     well as to act on behalf of the user (i.e., post messages, create friend requests, etc.)
     using the social network identity. The server-side social network application may
     generate 270 relationship map 275 based on established relationships identified by the
     user's social network identity. In the relatively simple embodiment illustrated, the
     relationship map for user 115 (FIG. 1) includes the direct relationships for user 115's
     social network 110 identity A*. In another embodiment, relationship map 275 may
                                                  - 15 -

.002178043
      include additional information such as length of relationships, relationship status (e.g.,
      identifying B* as A*'s spouse), frequency of interactions, etc.
      [0033]         After obtaining relationship map 275, server-side social network
      application 230' can send response 280 to server-side gaming network application
      240' that includes relationship map 275 as well as any additional relevant information
      regarding the user's social network identity. In addition to initial response 280, server
      side social network application 230' may continue to monitor the user's social network
      identity and can send updates to server-side gaming network application 240' when
      any updates are made to the user's social network identity. For example, server-side
      social network application 230' may generate and transmit 280 an updated
      relationship map when user 115's identity A* creates or terminates a social network
      relationship. Server-side social network application 230' may continue the monitoring
      process until the user terminates their social network or gaming network identity,
      requests that the identities be unlinked, or performs another action that results in the
      termination of the monitoring process.
      [0034]         Upon receiving response 280, server-side gaming network application
      240' may query 285 global data store 290 that maintains the gaming network
      identities of all gaming network users along with corresponding social network identities
      for users that have linked those identities. To continue the example of FIG. 1, global
      data store 290 may include gaming network identities (A, B, C, E, G, H, I) for each user
      of gaming network 105. For users that have linked their gaming network and social
      network identities, corresponding social network identities (A*, B*, C*, G*) can also be
                                                  - 16 -

.002178043
      provided in global data store 290. Query 285 may search the social network identifier
      field (SN ID) of global data store 290 for each of the direct relationships of social
      network identity A* included in the received relationship map 275. As such, query 285
      may return gaming network identities B, C, and G as matches for social network
      identities B*, C*, and G*, which correspond to direct social network relationships of
      gaming network identity A as indicated in relationship map 275. Server-side gaming
      network application 240' may then determine that gaming network identity A has
      already established a gaming network relationship with gaming network identity B but
      has not established a gaming network relationship with identities C or G. Server-side
      gaming network application 240' may periodically perform querying operation 285 to
      identify new friend recommendations based on new users linking their social network
      and gaming network identities.
      [0035]         Based on identified matches, server-side gaming network application 240'
      may send gaming network friend recommendations 295 to gaming network application
      210. In one embodiment, the friend recommendations may constitute an indication
      that the user's gaming network and social network identities have been successfully
      linked. In another embodiment, a separate message may be sent from server-side
      gaming network application 240' to gaming network application 210 indicating that the
      user's gaming network and social network identities have been successfully linked. In
      response to the indication that the user's gaming network and social network identities
      have been successfully linked, additional functionality of the gaming network application
      210 may be made available. For example, once the identities are linked, the gaming
                                                 - 17 -

.002178043
      network application may allow a user to distribute gaming network related messages
      (e.g., gaming network accomplishments, gaming network friend requests, etc.) as social
      network messages via the user's social network identity.
      [0036]        To continue the example from above, server-side gaming network
      application 240' may send friend recommendations 295 that allow user 115 to initiate
      gaming network relationships with gaming network identities C and G. In one
      embodiment, the friend recommendations 295 may include a selectable object that
      allows a user to send a direct request to initiate a gaming network relationship with the
      gaming network identity indicated in the friend recommendation. In another
      embodiment, server-side gaming network application 240' may automatically establish
      gaming network relationships between users that have direct social network
      relationships and have linked their social network and gaming network identities. In one
      embodiment, such automatic relationship establishment may be contingent upon a user
      selecting a setting option that allows the creation of automatic gaming network
      relationships in such a manner. The illustrated process results in the establishment of a
      two-way relationship between a user's social network identity and their gaming network
      identity by which server-side gaming network application 240' may obtain information
      from, and send information to, server-side social network application 230' on behalf of
      the user.
      [0037]         Referring to FIG. 3, network application operation 300 determines a user
      has a gaming network accomplishment (block 305). The accomplishment may be a
      new high score among the user's gaming network friends, a new global high score for a
                                                  - 18 -

.002178043
      particular game over a particular time period, a gaming network achievement (e.g., an
      accumulated points total based on results of all games that the user has played within
      gaming network 105), etc. In one embodiment, the accomplishment can be visible
      within gaming network 105. For example, the accomplishment may be displayed as a
      top ranking in a leaderboard among friends in gaming network 105. Because the user
      has linked their gaming network identity with their social network identity, gaming
      network application 210 may enable the user to share the accomplishment as a
      message via the user's linked social network identity (block 310). In one embodiment,
      the accomplishment may be transmitted from gaming network application 210 to
      server-side gaming network application 240'. Server-side gaming network application
      240' may then create a social network message on behalf of the user and transmit the
      message to server-side social network application 230' along with the gaming network
      specific credentials and gaming network server token. Server-side social network
      application 230' may then cause the message to be communicated via social network
      110 and attributed to the user. Therefore, the linking of a user's gaming network
      identity and social network identity permits the user to share gaming network related
      messages via their social network identity. While the accomplishment is described as
      being shared via a social network message, the accomplishment may be shared via a
      social network status update, a social network post, etc.
      [0038]        In one embodiment, the shared accomplishment may include a selectable
      link. In one embodiment, the selectable link may include a uniform resource locator
      (URL). By sharing the gaming network accomplishment via the user's social network
                                                 - 19 -

.002178043
      identity, other users that have a social network relationship with the user that shares
      the accomplishment will see the accomplishment. These other users may not have a
      gaming network relationship with the user sharing the accomplishment and may not
      even have a gaming network identity. As such, linkage of a user's gaming network and
      social network identities may facilitate the communication of gaming network
      accomplishments to a broader audience.
      [0039]         A user having a social network relationship with the user that shared the
      accomplishment may see the message and select the link included with the message
      (block 315). It is then determined whether the user that selected the link has a gaming
      network identity (block 320). In one embodiment, it may be determined that the user
      that selected the link has a gaming network identity if gaming network application 210
      is installed on the device from which the link was selected. In another embodiment, it
      may be determined that the user that selected the link has a gaming network identity if
      the device from which the link was selected has account information stored in a
      predetermined location for gaming network 105. If it is determined that the user that
      selected the link does not have a gaming network 105 identity (the "NO" prong of
      block 320), the link may cause an invitation to be displayed (block 325) inviting the
      user to create a gaming network identity and/or to download gaming network
      application 210. For example, referring back to the example provided in FIG. 1, user
      135 (F*) has a social network relationship with user 115 (A*) but does not have a
      gaming network identity. Therefore, user 135 may see the social network message
      identifying user 115's gaming network accomplishment and may select the associated
                                                  - 20 -

.002178043
      link. Because user 135 does not have a gaming network identity, however, the link will
      cause an invitation to create a gaming network identity to be displayed to user 135. In
      one embodiment, the link may cause the device to display a gaming network marketing
      webpage. In another embodiment, the invitation may cause the device to launch a
      media distribution application such as Apple's App Store     TM
                                                                      and to display an interface
      that enables the user to acquire gaming network application 210. (APP STORE is a
      trademark of Apple Inc.) Therefore, one user's linkage of their gaming network and
      social network identities may induce other users to acquire gaming network application
      210 and to create a gaming network identity.
      [0040]          If it is determined that the user that selected the link has a gaming
      network identity (the "YES" prong of block 320), the link may cause gaming network
      application 210 to be launched. It may then be determined whether the user that
      selected the link has a gaming network relationship with the user that shared the
      accomplishment (block 330). If it is determined that the user that selected the link
      does not have a gaming network relationship with the user that shared the
      accomplishment (the "NO" prong of block 330), the user that selected the link may be
      invited to initiate a gaming network relationship with the user that shared the
      accomplishment (block 335). For example, referring again to the example provided in
      FIG. 1, user 130 has both a social network identity (E*) and a gaming network identity
      (E). User 130 has a social network relationship but not a gaming network relationship
      with user 115. Therefore, user 130 may see a social network message identifying user
      115's gaming network accomplishment and may select the associated link. The link
                                                    - 21 -

002178043
     may cause gaming network application 210 to be launched on user 130's device. It
     may then be determined that user 130 does not have a gaming network relationship
     with user 115. Accordingly, user 130 may be presented with an invitation to initiate a
     gaming network relationship with user 115. User 130 may also be invited to link their
     gaming network and social network identities. Alternatively, the user that shared the
     accomplishment may be prompted to create a gaming network relationship with the
     user that selected the link. In another embodiment, selection of the link may
     automatically create a gaming network relationship between the user that selected the
     link and the user that shared the accomplishment because the users necessarily have a
     social network relationship. Again, the creation of an automatic relationship may be
     contingent upon a user selecting a setting option that allows the creation of automatic
     gaming network relationships in such a manner. Therefore, one user's linkage of their
     gaming network and social network identities may foster the creation of subsequent
     gaming network relationships.
     [0041]        If it is determined that the user that selected the link has a gaming
     network relationship with the user that shared the accomplishment (the "YES" prong of
     block 330), the accomplishment may be displayed to the user that selected the link
     (block 340). In one embodiment, the link can cause a leaderboard that shows the
     accomplishment to be displayed within gaming network application 210. In addition to
     promoting the creation of gaming network relationships, the linkage of a user's gaming
     network and social network identities may enable gaming network accomplishments to
     be shared via social network 110 to a potentially broader audience. Moreover, the
                                                 - 22 -

002178043
     sharing of gaming network accomplishments via social network 110 may encourage
     additional users of social network 110 to begin using gaming network 105.
     [0042]          Referring to FIGS. 4A-4C, example social network user interfaces
     illustrate various gaming network related messages communicated as social network
     messages via a user's social network identity. In each of the figures, an example
     interface provided by social network application 215 as viewed by user 120 (B*)
     illustrates functionality enabled by the linkage of user 115's gaming network and social
     network identities. Referring first to FIG. 4A, user 120's social network application 215
     interface displays message 405 indicating a gaming network accomplishment of user
     115. As described above, message 405 may be initiated by user 115 directly from
     gaming network 105 (e.g., from within user 115's gaming network application 210).
     For example, gaming network application 210 may send a request to server-side
     gaming network application 240' to send message 405 to server-side social network
     application 230' to be displayed via social network 110. Moreover, as additionally
     described above, message 405 includes link 410 that causes user 115's
     accomplishment to be displayed and may additionally foster new gaming network 105
     relationships for user 115. The gaming network accomplishment is displayed using user
     115's social network identity (A*).
     [0043]          Referring to FIG. 4B, user 120's social network application 215 interface
     displays gaming network friend request 415 sent by user 115. Like message 405,
     friend request 415 may be initiated by user 115 directly from gaming network 105
     (e.g., from within user 115's gaming network application 210). Because server-side
                                                  - 23 -

002178043
     gaming network application 240' will have access to each of user 115's social network
     relationships based on the relationship map, user 115 may send a friend request to any
     or all of the social network identities with whom they have a relationship. For example,
     gaming network application 210 may retrieve the list of identities from relationship map
     175 from server-side gaming network application 240' and may select certain identities
     to whom friend request 415 should be generated. In response to receiving the list of
     social network identities to whom friend request 415 should be sent, server-side
     gaming network application 240' may send the requests to server-side social network
     application 230' to be displayed via social network 110. Accordingly, user 115 may be
     able to reach a wide audience of users by sending the request via their social network
     identity. Like message 405, friend request 415 may include selectable link 420.
     Selectable link 420 may function similarly to link 410. For example, link 420 may
     cause gaming network application 210 to be launched if it is installed on a device from
     which the link is selected. Rather than causing gaming network application 210 to
     display an achievement, however, link 420 may enable the user selecting the link to
     initiate a gaming network relationship with the user that sent friend request 415.
     Therefore, in addition to utilizing social network 110 to post accomplishments from
     gaming network 105, a user that has linked their gaming network and social network
     identities might also utilize social network 110 to send gaming network friend requests.
     [0044]         Referring to FIG. 4C, user 120's social network application 215 interface
     displays game recommendation 425 sent by user 115. Like message 405 and friend
     request 415, game recommendation 425 may be initiated by user 115 directly from
                                                  - 24 -

002178043
     gaming network 105 (e.g., from within user 115's gaming network application 210).
     For example, gaming network application 210 may display all games compatible with
     gaming network 105 that a user has installed on a device. The user may be able to
     select an option to send a recommendation for one or more of the listed games to be
     displayed via social network 110. In addition, a user may be able to send game
     recommendation 425 from within a game itself (i.e., outside of gaming network
     application 210). For example, gaming network application 210 may provide an
     application programming interface (API) that allows a game application developer to
     display a "recommend" option within a game application. Selection of the "recommend"
     option by a user may cause the game to send a recommendation through gaming
     network application 210 to be posted via social network 110. Like message 405 and
     friend request 415, game recommendation 425 may include selectable link 430. Link
     430 may function similarly to links 410 and 420 but instead of displaying an
     accomplishment or initiating a gaming network relationship, link 430 may present a
     user selecting link 430 with an option to purchase a recommended game if the user
     selecting the link does not have the game or may allow the user to initiate a session of
     the game if the user does have the game. For example, if the user selecting link 430
     does not have the recommended game, link 430 may cause a device to launch a media
     distribution application such as Apple's App Store and to display an interface that
     enables the user to purchase the recommended game. In one embodiment, if the user
     that selects link 430 already has the recommended game, link 430 may enable the
     user to initiate a session of the game or to request a session of the game against the
                                                 - 25 -

.002178043
      user that posted game recommendation 425. Therefore, in addition to utilizing social
      network 110 to post accomplishments from gaming network 105 or to send friend
      requests 415, a user that has linked their gaming network and social network identities
      might also utilize social network 110 to send game recommendations 425.
      [0045]         Referring to FIG. 5, a simplified functional block diagram of an illustrative
      electronic device 500 is shown according to one embodiment. Device 205, social

      [0048]          It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be
      illustrative, and not restrictive. The material has been presented to enable any person
      skilled in the art to make and use the inventive concepts described herein, and is
      provided in the context of particular embodiments, variations of which will be readily
      apparent to those skilled in the art (e.g., some of the disclosed embodiments may be
      used in combination with each other). Many other embodiments will be apparent to
      those of skill in the art upon reviewing the above description. Moreover, although the
      specification has focused on the initiation of the described process from the gaming
      network application, the described process could just as easily be implemented from the
      social network application. That is, rather than the gaming network obtaining
      information from and sending information to the social network, the social network may
      obtain information from and send information to the gaming network. The scope of the
      invention therefore should be determined with reference to the appended claims, along
      with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. In the appended
