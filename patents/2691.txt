Summary of the invention
[0003C]    Embodiments of the invention are defined by each of the accompanying claims. For
example, in one embodiment, the invention relates to a method of reducing the risk of occurrency
of pulmonary edema according to claim 1.
[0004]     One aspect of the invention relates to a pre-screening methodology or protocol having
exclusionary criteria to be evaluated by a medical provider prior to treatment of a patient with
iNO. One objective of the invention is to evaluate and possibly exclude from treatment patients
eligible for treatment with iNO, who have pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction (LVD).

                                                    2
Patients who have pre-existing LVD may experience, and are at risk of, an increased rate of
adverse events or serious adverse events (e.g., pulmonary edema) when treated with iNO. Such
patients may be characterized as having a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) greater
than 20 mm Hg, and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with respect to the benefit
versus risk of using iNO as a treatment option.
[0005]     Accordingly, one aspect of the invention includes a method of reducing the risk or
preventing the occurrence, in a human patient, of an adverse event (AE) or a serious adverse
event (SAE) associated with a medical treatment comprising inhalation of nitric oxide, said
method comprising the steps or acts of (a) providing a source of pharmaceutically acceptable
nitric oxide gas to a medical provider; and, (b) informing the medical provider that excluding
human patients who have pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction from said treatment reduces
the risk or prevents the occurrence of the adverse event or the serious adverse event associated
with said medical treatment.
[0006]     Further provided herein is a method of distributing a pharmaceutical product, the
method comprising:
        a) providing a source of nitric oxide gas to a medical provider;
        b)   informing the medical provider that a recommended dose of inhaled nitric oxide gas
             for treatment of neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure is 20 ppm nitric oxide;
        c)   providing a first warning to the medical provider that inhaled nitric oxide is
             contraindicated in the treatment of neonates dependent on right-to-left shunting of
             blood; and
        d)   providing a second warning to the medical provider, distinct from the first warning,
             that in patients with pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction, inhaled nitric oxide
             may increase pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) leading to pulmonary
             edema, the second warning being sufficient to cause the medical provider and/or
             staff of the medical provider considering inhaled nitric oxide treatment for a
             plurality of neonatal patients who (a) are suffering from a condition for which
             inhaled nitric oxide is indicated, and (b) have pre-existing left ventricular
             dysfunction, to elect to avoid treating one or more such patients with inhaled nitric
             oxide in order to avoid putting such patient at risk of pulmonary edema.

                                                    3
[0007]     Further provided herein is a method of treating a neonate or child patient who are
candidates for inhaled nitric oxide treatment, which method reduces the risk that inhalation of
nitric oxide gas will induce an increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) leading
to pulmonary edema in neonatal patients with hypoxic respiratory failure, said method
comprising:
        a)   performing at least one diagnostic process to identify a plurality of neonate or child
             patients who have pulmonary hypertension and are candidates for inhaled nitric
             oxide treatment, wherein the patients are not dependent on right-to-left shunting of
             blood;
        b) determining that a first patient of the plurality does not have left ventricular
             dysfunction;
        c)   determining that a second patient of the plurality has left ventricular dysfunction, so
             is at particular risk of increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP),
             leading to pulmonary edema, upon treatment with inhaled nitric oxide;
        d)   administering inhaled nitric oxide treatment to the first patient; and
        e) excluding the second patient from treatment with inhaled nitric oxide, based on the
             determination that the second patient has left ventricular dysfunction, so is at
             particular risk of increased PCWP, leading to pulmonary edema, upon treatment
             with inhaled nitric oxide.
[0008]     Further provided herein is a system for use in administering inhaled nitric oxide gas
which system reduces the risk of inducing increased PCWP leading to pulmonary edema in
neonatal patients who have hypoxic respiratory failure and are candidates for inhaled nitric
oxide treatment, the system comprising:
        a)   a source of pharmaceutically acceptable nitric oxide gas for inhalation; and
        b) instructions for administering nitric oxide gas from the source to treat hypoxic
             respiratory failure in a term or near-term neonate at a dosage of 20 ppm nitric oxide
             gas, the instructions comprising a warning that a patient with pre-existing left
             ventricular dysfunction may experience increased PCWP leading to pulmonary
             edema when treated with inhaled nitric oxide gas, wherein the warning:

                                                    4
                 is effective to reduce use of inhaled nitric oxide gas to treat neonate patients who
                have hypoxic respiratory failure and pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction but
                who are not dependent on right to left shunting of blood, and
                 thereby reduces the risk of occurrence of increased PCWP leading to pulmonary
                edema in neonates that have hypoxic respiratory failure.
[0009]      Further provided herein is a method of reducing the risk or preventing the occurrence,
in a human patient, of an adverse event or a serious adverse event associated with a medical
treatment comprising inhalation of nitric oxide, said method comprising the steps or acts of
(a) providing a source of pharmaceutically acceptable nitric oxide gas to a medical provider and,
(b) informing the medical provider that human patients having pre-existing left ventricular
dysfunction experience an increased risk of serious adverse events associated with said medical
treatment.
[0010]      Another aspect of the invention is a method of reducing one or more of an AE or a
SAE in an intended patient population in need of being treated with iNO comprising the steps or
acts of (a) identifying a patient eligible for iNO treatment; (b) evaluating and screening the
patient to identify if the patient has pre-existing LVC, and (c) excluding from iNO treatment a
patient identified as having pre-existing LVD.
[0011]      Another aspect of the invention is a method of reducing the risk or preventing the
occurrence, in a patient, of one or more of an AE or a SAE associated with a medical treatment
comprising iNO, the method comprising the steps or acts of (a) identifying a patient in need of
receiving iNO treatment; (b) evaluating and screening the patient to identify if the patient has
pre-existing LVD; and (c) administering iNO if the patient does not have pre-existing LVD,
thereby reducing the risk or preventing the occurrence of the AE or the SAE associated with the
iNO treatment. Alternatively, step (c) may comprise further evaluating the risk versus benefit of
utilizing iNO in a patient where the patient has clinically significant LVD before administering
iNO to the patient.
[0012]      In an exemplary embodiment of the method, the method further comprises informing
the medical provider that there is a risk associated with using inhaled nitric oxides in human
patients who have pre-existing or clinically significant left ventricular dysfunction and that such
risk should be evaluated on a case by case basis.

                                                  5
[0013]     In another exemplary embodiment of the method, the method further comprises
informing the medical provider that there is a risk associated with using inhaled nitric oxide in
human patients who have left ventricular dysfunction.
[0014]     In another exemplary embodiment of the method, the method further comprises
generating the source of nitric oxide gas prior to providing the source to the medical provider.
[0015]     In another exemplary embodiment of the method, the method further comprises
generating the source of nitric oxide gas by a method comprising compressing nitric oxide and
nitrogen gases under high pressure, prior to providing the source to the medical provider.
[0016]     In another exemplary embodiment of the method, the source of nitric oxide gas is a
gaseous blend of nitric oxide and nitrogen.
[0017]     In another exemplary embodiment of the method, the source of nitric oxide gas is a
gaseous blend of nitric oxide and nitrogen provided as a compressed gas in a cylinder under
high pressure.
[0018]     In an exemplary embodiment of the methods described herein, a patient having
pre-existing LVD is characterized as having PCWP greater than 20 mm Hg.
[0019]     In an exemplary embodiment of the method, the patients having pre-existing LVC
demonstrate a PCWP > 20 mm Hg.
[0020]     In another exemplary embodiment of the method, the iNO treatment further comprises

dysfunction, ischemic cardiomyopathy, viral cardiomyopathy, idiopathic cardiomyopathy,
autoimmune disease related cardiomyopathy, drug-related cardiomyopathy, toxin-related
cardiomyopathy, structural heart disease, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, or,
associations thereof.
[0022]     In another exemplary embodiment of the method, the patient population comprises
children.

                                                     6
[0023]     In another exemplary embodiment of the method, the patient population comprises
adults.

pulmonary edema, hypotension, cardiac arrest, electrocardiogram changes, hypoxemia, hypoxia,
bradycardia or associations thereof.
[0025]     In another exemplary embodiment of the method, the intended patient population in
need of being treated with inhalation of nitric oxide has one or more of idiopathic pulmonary
arterial hypertension characterized by a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm) > 25 mm Hg at
rest, PCPW      15 mm Hg, and, a pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) > 3 tm 2; congenital
heart disease with pulmonary hypertension repaired and unrepaired characterized by PAPm > 25
mm Hg at rest and PVRI > 3 jam 2 ; cardiomyopathy characterized by PAPm > 25 mm Hg at rest
                   2
and PVRI > 3     Im  ; or, the patient is scheduled to undergo right heart catheterization to assess

[0026]     In another exemplary embodiment of any of the above methods, the method further
comprises reducing left ventricular afterload to minimize or reduce the risk of the occurrence of
an adverse event or serious adverse event being pulmonary edema in the patient. The left

Detailed Description of the Exemplary Embodiments
[0027]     INOmax@ (nitric oxide) for inhalation was approved for sale in the united States by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in 1999. Nitric oxide, the active substance in
INOmax@, is a selective pulmonary vasodilator that increases the partial pressure of arterial
oxygen (PaO 2) by dilating pulmonary vessels in better ventilated areas of the lung, redistributing
pulmonary blood flow away from the lung regions with low ventilation/perfusion 9V/Q) ratios
towards regions with normal ratios. INOmax@ significantly improves oxygenation, reduces the
need for extracorporeal oxygenation and is indicated to be used in conjunction with ventilatory
support and other appropriate agents. The current FDA-approved prescribing information for
INOmax@ is incorporated herein by reference to its entirety. In particular, the prescribing
information that was current as of 30 June 2009, which, in Section 4, Contraindications, states
that INOmax@ is contraindicated in the treatment of neonates known to be dependent on right-to
left shunting of blood.

                                                  7
[0028]      INOmax@ is a gaseous blend of NO and nitrogen (0.08% and 99.92% respectively for
800ppm; and 0.01% and 99.99% respectively for 100ppm) and is supplied in aluminium
cylinders as a compressed gas under high pressure. In general, INOmax@ is administered to a
patient in conjunction with ventilator support and 02. Delivery devices suitable for the safe and
effective delivery of gaseous NO for inhalation include the INOvent@, INOmax DS@,
INOpulse@, INOblender@, or other suitable drug delivery and regulation devices or components
incorporated therein, or other related processes, which are described in various patent
documents including USPNs 5,558,083; 5,732,693; 5,752,504; 5,732,694; 6,089,229; 6,109,260;

Serial Nos. 11/355,670 (US 2007/0190184); 10/520,270 (US 2006/009368 1); 11/401,722
(US 2007/0202083); 10/053,535 (US 2002/0155166); 10/367,277 (US 2003/0219496);

(US 2004/0005367); 12/050,826 (US 2008/0167609); and PCT/US2009/045266, all of which
are incorporated herein by reference to their entirety.
[0029]      Such devices deliver INOmax@ into the inspiratory limb of the patient breathing
circuit in a way that provides a constant concentration of NO to the patient throughout the
inspired breath. Importantly, suitable delivery devices provide continuous integrated monitoring
of inspired 02, NO 2 and NO, a comprehensive alarm system, a suitable power source for
uninterrupted NO delivery and a backup NO delivery capability.
[0030]      As used herein, the term "children" (and various thereof) includes those being around
4 weeks to 18 years of age.
[0031]      As used herein, the term "adult" (and various thereof) includes those being over 18
years of age.
[0032]      As used herein, the term "adverse event" or "AE" (and various thereof) mean any
untoward occurrence in a subject, or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical
product (such as nitric oxide) and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with
such treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the
use of a medicinal/investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product.
A relationship to the investigational product is not necessarily proven or implied. However,

                                                    8
abnormal values are not reported as adverse events unless considered clinically significant by
the investigator.
[0033]      As used herein, the terms "adverse drug reaction" or "ADR" (and variations thereof)
mean any noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product related to any dose.
[0034]      As used herein, the terms "serious adverse event" or "SAE" (or "serious adverse drug
reaction" or "serious ADR") (and various thereof) mean a significant hazard or side effect,
regardless of the investigator's opinion on the relationship to the investigational product. A
serious adverse event or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in
death; is life-threatening (which refers to an event/reaction where the patient was at risk of death
at the time of the event/reaction, however this does not refer to an event/reaction that
hypothetically may have caused death if it were more severe); requires inpatient hospitalization
or results in prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant
disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or, is a medically important event or
reaction. Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in deciding whether reporting is
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately
life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject to may
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above
these are also considered serious. Examples of such medical events include cancer, allergic
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias
or convulsions that do not result in hospitalizations, or the development of drug dependency or
drug abuse. Serious clinical laboratory abnormalities directly associated with relevant clinical
signs or symptoms are also reported.
 [0035]     Left Ventricular Dysfunction. Patients having pre-existing LVD may be described in
general as those with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, including those with
diastolic dysfunction (including hypertensive cardiomyopathy), those with systolic dysfunction,
including those with cardiomyopathies (including ischemic or viral cardiomyopathy, or
 idiopathic cardiomyopathy, or autoimmune disease related cardiomyopathy, and side effects due
to drug related or toxic-related cardiomyopathy), or structural heart disease valvular heart
disease, congenital heart disease, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary
hypertension and cardiomyopathy, or associations thereof. Identifying patients with pre-existing
 LVC is known to those skilled in the medicinal arts, and such techniques for example may
 include assessment of clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure, or echocardiography
 diagnostic screening.

                                                   9
[0036]      Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, or
"PCWP", provides an estimate of left atrial pressure. Identifying patients with pre-existing
PCWP is known to those skilled in the medical arts, and such techniques for example may
include measure by inserting balloon-tipped, multi-lumen catheter (also known as a Swan-Ganz
catheter). Measure of PCWP may be used as a means to diagnose the severity of LVD
(sometimes also referred to as left ventricular failure). PCWP is also a desired measure when
evaluating pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is often caused by an increase in
pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), but may also arise from increases in pulmonary venous
pressure and pulmonary blood volume secondary to left ventricular failure or mitral or aortic
valve disease.
[0037]      In cardiac physiology, afterload is used to mean the tension produced by a change of
the heart in order to contract. If the chamber is not mentioned, it is usually assumed to be the
left ventricle. However, the strict definition of the term relates to the properties of a single
cardiac myocyte. It is therefore only of direct relevance in the laboratory; in the clinic, the term
end-systolic pressure is usually more appropriate, although not equivalent.
[0038]      The terms "left ventricular afterload" (and various thereof) refer to the pressure that
the chamber of the heart has to generate in order to eject blood out of the chamber. Thus, it is a
consequence of the aortic pressure since the pressure in the ventricle must be greater than the
systemic pressure in order to open the aortic valve. Everything else held equal, as afterload
increases, cardiac output decreases. Disease processes that increase the left ventricular afterload
include increased blood pressure and aortic valve disease. Hypertension (increased blood
pressure) increases the left ventricular afterload because the left ventricle has to work harder to
eject blood into the aorta. This is because the aortic valve won't open until the pressure
generated in the left ventricle is higher than the elevated blood pressure. Aortic stenosis
increases the afterload because the left ventricle has to overcome the pressure gradient caused
by the stenotic aortic valve in addition to the blood pressure in order to eject blood into the
aorta. For instance, if the blood pressure is 120/80, and the aortic valve stenosis creates a
transvalvular gradient of 30 mmHg, the left ventricle has to generate a pressure of 110 mmHg in
order to open the aortic valve and eject blood into the aorta. Aortic insufficiency increases
afterload because a percentage of the blood that is ejected forward regurgitates back through the
diseased aortic valve. This leads to elevated systolic blood pressure. The diastolic blood
pressure would fall, due to regurgitation. This would result in an increase pulse pressure. Mitral
regurgitation decreases the afterload. During ventricular systole, the blood can regurgitate

                                                    10
through the diseased mitral valve as well as be ejected through the aortic valve. This means that
the left ventricle has to work less to eject blood, causing decreased afterload. Afterload is
largely dependent upon aortic pressure.
[0039]      An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is a mechanical device that is used to decrease
myocardial oxygen demand while at the same time increasing cardiac output. By increasing
cardiac output it also increases coronary blood flow and therefore myocardial oxygen delivery.
It consists of a cylindrical balloon that sits in the aorta and counterpulsates. That is, it actively
deflates in systole increasing forward blood flow by reducing afterload thus, and actively
inflates in diastole increasing blood flow to the coronary arteries. These actions have the
combined result of decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and increasing myocardial oxygen
supply. The balloon is inflated during diastole by a computer controlled mechanism, usually
linked to either an ECG or a pressure transducer at the distal tip of the catheter; some IABPs,
such as the Datascope System 98XT, allow for asynchronous counterpulsation at a set rate;
though this setting is rarely used. The computer controls the flow of helium from a cylinder into
and out of the balloon. Helium is used because its low viscosity allows it to travel quickly
through the long connecting tubes, and has a lower risk of causing a harmful embolism should
the balloon rupture while in use. Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation is used in situations when
the heart's own cardiac output is insufficient to meet oxygenation demands of the body. These
situations could include cardiogenic shock, severe septic shock, post cardiac surgery and
numerous other situations.
[0040]      Patients eligible for treatment with iNO. In general, patients approved for treatment
of iNO are term and near-term (>34 gestation) neonates having hypoxic respiratory failure
associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension, a condition
also known as persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn (PPHN). Due to the selective,
non-systemic nature of iNO to reduce pulmonary hypertension, physicians skilled in the art
further employ INOmax@ to treat or prevent pulmonary hypertension and improve blood 02
levels in a variety of other clinical settings, including in both pediatric and adult patients
suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pediatric and adult patients
undergoing cardiac or transplant surgeries, pediatric and adult patients for testing to diagnose
reversible pulmonary hypertension, and in pediatric patients with congenital diaphragmatic
hernia. In most, if not all, of these applications, INOmax@ acts by preventing or treating
reversible pulmonary vasoconstriction, reducing pulmonary arterial pressure and improving
pulmonary gas exchange.

[0041]      A small proportion of INOmax@ sales stem from its use by clinicians in a premature
infant population. In these patients, INOmax@ is generally utilized by physicians as a rescue
therapy primarily to vasodilate the lungs and improve pulmonary gas exchange. Some
physicians speculate that INOmax@ therapy may promote lung development and/or reduce or
prevent the future development of lung disease in a subset of these patients. Although the
precise mechanism(s) responsible for the benefits of INOmax@ therapy in these patients is not
completely understood, it appears that the benefits achieved in at least a majority of these
patients are due to the ability of INOmax@ to treat or prevent reversible pulmonary
vasoconstriction.
[0042]      In clinical practice, the use of INOmax@ has reduced or eliminated the use of high
risk systemic vasodilators for the treatment of PPHN. INOmax@, in contrast to systemic
vasodilators, specifically dilates the pulmonary vasculature without dilating systemic blood
vessels. Further, iNO preferentially vasodilates vessels of alveoli that are aerated, thus
improving V/Q matching. In contrast, systemic vasodilators may increase blood flow to
atelectatic (deflated or collapsed) alveoli, thereby increasing V/Q mismatch and worsening
arterial oxygenation. (See Rubin LJ, Kerr KM, Pulmonary Hypertension, in CriticalCare
Medicine: Principlesof Diagnosisand Management in the Adult, 2d Ed., Parillo JE,
Dellinger RP (eds.), Mosby, Inc. 2001, pp. 900-09 at 906; Kinsella JP, Abmam SH, The Role of
Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn, in Acute
Respiratory Care of the Neonate: A Self Study Course, 2d Ed., Askin DF (ed.), NICU Ink Book
Publishers, 1997, pp. 369-378 at 372 73).
[0043]      INOmax@ also possesses highly desirable pharmacokinetic properties as a
lung-specific vasodilator when compared to other ostensibly "pulmonary-specific vasodilators".
For example, the short half-life of INOmax@ allows INOmax@ to exhibit rapid "on" and "off"
responses relative to INOmax@ dosing, in contrast to non-gaseous alternatives. In this way,
INOmax@ can provide physicians with a useful therapeutic tool to easily control the magnitude
and duration of the pulmonary vasodilatation desired. Also, the nearly instantaneous
inactivation of INOmax@ in the blood significantly reduces or prevents vasodilatation of
non-pulmonary vessels.
[0044]      The pivotal trials leading to the approval of INOmax@ were the CINRGI and NINOS
study.

[0045]     CINRGI study. (See Davidson et al., March 1998, Inhaled Nitric Oxide for the Early
Treatment of Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the term Newborn; A Randomized, Double
Masked, Placebo-Controlled, Dose-Response, Multicenter Study; PEDIATRICS Vol. 101, No. 3,
p. 325).
[0046]     This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial of
186 term and near-term neonates with pulmonary hypertension and hypoxic respiratory failure.
The primary objective of the study was to determine whether INOmax@ would reduce the
receipt of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in these patients. Hypoxic
respiratory failure was caused by meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) (35%), idiopathic
persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (30%), pneumonia/sepsis (24%), or
respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (8%). Patients with a mean PaO 2 of 54 mm Hg and a mean
oxygenation index (0) of 44 cm H 20/mm Hg were randomly assigned to receive either 20 ppm
INOmax@ (n=97) or nitrogen gas (placebo; n=89) in addition to their ventilator support.
Patients that exhibited a PaO 2>60 mm Hg and a pH < 7.55 were weaned to 5 ppm INOmax@ or
placebo. The primary results from the CINRGI study are presented in Table 4. ECMO was the
primary endpoint of the study.

[0048]     NINOS study. (See Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Full-Term and Nearly Full-Term Infants
with Hypoxic Respiratory Failure; NEJM, Vol. 336, No. 9, 597).
[0049]     The Neonatal Inhaled Nitric Oxide Study (NINOS) group conducted a double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial in 235 neonates with hypoxic respiratory
failure. The objective of the study was to determine whether iNO would reduce the occurrence
of death and/or initiation of ECMO in a prospectively defined cohort of term or near-term
neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure unresponsive to conventional therapy. Hypoxic

with a mean PaO 2 of 46 mm Hg and a mean oxygenation index (01) of 43 cm H20/mmHg were
initially randomized to receive 100% 02 with (n=1 14) or without (n=121) 20 ppm NO for up to
14 days. Response to study drug was defined as a change from baseline in PaO 2 30 minutes
after starting treatment (full response => 20 mmHg, partial = 10-20 mm Hg, no response = < 10
mm Hg). Neonates with a less than full response were evaluated for a response to 80 ppm NO
or control gas. The primary results from the NINOS study are presented in Table 2.

[0050]      Adverse Events from CINRGI & NINOS. Controlled studies have included 325
patients on INOmax@ doses of 5 to 80 ppm and 251 patients on placebo. Total mortality in the
pooled trials was 11% on placebo and 9% on INOmax@, a result adequate to exclude INOmax@
mortality being more than 40% worse than placebo.
[0051]      In both the NINOS and CINRGI studies, the duration of hospitalization was similar in
     INOmax@ and placebo-treated groups.
[0052]      From all controlled studies, at least 6 months of follow-up is available for 278 patients
who received INOmax@ and 212 patients who received placebo. Among these patients, there
was no evidence of an AE of treatment on the need for re-hospitalization, special medical
services, pulmonary disease, or neurological squeal.
[0053]      In the NINOS study, treatment groups were similar with respect to the incidence and
severity of intracranial haemorrhage, Grade IV haemorrhage, per ventricular leukomalacia,

were statistically significant when iNO patients were compared to patients receiving placebo.

[0055]      Post-Marketing Experience. The following AEs have been reported as part of the
post-marketing surveillance. These events have not been reported above. Given the nature of
spontaneously reported post-marketing surveillance data, it is impossible to determine the actual
incidence of the events or definitely establish their causal relationship to the drug. The listing is
alphabetical: dose errors associated with the delivery system; headaches associated with
environmental exposure of INOmax@ in hospital staff; hypotension associated with acute
withdrawal of the drug; hypoxemia associated with acute withdrawal of the drug, pulmonary
edema in patients with CREST syndrome.
[0056]      An analysis of AEs and SAEs from both the CINRGI and NINOS studies, in addition
to post-marketing surveillance, did not suggest that patients who have pre-existing LVD could
experience an increased risk of AEs or SAEs. Nor was it predictable to physicians skilled in the
art that patients having pre-existing LVD (possibly identified as those patients having a PCWP
greater than 20 mmHg) should be evaluated in view of the benefit versus risk of using iNO in
patients with clinically significant LVD, and that these patients should be evaluated on a case by
case basis.

Examples
[0057]      Various embodiments/aspects of the invention will now be described with reference
to the following non-limiting examples.
Example 1: INOT22 Study
[0058]      The INOT22, entitled "Comparison of supplemental oxygen and nitric oxide for
inhalation plus oxygen in the evaluation of the reactivity of the pulmonary vasculature during
acute pulmonary vasodilatory testing" was conducted both to access the safety and effectiveness
of [NOmax@ as a diagnostic agent in patients undergoing assessment of pulmonary
hypertension (primary endpoint), and to confirm the hypothesis that iNO is selective for the
pulmonary vasculature (secondary endpoint).
[0059]      During, and upon final analysis of the INOT22 study results, applicants discovered
that rapidly decreasing the pulmonary vascular resistance, via the administration of iNO to a
patient in need of such treatment, may be detrimental to patients with concomitant, pre-existing
LVD. Therefore, a precaution for patients with LVD was proposed to be included in amended
prescribing information for INOmax@. Physicians were further informed to consider reducing
left ventricular afterload to minimize the occurrence of pulmonary edema in patients with pre
existing LVD.
[0060]      In particular, the INOT22 protocol studied consecutive children undergoing cardiac
catheterization that were prospectively enrolled at 16 centers in the US and Europe. Inclusion
criteria: 4 weeks to 18 years of age, pulmonary hypertension diagnosis, i.e. either idiopathic
pulmonary hypertension (IPAH) or related to congenital heart disease (CHD) (repaired or
unrepaired) or cardiomyopathy, with pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) > 3u-m2.
Later amendments, as discussed herein, added an additional inclusionary criteria of a PCWP less
than 20 gmm Hg. Patients were studied under general anaesthesia, or with conscious sedation,
according to the practice of the investigator. Exclusion criteria: focal infiltrates on chest X-ray,
history of intrinsic lung disease, and/or currently taking PDE-5 inhibitors, prostacyclin
analogues or sodium nitroprusside. The study involved supplemental 02 and NO for inhalation
plus 02 in the evaluation of the reactivity of the pulmonary vasculature during acute pulmonary
vasodilator testing. Consecutive children undergoing cardiac catheterization were prospectively
enrolled at 16 centers in the US and Europe. As hypotension is expected in these neonatal

                                                  16
populations, the comparison between iNO and placebo groups is difficult to assess. A specific
secondary endpoint was evaluated in study FNOT22 to provide a more definitive evaluation.
[0061]     The primary objective was to compare the response frequency with iNO and 02 vs.      02
alone; in addition, all subjects were studied with iNO alone. Patients were studied during five
periods: Baseline 1, Treatment Period 1, Treatment Period 2, Baseline 2 and Treatment Period 3.
All patients received all three treatments; treatment sequence was randomized by center in
blocks of 4; in Period 1, patients received either NO alone or 02 alone, and the alternate
treatment in Period 3. All patients received the iNO and 02 combination treatment in Period 2.
Once the sequence was assigned, treatment was unblended. Each treatment was given for 10
minutes prior to obtaining hemodynamic measurements, and the Baseline Period 2 was at least
10 minutes.
[0062]     Results for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all patients who were
randomized to receive drug, indicated that treatment with NO plus 02 and 02 alone significantly
increased systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) (Table 4). The change from baseline for
NO plus 02 was 1.4 Woods Units per meters (WU-m2) (p = 0.007) and that for 02 was 1.3
                                                                                               2
WU-m2 (p = 0.004). While the change from baseline in SVRI with NO alone was -0.2 WU-m
(p = 0.899) which demonstrates a lack of systemic effect.

[0063]    The ideal pulmonary vasodilator should reduce PVRI and/or PAPm while having no
appreciable effect on systemic blood pressure or SVRI. In this case, the ratio of PVRI to SVRI
would decrease, given some measure of the selectivity of the agent for the pulmonary vascular
bed. The change in the ratio of PVRI to SVRI by treatment is shown in Table 5.

[0064]    All three treatments have a preferential effect on the pulmonary vascular bed,
suggesting that all three are selective pulmonary vasodilators. The greatest reduction in the ratio
was during treatment with NO plus 02, possibly due to the decrease in SVRI effects seen with
02 and NO plus 02. These results are displayed as percent change in the ratio (See Table 6).

[0065]     NO plus 02 appeared to provide the greatest reduction in the ratio, suggesting that NO
plus 02 was more selective for the pulmonary vasculature than either agent alone.
[0066]     Overview of Cardiovascular Safety. In the INOT22 diagnostic study, all treatments
(NO plus 02, 02, and NO) were well-tolerated. Seven patients of 134 treated experienced an AE
during the study. These included cardiac arrest, bradycardia, low cardiac output (CO)
syndrome, elevated ST segment (the portion of an electrocardiogram between the end of the
QRS complex and the beginning of the T wave) on the electrocardiography (ECG) decreased 02
saturation, hypotension, mouth haemorrhage and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The numbers
orf patients and events were too small to determine whether risk for AEs differed by treatment,
diagnosis, age, gender or race. Eight patients are shown in Table 5 due to the time period in
which events are reported. AEs were reported for 12 hours or until hospital discharge (which

                                                   20
limits the period in which such events can be reported). There is technically no time limit in
which SAEs are to be reported. So, there were 7 AEs during the study and at least one SAE
after the study.
[0067]      A total of 4 patients had AEs assessed as being related to study drug. These events
included bradycardia, low CO syndrome, ST segment elevation on the ECG, low 02 saturation,
PH and hypotension. All but 2 AEs were mild or moderate in intensity and were resolved.
Study treatments had slight and non-clinically significant effects on vital signs including heart
rate, systolic arterial pressure and diastolic arterial pressure. When an investigator records an
AE, they are required to say if (in their opinion) the event is related to the treatment or not. In
this case, 4 of 7 were considered by the investigator to be related to treatment.
[0068]      The upper limit of normal PCWP in children is 10-12 mm Hg and 15 mm Hg in
adults. In INOT22, a baseline PCWP value was not included as exclusion criteria. However,
after the surprising and unexpected identification of SAEs in the early tested patients, it was
determined that patients with pre-existing LVD had an increased risk of experiencing an AE or
SSAE upon administration (e.g., worsening of left ventricular function due to the increased flow
of blood through the lungs). Accordingly, the protocol for INOT22 was thereafter amended to
exclude patients with a baseline PCWP greater than 20 mm Hg after one patient experienced
acute circulatory collapse and died during the study. The value "20 mm Hg" was selected to
avoid enrolment of a pediatric population with LVD such that they would be most likely at-risk
for these SAEs.
 [0069]     SAEs were collected from the start of study treatment until hospital discharge or 12
hours, whichever occurred sooner. Three SAEs were reported during the study period, and a
total of 7 SAEs were reported. Three of these were fatal SAEs and 4 were nonfatal (one of
which led to study discontinuation). In addition, one non-serious AE also lead to
discontinuation. A list of subjects who died, discontinued or experienced an SAE is provided in
Table 5 below.

[0070]     Two of the 3 fatal SAEs were deemed related to therapy. All 4 non-fatal SAEs were
also considered related to therapy. The numbers of patients and events were too small to
determine whether risk for SAEs differed by treatment, diagnosis, age, gender or race. At least
two patients developed signs of pulmonary edema (subjects 05002 and 02002). This is of
interest because pulmonary edema has previously been reported with the use of iNO in patients
with LVD, and may be related to decreasing PVRI and overfilling of the left atrium. (Hayward
CS et al., 1996, Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Cardiac Failure: Vascular Versus Ventricular Effects, J
CardiovascularPharmacology27:80-85; Bocchi EA et al., 1994, Inhaled Nitric Oxide Leading
to Pulmonary Edema in Stable Severe Heart Failure, Am J Cardiology74:70-72; and, Semigran
MJ et al., 1994, Hermodynamic Effects of Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Heart Failure, JAm Coll
Cardiology24:982-988).
[0071]     Although the SAE rate is within range for this population, it appears that patients with
the most elevated PCWP at baseline had a disproportionately high number of these events.
(Bocehi EA et al., 1994; Semigran MJ et al., 1994).
[0072]     In the INOT22 study, 10 of the total 134 patients had a baseline PCWP > 18 mm Hg
(7.5%), of which, 3 subjects (04001, 02002 and 04003) had a SAE or were prematurely
discontinued from the study (30%) compared to 76.5% for the entire cohort.
[0073]     Although there were very few significant AEs in the INOT22 study, these events are
consistent with the expected physiologic changes in patients with severe LVD. The events also

                                                  22
corroborate prior observations that iNO is rapidly acting, selective for the pulmonary
vasculature, and well-tolerated in most patients. The actual incidence of acute LVD during
acute ventricular failure (AVT) is unknown. However, it is reasonable to expect that a
significant number of patients are at-risk for an increased incidence of SAEs upon iNO
treatment based upon the nature of the underlying nature of the illness, i.e., pulmonary
hypertension and cardiovascular disease more generally. Thus, it would be advantageous to
have physicians identify these patients prior to beginning iNO treatment, so that the physicians
are alerted to this possible outcome.
[0074]     Benefit5s and Risks Conclusions. The INOT22 study was designed to demonstrate
the physiologic effects of iNO in a well-defined cohort of children (i.e., intended patient
population) with pulmonary hypertension using a high concentration, 80 ppm, of iNO, i.e., one
that would be expected to have the maximal pharmacodynamics effect. INOT22 was the largest
and most rigorous pharmacodynamics study of iNO conducted to date, and it confirms a number
of prior observations, such as iNO being rapidly acting, selective for the pulmonary vasculature,
and well-tolerated in most patients.
[0075]     It is also acknowledged that rapidly decreasing the PVR may be undesirable and even
dangerous in patients with concomitant LVD. In the INOT22 study, the overall numbers of
SAEs and fatal SAE's are within the expected range for patients with this degree of
cardiopulmonary disease. The overall rate is 7/124 (5.6%), which is closely comparable to the
rate of 6% recently reported in a very similar cohort of patients. (Taylor CJ et al., 2007, Risk, of
cardiac catheterization under anaesthesia in children with pulmonary hypertension, Br JAnaesth
98(5):657-61). Thus, the overall rate of SAEs would seem to be more closely related to the
underlying severity of illness of the patients rather than to the treatments given during this study.
[0076]     The INOT22 study results demonstrate that patients who had pre-existing LVD may
experience an increased rate of SAEs (e.g., pulmonary edema). During the course of the study,
the protocol was amended to exclude patients with a PCWP > 20 mmHg. The benefit/risk of
using iNO in patients with clinically significant LVD should be evaluated on a case by case
basis. A reduction in left ventricular afterload may perhaps be applied to minimize the
occurrence of pulmonary edema.
