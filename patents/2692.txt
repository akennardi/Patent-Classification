                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0017]     The technology described herein is a fastener having features
allowing securing elements in wood, composite or other material and
providing improved performance.
[0018]     The technology includes a threaded fastener having a varied
thread angle. A first portion of the thread is formed with a first thread
angle and a second portion of the thread is formed with a second thread
angle.    In one embodiment, the first thread angle is greater than the
second and is formed in the thread at the leading or tip end of the
fastener. In addition, one or more knurls are provided in the shaft in the
threaded or unthreaded regions of the fastener. The thread may be
serrated or jagged over one or more portions of the fastener, including
the area of the first thread angle.     Various embodiments of variable
thread knurl fasteners are described herein.      One embodiment of the
fastener includes a shank having a first region with a generally
cylindrical cross-section with a helical thread, followed by a thread-free
shank section.    The first section has a first portion with a first thread
angle and a second portion with a second thread angle.               In one
embodiment, this is combined with at "type 17" screw point.
[0019]      One or more knurl sections and one or more thread angle
changes may be provided in the fastener. In one embodiment, the pitch
of the thread is constant. In one embodiment the thread extends over
the entire shank and in another embodiment, the thread covers only a
partial length of the shank. The cross-sections may be formed to a
length approximately equal to the pitch of the helical thread.
[0020]     A first embodiment      of the fastener technology will be
described with respect to Figures 1 - 6.

                                    4
[0021]     The fastener 100 of Figures 1 - 5 includes a shank 102 having
a pointed tip 104 at one end thereof and a head 140 at another end.
The shank may be formed of galvanized steel, though other materials
may be used.       The first section 116 extends from pointed tip 104 to
second section 120. The body of the shank has a minor diameter D2
(Figure 3) in first section 116. The second section 120 has a diameter
D1, which may be greater than or equal to D2.
[0022]     The shank in region 120 has a cylindrical cross-section and in
this embodiment comprises an unthreaded region.
[0023]     Two knurls 114 and 118 are provided in the respective second
region 120 and first region 116. Knurl 118 has a knurl diameter KD2
which is 1.1 - 1.3 times the minor diameter D2. Knurl 114 has diameter
KD1 which may be the same as or different than diameter KD2. In one
embodiment, KD1 has a diameter which is 1.1 - 1.3 times shank
diameter D1 and which is the same as or greater than KD2 by a ratio of
0.8-1.2.
[0024]     A first section 116 of the shank includes a helical thread 112
formed on the shank 102 extending to the tip 104. The shank in section
116 has a generally cylindrical shank diameter D2 and the thread has a
diameter D3 which is approximately 1.5 - 1.75 times D2.        The thread
112 has an effective thread height above the shank in the section 116
equivalent to ((D3-D2)/2) and a pitch P.
[0025]     In the embodiment 100, two knurls (114, 118) are provided,
but in other embodiments only one knurl is used. Where one knurl is
used, the knurl may be in the threaded section (116) or the unthreaded
section (120).     The knurls may be the same or different sizes, as
described above. Each knurl has a knurl length KL. Knurl 114 has a
knurl length KL1 and knurl 118 has a knurl length KL2. KL1 and KL2

                                       5
may be the same or different. In the embodiment of Figures 1 - 5 the
length of KL1 to KL2 may vary over a ratio of KL1:KL2 of about 1.5
0.9.
[0026]      In one embodiment, thread 112 is divided into a first length (or
region) TL1 and a second length (or region) TL2, with TL1 extending
from point 104 toward second section 120. The thread in length TL1
includes a serrated edge defined by a plurality of teeth 150 illustrated in
Figure 4. The Teeth may be formed by 90 degree gaps spaced at 60
degree intervals in thread 112.          Other serration formations may be
used. Length TL1 extends just beyond knurl 118 in section 116 of shaft
102.
[0027]      In a further unique aspect of the technology, the thread has a
variable thread angle along the length of section 116. A first potion of
the thread in length TL1 has a thread angle a while a second portion of
the thread has a thread angle P, where a is greater than P. In one
embodiment, a is 55 - 65 degrees and P is 35 - 45 degrees. The thread
angle P may be maintained through length TL2. In one embodiment TL2
is greater than TL1 by about 2.15 - 2.5 times.
[0028]      In various embodiments, the total length Li of the fastener
may vary between 4 - 12 inches. In such embodiments, for any change
in length L1, the length of section 116 remains constant, with a change
in the length of section 120 extending the length of the fastener. In such
embodiments, a length of section 116 may be about 3 inches and the
position of knurl 118 remains adjacent to section 116 irrespective of the
length of section 120.      Alternatively, additional knurls may be provided
in section 116 or section 120.
[0029]     When       constructed    in accordance      with  the  foregoing
description, the torque required to install a fastener is greatly reduced.

                                     6
Table 1 is a comparison of three different fastener constructions:           a
standard thread (column C) with no serrations or knurls, a serrated
thread    (column    A)   and   a thread/knurl/variable    thread   fastener
constructed as in the present description of Figures 1 - 6. (column B)
As illustrated therein the average torque required for comparable lengths
of penetration into a wood surface was substantially less when both the
serrated edge and knurls 114 and 118 were provided.

[0030]      Head 140 may be any standard head, but in the embodiment
of Figures 1 - 6, a hex nut head fastened to a disk 145. The underside
of the disk 145 may include nibs which help the disk engage a surface of
the product being fastened.      In one embodiment, twelve (12) locking
teeth or nibs are formed in the bottom surface of the disk.

                                   7
[0031]     Figures 7 - 11 illustrate an alternative embodiment of the
technology. The fastener is similar to that of Figures 1 - 6 except that
the thread runs the entire length of the shaft, the portion of the wider
thread region extending from the tip is longer, the serrated section is
longer and the fastener includes a "type 17" point.          It should be
recognized that a type 17 point may be utilized with the embodiment of
Figures 1 - 6.
[0032]      In the embodiment of Figures 7 - 11, a fastener 200 has a
total length L2, includes a shank 202 having a first portion 220 and a
second portion 225.     The first portion includes a tip 204, a serrated
portion of thread 212, a thread portion having a thread angle 0 which is
larger than a thread angle 7.    Region 220 has a total length TL3 is less
than the length TL4 of region 225 by about 3.5 - 3.8 times. In one
embodiment, 0 is 55 - 65 degrees and 7 is 30 - 45 degrees.
[0033]     The shank 202 has a generally cylindrical shank diameter D4
and the thread has a diameter D5 which is approximately 1.4 - 1.5 times
D4. The thread 212 has an effective thread height above the shank
equivalent to ((D5-D4)/2) and a pitch P4.
[0034]     One knurl 224 is provided in the first region 220. Knurl 224
has a knurl diameter KD4 which is 1.002 - 1.25 times the minor
diameter D4. Knurl 224 has a length KL4 which in the embodiment of
Figures 6 - 9 is equivalent to two times P4. The knurl length may be
shorter or longer.
[0035]     Helical thread 212 formed on the shank 202 extends from the
tip 204 to head 240.     In the embodiment, one knurl is provided, but in
other embodiments multiple knurls are used. Where one knurl is used,
the knurl may be in the threaded section 220 with thread angle 0, and
may be positioned just after the tip reaches diameter D4 in the threaded

                                     8
section (220). If multiple knurls are used, the knurls may be the same or
different sizes, as illustrated above.
[0036]      In one embodiment, thread 212 is divided into a first section
220 of length TL3 and a second section 225 of length TL4, with TL3
extending from point 204 toward second section 225.         The thread in
length TL3 includes a serrated edge defined by a plurality of teeth 250.
The teeth may be formed by 90 degree gaps in thread 112 positioned at
60 degree intervals.
[0037]      The screw is designed to be a self-boring screw into the
material to be fastened. However, a pilot hole may be utilized.
[0038]      A head 240 is provided at the other end of the shank 202. The
head comprises hexalobular drive head, but may alternatively take the
form of head 240 and/or have, a Phillips recess, a square or other
shaped recess formed in the top of the head 240 to receive a driver.
[0039]      Figure 12 illustrates a third embodiment of a fastener 300
wherein a first and second thread angles are used in conjunction with
one or more knurls and a serrated edge thread. In this embodiment the
thread angle $ extends for a first portion 320 of the thread, then the
thread in portion 325 has a thread angle 0, and a third portion 330 of the
thread has a thread angle K. In one embodiment, K and $ are equal. In
another embodiment, they are different. In one embodiment angle $ is
less than 0 and approximately equal to K. In one embodiment, 0 is 55
- 65 degrees and K and $ are between 30 - 45 degrees.
[0040]      The thread may extend the entire length of shank 302, or a
portion thereof. While only one knurl is illustrated, multiple knurls may
be used.
