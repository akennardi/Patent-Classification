                 GLUTAMASE INHIBITORS AND METHOD OF USE
                                   CLAIM OF PRIORITY
        This application claims priority from U.S.S.N. 61/729,321, filed November 21,
2012, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
                             BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
        Cancer cells rely primarily on glycolysis to generate cellular energy and
biochemical intermediates for biosynthesis of lipids and nucleotides, while the majority
of "normal" cells in adult tissues utilize aerobic respiration. This fundamental difference
in cellular metabolism between cancer cells and normal cells is termed the Warburg
Effect. As a result of this difference, pyruvate generated via the glycolytic pathway is
converted to lactic acid, rather than being used to acetyl-CoA and eventually, the citrate
utilized in a normal citric acid cycle. To compensate for these energetic changes and to
maintain a citric acid cycle, cancer cells rely on glutamine metabolism which is achieved
through an elevation of glutaminase activity. Exploitation of this phenomenon can be
achieved by inhibition of this elevated glutaminase activity.
                                SUMMARY OF INVENTION
        Described herein are heterocyclic containing, pharmaceutically acceptable salts,
solvates, and hydrates thereof. The compounds can be used to treat a disorder described
herein, for example, by inhibiting glutaminase in a patient. Also provided are
compositions (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions) comprising a compound provided
herewith and the use of such compositions in methods of treating diseases and conditions,
for example, that are associated with the aberrant function of glutaminase or elevated
activity of glutaminase, including, e.g., cancer.
        In one embodiment, provided is a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof:

Methods of Evaluating Compounds
         Glutaminase activity can be monitored by detecting production of either of the
products of the reaction, glutamate or ammonia. In some embodiments, glutamate
production is measured because ammonia is a product of any of a number of biological
reactions.
         Glutamate production can be measured by any of a number of standard methods
known in the art, e.g., chemical and chromatographic detection methods and coupled
enzyme assays that utilize NADH and glutamate dehydrogenase. Extracellular glutamate
concentrations can also be measured in vivo, using microdialysis methods known in the
                                          55

art. One suitable method for measuring glutamate is a microtiter-based two-step assay in
which glutamate formed in the initial step is quantitatively deaminated by glutamate
dehydrogenase to yield an equivalent amount of NADH (Godfrey et al., 1977; Kvamme
et al., 1985), which can then be detected spectrophotometrically.

and/or experiment. When the term is used in conjunction with administration of a
compound or drug, then the patient has been the object of treatment, observation, and/or
administration of the compound or drug.
Cancers
        The methods described herein can be used with any cancer, for example those
described by the National Cancer Institute. A cancer can be evaluated to determine
whether it is using a method described herein. Exemplary cancers can include but are not
limited to, lung cancer, e.g., non-small cell lung cancer; breast cancer, e.g., triple negative
breast cancer; or hepatocellular carcninoma, osteosarcoma, lipomas, chondrosarcoma, or
mesothelioma. In some embodiments, the cancer is selected from colon cancer, renal cell
carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), melanoma, and multiple myeloma.
        The cancer can be a primary tumor, i.e., located at the anatomical site of tumor
growth initiation. The cancer can also be metastatic, i.e., appearing at least a second
anatomical site other than the anatomical site of tumor growth initiation. The cancer can
be a recurrent cancer, i.e., cancer that returns following treatment, and after a period of
time in which the cancer was undetectable. The recurrent cancer can be anatomically
located locally to the original tumor, e.g., anatomically near the original tumor; regionally

the original tumor, e.g., anatomically in a region remote from the original tumor.
Cancer Combination therapies
        In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered together with
one or more additional cancer treatments. Exemplary cancer treatments include, for
example: chemotherapy, targeted therapies such as antibody therapies, immunotherapy,
and hormonal therapy. Examples of each of these treatments are provided below.
         Chemotherapy
        In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with one or
morechemotherapies. Chemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with drugs that can
destroy cancer cells. "Chemotherapy" usually refers to cytotoxic drugs which affect
rapidly dividing cells in general, in contrast with targeted therapy. Chemotherapy drugs
interfere with cell division in various possible ways, e.g., with the duplication of DNA or
the separation of newly formed chromosomes. Most forms of chemotherapy target all
rapidly dividing cells and are not specific for cancer cells, although some degree of
specificity may come from the inability of many cancer cells to repair DNA damage,
while normal cells generally can.
        Examples of chemotherapeutic agents used in cancer therapy include, for
example, antimetabolites (e.g., folic acid, purine, and pyrimidine derivatives) and
alkylating agents (e.g., nitrogen mustards, nitrosoureas, platinum, alkyl sulfonates,
hydrazines, triazenes, aziridines, spindle poison, cytotoxic agents, toposimerase inhibitors
and others). Exemplary agents include Aclarubicin, Actinomycin, Alitretinon,
Altretamine, Aminopterin, Aminolevulinic acid, Amrubicin, Amsacrine, Anagrelide,
Arsenic trioxide, Asparaginase, Atrasentan, Belotecan, Bexarotene, endamustine,

other cytostatic or cytotoxic agents described herein.
        Because some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are often
given at the same time. Often, two or more chemotherapy agents are used as combination
chemotherapy. In some embodiments, the chemotherapy agents (including combination
chemotherapy) can be used in combination with a compound described herein.
        Targeted therapy
        In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with one or
more targeted therapies. Targeted therapy constitutes the use of agents specific for the
deregulated proteins of cancer cells. Small molecule targeted therapy drugs are generally
inhibitors of enzymatic domains on mutated, overexpressed, or otherwise critical proteins
within the cancer cell. Prominent examples are the tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as
Axitinib, Bosutinib, Cediranib, dasatinib, erlotinib, imatinib, gefitinib, lapatinib,
                                          59

    WO 2014/081925                                                         PCT/US2013/071212
Lestaurtinib, Nilotinib, Semaxanib, Sorafenib, Sunitinib, and Vandetanib, and also
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as Alvocidib and Seliciclib. Monoclonal
antibody therapy is another strategy in which the therapeutic agent is an antibody which
specifically binds to a protein on the surface of the cancer cells. Examples include the
anti-HER2/neu antibody trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN) typically used in breast cancer,
and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab and Tositumomab typically used in a variety of B
cell malignancies. Other exemplary anbibodies include Cetuximab, Panitumumab,
Trastuzumab, Alemtuzumab, Bevacizumab, Edrecolomab, and Gemtuzumab. Exemplary
fusion proteins include Aflibercept and Denileukin diftitox. In some embodiments, the
targeted therapy can be used in combination with a compound described herein.
        Exemplary additional therapeutic agents can also include epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, e.g., cetuximab, panitumumab, gefitinib, erlotinib,
nimotuzamab, matuzamab, zalutumumab, or lapatinib. Resistance to EGFR inhibitors can
occur as a result of the transition of a cell to a mesenchymal phenotype or a mesenchymal
phenotype, and tumors with EGFR mutations and mesenchymal phenotype can be less
sensitive to EGFR inhibitors (see for example, Sequist et al., (2011) Sci Transl Med.
3:75. Buck et al., (2007) Mol Cancer Ther. 6: 532; Thomson et al., (2008) Clin Exp
Metastasis 25: 843).
        Exemplary additional therapeutic agents can also include glutathione depleting
agents, e.g., L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO).
        Exemplary additional therapeutic agents can also include Phosphoinositide 3
kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, e.g., Perifosine, Idelalisib, BKM 120, PX-866, IPI- 145, NVP
BEZ235, GDC0941, and BAY 80-6946.
        Exemplary additional therapeutic agents can also include Heat Shock Protein 90
(HSP90) inhibitors, e.g., geldanamycin, radicicol, 17-N-Allylamino-17
demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG). ganetespib, 4-(4-(2,3-Dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-6
yl)-5-methyl-iH-pyrazol-3-yl)-6-ethylresorcinol, AUY922 (NVP-AUY922), BIIB021,
STA9090, AT13387, NVP-BEP800, and SNX-2112 (PF-04928473).

    WO 2014/081925                                                         PCT/US2013/071212
        Targeted therapy can also involve small peptides as "homing devices" which can
bind to cell surface receptors or affected extracellular matrix surrounding the tumor.
Radionuclides which are attached to these peptides (e.g., RGDs) eventually kill the
cancer cell if the nuclide decays in the vicinity of the cell. An example of such therapy
includes BEXXAR.
        Immunotherapy
        In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with one or
more immunotherapies. Cancer immunotherapy refers to a diverse set of therapeutic
strategies designed to induce the patient's own immune system to fight the tumor.
Contemporary methods for generating an immune response against tumors include
intravesicular BCG immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer, and use of interferons
and other cytokines to induce an immune response in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma
patients.
        Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be considered a form of
immunotherapy, since the donor's immune cells will often attack the tumor in a graft
versus-tumor effect. In some embodiments, the immunotherapy agents can be used in
combination with a compound described herein.
        Hormonal therapy
        In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with one or
more hormonal therapies. The growth of some cancers can be inhibited by providing or
blocking certain hormones. Common examples of hormone-sensitive tumors include
certain types of breast and prostate cancers. Removing or blocking estrogen or
testosterone is often an important additional treatment. In certain cancers, administration
of hormone agonists, such as progestogens may be therapeutically beneficial. In some
embodiments, the hormonal therapy agents can be used in combination with a compound
described herein.

         In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered in
conjunction with one or more nutrient restricted diets. Since cancer cells rely on glucose
to generate cellular energy, lowering glucose blood levels through carbohydrate and
protein restriction may inhibit the growth of some cancers. In certain cancers, nutrient
restricted diets such as caloric restriction, fasting, and ketogenic diets may be
therapeutically beneficial. In some embodiments, such nutrient restricted diets can be
used in combination with a compound described herein.
Neuronal Disorders
         A compound or composition described herein can be used to treat or prevent
neuronal cell death as a result of an injury to neuronal tissue, e.g., nervous tissue exposed
to an ischemic or hypoxic event, to trauma or to a chronic neurodegenerative disorder. A
"neuronal disorder" is a neurological disease or disorder that is associated with glutamate
excitotoxicity, e.g., cerebral ischemia or hypoxia resulting from an neurological event
such as a stroke or ischemic event. Treatment with the compound may be in an amount
effective to provide a neuroprotective effect, e.g., to prevent neuronal cell death.
Compositions and routes of administration
         The compositions delineated herein include the compounds delineated herein
(e.g., a compound described herein), as well as additional therapeutic agents if present, in

The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in
a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3
butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are
mannitol, water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition,
sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For
this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or
diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the
preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive
oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or
suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, or
carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents which are commonly used in the
formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms such as emulsions and or
suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants such as Tweens or Spans and/or other

Patient selection and monitoring
         The compounds described herein can inhibit glutaminase. Accordingly, a patient
and/or subject can be selected for treatment using a compound described herein by first
evaluating the patient and/or subject to determine whether the subject is in need of
inhibition of glutaminase, and if the subject is determined to be in need of glutaminase
inhibition, then administering to the subject a compound described herein.
         A subject can be evaluated as being in need of glutaminase inhibition using
methods known in the art, e.g., by measuring the presence and/or activity of glutaminase
in the patient. In some embodiments, the activity and/or level of glutaminase is evaluated
in the cancer.
         A patient receiving a compound described herein can be monitored, for example,
for improvement in the condition and/or adverse effects. Improvement of a patient's
condition can be evaluated, for example, by monitoring the growth, absence of growth, or
regression of the cancer (e.g., a tumor). In some embodiments, the patient is evaluated
using a radiological assay or evaluation of hemolytic parameters.
         A patient and/or subject can be selected for treatment using a compound described
hereby by optionally, acquiring a patient sample; evaluating the sample to determine
whether the sample is characterized by i) a low level of E-cadherin expression compared
to a reference standard, ii) a high level of vimentin expression compared to a reference

standard, and/or iii) a low or decreased level of pyruvate carboxylase expression
compared to a reference standard; and if the patient is determined to have a low level of
E-cadherin expression compared to a reference standard, or a high level of vimentin
expression compared to a reference standard, then the patient is administered a compound
described herein.
        In some embodiments, the level of E-cadherin expression is compared to a
reference standard, wherein the reference standard is the level of E-cadherin expression
in an epithelial cell as characterized on any one of the following references: (Yauch et al.,
(2005) Clin Cancer Res 11:24; Savagner et al., (2010) Ann Oncol. 21(suppl 7): vii89;
Thiery et al., (2002) Nature Reviews Cancer 2(6):442). In some embodiments, the level
of E-cadherin expression is low, decreased, or absent compared to the reference standard.
In some embodiments, the level of E-cadherin expression is measured by the evaluation
of the level of RNA that encodes E-cadherin. In some embodiments, the level of E
cadherin expression is evaluated by the level of E-cadherin protein expression.In some
embodiments the level of E-cadherin expression is at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50,
60, 70, 80, or 90% less than the reference standard. In some embodiments the level of E
cadherin expression is at least a 1.5, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100 fold decrease in
expression compared to the reference standard.
        In some embodiments, the level of vimentin expression is compared to a reference
standard, wherein the reference standard is the level of vimentin expression in an
epithelial cell as characterized on any one of the following references: (Yauch et al.,

         PatientSample
         The terms "patient sample", "subject sample", and "sample" are used
interchangeably herein. The patient sample can be a tissue, or bodily fluid, or bodily
product. Tissue samples can include fixed, paraffin embedded, fresh, or frozen samples.

product; requesting analysis of the tissue fluid or product; requesting results from
analysis of the tissue, fluid or product; or receiving the results from analysis of the tissue,
fluid or product.
         The sample tissue, fluid, or product can be analyzed for the expression level of a
gene described herein, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase. The sample
tissue, fluid, or product can be analyzed for the expression level of a protein described
herein, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase. The sample tissue, fluid or
product can further be analyzed for the level of gene expression of a gene or plurality of
genes of a preselected signaling pathway or phenotypic pathway, e.g., the epithelial to
mesenchymal transition pathway, E-cadherin pathway, vimentin pathway, or the pyruvate
carboxylase pathway. The sample tissue, fluid or product can further be analyzed for the
level of protein expression of a protein or plurality of proteins of a preselected signaling
pathway or phenotypic pathway, e.g., the epithelial to mesenchymal transition pathway,
E-cadherin pathway, vimentin pathway, or the pyruvate carboxylase pathway.
         Methods of evaluating samples
         The expression level of a gene described herein, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, and
pyruvate carboxylase, can be assessed using any of a wide variety of well known
methods for detecting expression of a transcribed molecule, gene, protein, mRNA,
genomic DNA, or cDNA. Gene expression can be measured or monitored by measure of
a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA, by a measure of the quantity of a translated protein, or by
a measure of gene product activity; any of which can be measured using standard
techniques known to one of skill in the art. Non-limiting examples of such methods
include nucleic acid hybridization methods, nucleic acid reverse transcription methods,
nucleic acid amplification methods, immunological methods for detection of proteins,
protein purification methods, protein function or activity assays.
         E-cadherin
         The E-cadherin gene is located on human chromosome 16. E-cadherin is a
classical cadherin of the cadherin superfamily. The encoded E-cadherin protein is a
                                           70

    WO 2014/081925                                                          PCT/US2013/071212
calcium dependent cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein comprised of five extracellular
cadherin repeats, a transmembrane region and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail.
Mutations in this gene have been correlated with cancer, including gastric, breast,
colorectal, thyroid and ovarian cancers. Loss of function of E-cadherin is contemplated to
contribute to cancer progression by increasing proliferation, invasion, and/or metastasis.
The ectodomain of this protein mediates bacterial adhesion to mammalian cells and the
cytoplasmic domain is required for internalization. Identified E-cadherin transcript
variants arise from mutation at consensus splice sites.
         Vimentin
         The vimentin gene is located on human chromosome 10 and encodes a member of
the intermediate filament family of proteins. Intermediate filaments, along with
microtubules and actin microfilaments, make up the cellular cytoskeleton, which helps
maintain cell shape and integrity of the cytoplasm, as well as stabilizing cytoskeletal
interactions. Vimentin also functions in mediating immune responses, control of the
transport of low-density lipoprotein derived cholesterol from lysosomes to the sites of
esterification, and as an organizer of a number of critical proteins involved in attachment,
migration, and cell signaling.
         Pyruvate Carboxylase (PC)
         The PC gene is located on human chromosomes 11 and encodes the protein
pyruvate carboxylase, which catalyzes the carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. The
active enzyme is a homotetramer arranged in a tetrahedron which is located exclusively
in the mitochondrial matrix. Pyruvate carboxylase is involved in multiple cellular
processes including gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, insulin secretion and synthesis of the
neurotransmitter glutamate. Mutations in this gene have been associated with pyruvate
carboxylase deficiency. Alternatively spliced transcript variants with different 5' UTRs,
but encoding the same protein, have been identified.

         Nucleic Acid Molecules
         The methods described herein can pertain to the evaluation of a sample for the
expression of a gene described herein, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase;
based on isolated nucleic acids which correspond to the gene described herein, e.g., the
mRNA level of E-cadherin; the mRNA level of vimentin; the mRNA level of pyruvate
carboxylase. As used herein, the term "nucleic acid" or "nucleic acid molecule" is
intended to include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA molecules
(e.g., mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs. The
nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded.
         An "isolated" nucleic acid molecule is one which is separated from other nucleic
acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid molecule. An
"isolated" nucleic acid molecule can be free of sequences (such as protein-encoding
sequences) which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5' and 3'
ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic
acid is derived. An "isolated" nucleic acid molecule, such mRNA, can be substantially
free of other cellular material cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the
cell or tissue source from which the nucleic acid is derived.
         A nucleic acid molecule described herein can be isolated using standard
molecular biology techniques and the sequence information available in database records
known to those of skill in the art. Using all or a portion of such nucleic acid sequences,
nucleic acid molecules described herein can be isolated using standard hybridization and
cloning techniques (e.g., as described in Sambrook et al., ed., Molecular Cloning: A
LaboratoryManual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor,
NY, 1989).
         A nucleic acid molecule described herein can be amplified using cDNA, mRNA,
or genomic DNA as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers according to
standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid molecules so amplified can be
cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis.

    WO 2014/081925                                                           PCT/US2013/071212
Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to all or a portion of a nucleic acid
molecule can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques, e.g., using an automated
DNA synthesizer.
        An isolated nucleic acid molecule can comprise a nucleic acid molecule which
has a nucleotide sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid
corresponding to gene described herein, or to the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid
encoding a protein which corresponds to the gene described herein. A nucleic acid
molecule which is complementary to a given nucleotide sequence is one which is
sufficiently complementary to the given nucleotide sequence that it can hybridize to the
given nucleotide sequence thereby forming a stable duplex.
        A nucleic acid molecule described herein can comprise only a portion of a nucleic
acid sequence. Such nucleic acid molecules can be used, for example, as a probe or
primer. The probe/primer can be one or more substantially purified oligonucleotides.
Probes based on the sequence of a nucleic acid molecules described herein can be used to
detect transcripts or genomic sequences corresponding to the genes described herein.
The probe can contain comprise a label group, e.g., a radioisotope, a fluorescent
compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. Such probes can be used as part of a
diagnostic test kit for identifying cells or tissues which express the protein, such as by
measuring levels of a nucleic acid molecule encoding the protein in a sample of cells
from a patient, e.g., detecting mRNA levels.
        Methods for Detection of Gene Expression
        Methods of detecting and/or quantifying a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA or cDNA
made therefrom, can include but are not limited to Southern Blot analysis, Northern Blot
analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses and probe arrays. Methods of
detecting and/or quantifying a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA or cDNA made therefrom, can
include but are not limited to hybridization based methods, e.g., hybridization with a
probe that is specific for the gene transcript, e.g., mRNA or cDNA made therefrom. The
level of a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA or cDNA made therefrom, can be assayed by
                                            73

    WO 2014/081925                                                            PCT/US2013/071212
applying the sample, or the mRNA or cDNA made therefrom, or amplified from; to a
nucleic acid microarray, or chip array.
         The level of a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA or cDNA made therefrom, can be
assayed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method, e.g., quantitative PCR,
quantitative real time PCR, real time PCR, reverse transcription PCR, real time reverse
transcription PCR. The level of a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA or cDNA made therefrom,
can be assayed by a sequencing based method, e.g., quantitative RNA sequencing.
         The level of a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA, can be determined by in situ or by in
vitro methods known in the art. For in vitro methods, any RNA isolation technique that
does not select against the isolation of mRNA can be utilized for the purification of RNA
from a sample, e.g., from cells of a sample (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., ed., Current
Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New York 1987-1999).
Additionally, large numbers of tissue samples can readily be processed using techniques
well known to those of skill in the art, such as, for example, the single-step RNA
isolation process of Chomczynski (1989, U.S. Patent No. 4,843,155). For in situ methods,
mRNA does not need to be isolated from the cells prior to detection. In such methods, a
cell or tissue sample can be prepared/processed using known histological methods. The
sample can then be immobilized on a support, and then contacted with a probe that can
hybridize to mRNA that encodes the gene transcript of interest.
         Determinations can be based on absolute expression level; normalized expression
level, or relative expression level; of a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA. Expression levels can
be normalized by correcting the absolute expression level of a gene transcript by
comparing its expression level to the expression level of another gene which is stably
expressed, e.g., a housekeeping gene that is constitutively expressed. Suitable genes for
normalization include housekeeping genes such as histone H3 gene or the actin gene.
This normalization allows the comparison of the expression level in one sample to
another sample, e.g., a first sample taken from a patient to a second sample taken from
the same patient, e.g., from another tissue or at a different time point; or between samples
                                           74

    WO 2014/081925                                                            PCT/US2013/071212
from different sources, e.g., a patient sample from one patient to a patient sample from
another patient.
        The expression level can be provided as a relative expression level. The relative
expression level can be determined by comparing the absolute level of expression of the
gene transcript, e.g., mRNA, to a reference standard. The reference standard can include
the level of expression of the gene transcript of interest in a genotypically or
phenotypically defined sample. The reference standard can be the level of expression of
the gene transcript of interest, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase, in a cell
genotypically or phenotypically characterized as an epithelial cell. An epithelial cell can
be characterized as in any one of the following references: (Yauch et al., (2005) Clin
Cancer Res 11:24; Savagner et al., (2010) Ann Oncol. 21(suppl 7): vii89; Thiery et al.,
(2002) Nature Reviews Cancer 2(6):442).
        The expression level of a gene transcript described herein, e.g., E-cadherin,
vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase, can be measured at least at two time-points to determine
if a change in the level of expression has occurred. For example, the level of expression
can be measured pre- and post-treatment with a compound described herein, or at one or
more time-points while treatment with a compound described herein is ongoing. If the
expression level is found to be decreased, e.g., decreased expression of E-cadherin
compared to a reference standard and/or increased expression of vimentin compared to a
reference standard; the subject may be administered treatment with a compound
described herein. The reference standard can be the level of expression of the gene
transcript of interest in an epithelial cell characterized. An epithelial cell can be
characterized by methods known in the art, e.g., as in any one of the following
references: (Yauch et al., (2005) Clin Cancer Res 11:24; Savagner et al., (2010) Ann

based on isolated proteins which correspond to the gene described herein, e.g., the protein
level of E-cadherin; the protein level of vimentin; the protein level of pyruvate
carboxylase. This can also include the evaluation of biologically active portions,
variants, isoforms, or splice variants thereof. The native polypeptide corresponding to
the protein of interest can be isolated from the sample by an appropriate purification
scheme using standard protein purification techniques known to those of skill in the art.
        An "isolated" or "purified" protein or biologically active portion thereof is
substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or
tissue source from which the protein is derived. The language "substantially free of
cellular material" includes preparations of protein in which the protein is separated from
cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated. Biologically active portions of
a polypeptide can include polypeptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently
identical to or derived from the amino acid sequence of the protein, which include fewer
amino acids than the full length protein, and exhibit at least one activity of the
corresponding full-length protein. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a
domain or motif with at least one activity of the corresponding protein.
        Methods for Detection of ProteinExpression
        The level of expression of a protein or polypeptide can be detected and quantified
by any of a number of means well known to those of skill in the art. Methods of detecting
and/or quantifying a protein or polypeptide described herein, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin,
pyruvate carboxylase; can include but are not limited to biochemical methods such as
electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), hyperdiffusion chromatography, and the like,
or various immunoassays such as fluid or gel precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion
(single or double), immunoelectrophoresis, radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), immunofluorescent assays, Western blotting,
immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
and the like. A skilled artisan can readily adapt known protein/antibody detection

methods for use in determining whether cells express the protein or polypeptide described
herein.
        A protein or polypeptide can be detected using an immunoassay. As used herein,
immunoassays include assays that utilize an antibody to specifically bind to a protein or
polypeptide. An immunoassay can be characterized by the detection of specific binding
of a protein or polypeptide to an antibody as opposed to the use of other physical or
chemical properties to isolate, target, and quantify the polypeptide. The polypeptide can
be detected and/or quantified using any of a number of well recognized immunological
binding assays (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,366,241; 4,376,110; 4,517,288; and
4,837,168). For a review of the general immunoassays, see also Asai (1993) Methods in
Cell Biology Volume 37: Antibodies in Cell Biology, Academic Press, Inc. New York;

detection and/or quantification of a protein or polypeptide can take a wide variety of
formats well known to those of skill in the art.
        An antibody capable of binding to a protein or polypeptide, e.g., an antibody with
a detectable label (either directly or indirectly labeled), corresponding to a protein or
polypeptide described herein, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase, can be
used to detect the protein or polypeptide. Antibodies can be polyclonal or monoclonal.
An intact antibody, or a fragment thereof, e.g., Fab or F(ab') 2 can be used. The term
"labeled", with regard to the probe or antibody, is intended to encompass direct labeling
of the probe or antibody by coupling, i.e., physically linking a detectable substance to the
probe or antibody, as well as indirect labeling of the probe or antibody by reactivity with
another reagent that is directly labeled. Examples of indirect labeling include detection
of a primary antibody using a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody and end-labeling
of a DNA probe with biotin such that it can be detected with fluorescently labeled
streptavidin. The antibody can also be labeled, e.g., a radio-labeled, chromophore
labeled, fluorophore-labeled, or enzyme-labeled antibody. An antibody derivative, e.g.,
an antibody conjugated with a substrate or with the protein or ligand of a protein-ligand

encoded by the open reading frame corresponding to the gene transcript of a protein or
polypeptide described herein, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase, or such a
protein or polypeptide which has undergone all or a portion of its normal post
translational modification, is used.
         Proteins from cells can be isolated using techniques that are well known to those
of skill in the art. The protein isolation methods employed can, for example, be such as
those described in Harlow and Lane (Harlow and Lane, 1988, Antibodies: A Laboratory
Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York).
         The expression level can be provided as a relative expression level. The relative
expression level can be determined by comparing the absolute level of expression of the
protein, to a reference standard. The reference standard can include the level of
expression of the protein of interest in a genotypically or phenotypically defined sample.
The reference standard can be the level of expression of the protein of interest, e.g., E
cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase, in a cell genotypically or phenotypically
characterized as an epithelial cell. An epithelial cell can be characterized by methods
known in the art, e.g., as described in on any one of the following references: (Yauch et

Example A
        In this example, the enzymatic activity of glutaminase is measured through a
coupled endpoint assay. Glutamine and phosphate are supplied to GAC at a
concentration equal to Km and AC5 0 , respectively, and GAC concentration is adjusted to
give a linear reaction for 60 minutes. The glutamate produced is converted to 2-OG by a
kinetic excess of glutamate dehydrogenase. This second step is configured for 2X Km
                                            81

for NAD, since excess NAD is inhibitory. However, a kinetic excess of the third
coupling enzyme, diaphorase, recycles NAD from NADH to keep the NAD concentration
constant during the timecourse of the assay. Diaphorase, also supplied in kinetic excess,
oxidizes NADH produced by GDH back to NAD with the concomitant reduction of
rezasurin to the highly fluorescent resorufin. Resorufin in measured after the assay is
stopped with SDS by Ex544/Em590. A reduction in the signal indicates inhibition of
some component of the coupled enzyme system. Prospective hits are counterscreened
against GDH/diaphorase alone to remove hits to the coupling enzyme system in a second
assay.

system of the glutaminase HTS method, which comprises glutamate dehydrogenase and
diaphorase, is tested through a coupled endpoint assay. Glutamate is supplied at Km to
GDH, which then performs a reductive deamidation to produce 20G. NAD is supplied at
2X Km to the system, and its conversion to NADH is monitored by the activity of
diaphorase. Diaphorase, supplied in large kinetic excess to GDH, converts NADH back
to NAD to keep NAD levels constant in the reaction while at the same time reducing
rezasurin to the highly fluorescent resorufin. Resorufin in measured after the assay is

equivalents) was then added followed by the addition of DIPEA (3 equivalents) and
stirred for 10 min. The corresponding acid (3 equivalents) was added and the reaction
mixture was stirred for overnight at room temperature. The progress of the reaction was
monitored by LCMS. After completion of the reaction, water was added to the reaction
mixture and stirred for 10 min. The mixture was filtered through Buchner funnel, washed
with water and dried. The crude product was purified by standard procedures to afford
the desired products 1-16.
