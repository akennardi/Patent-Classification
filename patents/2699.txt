   Detailed Description
         Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming
   system having a game controller arranged to implement a
35 game.
         The gaming system presents to a player of the game a
   plurality of reels and an electronic display.        In this
                                                9939194_1(GHMatters)P80809.AU.32/02/2018

                              - 8
   embodiment the reels are mechanical, however in another
   embodiment the mechanical reels are simulated on the or
   another electronic display.    In this embodiment, the
   electronic display is of a type suitable for the display
 5 of animations.  During the game, a visual event is caused
   which involves one or more of the reels and also the
   electronic display.  The portion of the visual event that
   involves the reels constitutes a reel portion, and the
   portion of the event that involves the electronic display
10 constitutes an electronic display portion.     The reel
   portion and the electronic display portion interact, and
   may in some embodiments even give the player the
   impression that the reel portion causes the electronic
   display portion or vice versa.
15
        The gaming system can take a number of different
   forms. In a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is
   provided wherein all or most components required for
   implementing the game are present in a player operable
20 gaming machine.
        In a second form, a distributed architecture is
   provided wherein some of the components required for
   implementing the game are present in a player operable
25 gaming machine and some of the components required for
   implementing the game are located remotely relative to the
   gaming machine.  For example, a "thick client"
   architecture may be used wherein part of the game is
   executed on a player operable gaming machine and part of
30 the game is executed remotely, such as by a gaming server;
   or a "thin client" architecture may be used wherein most
   of the game is executed remotely such as by a gaming
   server and a player operable gaming machine is used only
   to display audible and/or visible gaming information to
35 the player and receive gaming inputs from the player.
        However, it will be understood that other
                                                 9939194_1(GHMatters)P80809.AU.32/02/2018

                                - 9
   arrangements are envisaged.      For example, an architecture
   may be provided wherein a gaming machine is networked to a
   gaming server and the respective functions of the gaming
   machine and the gaming server are selectively modifiable.
 5 For example, the gaming system may operate in stand alone
   gaming machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client"
   mode depending on the game being played, operating
   conditions,  and so on. Other variations will be apparent
   to persons skilled in the art.
10
        Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has
   several core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
15 arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
20
        The game controller 60 is operatively coupled to the
   reels and the electronic display(s) which are collectively
   indicated by numeral 54 in Figure 1.      The controller 60
   causes the visual event on the reels and electronic
25 display(s)  54.
        Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
30 and receive payouts, one or more displays such as the reel
   and an electronic   (or video) display 54,   a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions            (e.g. to
   place a wager),  and one or more speakers 58.
35
        The game controller 60 is in data communication with
   the player interface and typically includes a processor 62
                                                   9939194_1(GHMatters)P80809.AU.32/02/2018

                              - 10
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   displays. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
 5 Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:           a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
10  (e.g. a PC) or a server.
         A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
15 displayed representations of a game that can be played by
   a player.
         In some embodiments, the plurality of mechanical
   reels such as 15 are grouped in a block of reels.                The
20 electronic display and block of reels are presented on a
   display area.   The reels may be located above, below or to
   one side of the electronic display.    In another
   embodiment, there are two electronic displays which may
   each respectively sit above and below    (or alternatively
25 either side of) the plurality of reels.     In these
   embodiments, the block of reels and the electronic
   displays form an array.   The array may, for example, be
   either vertically or horizontally orientated, or may even
   have some other orientation.    Typically, the array
30 components are adjacent but may in some embodiments be
   spaced apart.   In an embodiment, the block of reels and
   electronic display(s) may have an arbitrary spatial
   relationship.
35       A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10 houses a bank
   of buttons 22 for enabling a player to interact with the
   gaming machine, in particular during game play.            The mid
                                                  9939194_1(GHMatters)P80809.AU.32/02/2018

                              -  11
   trim 20 also houses a credit input mechanism 24 which in
   this example includes a coin input chute 24A and a bill
   collector 24B.  Other credit input mechanisms may also be
   employed, for example, a card reader for reading a smart
 5 card, debit card or credit card.    Other gaming machines
   may configure for ticket in such that they have a ticket
   reader for reading tickets having a value and crediting
   the player based on the face value of the ticket.               A
   player marketing module  (not shown) having a reading
10 device may also be provided for the purpose of reading a
   player tracking device, for example as part of a loyalty
   program.  The player tracking device may be in the form of
   a card, flash drive or any other portable storage medium
   capable of being read by the reading device. In some
15 embodiments, the player marketing module may provide an
   additional credit mechanism, either by transferring
   credits to the gaming machine from credits stored on the
   player tracking device or by transferring credits from a
   player account in data communication with the player
20 marketing module.
        A top box 26 may carry artwork 28,   including for
   example pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.      Further
25 artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
30      The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a
   video display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.  Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
35 electromechanical device.    The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14,   or of a different
                                                 9939194_1(GHMatters)P80809.AU.32/02/2018

                               - 12
   type.
         Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative
   components of a typical gaming machine which may be the
 5 same as or different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
         The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
10 processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
15 memory 103.
         The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for
   purposes including ensuring regulatory compliance and
   monitoring player credit, an input/output    (I/O) interface
20 105 for communicating with peripheral devices of the
   gaming machine 100.    The input/output interface 105 and/or
   the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
   their own memory for storing associated instructions and
   data for use with the input/output interface or the
25 peripheral devices.    A random number generator module 113
   generates random numbers for use by the processor 102.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the
   reference to random numbers includes pseudo-random
   numbers.
30
         In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface
   120 includes peripheral devices that communicate with the
   game controller 101 including one or more displays such as
   electronic display(s) and reels 106,   a touch screen and/or
35 buttons 107   (which provide a game play mechanism),             a card
   and/or ticket reader 108, a printer 109, a bill acceptor
   and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a coin output
                                                  9939194_1(GHMatters)P80809.AU.32/02/2018

        Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with
 5 an alternative embodiment.   The gaming system 200 includes
   a network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet
   network.  Gaming machines 202,  shown arranged in three
   banks 203 of two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are
   connected to the network 201.   The gaming machines 202
10 provide a player operable interface and may be the same as
   the gaming machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or
   may have simplified functionality depending on the
   requirements for implementing game play.   While banks 203
   of two gaming machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks
15 of one, three or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
        One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
20 The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
25      In a thick client embodiment, game server 205
   implements part of the game played by a player using a
   gaming machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 implements
   part of the game. With this embodiment, as both the game
   server and the gaming device implement part of the game,
30 they collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
35 game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.    A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.

        In a thin client embodiment, game server 205
   implements most or all of the game played by a player
   using a gaming machine 202 and the gaming machine 202
 5 essentially provides only the player interface.         With this
   embodiment, the game server 205 provides the game
   controller. The gaming machine will receive player
   instructions, pass these to the game server which will
   process them and return game play outcomes to the gaming
10 machine for display.  In a thin client embodiment, the
   gaming machines could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs
   running software that provides a player interface operable
   using standard computer input and output components. Other
   client/server configurations are possible, and further
15 details of a client/server architecture can be found in WO
   2006/052213 and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of
   which are incorporated herein by reference.
        Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
20 administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208,     and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.  An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
25 network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
        The gaming system 200 may communicate with other
   gaming systems, other local networks, for example a
   corporate network, and/or a wide area network such as the
30 Internet, for example through a firewall 211.
        Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
35 plurality of different computers.  For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.  For example, the game
                                               9939194_1(GHMatters)P80809.AU.32/02/2018

   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.   Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
 5 provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Further detail of gaming system
10
        The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to
   specify the win entitlement which will be evaluated for
   this play of the game and initiates a play of the game.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a player's
15 win entitlement will vary from game to game dependent on
   player selections. In most spinning reel games, it is
   typical for the player's entitlement to be affected by the
   amount they wager and selections they make   (i.e. the
   nature of the wager).  For example, a player's win
20 entitlement may be based on how many lines they play in
   each game - e.g. a minimum of one line up to the maximum
   number of lines allowed by the game   (noting that not all
   permutations of win lines may be available for selection).
   Such win lines are typically formed by a combination of
25 symbol display positions, one from each reel, the symbol
   display positions being located relative to one another
   such that they form a line.
        In many games, the player's win entitlement is not
30 strictly limited to the lines they have selected, for
   example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
   player's selection of pay lines and are an inherent part
   of the win entitlement.
35      Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in
   other embodiments, the player may obtain a win entitlement
   by selecting a number of reels to play. Such games are
                                                 9939194_1(GHMatters)P80809.AU.32/02/2018

                             - 17
   marketed under the trade name "Reel Power" by Aristocrat
   Leisure Industries Pty Ltd. The selection of the reel
   means that each displayed symbol of the reel can be
   substituted for a symbol at one or more designated display
 5 positions. In other words, all symbols displayed at symbol
   display positions corresponding to a selected reel can be
   used to form symbol combinations with symbols displayed at
   a designated, symbol display positions of the other reels.
   For example, if there are five reels and three symbol
10 display positions for each reel such that the symbol
   display positions comprise three rows of five symbol
   display positions, the symbols displayed in the centre row
   are used for non-selected reels. As a result, the total
   number of ways to win is determined by multiplying the
15 number of active display positions of each reel, the
   active display positions being all display positions of
   each selected reel and the designated display position of
   the non-selected reels. As a result for five reels and
   fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to win.
20
        In other embodiments a player win entitlement may be
   affected by purchasing access to particular pay tables
   e.g. a first bet amount entitles the player to wins
   including cherries and a second amount entitles them to
25 wins including plums.
        In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60
   is shown implementing a number of modules based on program
   code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
30 art will appreciate that various of the modules could be
   implemented in some other way, for example by a dedicated
   circuit.
        These modules include the outcome generator 622 which
35 operates in response to the player's operation of game
   play mechanism 56 to place a wager and initiate a play of
   the game and generates a game outcome which will then be
                                               9939194_1(GHMatters)P80809.AU.32/02/2018

                               - 18
   evaluated by award evaluator 623. The first part of
   forming the game outcome is for a symbol selector 622A to
   select symbols from a set of symbols specified by symbol
   data 641 using random number generator 621. The selected
 5 symbols are advised to the display controller 624 which
   causes them to be displayed on display 54 at a set of
   display positions.
         One example of selecting symbols is for the symbol
10 selector 622A to select symbols for display from a
   plurality of symbol sets corresponding to respective ones
   of a plurality of spinning reels. The symbol sets 641 can
   specify a sequence of symbols for each reel such that the
   symbol selector 622A can select all of the symbols by
15 selecting a stopping position in the sequence. In one
   example, three symbols of each of five reels may be
   displayed such that symbols are displayed at fifteen
   display positions on display 54.   It is known to use a
   probability table stored in memory 64 to vary the odds of
20 a particular stop position being selected. Other
   techniques can be used to control the odds of particular
   outcomes occurring to thereby control the return to player
   of the game.
25       The processor may have a visual event controller 626,
   for controlling and co-ordinating a visual event.               The
   visual event controller 626 may have a sub-unit 628 for
   controlling a reel portion of the visual event         (reel
   portion controller") and another sub-unit 630 for
30 controlling an electronic display portion of the visual
   event   ("electronic display portion controller").           The
   event controller communicates with the display controller.
   The display controller may have a sub-unit    (632) for
   controlling the reels, and another sub-unit     (634) for
35 controlling the electronic display.
         In some embodiments, an eligibility criteria may be
                                                 9939194_1(GHMatters)P80809.AU.32/02/2018

                             - 19
   applied, for example that the player has made a certain
   sized wager, made an ante bet, selected all win lines,
   played sufficient games, or the player is a member of a
   loyalty program.

        The trigger event may be, a symbol combination in the
   game, occurrence of a specific symbol in the game,
   purchased, be caused by another connected system, based on
   turnover etc.
10
        A game round involves at least one of the reels being
   "spun" - e.g. new symbols of the reels are selected for
   display at the display positions and the reel is either
   physically or virtually spun to a stop. Persons skilled in
15 the art will appreciate that there may be more than one
   game round in a play of a gaming machine such as is the
   case when a series of free spins is awarded. The outcome
   of a game round may be no win, a win  (for example from a
   winning combination of symbols), a contribution towards a
20 win accrued over a plurality of game rounds, a trigger
   condition occurring etc.
   Examples of Visual Events
25      Figures 7 and 8 show flow diagrams of embodiments of
   methods executed by the gaming system.   Some examples of
   the visual events generated are now discussed.
        Figure 9 shows an example display area 14 of a gaming
30 system.  The display area comprises a plurality of reels
   15 arranged in a block and also an adjacent electronic
   display 16 located below the reel block.   The reels and
   display are constantly independently viewable such that a
   player's view of the reels does not interfere with that of
35 the electronic display, and vice versa.
        In this example, the reel portion of the visual event
                                                9939194_1(GHMatters)P80809.AU.32/02/2018

                              - 20
   comprises the reel 17  spinning and then stopping such that
   the symbol B 19 is located on a pay line when the reel
   stops.   Of course the symbol could be any suitable symbol.
   Subsequent to the reel stopping, the controller 60 which
 5 caused the reel portion of the visual event, starts the
   display portion of the visual event.   In this embodiment,
   the display portion includes an animation of the symbol B
   falling from the top edge 21 of the display to the middle
   of the display 16 at which point the symbols stops
10 falling.   The symbol may stop at some other point, such as
   along the bottom edge of the electronic display.
        In this and other examples, the symbol may not move in
   a straight line.   For example, it may follow a path that
15 comprises one or more of segments and curves.        It may take
   part in a larger animation.   It may change its appearance
   as it moves, or interact with other components of the
   larger animation.
20      In another example, in the reel portion of the visual
   event, the reel 23 stops on symbol B, and the controller
   then causes symbol B to appear below the reel 23 on the
   centre line of the electronic display 16.   It may for
   example, suddenly appear, fade in, bounce or otherwise
25 come in from a side of the electronic display, or appear
   in any number of suitable ways.
        Because the symbol B on the other reels such as reel
   25 do not fall upon a pay line there is,  at least in this
30 example, no subsequent action on the display 16.
        It will be appreciated that the relative position of
   the electronic display 16 and the block of reels 15 could
   be reversed so that the electronic display is above the
35 block of reels 15.   In this case, the reel stopping on a
   particular symbol may be accompanied or followed by the
   symbol rising from the bottom edge of the display 16, and
                                                9939194_1(GHMatters)P80809.AU.32/02/2018

                              - 21
   the symbol may stop along the mid-line or rise to the very
   top of the electronic display 16.   Generally any "rising"
   animation may be exhibited.
 5      In other examples, the symbol that appears on the
   electronic display may not be the same symbol as that is
   located on a pay line of the respective reel when stopped.
   Rather, it could be some other symbol.   The symbol on the
   electronic display 16 may be regularly associated with the
10 symbol on the reel, such as 19.   For example, a picture of
   a grinning monarch may appear on the display 16 if the
   symbol on the reel 19 is a coin.   In alternative
   embodiments, the symbol to appear on the display 16 is
   determined on some other condition in association with the
15 symbol on the pay line of the reel.   For example, a pair
   of particular symbols  should be located on the pay line
   before the display portion is triggered.
        Figure 10 shows another example of a display area 14
20 having a block of reels 15 and electronic display 16.                     In
   this embodiment, a display portion in the form of an
   animation may appear on the electronic display which is
   located above the block of reels 15.   The animation would
   appear to cause the reel to move in an indicated
25 direction, for example as indicated by an arrow such as
   27.  The reel may appear to be forced to respin and stop
   to display a specific symbol in concordance with a symbol
   displayed on the electronic display 16, possibly directly
   but not necessarily above the respective reel.
30 Alternatively, an animation may appear on the screen 16,
   such as represented by 29 which would appear to cause the
   reel indicated by the arrow 29 to re-spin.
        Figure 11 shows another example of a display area 14.
35 In this example, the block of reels  15 is located between
   a pair of electronic displays 16 and 31 above and below
   the reel block 15 respectively.   In this example, an
                                                9939194_1(GHMatters)P80809.AU.32/02/2018

                              - 22
   animation 40 in the top electronic display 31 indicates
   that the reel should spin and show a particular symbol.
   After this first electronic display portion, the reel
   spins in the indicated direction and stops to display the
 5 indicated symbol on a pay line.   Once the reel portion has
   finished, at least in this embodiment, the controller may
   cause a second electronic display portion of the visual
   effect which is the symbol on the reel and pay line being
   shown on the lower electronic display 16.   In an
10 embodiment, a tally may be kept on the lower display of
   the number of symbols of a particular type that have come
   up, for example.  Any suitable interacting event portions
   between the reels and the electronic displays may be
   similarly exhibited.
15
        Figure 12 shows another example of a display area 14
   having a block of reels 15 and an electronic display 16.
   In this example, an animation appears in the electronic
   display 16 indicated by the numeral 33.   The animation may
20 indicate that some modification should occur to the symbol
   displayed on the central pay line when the reel stops, for
   example.  In one example, the animation indicates that the
   symbol the reel has stopped at should change colours, from
   white to blue for example.   Alternatively, the animation
25 may indicate that the symbol the reel stopped at should
   change to another type of symbol.   The final state of the
   symbol after the visual event is then used in determining
   if a win or some other condition has been met.          For
   example, a different coloured symbol may indicate a
30 different amount payout.
        Further aspects of the method will be apparent from
   the above description of the gaming system. Persons
   skilled in the art will also appreciate that the method
35 could be embodied in program code. The program code could
   be supplied in a number of ways, for example on a computer
   readable storage medium, such as a disc or a memory                (for
                                                9939194_1(GHMatters)P80809.AU.32/02/2018

   of the invention that many modifications may be made
   without departing from the spirit and scope of the
   invention, in particular it will be apparent that certain
   features of embodiments of the invention can be employed
