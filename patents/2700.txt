   ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
             An irrigated balloon catheter, includes a balloon carrying contact electrodes,
   wherein a user can vary the balloon's configuration by manipulating an elongated
 5 expander that extends along the catheter and through the balloon's interior, with its distal
   end coupled to a distal end of the balloon. The expander may pass through an irrigation
   lumen to save on space within the catheter, and the expander itself may be hollow in
   providing a lumen for cables or lead wires. The expander may include flexure slits for
   increased flexibility. The distal end of the balloon includes a housing for components,
10 e.g., a position sensor. The distal end of the balloon and the manner by which the balloon
   membrane is attached to the housing present a generally flat atraumatic surface suitable
   for direct head-on contact with tissue. Longitudinal spines extend along the outer surface
   of the balloon to provide support.

                             IRRIGATED BALLOON CATHETER WITH
                           SUPPORT SPINES AND VARIABLE SHAPE
   FIELD
   [0001]     This disclosure relates to medical devices. More particularly, this disclosure
 5 relates to improvements in cardiac catheterization, including electrophysiologic (EP)
   catheters, in particular, EP catheters for mapping and/or ablating regions in the heart,
   including the atrium, an ostium and tubular regions in the heart.
   BACKGROUND
   [0002]     Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, occur when regions of cardiac
10 tissue abnormally conduct electric signals to adjacent tissue, thereby disrupting the
   normal cardiac cycle and causing asynchronous rhythm.
   [0003]      Procedures for treating arrhythmia include surgically disrupting the origin of the
   signals causing the arrhythmia, as well as disrupting the conducting pathway for such
   signals. By selectively ablating cardiac tissue by application of energy via a catheter, it is
15 sometimes possible to cease or modify the propagation of unwanted electrical signals
   from one portion of the heart to another. The ablation process destroys the unwanted
   electrical pathways by formation of non-conducting lesions.
   [0004]     Circumferential lesions at or near the ostia of the pulmonary veins have been
   created to treat atrial arrhythmias. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,012,457 and 6,024,740, both to Lesh,
20 disclose a radially expandable ablation device, which includes a radiofrequency electrode.
   Using this device, it is proposed to deliver radiofrequency energy to the pulmonary veins
   in order to establish a circumferential conduction block, thereby electrically isolating the
   pulmonary veins from the left atrium.
                                                 -1

   [0005]      U.S. Pat. No. 6,814,733 to Schwartz et al., which is commonly assigned
   herewith and herein incorporated         by reference, describes a catheter introduction
   apparatus having a radially expandable helical coil as a radiofrequency emitter. In one
   application the emitter is introduced percutaneously, and trans-septally advanced to the
 5 ostium of a pulmonary vein. The emitter is radially expanded, which can be accomplished
   by inflating an anchoring balloon about which the emitter is wrapped, in order to cause the
   emitter to make circumferential contact with the inner wall of the pulmonary vein. The coil
   is energized by a radiofrequency generator, and a circumferential ablation lesion is
   produced in the myocardial sleeve of the pulmonary vein, which effectively blocks
10 electrical propagation between the pulmonary vein and the left atrium.
   [0006]      Another example is found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,340,307 to Maguire, et al., which
   proposes a tissue ablation system and method that treats atrial arrhythmia by ablating a
   circumferential region of tissue at a location where a pulmonary vein extends from an
   atrium. The system includes a circumferential ablation member with an ablation element
15 and includes a delivery assembly for delivering the ablation member to the location. The
   circumferential ablation member is generally adjustable between different configurations
   to allow both the delivery through a delivery sheath into the atrium and the ablative
   coupling between the ablation element and the circumferential region of tissue.
   [0007]      More recently, inflatable catheter electrode assemblies have been constructed
20 with flex circuits to provide the outer surface of the inflatable electrode assemblies with a
   multitude of very small electrodes. Examples of catheter balloon structures are described
   in U.S. Publication No. 2016/0175041, titled Balloon for Ablation Around Pulmonary Vein,
   the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
   [0008]      Flex circuits or flexible electronics involve a technology for assembling
25 electronic circuits by mounting electronic devices on flexible plastic substrates, such as
                                                 -2
   3463393vl

   polyimide, Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP), PEEK or transparent conductive polyester film
   (PET). Additionally, flex circuits can be screen printed silver circuits on polyester. Flexible
   printed circuits (FPC) are made with a photolithographic technology. An alternative way of
   making flexible foil circuits or flexible flat cables (FFCs) is laminating very thin (0.07 mm)
 5 copper strips in between two layers of PET. These PET layers, typically 0.05 mm thick,
   are coated with an adhesive which is thermosetting, and will be activated during the
   lamination process. Single-sided flexible circuits have a single conductor layer made of
   either a metal or conductive (metal filled) polymer on a flexible dielectric film. Component
   termination features are accessible only from one side. Holes may be formed in the base
10 film to allow component leads to pass through for interconnection, normally by soldering.
   [0009]      However, due to variances in human anatomy, ostia and tubular regions in the
   heart come in all sizes. Thus, conventional balloon or inflatable catheters may not have
   the necessary flexibility to accommodate different shapes and sizes while having sufficient
   structural support for effective circumferential contact with tissue. Moreover, the balloon
15 may tend to buckle or bend off-axis when the balloon comes into contact with tissue.
   [0010]      Accordingly, there is a desire for a balloon or a catheter having an inflatable
   balloon that can more reliably maintain its overall spherical shape yet be variable in its
   length and radius by selective manipulation of a user.
   SUMMARY
20 [0011]      The present disclosure is directed to a catheter having an irrigated inflatable
   balloon adapted for use in regions of the heart, including, for example, the atrium, ostia
   and pulmonary veins. The balloon includes contact electrodes on its membrane, wherein
   a user may vary the balloon's configuration by manipulating an elongated expander that
   extends along the length of the catheter and through the balloon's interior, with its distal
                                                    -3
   3463393vl

   end coupled to a distal end of the balloon. The expander may pass through an irrigation
   lumen to save on space within the catheter. Moreover, the expander itself may be hollow
   in providing a lumen through which components, such as cables or lead wires, can pass
   between the balloon and a control handle. One or more segments of the expander may
 5 include flexure slits for increased flexibility along its length. The distal end of the balloon
   includes a housing for components, including a position sensor. Notwithstanding the
   housing, the balloon's distal end and the manner by which the balloon membrane is
   attached to the housing present a generally flat atraumatic surface suitable for direct
   head-on contact with tissue in the atrium.
10 [0012]      To support the shape of the balloon, and help the balloon remain on-axis
   relative to the catheter shaft during tissue contact, the balloon includes support spines that
   span longitudinally from a proximal end of the balloon toward the distal end of the balloon.
   The spines may be evenly spaced around the balloon and the length of the spines may
   span the entire length of the balloon, or a portion thereof, as needed or desired.
15 [0013]      The spines may extend through a passage provided by a protective cover or
   sleeve that is affixed to the balloon membrane.         The passage may receive and protect
   other components extending along an outer surface of the balloon.
   [0014]      In some embodiments, an electrophysiology catheter includes an elongated
   catheter shaft having a first lumen and a balloon having a membrane supporting a contact
20 electrode. The catheter also includes an irrigation tubing and an elongated expander,
   wherein the irrigation tubing extends through the catheter shaft and the expander extends
   through a lumen of the irrigation tubing. The irrigation tubing terminates at a proximal end
   of the balloon, whereas the expander extends into the balloon and is coupled to a distal
   end of the balloon at its distal end.        The expander is advantageously longitudinally
                                                   -4
   3463393vl

   movable relative to the catheter shaft to move the distal end of the balloon in changing a
   configuration of the balloon.
   [0015]       In some embodiments, the electrophysiology catheter includes a plurality of
   support spines extending longitudinally along an outer surface of the membrane of the
 5 balloon. Some spines may extend from the proximal end of the balloon to the distal end
   of the balloon and/or some spines may extend from the proximal end of the balloon to a
   location proximal of the distal end of the balloon. In some detailed embodiments, one or
   more support spines extend from the distal end of the balloon to a location distal of the
   proximal end of the balloon. The balloon may include protective covers for the spines.
10 The covers may be in the form of strips or sleeves affixed to the balloon membrane or to
   proximal tail portions of a flex circuit electrode assembly providing the contact electrode.
   [0016]       In some detailed embodiments, the distal end of the balloon includes a housing
   having a flat distal face, and an outer radial surface to which an inwardly turned distal end
   portion of the balloon membrane is affixed, in providing the distal end of the balloon with
15 an atraumatic profile.
   [0017]       In some detailed embodiments, the expander is hollow, having a lumen
   configured to receive components, including, for example, cables and/or lead wires. In
   some embodiments, the expander has a segment with one or more intermittent cuts or
   spiral slits for increased flexibility.
20 [0018]       In other embodiments, an electrophysiology catheter includes an elongated
   catheter shaft having a first lumen, and a balloon having a membrane and a flex circuit
   electrode assembly, the balloon also having a distal housing for a component with an
   electrical conduit. The catheter also includes a hollow elongated expander longitudinally
   movable through the first lumen relative to the catheter shaft, the expander having a
                                                    -5
   3463393vl

   second lumen through which the electrical conduit passes, and a distal end coupled to the
   distal housing for changing a shape of the balloon.
   [0019]      In some detailed embodiments, the balloon of the catheter includes a support
   spine extending       longitudinally along the balloon     membrane.      In some detailed
 5 embodiments, the support spine extends from the proximal end of the balloon to the distal
   end of the balloon.     In some detailed embodiments, the support spine extends from the
   proximal end of the balloon to a location proximal of the distal end of the balloon. In some
   detailed embodiments, the support spine extends from the distal end of the balloon to a
   location distal of the proximal end of the balloon.
10 [0020]      In some detailed embodiments, the balloon has an atraumatic distal end. In
   some detailed embodiments, the distal end of the balloon includes a flat distal face, and a
   distal end portion the balloon membrane is turned inwardly and affixed to the distal end of
   the housing.
   [0021]      In some embodiments, lead wires for the flex circuit electrode assembly extend
15 along the membrane outside of the interior of the balloon, from a proximal end of the flex
   circuit electrode to the proximal end of the balloon. Alternatively, the lead wires for the
   flex circuit electrode assembly can extend through the expander lumen, exit the distal end
   of the balloon and connect to distal ends of the flex circuit electrodes.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
                                             Overview
10 [0041]     Ablation of cardiac tissue to correct a malfunctioning heart is a well-known
   procedure for implementing such a correction. Typically, in order to successfully ablate,
   cardia electropotentials need to be measured at various locations of the myocardium. In
   addition, temperature measurements during ablation provide data enabling the efficacy of
   the ablation to be measured.     Typically, for an ablation procedure, the electropotentials
15 and the temperatures are measured before, during, and after the actual ablation.
   [0042]     In contrast with prior art systems that use two or more separate instructions
   (e.g., one for the electropotential and temperature measurements, and another for the
   ablation), embodiments of the present disclosure facilitate the two measurements, and in
   addition enable ablation using radiofrequency electromagnetic energy, using a single
20 balloon catheter. The catheter has a lumen, and an inflatable balloon is deployed through
   the catheter lumen (the balloon travels through the lumen in a collapsed, deflated
   configuration, and the balloon is inflated on exiting the lumen).        The balloon has an
   exterior wall or membrane and has a distal end and a proximal end which define a
   longitudinal axis that extends the lumen.
                                                 -8
   3463393vl

   [0043]      The catheter includes an elongated expander which is longitudinally movable
   relative to a catheter shaft for lengthening or compressing the balloon to alter its shape.
   The expander has a length that extends from the control handle, through the catheter
   shaft, through a proximal end of the balloon and into the interior of the balloon to a distal
 5 end of the balloon. The distal end of the balloon is coupled to a distal end of the expander
   whose longitudinal movement extends distally or withdraws proximally the distal end of
   the balloon in lengthening or compressing the balloon. The expander may pass through
   the lumen of an irrigation tubing supplying irrigation fluid to the balloon, such that the
   expander and the irrigation fluid share a common lumen as an efficient use of space
10 within the catheter.
   [0044]      The balloon also includes support spines that are positioned on the balloon
   membrane spread radially around the balloon.         Selected support spines may extend
   longitudinally from the proximal end of the balloon partially to the distal end, e.g., to an
   equatorial region of the balloon.     Other support spines, in addition to or in lieu of the
15 selected spines, may extend longitudinally from the proximal end of the balloon to the
   distal end. Alternatively, the support spines can extend from the distal end of the balloon
   partially to the proximal end, e.g. to an equatorial region of the balloon, distal to the
   proximal end of the balloon. Optionally, the support spines can be hollow and the lumens
   thereof can be used to run lead wires for the electrodes from a proximal portion of the
20 balloon to the electrodes.
   [0045]      A multi-layer flexible electrode assembly is attached to an exterior wall or
   membrane of the balloon.         The structure comprises a plurality of electrode groups
   arranged circumferentially about the longitudinal axis, where each electrode group
   comprises multiple contact and wiring electrodes arranged longitudinally. One or more
25 electrode group may also include at least one micro-electrode that is insulated physically
                                                 -9
   3463393vl

   and electrically from the electrodes in its group. Each electrode group may also include at
   least a thermocouple.
   [0046]      Using a single balloon catheter, with at least the three functionalities of ability to
   perform ablation, electropotential measurement, and temperature measurement, simplifies
 5 cardiac ablation procedures.
                                         System Description
   [0047]      In the following description, like elements in the drawings are identified by like
   numerals, and like elements are differentiated as necessary by appending a letter to the
   identifying numeral.
10 [0048]      FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of an invasive medical procedure using
   apparatus 12, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The procedure is
   performed by a medical professional 14, and, by way of example, the procedure in the
   description hereinbelow is assumed to comprise ablation of a portion of a myocardium 16
   of the heart of a human patient 18. However, it is understood that embodiments of the
15 present disclosure are not merely applicable to this specific procedure, and may include
   substantially any procedure on biological tissue or on non-biological materials.
   [0049]      In order to perform the ablation, medical professional 14 inserts a probe 20 into
   a sheath 21 that has been pre-positioned in a lumen of the patient.               Sheath 21 is
   positioned so that a distal end 22 of probe 20 enters the heart of the patient. A balloon
20 catheter 24, which is described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 2A, is
   deployed through a lumen 23 of the probe 20, and exits from a distal end of the probe 20.
   [0050]     As shown in FIG. 1, apparatus 12 is controlled by a system processor 46, which
   is located in an operating console 15 of the apparatus. Console 15 comprises controls 49
   which are used by professional 14 to communicate with the processor.                 During the
25 procedure, the processor 46 typically tracks a location and an orientation of the distal end
                                                  -10
   3463393vl

   22 of the probe 20, using any method known in the art. For example, processor 46 may
   use a magnetic tracking method, wherein magnetic transmitters 25x, 25y and 25z external
   to the patient 18 generate signals in coils positioned in the distal end of the probe 20. The
   CARTO@ available from Biosense Webster, Inc. of Diamond Bar, California, uses such a
 5 tracking method.
   [0051]     The software for the processor 46 may be downloaded to the processor in
   electronic form, over a network, for example. Alternatively or additionally, the software
   may be provided on non-transitory tangible media, such as optical, magnetic, or electronic
   storage media.     The tracking of the distal end 22 is typically displayed on a three
10 dimensional representation 60 of the heart of the patient 18 on a screen 62.
   [0052]     In order to operate apparatus 12, the processor 46 communicates with a
   memory 50, which has a number of modules used by the processor to operate the
   apparatus.    Thus, the memory 50 comprises a temperature module 52, an ablation
   module 54, and an electrocardiograph (ECG) module 56, the functions of which are
15 described below. The memory 50 typically comprises other modules, such as a force
   module for measuring the force on the distal end 22, a tracking module for operating the
   tracking method used by the processor 46, and an irrigation module allowing the
   processor to control irrigation provided for the distal end 22. For simplicity, such other
   modules are not illustrated in FIG. 1. The modules may comprise hardware as well as
20 software elements.
   [0053]     FIG. 3 is a schematic perspective view of a balloon 80 of the catheter 24 in its
   inflated configuration, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.             In a
   disclosed embodiment, where the balloon 80 is used to ablate an ostium 11 of a lumen,
   such as a pulmonary vein 13, as shown in FIG. 4, the balloon 80 extends at the distal end
25 of the catheter 24. As shown in FIG. 2A, the catheter 24 has an elongated catheter shaft
                                                -11
   3463393vl

   which may include an elongated catheter body 17, a deflectable intermediate section 19,
   and a tubular connector shaft 70. In some embodiments, the catheter body 17 has a
   central lumen, the intermediate section 19 has multiple lumens 65, 66, 67, 68 and 69 (see
   FIG. 2B), and the shaft 70 has a central lumen 74 (see FIG. 6A).
 5 [0054]      As shown in FIG. 3, the inflatable balloon 80 has an exterior wall or membrane
   26 of a bio-compatible material, for example, formed from a plastic such as polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET), polyurethane or PEBAX@. The shaft 70 and a distal end 80D of the
   balloon 80 define a longitudinal axis. The balloon 80 is deployed, in a collapsed uninflated
   configuration, via the lumen 23 of the probe 20, and may be inflated after exiting from the
10 distal end 22. The balloon 80 may be inflated and deflated by injection and expulsion of a
   fluid such as saline solution through the catheter shaft. The membrane 26 of the balloon
   80 is formed with irrigation pores or apertures 27 (see FIG. 7) through which the fluid can
   exit from the interior of the balloon 80 to outside the balloon for cooling the tissue ablation
   site. While FIG. 4 shows fluid exiting the balloon 80 as jet streams, it is understood that
15 the fluid may exit the balloon with any desired flow rate and/or pressure, including a rate
   where the fluid is seeping out of the apertures 27.
   [0055]      The membrane 26 supports and carries a combined electrode and temperature
   sensing member which is constructed as a multi-layer flexible circuit electrode assembly
   84.      The "flex circuit electrode assembly" 84 may have many different geometric
20 configurations. In the illustrated embodiment, the flex circuit electrode assembly 84 has a
   plurality of radiating leaves or strips 30, as best seen in FIG. 5. The leaves 30 are evenly
   distributed about the distal end 80D of the balloon 80.        Each leaf has wider proximal
   portion that gradually tapers to a narrower distal portion.
   [0056]      With additional reference to FIG. 3 and FIG. 6A, each leaf 30 has a proximal tail
25 31 and is connected at its distal end to a hub 32 with a central opening 39 that is
                                                  -12

   concentric with the distal end 80D of the balloon 80. The proximal tail 31 is tucked under
   and fastened to the catheter 24 by a proximal ring 28 mounted on the shaft 70. One or
   more contact electrodes 33 on each leaf come into galvanic contract with the ostium 11
   during an ablation procedure, during which electrical current flows from the contact
 5 electrodes 33 to the ostium 11, as shown in FIG. 4.
   [0057]      As shown in FIG. 7, the flex circuit electrode assembly 84 includes a flexible
   and resilient sheet substrate 34, constructed of a suitable bio-compatible material, for
   example, polyimide. For each leaf 30, an outer surface 36 of the substrate 34 supports
   and carries a contact electrode 33 adapted for tissue contact with the ostium. The contact
10 electrode 33 delivers RF energy to the ostium during ablation and/or is connected to a
   thermocouple junction for temperature/electropotential sensing of the ostium.       In the
   illustrated embodiment, the contact electrode 33 has a longitudinally elongated portion 40
   and a plurality of thin transversal linear portions or fingers 41 extending generally
   perpendicularly, evenly spaced between each other, from each lateral side of the
15 elongated portion 40. Formed within the contact electrode 33 are one or more exclusion
   zones 47, each surrounding an irrigation aperture 35 formed in the substrate 34 which is
   in communication with a corresponding irrigation aperture 27 formed in the balloon
   membrane 26. Also formed in the contact electrode 33 are one or more conductive blind
   vias 48 which are conductive or metallic formations or substances that extend through
20 through-holes (not shown) in the substrate 34 and are configured as electrical conduits
   connecting the contact electrode 33 and a wiring electrode 38 sandwiched between the
   substrate 34 and the balloon membrane. It is understood that "conductive" is used herein
   interchangeably with "metallic" in all relevant instances.
   [0058]      The wiring electrode 38 is generally configured as an elongated body similar in
25 shape and size to the elongated portion 40 of the contact electrode 33.         The wiring
                                                 -13
   3463393vl

   electrode 38 loosely resembles a "spine" and can also function as a spine in terms of
   providing a predetermined degree of longitudinal rigidity to each leaf 30 of the electrode
   assembly 84. The wiring electrode 38 is positioned such that each of the blind vias 48 is
   in conductive contact with both the contact electrode 33 and the wiring electrode 38. In
 5 the illustrated embodiment, the two electrodes 33 and 38 are in longitudinal alignment with
   each other, with all blind vias 48 in conductive contact with both electrodes 33 and 38.
   [0059]      The wiring electrode 38 is also formed with its exclusion zones 59 around the
   irrigation apertures 35 in the substrate 34. The wiring electrode 38 is further formed with
   at least one active solder pad portion 61. Attached, e.g., by a solder weld 63, to the active
10 solder pad portion 61 are a wire pair, e.g., a constantan wire 51 and a copper wire 53.
   The copper wire 53 provides a lead wire to the wiring electrode 33, and the copper wire 53
   and the constantan wire 51 provide a thermocouple whose junction is at solder weld 63.
   As illustrated, the wire pair 51/53 run between the membrane 26 and the substrate 34 and
   further proximally between the membrane 26 and the proximal tail 31 until the wire pair
15 51/53 enters the tubular shaft 70 via one or more through-holes 72 formed in the tubular
   shaft sidewall closer to the proximal ring 28, as shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 6A.
   [0060]      In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 8, the flex circuit electrode assembly
   84, may include split "island" contact microelectrodes 101A and 101B, physically and
   electrically isolated from a partially or fully surrounding contact electrode, such as "split"
20 contact electrodes 133A and 133B, respectively.           Corresponding split "island" wiring
   microelectrodes 103A and 103B are physically and electrically isolated from a partially or
   fully surrounding underlying wiring electrode 38 (see FIG. 7), which are also "split" wiring
   electrodes (not shown). Pairs of aligned contact microelectrodes 101A, 101B, and wiring
   microelectrodes 103A, 103B are conductively connected to each other by respective blind
25 vias 448A, 448B. The microelectrodes 101A, 101B and 103A, 103B are configured for
                                                  -14
   3463393vl

   impedance, electrical signals, and/or temperature sensing independently of the electrodes
   133A, 133B and 38.        In a disclosed embodiment of FIG. 8, each of the split wiring
   electrodes has its own wire pair 51A/53A and 51B/53B, and each wiring microelectrode
   has its own wire (e.g., copper) 153A and 153B.
 5 [0061]      In other embodiments of the present disclosure, the balloon includes contact
   electrodes painted on the balloon membrane, such as with a conductive ink. In certain
   embodiments, a conductive material forming contact electrodes is applied by a micropen
   or positive displacement dispensing system, as understood by one of ordinary skill in the
   art. A micropen can dispense a controllable volume of paste per time, which enables
10 control of thickness by varying print volume, paste concentration, and write speed. Such
   a system is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 9,289,141, titled "Apparatus and Methods for the
   Measurement of Cardiac Output."         Positive displacement dispensing technologies and
   direct-write deposition tools including aerosol jets and automated syringes are available
   under the mark MICROPEN by MicroPen Technologies and Ohmcraft, Inc., both of
15 Honeoye Falls, N.Y.      It is understood that the contact electrode 33 may assume any
   variety of patterns.
   [0062]     With reference to FIG. 2A, the longitudinal and radial dimensions of the balloon
   80 can be varied with longitudinal movement of an expander 90 relative to the shaft 70.
   The balloon 80 can adopt different configurations, including (1) a compressed
20 configuration C (broken lines) where the expander 90 is drawn proximally to a proximal
   position relative to the shaft 70, (2) an elongated configuration E (broken lines) where the
   expander 90 is extended distally to a distal position relative to the shaft 70, and (3) a more
   neutral configuration N (solid lines) where the expander 90 is in between its distal and
   proximal positions. In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 9 and FIG. 10, the expander
25 90 is configured as an elongated hollow tubing or rod with a lumen 93. The expander 90
                                                 -15
   3463393vl

   has a distal end 90D at the distal end 80D of the balloon and can be described as having
   at least a distal portion 90A that spans the length of the balloon, and a proximal portion
   90B that spans between the proximal end 80P of the balloon 80 and the control handle
   16.
 5 [0063]       From the control handle, the proximal portion 90B extends through the central
   lumen (not shown) of the catheter body 17, the on-axis lumen 67 of the intermediate
   section 19 (see FIG. 2B), and the lumen 74 of the connector shaft 70 (see FIG. 9). A
   segment 90S of the expander 90, e.g., at least the segment extending through the lumen
   67 of the intermediate section 19, has one or more flexure slits for increased flexibility. In
10 the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 11, the portion 90S has a spiral slit 94 in its sidewall
   that coils along the length of the segment 90S. To seal the expander 90 at least along the
   segment 90S with the one or more flexure splits, a heat shrink sleeve 95 surrounds the
   expander.
   [0064]       Throughout the length of the catheter shaft, the proximal portion 90A of the
15 expander 90 passes through a lumen 45 of an irrigation tubing 44 (see FIG. 2B and FIG.
   9) which is longitudinally coextensive with the expander between the proximal end 80P of
   the balloon and into the control handle 16.         The diameter of the irrigation tubing 44 is
   sized to provide a lumen 45 which accommodates the expander 90 and allows for
   irrigation fluid to pass through the irrigation tubing 44 and into the interior of the balloon 80
20 at the proximal end 80P of the balloon. Irrigation fluid delivered into the balloon can exit
   the balloon through the irrigation apertures 27 formed in the balloon membrane 26 and the
   irrigation apertures 35 formed in the flex circuit substrate 34 to cool surrounding tissue
   (see FIG. 4).
   [0065]       In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 9 and FIG. 12, the proximal end 80P of the
25 balloon includes an outer proximal ring 28 circumferentially surrounding a distal end 44D
                                                   -16
   3463393vl

   of the irrigation tubing 44. Sandwiched between the ring 28 and the distal end 44D are
   several components of the balloon 80, as described further below, which are affixed within
   the ring 28 with adhesive 105, e.g., epoxy. The proximal end 80P of the balloon includes
   an annular plug 106 filling the gap in the lumen 74 between the shaft 70 and the irrigation
 5 tubing 44. Adhesive (not shown) may be applied between an inner surface of the balloon
   membrane 26 and an outer surface of the shaft 70 to provide a fluid tight seal at the
   proximal end 80P. Adhesive (not shown) may also be applied between the plug 106 and
   an inner surface of the shaft 70 and/or an outer surface of the irrigation tubing 44 to
   provide a fluid tight seal at the proximal end 80P.
10 [0066]      With the distal end of the irrigation tubing 44 terminating at the proximal end
   80P of the balloon 80, the distal portion 90A of expander extending through an interior of
   the balloon 80, is without the irrigation tubing 44. In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 10,
   the distal end 80D of the balloon includes a sensor housing 85 having a hollow cylindrical
   body which has a passage 86 receiving the distal end 90D of the expander 90.               For
15 example, laser welding 79 secures the attachment and coupling of the distal end 90D and
   the housing 85. An interior 87 of the housing 85 houses an electromagnetic position
   sensor 88 whose cable 89 extends proximally through the lumen 93 of the expander 90
   along the length of the catheter shaft and into the control handle 16. A distal end of the
   housing 85 includes a distal member 96 having a flat distal face 96D, that is affixed by
20 adhesive 98A which also seals the interior 87 against fluid leaks. In some embodiments,
   the distal member 96 is configured as a distal tip electrode whose lead wire (not shown)
   may also pass proximally to the control handle via the distal passage 86 and through the
   lumen 93 of the expander 90. Optionally, lead wires for the various electrodes can be
   routed through lumen 93 and out of housing 85 at its distal end and into contact with the
                                                  -17
   3463393vl

   electrodes. The housing 85 may be constructed of any suitable material, including, for
   example, stainless steel, braided shafts, and the like.
   [0067]     In the disclosed embodiment, the housing 85 includes a cover 97 configured,
   e.g., as short tubing, circumferentially surrounding the housing body. An outer surface of
 5 the housing body may include a texture 85T with an uneven surface to better hold
   adhesive 98B affixing the cover 97 to the housing 85. Affixed to an outer radial surface of
   the cover 97 of the housing 85 by adhesive 98C is a distal end portion 26D of the balloon
   membrane 26 turned inwardly such that an outer surface 26A of the membrane 26 is
   affixed to the outer radial surface of the cover 97. Accordingly, the inward turn of the
10 balloon membrane 26D and the flat distal face 96D of the distal member 96
   advantageously provide the distal end 80D of the balloon with an atraumatic distal profile,
   as shown in FIG. 3, which can contact tissue head-on without damaging tissue. With the
   balloon membrane distal end 26D affixed to the housing 85 and the housing 85 affixed to
   the distal end 90D of the expander, longitudinal movement of the expander 90 at its
15 proximal end (either within the control handle 16, or proximal of the control handle) by a
   user can vary the configuration of the balloon, by elongating or compressing the balloon's
   longitudinal profile, as shown in FIG. 2A. Moreover, the encased position sensor 88 is
   configured to generate electrical signals representative of the position of the distal end
   80D.
20 [0068]     With reference to FIGS. 6A and 6B, the balloon 80 includes a plurality of
   elongated longitudinal supports or "spines" 81 extending radially from a proximal or distal
   end of the balloon 80 to a location on the outer surface of the balloon membrane 26
   proximal to the distal end, or distal to the proximal end. That is, the ends of the spines fall
   around an equatorial portion of the balloon. The support spines 81 are made of a suitable
25 material with shape-memory, for example, nitinol. The spines may have any suitable
                                                 -18
   3463393vl

   cross-sectional shape, e.g., rectangular or circular, and can be hollow, and are pre
   shaped with a curvature to ensure that the balloon 80 assumes a generally spherical
   configuration when deployed from the distal end of the shaft 70 and especially when
   inflated with irrigation fluid. In some embodiments, each spine 81 is covered by a cover
 5 82 configured, e.g., as a strip or a sleeve, that is affixed to an outer surface of the balloon
   membrane 26 and provides an interior passage through which the spine 81 extends. A
   distal end of the passage is sealed, e.g., by a plug of polyurethane 83. A proximal portion
   of each sleeve 82, along with a proximal portion of the respective spine 81, is tucked
   under and fastened to the balloon 80 by the proximal ring 28.
10 [0069]      It is understood that the lengths of the sleeves 82 and the spines 81 may be
   different for different embodiments, as appropriate or desired. Likewise, the placement of
   the sleeves and the spines on the balloon 80 may be different for different embodiments,
   as appropriate or desired.      In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 3 and FIG. 6A, each
   sleeve 82 and each spine 81 have a length generally equal to the length of a tail 31.
15 Moreover, each sleeve 82 is affixed to an outer surface of a respective tail 31, so that
   each spine 81 is generally coextensive with a respective tail 31, which in turn, cover lead
   wires 51, 53 from the flex circuit electrode assembly, as shown in FIG. 13. The lead wires
   51, 53 may be covered by a nonconductive protective cover to form a lead wire ribbon
    102. Spines and sleeves may also lie along fold lines 76 of the balloon membrane in
20 addition to or in lieu of the spines 81 and sleeves 82, as needed or desired. As such,
   these spines reinforce a proximal hemisphere of the balloon 80 so that the balloon 80 can
   better remain on axis relative to the shaft 70 when the balloon 80 contacts the ostium.
   [0070]      In another embodiment, as shown in FIG. 14 and FIG. 15, the balloon 80
   includes spines 91 that extend the length of the balloon generally spanning both proximal
25 and distal hemispheres of the balloon 80 between the distal and proximal ends 80D and
                                                   -19
   3463393vl

   80P. Each spine extends through a cover 92, e.g., strips or sleeves, that is affixed to the
   outer surface of the balloon membrane 26 and provides an interior passage through which
   the spine 92 extends.         A distal end of the passage is sealed, e.g., by a plug of
   polyurethane 83. The spines 91 in their covers 92 extend between the leaves 30 and the
 5 spines 81, e.g., lying on the fold lines 76. The spines 91 may be in addition to and/or in
   lieu of the spines 81, as appropriate or desired, in supporting the shape of the balloon.
   [0071]      The interior of the covers 82 and 92 may be shaped and sized to accommodate
   additional components, such as lead wires or cables, which would be protected and/or
   insulated from exposure to the patient's bodily fluids or irrigation fluid entering and exiting
10 the interior of the balloon.
   [0072]      In some embodiments, the catheter includes a deflection puller wire 43 that
   extends through the central lumen of the catheter body 17, and the lumen 68 of
   intermediate section 19, the latter shown in FIG. 2B. A proximal end (not shown) of the
   puller wire is anchored in the control handle, and a distal end terminating in a T-bar 43T is
15 anchored in a sidewall of the lumen 68 at or near a distal end of the multi-lumened
   intermediate section 19 (see FIG. 12). As understood in the art, a compression coil (not
   shown) surrounds the portion of the deflection puller wire extending through the catheter
   body 17, and has a distal end terminating generally at junction between the catheter body
    17 and the intermediate section 19. The control handle includes a deflection mechanism
20 (not shown) that acts on the puller wire to draw it proximally for deflecting the catheter.
   [0073]      As shown in FIG. 9, the lead wires 51 and 53 leading from the flex circuit leaves
   30 enter the lumen 74 of the connector shaft 70 via the one or more through-holes 72
   situated at different radial locations around the connector shaft 70. Depending on factors,
   including, e.g., the plurality of leaves 30, the plurality of contact electrodes 33 and wiring
25 electrodes 38, microelectrodes 101 and 103, the plurality of through-holes 72 varies, as
                                                 -20

   desired or appropriate, to accommodate the plurality of lead wires 51 and 53.         In any
   event, the lead wires 51 and 53 pass into the lumen 65 and/or the lumen 66 of the
   intermediate section 19, as shown in FIG. 2B, and further proximally into the center lumen
   (not shown) of the catheter body 19. The holes 72 and the wires 51 and 53 may be
 5 protected and sealed by a suitable adhesive, e.g., epoxy. Moreover, the proximal ring 28
   (as shown in broken lines in FIG. 9) may be sized to cover the holes and the wires, and
   sealed with a suitable adhesive.
