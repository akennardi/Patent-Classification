SYNERGISTIC COMBINATION OF A CHLOROTOLURON AND IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLCARBAMATE (IPBC)
FOR DRY FILM PROTECTION
[0001]       The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent
application number 2014265887, which claims priority to United States Provisional Patent
Application Serial No. 61/806,090, filed 28 March 2013, the entirety of which are
incorporated by reference herein.
[0001a]      This invention relates to combinations of antimicrobial compounds and their uses
in dry film protection applications, the combinations having unexpectedly greater activity
than would be expected for the use of both of the individual antimicrobial compounds.
[0002]       Use of combinations of at least two antimicrobial compounds can broaden
potential markets, reduce use concentrations and costs, and reduce waste. In some cases,
commercial antimicrobial compounds cannot provide effective control of microorganisms,
even at high use concentrations, due to weak activity against certain types of microorganisms,
e.g., those resistant to some antimicrobial compounds. Combinations of different
antimicrobial compounds are sometimes used to provide overall control of microorganisms in
a particular end user environment. For example, WO 1998/121962 discloses combinations of
3-Iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate and pyrithione, but this reference does not suggest any of
the combinations claimed herein. Moreover, there is a need for additional combinations of
antimicrobial compounds with relatively low impact on health and/or the environment. The
problem addressed by this invention is to provide such additional combinations of
antimicrobial compounds.
[0003]       Antimicrobial compounds are sometimes included in liquid coating compositions
that are applied to a substrate and that become dry films. It is desirable that such dry films
control surface fungi and algae and that such dry films also present as little adverse effect as
possible on health and the environment.
[0003a]      The discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like is
included in this specification solely for the purpose of providing a context for the present
invention. It is not suggested or represented that any or all of these matters formed part of the
prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present
invention as it existed before the priority date of each claim of this application.
[0003b]      Where the terms "comprise", "comprises", "comprised" or "comprising" are used
in this specification (including the claims) they are to be interpreted as specifying the
presence of the stated features, integers, steps or components, but not precluding the presence
of one or more other features, integers, steps or components, or group thereof.

                                                la
[0004]      In the present invention there is provided a synergistic antimicrobial composition
comprising chlorotoluron and 3-Iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate (also known as
iodopropynyl butylcarbamate) (CAS registry number is 55406-53-6).
[0005]       The invention further provides a method of inhibiting the growth of or controlling
the growth of microorganisms in a building material, the method comprising the step of
adding a synergistic antimicrobial composition comprising chlorotoluron and 3-Iodo-2
propynyl butylcarbamate; wherein the weight ratio of the 3-Iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate
to chlorotoluron is from 1:5 to 2:1.
[0006]       The present invention further comprises a coating composition comprising a
synergistic antimicrobial composition comprising chlorotoluron and 3-Iodo-2-propynyl
butylcarbamate. The coating composition of the present invention may also comprise a
synergistic antimicrobial composition comprising chlorotoluron and 3-Iodo-2-propynyl

 WO 2014/186061                                                                PCT/US2014/032218
                                                  2
butylcarbamate; wherein the weight ratio of the 3-Iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate to
chlorotoluron is from 1:5 to 2:1.
[0007]    Lastly, the present invention provides a dry film made by a process comprising
applying a layer of the coating composition comprising a synergistic antimicrobial
composition comprising chlorotoluron and 3-Iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate; wherein the
weight ratio of the 3-Iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate to chlorotoluron is from 1:5 to 2:1 to a
substrate and drying the coating composition or allowing the coating composition to dry.
[0008]    The following is a detailed description of the invention.
[0009] As used herein, the following terms have the designated definitions, unless the context
clearly indicates otherwise.
[0010] The term "antimicrobial compound" refers to a compound capable of inhibiting the
growth of or controlling the growth of microorganisms; antimicrobial compounds include
bactericides, bacteriostats, fungicides, fungistats, algaecides and algistats, depending on the
dose level applied, system conditions and the level of microbial control desired. Such term
"antimicrobial compound" as used herein is synonymous with the term "biocide".
[0011] The term "microorganism" includes, for example, fungi (such as yeast and mold),
bacteria and algae.
[0012] The following abbreviations are used throughout the specification: ppm = parts per
million by weight (weight/weight), mL = milliliter, ATCC = American Type Culture
Collection, and MIC = minimum inhibitory concentration.
[0013] Unless otherwise specified, temperatures are in degrees centigrade ('C), and
references to percentages are by weight (wt%). Percentages of antimicrobial compounds in
the composition of this invention are based on the total weight of active ingredients in the
composition, i.e., the antimicrobial compounds themselves, exclusive of any amounts of
solvents, carriers, dispersants, stabilizers or other materials which may be present.
[0014] As used herein, "IPBC" is 3-Iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate (CAS registry number
55406-53-6).
[0015] When a ratio is the herein to be "X:1 or higher," it is meant that the ratio is Y:1, where
Y is X or greater, and when a ratio is the herein to be X: 1 or lower," it is meant that the ratio
is Z:1, where Z is X or less. The same logic follows for ratios that are "1:X or higher" and
"1:X or lower".
[0016]      Chlorotoluron is an herbicide, N'-(3-chloro-4-methylphenyl)-NN-dimethylurea or
3-(3-chloro-p-tolyl)-1,1-dimethylurea represented by CioH 13ClN20 (registry number 15545
48-9).

 WO 2014/186061                                                               PCT/US2014/032218
                                                  3
[0017] Chlorotoluron has relatively low solubility in water. This relatively low solubility in
water is preferred for an antimicrobial material that may be included in a coating composition
or other building material, because dried coatings and building materials are exposed to
water, which could tend to remove a highly soluble compound from the dried coating or the
building material.
[0018] The present invention involves a composition that contains both chlorotoluron and 3
Iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate. It has been surprisingly found that such a composition is
synergistically effective as a biocide. It has been especially surprisingly found that
compositions that contain both chlorotoluron and IPBC are synergistically effective as
biocides.
[0019] When IPBC is present, preferably the weight ratio of IPBC to chlorotoluron
compound is preferably 1:5 to 2:1.
[0020] The mixture of chlorotoluron and IPBC may be included in a coating composition.
Chlorotoluron and IPBC may be added to the coating composition separately or as a mixture
or any combination thereof. Preferred coating compositions are liquid. Coating
compositions may be aqueous or non-aqueous. Aqueous coating compositions generally
contain 30% or more water by weight of the mixture, based on the weight of the coating
composition.
[0021] Among embodiments in which chlorotoluron and IPBC are included in paint or other
coating composition, preferred coating compositions are liquid compositions, especially
compositions that contain dispersions of polymers in aqueous media.
[0022] In addition to paints and other coating compositions such as marine anti-fouling, the
antimicrobial compound combinations of the present invention are particularly useful in
preservation of building materials, e.g., adhesives, caulk, joint compound, sealant, wallboard,
etc., polymers, plastics, synthetic and natural rubber, paper products, fiberglass sheets,
insulation, exterior insulating finishing systems, roofing and flooring felts, building plasters,
bricks, mortar, gypsum board, wood products and wood-plastic composites. When an
antimicrobial compound combination of the present invention is present in a building
material, it is preferred that some or all of the antimicrobial compound combination is present
at the surface of the building material or near enough to the surface of the building material to
inhibit microbial growth on that surface.
[0023] In some embodiments, latex paints or other liquid coating compositions are used that
contain the antimicrobial compound combinations disclosed herein.

 WO 2014/186061                                                              PCT/US2014/032218
                                                 4
[0024] Coating compositions are designed so that a layer of the coating composition can
readily be applied to a substrate and then dried or allowed to dry to form a dry film. Coating
compositions contain a binder. Binders contain one or more of the following: one or more
polymer, one or more oligomer, and/or one or more monomer. Oligomers and monomers in
binders are designed to polymerize and/or crosslink during or after the formation of the dry
film. Polymers in a binder may or may not be designed to crosslink during or after the
formation of the dry film.
[0025] Coating compositions optionally contain one or more pigment. A pigment is a
mineral or an organic substance in the form of small solid particles. Pigments provide full or
partial opacity to the dry film.
[0026] The antimicrobial compound combinations are useful for preservation of the dry film
coating resulting after application of paint or other liquid coating composition. Preferably,
the antimicrobial composition is an aqueous latex paint comprising one or more of the
antimicrobial compound combinations disclosed herein, or the dry film coating resulting from
application of the paint to a surface. An aqueous latex paint is an aqueous liquid coating
composition in which the binder is a polymer in the form of a latex (i.e., in the form of
polymer particles dispersed throughout the water). More preferred are aqueous latex paints in
which the binder contains one or more acrylic polymer.
[0027] Typically, the amount of the antimicrobial compound combinations of the present
invention to control the growth of microorganisms is from 100 ppm to 25,000 ppm active
ingredient. For example, in the present invention, chlorotoluron plus IPBC is present in an
amount from 100 ppm to 25,000 ppm. The antimicrobial combinations of the composition
are present in an amount of at least 100 ppm and no more than 20,000 ppm, preferably no
more than 18,000 ppm, preferably no more than 16,000 ppm, preferably no more than 14,000
ppm, preferably no more than 12,000 ppm, preferably no more than 10,000 ppm, preferably
no more than 8,000 ppm, preferably no more than 6,000 ppm, preferably no more than 5,000
ppm, preferably no more than 4,000 ppm, preferably no more than 3,000 ppm, preferably no
more than 2500 ppm, and preferably no more than 2,000 ppm. Concentrations mentioned
above are in a liquid coating composition containing the antimicrobial compound
combinations; antimicrobial compound combination levels in the dry film coating will be
higher.
[0028] The present invention also encompasses a method for preventing microbial growth in
building materials, especially in dry film coatings, by incorporating any of the claimed
antimicrobial compound combinations into the materials.

                                                 5
[0029] Typically, the antimicrobial compositions are used to inhibit growth of algae and/or
fungi.
[0030] The composition of the present invention contains chlorotoluron and IPBC. It is
contemplated that some embodiments may contain one or more additional antimicrobial
compound.
[0031] The following are examples of the present invention.
[0032] Sample preparation for antimicrobial testing was performed as follows:
[0033] Slurries containing 33% antimicrobial active ingredient (chlorotoluron) were post
added to a white, acrylic/silicone based outdoor paint free of biocides to give a total active
ingredient concentration of 10000 and 1000 ppm respectively. ROCIMAM 250 (40% IPBC)
was post added to a white, acrylic/silicone based outdoor paint free of biocides to give a total
active ingredient concentration of 10000 and 1000 ppm respectively. These paints were then
diluted with an antimicrobial free acrylic/silicone based paint and mixed to prepare targeted
concentrations of antimicrobial compounds for the testing. The total biocides concentrations
tested were 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 ppm. After biocides addition or dilution, the
paints were mixed 90 seconds with the horse power shaker (AXEL 75M3372/ Agitateur SO
10MI) until uniformity was achieved. Paints containing different antimicrobial compounds at
the same levels were mixed together in order to obtain the desired ratio of antimicrobial
compounds. After one day, the paints were applied to Schleicher & Schuell filter paper at
280pm wet film thickness and dried for 3 days at room temperature avoiding direct exposure
to sunlight. Square discs (1.6 cm x 1.6 cm) were cut out from each panel and were used as the
substrate for algal efficacy tests. This sample size allowed for an agar border when the
sample disc was placed into the well of the test plate.
[0034] Algal Efficacy Testing:
[0035] Algal efficacy was tested according to modified ASTM 5589 which is a standard
accelerated test method for determining resistance of various coatings (including paints) to
algal defacement. To accommodate for high-throughput screening, this method was scaled
down from petri dishes to 6-well plates. Bold Modified Basal Freshwater Nutrient Solution
was used as growth medium. A single coated filter paper coupon was placed with a pair of
sterile forceps at the center of the agar plug (on top) with the painted surface facing upwards.
Algal inoculum was prepared by mixing equal concentrations (lx 106 cfu/ml) and equal
volumes of exponentially growing algae cultures.

[0037] Each well that contains a tested coupon was inoculated with 1750 pl of algal
suspensions (lx 106 cfu/ml) making sure that the whole surface (paint film as well as the agar
surrounding it) was evenly covered. The plates were incubated at room temp (21 C - 25 C)
with cyclic exposure to light and dark phases, for a period of three weeks. The total area
inhibited was evaluated at the end of each week according to percent area covered in 5%
increments.
[0038] At the end of the three week incubation period, the samples were scored for percent
inhibition regarding color intensity compared to the blank sample.
[0039] The Synergy Index calculation was performed as follows.
[0040] The SI is calculated based on F.C.Kull et. Al. method (Applied Microbiology, Vol. 9
(1961). In this study, SI was calculated based on the following formula with the minimum
inhibitory concentration chosen based on the percent inhibitory exhibited by the individual
antimicrobial against each microorganisms tested.
                        SI= Qa/QA+Qb/QB
                        Qa = the concentration of Antimicrobial A in the blend
                        QA = the concentration of Antimicrobial A as the only biocide
                        Qb = the concentration of Antimicrobial B in the blend
                        QB = the concentration of Antimicrobial B as the only antimicrobial
[0041] SI value of < 1 in the formula indicates a synergism of the blended biocides exists.
[0042] Note: If any of the active with maximum concentration tested did not exhibit some
inhibition, this maximum concentration is used to calculate the estimated SI and a sign of less
than (<) is included to take into account that higher concentration of the active
(e.g. chlorotoluron) is needed to achieve the targeted inhibition. The minimal targeted
inhibition was set at 75%, meaning a coupon with at least 75% algal growth inhibition was
considered as a pass.
