DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Embodiment 1
[0022] Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the
accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a diagram illustrating a decoration forming toy set 1. The
decoration forming toy set 1 includes a pastry bag 2 and a base 3. When a user squeezes a
creamy substance 4 filled in a container 20 of the pastry bag 2 so as to move the creamy
substance 4 from a rear side (an upper side in the drawing) of the container 20 to a front side (a
lower side in the drawing), the creamy substance 4 can be squeezed out through an opening 631
of a nozzle 60 disposed at the tip. The squeezed creamy substance 4 is placed on an upper plate
31 of the base 3, and thus, a decoration toy simulating a pastry or the like decorated with fresh
cream can be formed.
[0023] Now, the decoration forming toy set 1 using a cream resin as the creamy substance 4 and
applying the pastry bag 2 to a decoration forming toy mainly to be enjoyed by children will be
described. It is noted that the pastry bag 2 of the present embodiment may be filled with, instead
of the cream resin, a creamy substance, such as whipped cream, to be used for general food. In

                                                    5
this case, the pastry bag 2 can be used for decorating food such as sponge cake instead of the
base 3.
[0024] Fig. 2 is an exploded perspective view of the pastry bag 2. In the following description
of the pastry bag 2, a side closer to the container 20 is designated as the rear side, and a side
closer to the nozzle 60 is designated as the front side. The pastry bag 2 includes the container
20, a connecting section 40, an auxiliary member 50, the nozzle 60, and a cap 70. The container
20 is formed by placing two flexible sheet members of a polyvinyl chloride resin or the like in a
front surface side and a rear surface side of the drawing as illustrated mainly in Fig. 1 to be put
on top of each other, and by adhering sides 21 through thermocompression bonding or the like.
A front portion 201 of the container 20 is formed to have a width increasing from its front side
end toward its rear side end. A rear portion 202 of the container 20 is formed to have
substantially the same width. Also at a rear side end 22 of the container 20, the two overlaid
sheet members are caused to adhere to each other by the thermocompression bonding or the like
so that the container 20 can be closed in the shape of a bag.
[0025] The container 20 thus formed is filled with the creamy substance 4 in a vacuum state.
The creamy substance 4 simulates whipped cream, and can contain, for example, a synthetic
sizing agent, an acrylic resin, a cellulose, a stabilizer, a preservative and the like. Accordingly,
when exposed to the air and dried, the creamy substance 4 is cured. Besides, the creamy
substance 4 may be colored by adding a coloring agent thereto.
[0026] As shown in Fig. 2, the connecting section 40 has a rear portion 41 and a front portion 42
having an outer diameter smaller than that of the rear portion 41, and is formed in a substantially
cylindrical shape as a whole. The rear portion 41 is formed to have a diameter decreasing toward
the front side (downward in the drawing). In a rear edge of the rear portion 41, a flange 411 is
formed over the whole circumference. On the outer circumferential surface of the rear portion
41, a plurality of ridges 412 having a larger diameter than the outer circumferential surface are
formed to extend the circumferential direction. The plural ridges 412 are disposed in the front
to-rear direction.
[0027] The container 20 has an opening 23 at the front end. The opening 23 is connected to the
connecting section 40. The opening 23 is formed by the two sheet members adhering to each
other in the sides 21 excluding their front ends. Besides, in the vicinity of the opening 23, the

                                                   6
sides 21 are caused to adhere to each other so that the inner edge of the opening 23 can adhere
tightly to the rear portion 41 of the connecting section 40. Since the ridges 412 provided on the
rear portion 41 are caused to tightly adhere to the inside of the opening 23, the creamy substance
4 can be prevented from leaking through a gap otherwise formed between the outer
circumferential surface of the rear portion 41 and the opening 23.
[0028] A male screw portion 421 is formed on the outer circumferential surface of the front
portion 42. In the vicinity of the rear end of a groove 422 of the male screw portion 421, a
catching projection 423 is formed in the shape of a flat projection. The catching projection 423
is formed to be lower than a screw thread of the male screw portion 421.
[0029] Besides, as illustrated mainly in Fig. 6, the connecting section 40 has a rear inner wall 43
and a front inner wall 44 having an inner diameter smaller than the that of the rear inner wall 43.
In a step-like boundary between the rear inner wall 43 and the front inner wall 44, a step 45
having a flat surface facing the rear side is formed. Furthermore, a ring-shaped front contact
portion 424 is formed at the front end of the connecting section 40.
[0030] Referring to Fig. 2 again, the nozzle 60 has a rear portion 61, a middle portion 62 having
an outer diameter smaller than that of the rear portion 61, and a front portion 63 having an outer
diameter smaller than that of the middle portion 62, and is formed in a substantially cylindrical
shape as a whole. A flange 611 is formed at the rear edge of the rear portion 61 over the whole
circumference. A plurality of ribs 612 are formed on the outer circumferential surface of the rear
portion 61 to extend in the front-to-back direction (i.e., the axial direction of the cylindrical
nozzle 60). In a part of the side surface of the rear portion 61, a display plate 613 is formed to
stand backward. On a surface on the outer circumferential side (the right-hand side in Fig. 2) of
the display plate 613, a shape type of the opening 631 of the nozzle 60 can be illustrated using
letters or figures. The shape type includes the shape and the size of the opening 631. Besides, a
male screw portion 621 is formed on the outer circumferential surface of the middle portion 62.
[0031] The front portion 63 is formed to have an outer diameter gradually decreased toward the
front side. An opening 631 is formed at the front end of the front portion 63. The opening 631
can be provided with an opening shape generally used in a pastry bag for whipped cream. In the
present embodiment, an eight-pointed star-shaped type is used. Accordingly, the opening 631 is
formed by arranging eight pointed plates 631 a circularly with their pointed apexes facing the

                                                  7
center of the opening 631 in a plan view. Between the pointed plates 631a, notches 631b are
respectively formed.
[0032] Besides, the nozzle 60 includes, as illustrated mainly in Fig. 6, a rear inner wall 64 and a
front inner wall 65 having an inner diameter smaller than that of the rear inner wall 64. On the
rear inner wall 64, a female screw portion 641 to be screwed with the male screw portion 421 of
the connecting section 40 is formed. The front inner wall 65 is formed from a front end of the
rear inner wall 64 to the opening 631, and is formed to have an inner diameter gradually
decreased toward the front side. In a boundary between the rear inner wall 64 and the front inner
wall 65, a step-like rear contact portion 66 having a flat surface facing the rear side is formed.
Incidentally, screwed engagement between the connecting section 40 and the nozzle 60 can be
retained by screwing the male screw portion 421 into the female screw portion 641 such that the
catching projection 423 comes into contact with a screw thread of the female screw portion 641.
[0033] The auxiliary member 50 is disposed inside the connecting section 40 and the nozzle 60.
Here, referring to Figs. 3A, 3B, 4A and 4B, the auxiliary member 50 will be described in detail.
Fig. 3A is a perspective view of the auxiliary member 50 taken from the front side, and Fig. 3B
is a perspective view of the auxiliary member 50 taken from the rear side. Fig. 4A is a plan view
of the auxiliary member 50 taken from the front side, and Fig. 4B is a plan view of the auxiliary
member 50 taken from the rear side.
[0034] The auxiliary member 50 includes a column-shaped (or bar-shaped) positioning portion
51 having a long axis in the front-to-back direction, and a ring-shaped fixing portion 52. The
positioning portion 51 is disposed to pass through substantially the center of the fixing portion
52. Besides, the fixing portion 52 is disposed behind the positioning portion 51. The positioning
portion 51 and the fixing portion 52 are connected to each other via prismatic connecting rods
53. Front surfaces 531 of the connecting rods 53 are formed at the same level as a front surface
521 of the fixing portion 52 (see Fig. 3A or Fig. 4A). Rear surfaces 532 of the connecting rods
53 are formed at the same level as a rear surface 522 of the fixing portion 52 (see Fig. 3B or Fig.
4B).
[0035] Between the connecting rods 53 and a part of the positioning portion 51 on the front
surfaces 531 side, front ribs 54 are provided. Each front rib 54 is formed in the shape of a right
trapezoidal plate in side view. Each front rib 54 is formed to extend from substantially the center

                                                   8
of the corresponding connecting rod 53 to a part of the positioning portion 51 beyond its center
toward the front side. Each front rib 54 is formed in the shape of a plate extending in the front
to-back direction. The thickness of the front ribs 54 is smaller than the width of the connecting
rods 53 and the diameter of the positioning portion 51.
[0036] On the other hand, between the connecting rods 53 and a part of the positioning portion
51 on the rear surfaces 532 side, rear ribs 55 are provided. Each rear rib 55 is formed in the
shape of a right triangular plate in side view. Incidentally, since these rear ribs 55 are thus
formed in a triangular shape, even when the auxiliary member 50 is left on a floor or the like,
the positioning portion 51 of the auxiliary member 50 falls sideways so that an injury otherwise
caused can be avoided in safety. Each rear rib 55 is formed to extend from the outside end
(namely, the end closer to the fixing portion 52) of the corresponding connecting rod 53 to a rear
end 511 of the positioning portion 51. Besides, an outside end 55a of each rear rib 55 on the side
closer to the fixing portion 52 is substantially parallel to the long axis of the positioning portion
51, and is C-chamfered by a plane substantially vertical to the rear rib 55. The thickness of the
rear ribs 55 is smaller than the width of the connecting rods 53 and the diameter of the
positioning portion 51.
[0037] The connecting rods 53, the front ribs 54 and the rear ribs 55 of the present embodiment
are disposed, as illustrated in the plan view of Figs 4A and Fig. 4B, radially around the
positioning portion 51 toward the fixing portion 52. Besides, the connecting rods 53, the front
ribs 54 and the rear ribs 55 are disposed at substantially the same angle around the long axis of
the positioning portion 51. In the present embodiment, the connecting rods 53, the front ribs 54
and the rear ribs 55 are provided each in number of three. Accordingly, the connecting rods 53,
the front ribs 54 and the rear ribs 55 are disposed at about 120 degrees around the long axis of
the positioning portion 51.
[0038] Since the positioning portion 51 and the fixing portion 52 are thus connected to each
other via the connecting rods 53, substantially fan-shaped passages 56 through which the
creamy substance 4 passes during use of the pastry bag 2 are formed in the auxiliary member 50.
[0039] Referring to Fig. 2 again, the cap 70 is formed in a cylindrical shape having a bottom on
the front end side. A flange 711 is formed at the rear edge of the cap 70 over the whole
circumference. On an outer circumferential surface 71 of the cap 70, a plurality of vertical ribs

                                                   9
712 are formed. A female screw portion 721 to be screwed with the male screw portion 621 of
the nozzle 60 is formed in a rear end portion of an inner wall 72 of the cap 70.
[0040] Next, the base 3 will be described. Fig. 5A is a perspective view of the base 3 taken from
above, and Fig. 5B is a perspective view of the base 3 taken from below. Incidentally, in the
description of the base 3, a side closer to the upper plate 31 in Figs. 5A and 5B is designated as
the upper side, and the opposite side is designated as the lower side. The base 3 is formed in a
substantially cylindrical shape. On the upper plate 31 of the base 3, a plurality of contact guides
311 and amount guides 312 are provided.
[0041] Referring to Fig. 5A, each contact guide 311 is formed in the shape of a circular recess.
The contact guide 311 is used for positioning the pastry bag 2 by bringing a front end 512 of the
positioning portion 51 of the auxiliary member 50 into contact with the contact guide 311. In
this manner, the height and the position in every direction of the pastry bag 2 with respect to the
base 3 can be easily stably retained. Incidentally, the contact guide 311 of the present
embodiment is formed as a recess in substantially the same shape as the shape of the front end
512 of the positioning portion 51. Therefore, the front surface of the front end 512 can be placed
in substantially surface contact with the bottom of the contact guide 311.
[0042] Alternatively, the contact guide 311 may be formed to have a larger diameter than the
outline of the positioning portion 51, so that the positioning portion 51 can be guided in its
position by bringing the tip of the front end 512 into contact with the bottom of the contact
guide 311. Alternatively, the contact guide 311 may be provided as a recess or a hole having a
smaller diameter than the positioning portion 51, so that the position of the front end 512 of the
positioning portion 51 can be supported by the inner edge of the recess or the hole.
[0043] Each amount guide 312 is provided around the corresponding contact guide 311 with the
contact guide 311 set at the center. The amount guide 312 has an outline guide 312a and a radial
guide 312b drawn with a line protruding beyond the upper plate 31. The outline guide 312a of
the amount guide 312 is formed in a star shape having eight apexes 312c. The amount guide 312
is used for allowing a user to grasp an appropriate amount of squeezing the creamy substance 4
out of the pastry bag 2.
[0044] In the base 3 of the present embodiment, fourteen combinations of the contact guide 311
and the amount guide 312 are provided on the upper plate 31. Besides, at substantially the center

                                                  10
of the upper plate 31, a recess 313 in a substantially circular shape larger than the contact guide
311 is formed.
[0045] Referring to Fig. 5B, a side wall 32 is formed to extend toward the lower side from the
outer edge of the upper plate 31 of the base 3. The base 3 is formed in the shape of a cylindrical
container opened on the lower side. A cylindrical rib 33 is provided at substantially the center
on the rear surface side of the upper plate 31. Besides, on the rear surface side of the upper plate
31, plate ribs 34 each connecting an outer surface 33a of the cylindrical rib 33 to an inner
surface 32b of the side wall 32 are provided. The plate ribs 34 are connected also to the rear
surface of the upper plate 31. Furthermore, in a plan view taken from below, the plate ribs 34 are
provided in number of four at substantially 90 degrees against each other around the center of
the upper plate 31. Since the cylindrical rib 33 and the plate ribs 34 are thus provided, the
strength of the base 3 can be increased.
[0046] Incidentally, the contact guides 311 may be in another shape including a plurality of
projections as long as the shape can be fit with the front end 512 of the positioning portion 51
brought into contact therewith. Besides, each amount guide 312 may be drawn with a groove as
long as a user can visually recognize its shape. Alternatively, the contact guides 311 and the
amount guides 312 may be formed with dots or lines in colors distinguishable from the base
color of the upper plate 31.
[0047] Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view of the pastry bag 2 of Fig. 1 taken on line VI-VI. This
drawing illustrates merely a part in the vicinity of the nozzle 60 with the creamy substance 4
omitted. The connecting section 40 attached to the container 20 is connected to the nozzle 60 by
screwing the front portion 42 with the rear inner wall 64. At this point, the rear surface 522 of
the fixing portion 52 comes into contact with the front contact portion 424 of the connecting
section 40, and the front surface 521 of the fixing portion 52 comes into contact with the rear
contact portion 66 of the nozzle 60. As a result, the auxiliary member 50 is sandwiched between
the front contact portion 424 and the rear contact portion 66 to be supported within the nozzle
60. Besides, since the outside ends 55a of the rear ribs 55 and the front inner wall 44 come close
to or come into contact with each other, a shift of the auxiliary member 50 in the front-to-back
or lateral direction can be reduced.

                                                 11
[0048] Besides, a part of the front end 512 of the positioning portion 51 of the auxiliary member
50 is disposed to protrude outward beyond the opening 631. When the auxiliary member 50 is
thus disposed within the nozzle 60, the creamy substance 4 squeezed from the bag-shaped
container 20 in a direction of an arrow C (namely, in the back-to-front direction) successively
passes through the connecting section 40, the passages 56 of the auxiliary member 50 and the
nozzle 60 to be squeezed out toward the front side of the pastry bag 2 through the opening 631.
The creamy substance 4 squeezed out through the opening 631 moves toward the front side
along the positioning portion 51 exposed out of the opening 631.
[0049] Next, a method for using the pastry bag 2 with the base 3 will be described. Figs. 7A to
7D are diagrams illustrating the method for using the pastry bag 2. First, in step SI of Fig. 7A, a
user places the pastry bag 2, with the nozzle 60 disposed downward and the connecting section
40 disposed upward, in such a manner that the front end 512 of the positioning portion 51 is in
contact with one contact guide 311 provided on the base 3. The pastry bag 2 can be easily placed
in a position with a distance between the opening 631 and the upper plate 31 of the base 3 set to
a prescribed height h predetermined by the auxiliary member 50.
[0050] In step S2 of Fig. 7B, when the user moves the creamy substance 4 contained in the
container 20 to be squeezed toward the nozzle 60, the creamy substance 4 appears outside
through the opening 631. At the initial stage of the appearance of the creamy substance 4, a
contact area between the creamy substance 4 and the upper plate 31 is small, and hence the
creamy substance 4 is provided inside the outline guide 312a (namely, in a part of the outline
guide 312a closer to the contact guide 311). When the user continues to squeeze the creamy
substance 4, the creamy substance 4 squeezed out becomes larger to have a swollen side surface
while increasing the contact area with the upper plate 31, and as a result, a three-dimensional
cream decoration 81 can be formed. Here, a portion of the creamy substance 4 squeezed out
through each notch 63 lb forms a side apex 811, and a portion of the creamy substance 4
squeezed out through each pointed plate 631 a forms a valley 812.
[0051] The outline guide 312a indicates that the amount of squeezing the creamy substance 4
(namely, the position of a boundary b between the squeezed creamy substance 4 and the upper
plate 31) is appropriate. Besides, the opening 631 of the present embodiment is in the shape of
an eight-pointed star, and the outline guide 312a is also in the shape of a star having eight
apexes 312c. Accordingly, the boundary b becomes substantially similar to the outline guide

                                                  12
312a in a plan view not illustrated. In using the pastry bag 2, the user adjusts the axial direction
of the pastry bag 2 so that the side apexes 811 of the cream decoration 81 can accord with the
apexes 312c of the outline guide 312a (see Fig. 5A). Accordingly, when the amount of
squeezing the creamy substance 4 is increased, the outline guide 312a illustrated in Fig. 5A
accords with the boundary b. In this manner, the user can easily determine whether or not an
appropriate amount of the creamy substance 4 has been squeezed.
[0052] In step S3 of Fig. 7C, when the boundary b between the squeezed creamy substance 4
and the upper plate 31 substantially accords with the outline guide 312a, the user stops the
squeezing operation of the pastry bag 2.
[0053] In step S4 of Fig. 7D, the user pulls up the pastry bag 2 away from the upper plate 31. In
this manner, the cream decoration 81 made of the creamy substance 4 can be formed in a good
shape. Besides, when dried for a prescribed period of time, the cream decoration 81 can be cured
to hardness suitable for storage or use as a decoration.
[0054] Incidentally, the appropriate height h between the opening 631 and the base 3 may be
different depending on the shape or size of the opening 631. In this manner, according to the
pastry bag 2 of the present embodiment, the opening 631 can be set and retained at the
appropriate height h owing to the auxiliary member 50.
[0055] The positioning portion 51 that determines the height of the auxiliary member 50 is
provided to protrude through substantially the center of the opening 631, and hence, the
movement of the squeezed creamy substance 4 and the formation of the appearance of the cream
decoration 81 are never impaired.
[0056] Besides, in pulling up the pastry bag 2 in step S4 described above, the front end 512 of
the positioning portion 51 pulls up the creamy substance 4 having been squeezed onto the base
3, and thus, a pointed tip 813 of the cream decoration 81 is formed. The pointed tip 813 is
formed because the cream decoration 81 is pulled upward when the pastry bag 2 is separated
from the cream decoration 81, and a pointed tip can be formed in a good shape in the same
manner as in using a conventional pastry bag not including the auxiliary member 50. Therefore,
the cream decoration 81 created by using the pastry bag 2 is never inferior in the appearance to a
cream decoration formed by using a conventional pastry bag. Besides, since the positioning

                                                   13
portion 51 is provided inside the opening 631, the user can visually recognize the squeezed
cream substance 4 in the same manner as in a case where the auxiliary member 50 is not used.
[0057] Furthermore, although the pastry bag 2 is set, when used, to be substantially vertical to
the base 3 in steps SI to S4 described above, the pastry bag 2 may be inclined, when used,
depending on the shape of a cream decoration 81 desired to create. Even in this case, when the
front end 512 of the positioning portion 51 is brought into contact with the base 3, the distance
between the opening 631 of the nozzle 60 and the upper plate 31 of the base 3 can be set to the
predetermined height, and hence, a beautiful cream decoration 81 can be stably created.
[0058] Alternatively, the user may squeeze the creamy substance 4 in the squeezing operation
performed in steps S2 and S3 while rotating the pastry bag 2 around the center of the opening
631. Thus, a cream decoration 81 having star-shaped side apexes 811 spirally rotated can be
formed.
[0059] The pastry bag 2 using the auxiliary member 50 of the present embodiment has been
described so far, and it is noted that a member having another structure may be used as the
auxiliary member 50 as long as a distance between the opening 631 and a creation surface
(which corresponds to the upper plate 31 of the base 3 in the present embodiment) can be
appropriately retained.
Embodiment 2
[0060] Fig. 8 is a cross-sectional view of a pastry bag 2A according to Embodiment 2 of the
present invention. It is noted that Fig. 8 is a cross-sectional view of the pastry bag 2A taken on
line corresponding to line VI-VI of the pastry bag 2 of Fig. 1. In the present embodiment, an
auxiliary member 50A is used instead of the auxiliary member 50 of Embodiment 1, and a
connecting section 40A and a nozzle 60A are used respectively instead of the connecting section
40 and the nozzle 60. Incidentally, like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements
used in Embodiment 1 so as to omit or simplify the description.
[0061] The auxiliary member 50A includes four positioning portions 5 1A and a fixing portion
52A. It is noted that three of the positioning portions 5 1A disposed on both the sides and behind
the nozzle 60A are illustrated in this drawing. The fixing portion 52A is formed in a circular
shape having a flat front surface 52A1 and a flat rear surface 52A2. Each of the positioning

                                                   14
portions 5 1A is formed in a cylindrical shape. Besides, a rear end of each positioning portion
5 1A is connected to the outer circumferential surface of the fixing portion 52A. Here, the
respective positioning portions 5 1A are disposed in positions, in a plan view taken from the rear
side of the fixing portion 52A, at substantially 90 degrees with each other around the center of
the fixing portion 52A.
[0062] In the auxiliary member 50A, the fixing portion 52A is sandwiched between and
supported by the rear surface of the flange 611 and a step 46 of the connecting section 40. Thus,
a distance (height) between the opening 631 of the nozzle 60A and the front end 512 of the
positioning portion 5 1A can be set to a predetermined length. Accordingly, when the creamy
substance 4 is squeezed out with the distance and the positional relationship between the
opening 631 and the upper plate 31 stably retained by bringing the front ends 512 of the
positioning portions 51A into contact with the upper plate 31 of the base 3 of Figs. 7A to 7D
(namely, the creation surface for a cream decoration 81), a beautiful cream decoration 81 can be
easily created.
[0063] Besides, since the auxiliary member 50A of the present embodiment includes the plural
positioning portions 5 1A, the pastry bag 2A can be prevented from being inclined against the
creation surface in using the pastry bag 2A.
[0064] Incidentally, when the auxiliary member 50A is fixed outside the nozzle 60A as in the
present embodiment, the positioning portion 5 1A for determining the distance between the
nozzle 60A and the base 3 can be formed in another shape such as one or a plurality of columns
or plates. In this case, the positioning portion 5 1A may be provided in a position not coming
into contact with the creamy substance 4 having been squeezed out of the pastry bag 2A as
illustrated in Fig. 8, or in a position coming into contact with the creamy substance 4 as in
Embodiment 1.
[0065] Alternatively, the positioning portion 5 1A may be formed in the shape of a cylindrical
wall extending toward the front side from the circular outer edge of the fixing portion 52A. Such
a wall can be provided with a slit-shaped cut or made of a transparent material so that the
creamy substance 4 squeezed out through the nozzle 60A can be easily visible.
[0066] The pastry bags 2 and 2A respectively using the auxiliary members 50 and 50A have
been described so far, and the shape of the opening 631 can be, instead of the eight-pointed star,

                                                  15
any of star shapes having apexes appropriately increased or decreased in number. Alternatively,
the shape of the opening 631 can be any other shape such as a circular shape or a polygonal
shape.
[0067] Besides, the size, the shape and the number of the contact guides 311 provided on the
base 3 can be determined correspondingly to the size, the shape and the number of the tip (the
front end 512) of the positioning portion 51 or 51A. Each contact guide 311 can be a projection
or a recess to be engaged with the tip of the positioning portion 51 or 5 1A of the auxiliary
member 50 or 50A for reducing its shift in the front-to-back or lateral direction.
[0068] Furthermore, each contact guide 311 may include an engaging portion in the shape of a
recess or a projection for determining the axial direction of the pastry bag 2 or 2A. For example,
the auxiliary member 50A may include a column-shaped direction determining portion
extending toward the front side from the outer circumferential surface of a fixing portion 52A,
so that the direction determining portion can be engaged with the engaging portion in bringing
the positioning portion 51 or 5 1A into contact with the contact guide 311. Thus, the axial
direction of the pastry bag 2 or 2A can be guided to an appropriate position.
[0069] Alternatively, the auxiliary member 50 or 50A may be integrally formed with the nozzle
60 or 60A and/or the connecting section 40 or 40A via a portion such as the fixing portion 52 or
52A.
[0070] According to the above-described embodiments of the present invention, the following
aspects of a pastry bag, an auxiliary member, a decoration forming toy and a decoration forming
toy set can be provided:
[0071] In a first aspect, a pastry bag includes: a container containing a creamy substance; a
nozzle connected to the container; and an auxiliary member including: a fixing portion fixed to
the nozzle; and a positioning portion to be brought into contact with a creation surface on which
a decoration is to be created.
[0072] According to this aspect, a distance between the creation surface and the pastry bag can
be stably retained, and therefore, beautiful cream decorations having uniform height and shape
can be easily created.

                                                  16
[0073] In a second aspect of the pastry bag, the fixing portion is formed in a ring shape, and the
auxiliary member is fixed such that the fixing portion is sandwiched between the nozzle and the
container.
[0074] According to this aspect, the auxiliary member can be more stably fixed on the pastry
bag with a simple structure.
[0075] In a third aspect of the pastry bag, the container includes a connecting section including
a front contact portion at a front end thereof, the nozzle includes a rear contact portion formed
inside, and the auxiliary member is fixed such that front and rear portions of the auxiliary
member are sandwiched between the front contact portion and the rear contact portion.
[0076] According to this aspect, the auxiliary member can be easily fixed within the nozzle.
[0077] In a fourth aspect of the pastry bag, the auxiliary member is received within the nozzle,
and the positioning portion is formed in a cylindrical shape and protrudes from the nozzle.
[0078] According to this aspect, the auxiliary member can be disposed in a compact manner by
a simple structure. Besides, when the pastry bag is pulled up after squeezing the creamy
substance, the cylindrical positioning portion pulls up a pointed tip of the cream decoration, and
hence, the decoration can be created without impairing the appearance.
[0079] In a fifth aspect of the pastry bag, the auxiliary member includes: a connecting rod
connecting the positioning portion and the fixing portion; a front rib formed between a part of
the positioning portion on a front side of the connecting rod and a front surface of the
connecting rod; and a rear rib formed between a part of the positioning portion on a rear side of
the connecting rod and a rear surface of the connecting rod.
[0080] According to this aspect, the auxiliary member can be disposed in a passage for the
creamy substance within the nozzle. Besides, since a space surrounded by the connecting rod,
the fixing portion and the positioning portion defines the passage, a flow of the creamy
substance is less impaired. Besides, the strength of the positioning portion formed in a
cylindrical shape and the connecting rod formed in a rod shape can be increased. Therefore,
even if a pressing load is applied to the auxiliary member when the auxiliary member is brought

                                                  17
into contact with the creation surface, damage otherwise caused can be avoided with a simple
structure.
[0081] In a sixth aspect, an auxiliary member for a pastry bag for squeezing a creamy substance
includes: a fixing portion fixed to the pastry bag; and a positioning portion to be brought into
contact with a creation surface on which a decoration is to be created.
[0082] In a seventh aspect, a decoration forming toy includes: a container containing a creamy
substance; a nozzle connected to the container; and an auxiliary member including: a fixing
portion fixed to the nozzle; and a positioning portion to be brought into contact with a creation
surface on which a decoration is to be created.
[0083] According to the sixth and seventh aspects, a distance between the creation surface and
the pastry bag can be stably retained, and therefore, beautiful cream decorations having uniform
height and shape can be easily created.
[0084] In an eighth aspect, a decoration forming toy set includes: a decoration forming toy; and
a base, in which the decoration forming toy includes: a container containing a creamy substance;
a nozzle connected to the container; and an auxiliary member including: a fixing portion fixed to
the nozzle; and a positioning portion to be brought into contact with a creation surface on which
a decoration is to be created, and the base includes: a contact guide with which a tip of the
positioning portion is brought into contact; and an amount guide which guides an amount of
squeezing the creamy substance.
[0085] According to this aspect, the position of the auxiliary member can be guided by the
contact guide, and it can be determined, by using the amount guide, whether or not an
appropriate amount of the creamy substance has been squeezed, and therefore, beautiful cream
decorations with uniform height and shape can be easily created.
[0086] The embodiments of the present invention have been described so far, and it is noted that
the present invention is not limited to these embodiments but can be practiced in various
aspects.
