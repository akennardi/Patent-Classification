         VERTICAL TAKE-OFF AND LANDING FIXED-WING AIRCRAFT AND THE FLIGHT
                                CONTROL METHOD THEREOF
   CROSS REFERENCE
 5 The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent application
   <removed-apn> the entire content of which is taken to be incorporated herein.
   TECHNICAL FIELD
   The present invention relates to a field of aircraft, in particular to a vertical take-off
   and landing (VTOL) fixed-wing aircraft and the flight control method thereof.
10 BACKGROUND
   It is known that fixed-wing aircraft can generate a lift force itself by its wings moving
   through airflow, allowing for high speed and long flight, heavy loaded and efficiency,
   whereas it needs a long airstrip, and cannot hover overhead. Rotorcraft uses lift force
   generated by rotary wings, and can be thrust horizontally by controlling the pitching
15 angle of the rotary wings. The merit of rotorcraft includes a simple structure, being
   able of vertical take-off and landing and being able of hover in the air, whereas the
   shortage includes low speed, short range, light loaded and low efficiency.
   Therefore, it is desirable to combine the merits of fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft
   with many attempts.
20 V22 Osprey in US uses the tiltrotor technical solution. The aircraft is in a rotorcraft
   mode capable of vertical take-off and landing while rotary plane of the rotary wings
   is horizontal. When the aircraft needs a horizontal movement, their rotary plane of
   the rotary wings tilts to a vertical direction so that the thrust force is generated by
   the rotary wings.
25 Another VTOL aircraft is a tail-sitter type, i.e. the aircraft tilts vertically, takes off and
   lands on its tail while the rotary plane of the rotary wings is parallel to ground, and
   the rotary wings provides a lift force, then the aircraft tilts horizontally for forward
   flight while the rotary plane of the rotary wings is vertical to ground, and the rotary
   wings provides a thrust force.
30 Under the constraints that the capacity of the battery is limited, the problem we are
   facing is how to enhance the load capacity, the airborne time and the range of
   aircraft, especially an unmanned aerial vehicle. Although existing design provides a
   solution as to vertical take-off and landing of fixed-wing aircraft, it is not an optimal
   solution of energy efficiency as the rotary wings require peculiarly contrary design in
35 the aspect about energy efficiency when being used for horizontal thrust or vertical
   take-off and landing, that is, the rotary wings for horizontal thrust require small
   diameter, small pitch and small thrust, whereas the rotary wings for vertical take-off
                                                1

   and landing require larger diameter, larger pitch and larger thrust. Existing tiltrotor
   and tail-sitter type solutions take both thrust and hover into account, resulting in a
   non-optimal status both operations in the aspect about energy efficiency.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

30 It should be noted that,
   The preceding words "first", "second" do not represent specific quantity or order,
   merely for the purpose of distinguishing parts' names.
   The advantages or principle of the invention is as follows,
   1. When the fixed-wing aircraft takes off, lands or hovers, the doors open, and the
35      deployable supporting mechanism is spread by act of the driving mechanism,
        thereby the vertical lifers will be working outside the storage room to provide the
        aircraft with large lift force in vertical direction; during the high speed cruise, the
        deployable supporting mechanism is gathered within the storage room, by act of
        the driving mechanism, that time the doors close, and the thruster works so as to
                                                   4

      make the aircraft to achieve a high efficiency and long range due to fully
      utilization of the aerodynamic efficiency of the fixed-wing.
   2. In the open state, at least two vertical lifters are located on both sides of the
      fuselage, to provide a lift force for the aircraft during vertical take-off and landing
 5    or hover; if only two vertical lifters are provided on both sides of the fuselage, it
      is necessary to utilize a thruster with tiltable structure to control the flight
      attitude in vertical direction.
   3. The deployable supporting mechanism comprises a first supporting arm, and two
      vertical lifters are mounted to both ends of the first supporting arm respectively
10    so that the lift requirement can be perfectly met with simple structure.
   4. The middle parts of the first supporting arm and the second supporting arm are
      all hinged to a hinge shaft such that the first supporting arm and the second
      supporting arm form an "X" shape, such structure has the following advantages.
       A.   When the first supporting arm and the second supporting arm are parallel,
15          they are in a closed state, that is, the supporting arms and the vertical lifters
            thereon are located in the storage room; when the first supporting arm and
            the second supporting arm are arranged at a certain angle, they are in an
            open state, and the vertical lifters will be outside the storage room; the "X"
            shaped structure is simple and facilitate gathering and spreading;
20     B.   The hinge portions of the first supporting arm and the second supporting
            arm will bear a large bending moment. Such "X" shaped structure thereof
            ensure sufficient bending strength and rigidity in the hinged portion of the
            first supporting arm and the second supporting arm;
       C. Such "X" shaped structure formed by both the first supporting arm and the
25          second supporting arm allows larger expanded plane during the open state
            and smaller compact space during closed state.
   5. Each of the first supporting arm and the second supporting arm comprises the
      hinge segment, the first end arm and the second end arm, the first end arm and
      the second end arm are arranged on opposite sides of the hinge shaft, ensuring
30    the first supporting arm and the second supporting arm to be parallel during the
      closed state, to avoid more space being occupied due to incomplete gather
      thereof.
   6. The first supporting arm and the second supporting arm all have a thickness, thus
      they cannot be in a same plane when they are hinge-jointed, which will affect the
35    stability of the aircraft when it is vertically raised. During the installation, two
      vertical lifters on the first supporting arms are mounted on the bottom surface of
      the ends of the first supporting arms, and two vertical lifters on the second
      supporting arms are mounted on the top surface of the ends of the second
      supporting arms. This installation arrangement can ensure the four vertical lifters
                                                 5

       being in a same horizontal plane to improve the stability of the aircraft.
   7.  Positive stops are provided about the first supporting arm and the second
       supporting arm to limit the location of the first supporting arm and the second
       supporting arm when the first supporting arm and the second supporting arm are
 5     spread out, so that the reliability of the aircraft is guaranteed during flight.
   8. The first supporting arm and the second supporting arm are all provided with a
       first pin and a second pin respectively, the driving mechanism may act on the first
       pin and the second pin that located on two opposite sides of the hinge shaft,
       then the first supporting arm can rotate in reverse relative to the second
10     supporting arm to implement their gather or spread.
   9. The driving mechanism comprises a rotator, a slider and a guider, when the
       rotator rotates, the finger pushes the slider to slide in horizontal direction along
       the guider, whereby the first pin and the second pin bring the first supporting
       arm and the second supporting arm to spread out or gather together..
15 10. The hinge shaft comprises an outer shaft fixed to the first supporting arm and an
       inner shaft fixed to the second supporting arm, the sleeve structure of the outer
       shaft has a larger thrust surface, which can reduce the possibility of skew or
       distortion between the first supporting arm and the second supporting arm. Such
       sleeve structure is very important to ensure the reliability of the hinge portions.
20
   11. Two doors are located on opposite sides of the fuselage to facilitate the
       deployable supporting mechanism gathering together and spreading out.
   12. The foresaid storage room, doors and deployable supporting mechanism may be
25     provided in the fixed-wing, their working principle is same as the foresaid
       structure (i.e. the storage room, the doors, the deployable supporting mechanism,
       etc. are arranged on the fuselage), and more space can be left to make the
       structure more compact.
   13. Arranging the storage room, doors and deployable supporting mechanism etc. on
30     the fixed-wing, and using the following specific solution,
       A. Vertical lifters are arranged on the fixed-wings on both sides of the fuselage
            so that the fixed-wing aircraft can obtain a better balance when it takes-off,
            lands, or hovers.
       B. The vertical lifters are arranged on both sides the aircraft, the thruster is
35          movable mounted to the fuselage to enhance the balance of the fixed-wing
            aircraft when it takes-off, lands, or hovers. During high-speed cruise, the
            thruster offers thrust force, and when takes-off and lands, the thruster
            rotates until its own axis is vertical, then the thruster controls the flight
            attitude in vertical direction.

30 the first pin 211 and the second pin 221. The first pin 211 and the second pin 221 are
   used to localize between the first supporting arm 21 and the second supporting arm
   22, for instance, in the stop state, the first supporting arm 21 and the second
   supporting arm 22 are spread out maximumly.
   The driving mechanism 30 includes a rotator 31, a slider 32 and a guider 33. The
35 rotator 31 and the guider 33 are arranged on the fuselage 10. The slider 32 is
   slid-fitted with the guider 33. The slider 32 is provided with a slot 323, and the
   rotator 31 is provided with a finger 311 which is inserted into the slot 323 and is
   deviated from the rotary axis of the rotator 31. A first slide element 321 and a second
   slide element 322 are arranged on the slider 32, the first pin 211 and the second pin
40 221 are inserted into the first slide element 321 and the second slide element 322
   respectively. The hinge shaft 23 comprises an outer shaft 231 fixed to the first
                                                10

   supporting arm 21, and an inner shaft 232 fixed to the second supporting arm 22, the
   outer shaft 231 is sleeved on the inner shaft 232.
   The fixed-wings 11 are located on both sides of the fuselage 10, and the hinge shaft
   23 is located near the back portion of the fixed-wing 11. In the open state, two
 5 vertical lifters 40 are located ahead of the fixed-wings 11.
   This embodiment has the following advantages:
   1. When the fixed-wing aircraft takes off, lands or hovers, the doors 14 open, and
       the deployable supporting mechanism is spread by act of the driving mechanism
       30, thereby the vertical lifers 40 will be working outside the storage room 13 to
10     provide the aircraft with large lift force in vertical direction; during the high speed
       cruise, the deployable supporting mechanism is gathered within the storage
       room 13, by act of the driving mechanism 30, that time the doors 14 close, and
       the thruster 12 works so as to make the aircraft to achieve a high efficiency and
       long range due to fully utilization of the aerodynamic efficiency of the fixed-wing
15     11.
   2. In the open state, four vertical lifters 40 are located on both sides of the fuselage
       10, to provide a lift force for the aircraft during vertical take-off and landing or
       hover, with a higher stability.
   3. The deployable supporting mechanism comprises a first supporting arm 21, and
20     two vertical lifters 40 are mounted to both ends of the first supporting arm 21
       respectively so that the lift requirement can be perfectly met with simple
       structure.
   4. The middle parts of the first supporting arm 21 and the second supporting arm
       22 are all hinged to a hinge shaft 23 such that the first supporting arm 21 and the
25     second supporting arm 22 form an "X" shape, such structure has the following
       advantages.
        A.   When the first supporting arm 21 and the second supporting arm 22 are
              parallel, they are in a closed state, that is, the supporting arms 21, 22 and
             the vertical lifters 40 thereon are located in the storage room 13; when the
30           first supporting arm 21 and the second supporting arm 22 are arranged at a
             certain angle, they are in an open state, and the vertical lifters 40 will be
             outside the storage room 13; the "X" shaped structure is simple and
             facilitate gathering and spreading;
        B. The hinged portions of the first supporting arm 21 and the second
35           supporting arm 22 will bear a large bending moment. Such "X" shaped
             structure thereof ensure sufficient bending strength and rigidity in the
              hinged portion of the first supporting arm 21 and the second supporting arm
             22;
                                                 11

        C. Such "X" shaped structure formed by both the first supporting arm 21 and
             the second supporting arm 22 allows larger expanded plane during the open
             state and smaller compact space during closed state.
   5. Each of the first supporting arm 21 and the second supporting arm 22 comprises
 5     the hinge segment 24, the first end arm 25 and the second end arm 26, the first
       end arm 25 and the second end arm 26 are arranged on opposite sides of the
       hinge shaft 23, ensuring the first supporting arm 25 and the second supporting
       arm 26 to be parallel during the closed state, to avoid more space being occupied
       due to incomplete gather thereof.
10 6. The first supporting arm 21 and the second supporting arm 22 all have a
       thickness, thus they cannot be in a same plane when they are hinge-jointed,
       which will affect the stability of the aircraft when it is vertically raised. During the
       installation, two vertical lifters 40 on the first supporting arms 21 are mounted on
       the bottom surface of the ends of the first supporting arms 21, and two vertical
15     lifters 40 on the second supporting arms 22 are mounted on the top surface of
       the ends of the second supporting arms 22. This installation arrangement can
       ensure the four vertical lifters 40 being in a same horizontal plane to improve the
       stability of the aircraft.
   7. The relative position between the first supporting arm 21 and the second
20     supporting arm 22 are limited by the first pin 211 and the second pin 221 in the
       open state, to ensure the reliability of the aircraft during flight.
   8. The first supporting arm 21 and the second supporting arm 22 are all provided
       with a first pin 211 and a second pin 221 respectively, the driving mechanism 30
       may act on the first pin 211 and the second pin 221 that located on two opposite
25     sides of the hinge shaft 23, then the first supporting arm 21 can rotate in reverse
       relative to the second supporting arm 22 to implement their gather or spread.
   9. The driving mechanism 30 comprises a rotator 31, a slider 32 and a guider 33,
       when the rotator 31 rotates, the finger 311 pushes the slider 32 to slide in
       horizontal direction along the guider 33, whereby the first pin 211 and the
30     second pin 221 bring the first supporting arm 21 and the second supporting arm
       22 to spread out or gather together.
   10. The hinge shaft 23 comprises an outer shaft 231 fixed to the first supporting arm
       21, and an inner shaft 232 fixed to the second supporting arm 232. The sleeve
       structure of the outer shaft 231 has a larger thrust surface, which can reduce the
35     possibility of skew or distortion between the first supporting arm 21 and the
       second supporting arm 22. Such sleeve structure is very important to ensure the
       reliability of the hinged portions.
   11. Two doors 14 are located on opposite sides of the fuselage 10 to facilitate the
       deployable supporting mechanism gathering together and spreading out.

   cruise, the thruster 12 offers thrust power, and during take-off, landing or hover, the
10 thruster 12 rotates around the horizontal rotation shaft 121 until its own axis being
   vertical then the thruster 12 acts as a pitch control mechanism to provide an auxiliary
   lift force.
