     [0001]      The invention relates to devices and methods for delivering a
      medicament to a user. More particularly, the invention relates to devices and
      methods for delivering an aerosol of a medicament to a user's lungs.

                                     BACKGROUND ART
      [0002]     Pulmonary drug delivery systems have been used for decades to deliver
      medicaments for the treatment of respiratory disorders.        The principle behind
20   pulmonary drug delivery is aerosolization of drug compounds to be delivered to
     bronchioles and alveoli. Despite facing challenges like particle size optimization and
     degradation, a number of companies have developed technologies to deliver
     treatments for diabetes, migraine, osteoporosis and cancer.
25   [0003]      The available delivery systems include metered dose inhalers (MDIs),
     dry powder inhalers (DPIs), and nebulizers.       MDIs were among the first to be
     introduced in the United States in the mid 1950s. The HFA-based (pressurized) MDI
     was introduced in the United States in 1995. Although DPIs were introduced in the
     1970s, their use has been limited due to the overwhelming dominance of MDIs.
30   Nebulizers are generally used within hospital settings. Technological advances
     within the pulmonary ding delivery technologies markets are taking place in non
     CFC-based MDIs, DPIs, and liquid-based inhalers (LBIs).

                                             - la
    [0004]      Many preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that pulmonary
   delivery of medicaments is an efficient method for the treatment of both respiratory
   and systemic diseases. The many advantages of pulmonary delivery are well
   recognized and include rapid onset, patient self-administration, reduced side-effects,
 5 ease of delivery by inhalation, and the elimination of needles.
   [0005]      Nevertheless, methods for the administration of most medicaments have
   not significantly deviated from delivery via the traditional intravenous/intramuscular
   and oral routes to include pulmonary delivery via inhalation. The use of pulmonary
10 delivery has been limited mainly to the administration of medicaments for the
   treatment of asthma.

                 [0006]    It has been reported that in order to deliver a powder directly into the
    lower respiratory regions the powder should generally have a particle size of
                                                                                       less than 5 Im,
   Further, powders in the 5-10 tm range have been found not to penetrate
                                                                                as deeply and instead
   tend to stimulate the upper respiratory tract regions.
                [0007]     When manufacturing drug formulations for dry powder inhalers
                                                                                                (DPIs),
   the medicament must first be milled to obtain an acceptable particle size for
                                                                                  pulmonary delivery.
   This micronization step can cause problems during manufacture.
                                                                             For example, the heat
  produced during milling can cause degradation of the medicament. Additionally,
                                                                                         metal can rub
  off some mills and contaminate the medicament. Furthermore, due
                                                                            to the small size of the
  particles, dry powder formulations tend to agglomerate, especially in the presence
                                                                                        of moisture.
               [0008]     Agglomeration results in low flowability of the particles which diminishes
  the efficacy of the dry powder formulation. As a result, careful supervision
                                                                                   is required during
  milling, blending, powder flow, filling and even administration to ensure that the dry
                                                                                               powder
  aerosols are properly delivered.
               [0009]     Thus, there is aneed for new methods to prepare aerosols for medicament
  delivery. The present disclosure describes in part a method for combining
                                                                                    nicotine or other
 medicaments with a delivery enhancing compound in a gaseous stream to generate
                                                                                        an aerosol for
 pulmonary delivery, without the need for excipients or other additives including
                                                                                    solvents.

               [0127]     "Therapeutically effective amount" as used herein may refer to a
   concentration or amount of nicotine or other medicament which achieves a therapeutic effect in a
  subject generally a human subject. The subject has an improvement in a disease or medically
  defined condition. The improvement is any improvement or remediation of the symptoms
  associated with the disease. The improvement is an observable or measurable improvement.
  Thus, one of skill in the art realizes that a treatment may improve the disease condition, but may
  not be a complete cure for the disease. The therapeutic effect in some embodiments may include
  reduction or elimination of nicotine craving in a subject suffering nicotine addiction or in a
  subject experiencing nicotine use withdrawal symptoms.
              [0128}     To aid in the understanding of the concepts of the present invention,
 embodiments will be described herein with reference to devices and methods for nicotine
 delivery. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the medicaments listed at
 [0132] may be used in place of or in addition to the nicotine according to the teachings herein.
              [0129]     The methods described herein relate to a surprising discovery regarding
 the dose of nicotine obtained from nicotine delivery devices. The inventors have unexpectedly
 identified methods for increasing the dose of nicotine delivered to a subject by inhalation. The
 importance of this discovery lies in an improved ability to substitute for the nicotine delivery
 subjects experience while smoking cigarettes and similar tobacco products. With improved
nicotine delivery profiles, subjects applying the methods described herein will be provided with
superior nicotine replacement therapy during attempts at smoking cessation, harm reduction
and/or substitution. With the continued global problem of smoking related health issues, the
methods described herein address a critical need in medical efforts to assist smokers in quitting.
             [0130]      Without desiring to be bound by theory, it is believed that passing the
vapor of a volatile first substance (i.e. a delivery enhancing compound) over a nicotine source
results in the formation of particles in a liquid or solid state, which subsequently allows more of

 the nicotine to evaporate and combine with the first substance, generating further particles. The
 amount of particle formation (mass delivered) at a given temperature would be greater than that
 formed when the vapor of nicotine is passed over a second volatile substance. Similarly, the
 amount of particle formation at a given temperature would be greater than that formed when the
 vapors of the two substances are combined in a parallel mixing apparatus (as disclosed in prior
 art), due to the amount of particle formation being limited by the volatility of the less volatile
 substance and to the dilution of the active substance by mixing with the volume of gas containing
 the other substance, Also, allowing sequential passing of one substance over a second substance
may allow for a more efficient combination of the two substances than parallel mixing as
 disclosed in prior art. Another possibility is that the interaction between the first and second
substances is an exothermic process. In other words, energy is released in the form of heat as a
result of the exothermic interaction. Without desiring to be bound by theory, it is believed that
the heat released may enhance the evaporation of the nicotine.
             [0131]      In some embodiments, the methods involve the step of bringing a gaseous
carrier in communication with a nicotine source. The gaseous carrier in these embodiments
contains a delivery enhancing compound capable of increasing the amount of nicotine in the
gaseous canier, relative to the amount of nicotine that would be in the gaseous carrier lacking the
delivery enhancing compound. In some embodiments, the delivery enhancing compound is
capable of reacting with nicotine base or other medicament to form a salt. In particular
embodiments, the delivery enhancing compound is capable of reacting with nicotine base to form
salt particles.     In preferred embodiments, the particles are less than 6 micrometers, more
preferably less than I micrometer, in Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter. (For Mass Median
Aerodynamic Diameter determinations, see Katz IM, Schroeter JD, Martionen TB, Factors
affecting the deposition of aerosolized insulin, Diabetes technology & Therapeutics, vol. 3 (3),
2001, pp 387-397, incorporated by reference for this teaching).
             [0)32]      The methods disclosed herein may be adapted for use with a variety of
other medicaments having similar biophysical and/or chemical properties to nicotine. The
following compounds are aliphatic or aromatic, saturated or unsaturated nitrogenous bases
(nitrogen containing alkaline compounds) in which a nitrogen atom is present in a heterocyclic
ring or in an acyclic chain (substitution). In addition, the compounds have been selected based
on melting point (below 150*C) or boiling point (below 300"C) that are expected to favor
volatilization:

             [0133]     Gaseous Carrier and Source Thereof
             [0134]     The gaseous carrier may be any gas capable of containing nicotine base
  and the delivery enhancing compound. One of skill in the art will readily be able to select an
 appropriate gaseous carrier based on the intended use, fon of nicotine and specific delivery
 enhancing compound(s). In preferred embodiments, the gaseous carrier is substantially inert with
 regard to the form of nicotine and/or the delivery enhancing compound carried, at least for the
 time period contemplated for delivery to a subject. In some embodiments, the gaseous carrier is
 ambient air. In other embodiments the gaseous carrier is a substantially pure gas such as carbon
 dioxide or nitrogen gas, or a blend of such gases. In such embodiments, the gaseous carrier is
 supplied from a container designed to hold and deliver the gaseous carrier in a manner to effect
 the methods described herein. For example, in embodiments using metered dose inhaler devices,
 the gaseous carrier may comprise Hydrofluorocarbons, which include Hydrofluoroalkanes
 (HFAs) as propellants. In some of these embodiments, the HFAs, are one or more of HFA 134a
 and HFA 227.
            [0135]      Delivery Enhancing Compounds
            [0136]      Delivery enhancing compounds are those compounds              capable of
 increasing the total concentration of nicotine in a gaseous carrier when the gaseous carrier is
placed in communication with a nicotine source. Nicotine has a vapor pressure of 0.04 mm Hg
at 25" C. Delivery enhancing compounds having a vapor pressure greater than nicotine at a given
temperature are preferred if ambient temperatures are used.      Non-limiting examples include
inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, or sulfuric acid, and organic acids including
saturated and unsaturated aliphatic acids, saturated and unsaturated alicyclic acids, aromatic
acids (including heterocyclic aromatic), polycarboxylic acids, hydroxy, alkoxy, keto, and oxo
acids, thioacids, amino acids, and each of the preceding optionally substituted with one or more
heteroatoms, including but not limited to halogens.        In some embodiments, the delivery
enhancing compound is a carboxylic acid. In some of these embodiments, the carboxylic acid is
in the class termed "2-Oxo acids." In some of these embodiments, the carboxylic acid is in the
class of a-Keto acids known as "2-Keto acids." In some of these embodiments, the acid is
selected from the group consisting of 3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, Pyruvic acid, 2-Oxovaleric
acid, 4-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, 3-Methyl-2-oxobutanoic        acid, 2-Oxooctanoic acid and
combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the delivery enhancing compound forms solid
                                               -19-

 particles, for example salt particles. In other embodiments, the delivery enhancing compound
 forms a liquid droplet aerosol.
              [0137]     Alternatively, the delivery enhancing compound forms a particulate
 aerosol, the particles of which may, for example, adsorb or absorb nicotine base. In particular
 embodiments, the particulate aerosol includes ammonium chloride salt particles.                    In
 embodiments comprising nicotine particle formation or nicotine adsorption/absorption onto
 particles the particles formed are preferably less than 6 microns, more preferably less than 5
 microns or less than 1 micron in size.
              [0138     Nicotine (or other medicament) Sources
              [0139]     Embodiments of a nicotine source use a compound comprising any
 chemical capable of providing a volatile form of nicotine such as nicotine base or nicotine salts
 (e.g. nicotine-HCI, -ditartrate). Although more than one form of nicotine can be used, free base
 nicotine is preferred. The nicotine source may comprise other compounds such as antioxidants
 (BHA, BHT, ascorbate) for stabilizing the nicotine. In some embodiments, nicotine is adsorbed
 on an element to provide a nicotine source. The adsorbed nicotine is held on the surface of a
relatively inert material. Non-limiting examples of adsorption element materials include glass,
stainless steel, aluminum, PET, PBT, PTFE, ePTFE, and BAREX*. Adsorption is a process that
occurs when a gas, liquid or solid solute accumulates on the surface of a solid or, more rarely, a
liquid (adsorbent), forming a molecular or atomic film (the adsorbate). Physical adsorption is
typically the result of van der Waals forces and electrostatic forces between adsorbate molecules
and the atoms which compose the adsorbent surface. Thus adsorbents are characterized by
surface properties such as surface area and polarity.
             [0140]     A large specific surface area is preferable for providing large adsorption
capacity, but the creation of a large internal surface area in a limited volume inevitably gives rise
to large numbers of small sized pores between adsorption surfaces. The size of the micropores
determines the accessibility of adsorbate molecules to the internal adsorption surface, so the pore
size distribution of micropores is another important property for characterizing adsorptivity of
adsorbents. Surface polarity corresponds to affinity with polar substances such as water or
alcohols. Polar adsorbents are thus called "hydrophilic" and aluminosilicates such as zeolites,
porous alumina, silica gel or silica-alumina are examples of adsorbents of this type. On the other
                                                -20-

 hand, non-polar adsorbems are generally "hydrophobic."       Carbonaceous adsorbents, polymer
 adsorbents and silicalite are typical non-polar adsorbents. These adsorbents have more affinity
 with oil or hydrocarbons than water. In some embodiments, the adsorbing surface also wicks the
 adsorbed material by capillary action, when the adsorbent is in liquid form. Wicking occurs
 when the adhesive intermolecular forces between the liquid and an adsorbing surface are
 stronger than the cohesive intermolecular forces inside the liquid. The effect causes a concave
 meniscus to form where the substance is touching a vertical adsorbing surface. Adsorbing
 surfaces may be selected or designed to wick hydrophilic or hydrophobic liquids.
             [0141]     In alternative embodiments, the nicotine source element can comprise an
 absorbing (either porous or nonporous) material. Non-limiting examples of nicotine source
 element materials include polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP).
             [0142]     A nicotine source may in some embodiments be or be in communication
with a nicotine reservoir. In some embodiments, the reservoir contains a volume of nicotine in
 liquid form with the liquid reservoir in communication with an adsorbing or absorbing nicotine
source element. In other embodiments, the nicotine reservoir is or forms part of the nicotine
source element. A non-limiting example of such a combination source and reservoir would be a
material (e.g., PE or PP) saturated with nicotine solution.      In particular embodiments, the
reservoir provides sufficient nicotine solution to enable a delivery device to provide
therapeutically effective doses of nicotine over a desired time frame. Non-limiting examples
would be devices capable of delivering 0-100 micrograms of nicotine per 35 cubic centimeter
volume "puff" of gaseous carrier for a desired number of puffs per day (e.g., 200) over a desired
number of days (e.g., 1-7 days). In certain embodiments, the amount of nicotine delivered is
between 10 and 110, 20 and 100, 50 and 100, or 40 and 60 micrograms of nicotine per 35 cubic
centimeter volume "puff."
             [0143]    Other medicaments listed in [0132] may be used in place of or in addition
to nicotine to form sources of medicament(s) using the same principles applied to nicotine base
as the example species above.
            [0144]     Delivery Enhancing Compound Sources
            [0145]     In some embodiments of the methods, the gaseous carrier is provided pre
combined with the delivery enhancing compound. Other embodiments of the methods described
                                               - 21 -

  herein include astep of loading a gaseous carrier with a delivery enhancing compound prior to or
  concurrently with passage of the gaseous carrier over the nicotine source. In embodiments
  encompassing a step of loading gaseous carrier with a delivery enhancing compound, the
  delivery enhancing compound is generally provided in the form of a delivery enhancing
  compound source, The gaseous carrier in these embodiments is generally brought into direct
  communication with the delivery enhancing compound source such that the delivery enhancing
  compound may enter the gaseous carrier from the delivery enhancing compound source. In
 some embodiments, delivery enhancing compound sources comprise a delivery enhancing
 compound source element containing materials which adsorb or absorb the delivery enhancing
 compound. Delivery enhancing compound source element materials will generally be inert with
 respect to the delivery enhancing compound. In some embodiments, the delivery enhancing
 compound is an acid as described above. Non-limiting examples of adsorption element materials
 for such embodiments include glass, stainless steel, aluminum, PET, PBT, PTFE, ePTFE, and
 BAREX*. Non-limiting examples of absorption element materials for such embodiments
 include PE and PP.
              [0146]   A delivery enhancing compound source may in some embodiments be, or
 be in communication with, a delivery enhancing compound reservoir. In some embodiments, the
 reservoir contains a volume of delivery enhancing compound in liquid fomi with the liquid
 reservoir in communication with an adsorbing or absorbing delivery enhancing compound source
 element. In other embodiments, the nicotine reservoir is or forms part of the delivery enhancing
 compound source element. A non-limiting example of such a combination source and reservoir
would be a material (e.g., PE or PP) saturated with delivery enhancing compound solution. In
particular embodiments, the reservoir provides sufficient delivery enhancing compound solution
to enable a delivery device to provide therapeutically effective doses of nicotine over a desired
time frame. Non-limiting examples would be devices capable of delivering sufficient delivery
enhancing compound to enable delivery of 0-100 micrograms of nicotine per 35 cubic centimeter
volume "puff' of gaseous carrier for a desired number of puffs per day (e.g. 200) over a desired
number of days (e.g. 1-7 days). In certain embodiments, the amount of nicotine delivered is
between 10 and 110, 20 and 100, 50 and 100, or 40 and 60 micrograms of nicotine per 35 cubic
centimeter volume "puff." Embodiments delivering 0 micrograms of nicotine are generally
intended to be the end points of a gradual nicotine cessation program.

            [0147]     Temperature
            [0148]     In some embodiments of the methods, the method involves a step of
increasing the temperature of one or more of the gaseous carrier, the nicotine source and/or the
enhancer source (when present). Such temperature control steps are generally used to regulate or
to further enhance the amount of nicotine delivery. In some embodiments, the increase in
temperature is used only if the nicotine levels delivered would generally be otherwise expected
to drop below a desired minimum. In some embodiments this may be more than 20 micrograms,
preferably more than 30 micrograms, and more preferably more than 40 micrograms of nicotine
per 35cc volume puff.        For example, a common target delivery concentration is 40-50
micrograms nicotine per 35 cubic centimeter volume "puff" as measured by a well known
technique in the nicotine delivery field. See The FTC Cigarette Test Method for Determining
Tar, Nicotine and Carbon Monoxide Yield of U.S. Cigarettes: Report of the NC Ad Hoc
Committee. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph #7. Dr. R. Shopland (Ed.). Darby, PA:
Diane Publishing Co, 1996. In some embodiments, generally a lower temperature is used first
with the temperature increasing over time to sustain a desired nicotine delivery concentration
from a nicotine source. In other embodiments a constant temperature is maintained during use.
In some embodiments, the temperature is elevated to a maximum of 100 degrees C, a maximum
of 70 degrees C, or the temperature is elevated to 40+5 degrees C. For example, pyruvic acid as
a delivery enhancing compound may be heated to 40 degrees C to facilitate sustained nicotine
delivery over multiple puffs at a desired nicotine concentration range (e.g. 20-50 micrograms per
puff). Temperature control may in some embodiments be effected by a temperature control
element. Such elements may be any known mechanism capable of achieving the desired target
temperature for the gaseous carrier, the nicotine and/or the delivery enhancing compound(s).
Particular examples of temperature control elements are illustrated below in the exemplary
devices provided.
           [0149]      Devices
           [0150]      The methods described herein are generally carried out using specially
adapted delivery devices configured to cany out the methods described herein during device
operation. One of skill in the art will be able to design and produce a variety of delivery devices
using the foregoing guidance. The Inventors however provide herein a number of delivery
device configurations to further illustrate the methods herein and their practical application by
                                                 - 23 -

 way of specific examples.        The gaseous carrier delivered to a device user can include a
 therapeutically effective dose of nicotine for smoking cessation, harm reduction and/or
 substitution. Preferred delivery device embodiments are pulmonary delivery systems.
 Pulmonary delivery systems have the ability to deliver consistent doses with suitable particle
 size and low particle-size variability, to the deep lung. Of the various non-invasive drug delivery
 technologies available, including nasal, transdermal, buccal, and needle-free injections,
 pulmonary delivery offers unique potential for precise dose titration, rapid absorption, and high
 bioavailability to deliver novel therapeutics and improve delivery of existing compounds.
                        MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION
             [0151]      SCREENING FOR A SUITABLE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN FOR
 NICOTINE AEROSOL FORMATION
             [0152)      Several experimental designs were tested as described below to evaluate
 the generation of aerosol particles by allowing acid vapor to react instantly with base vapor.
             [0153]      Experiment #1: Hydrochloric Acid and Ammonia Were Used to
Generate a Mixture of Vapors in a "Y" Shaped Tube that was Then Passed Over Nicotine
Free Base
             [0154]      Objective:
The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of a chemically robust acid/base system to generate an
aerosol of sufficient characteristics to aerosolize nicotine free base.
             [0155]      ExperimentalDesign:
The experimental design included two identical glass test tubes (Tube A contained 5ml of
hydrochloric acid (HCl) and Tube B contained 5 ml ammonia (NH3)) connected through a "Y"
shape tube designed to allow for the vapors from the two test tubes to be admixed instantly in the
"Y" shape tubing and then passed over nicotine free base using a Controlled Puff Volume
Apparatus, CPVA (40cc air at 2 seconds' duration (3-second interval) for 100 times (100 puffs)).
The admixture of HCI and NH3 vapors produced a white, dense and visible cloud.

              [0158]    Discussion:
              [0159      The use of hydrochloric acid, ammonia and nicotine resulted in significant
 nicotine delivery vs. nicotine only, as shown in Table 1. However, due to the chemical reactivity
 and corrosive nature of the acid and base chosen for this experiment, alternative constituents
 were evaluated that are more amenable to human use such as non-corrosive acid alternatives,
 including volatile and low-volatility organic acids (e.g., fatty acids).
             [0160]     EXPERIMENT # 2: Screening for Suitable Acid Candidates for Use
 In the Development of Acid Over Nicotine Base Aerosol Delivery Arrangement
             [0161]     Objective:
             [0162]     The objective of this experiment was to evaluate a series of acid
candidates for their ability to admix with nicotine free base to form an aerosol suitable for
pulmonary delivery. The superior candidates which created aerosols containing the greatest
mass of nicotine free base reported as jg/puff were selected for further evaluation. Volatile
carboxylic acids were selected as the organic acid of choice due to their relative high volatility
and to the fact that they are constituents of cigarettes and other commercial products for human
consumption such as food additives, flavoring agents and sweetening agents.
            [0163]      ExperimentalDesign:
            (01641      Two identical rectangular glass chambers measuring 4cm x 2cm x 1ern
each contained two inlet/outlet ports extending externally through the top of the chamber before
turning 900 away from the center of the chamber. These ports were positioned on opposite sides
                                                -25-

  and near the edge of the chambers. Internally, these ports consisted of a hollow glass tube that
  extended to near the bottom of the chamber. The purpose of these ports was to provide a
  controlled pathway for the movement of air across a volume of nicotine free base (chamber "B")
  or candidate acid (chamber "A"). For this experiment chamber B was filled with 200pL nicotine
  free base and chamber A was filled with 200pL pyruvic acid. The volumes of nicotine free base
  and pyruvic acid were added by Eppendorf pipette. Neat nicotine free base and neat pyruvic acid
 were stored at 40 C and under Nitrogen gas. The working volumes of the nicotine free base and
 pyruvic acid were stored under refrigerated conditions but not under nitrogen. The working
 volumes were brought to room temperature before transferring to the chambers. A temperature
 probe was used to verify that the working volumes had reached room temperature. A filling
 portal was crafted into each chamber and positioned on the top center panel and was used for
 filling the chambers with the appropriate reactants. Once the appropriate volume was added to
 the individual chamber, the portal was sealed using a plug of PARAFILM* that was covered
 with TEFLON* tape. The chambers were then connected sequentially using TEFLON* tubing,
 secured by PARAFILM*. The outlet from Chamber B was then connected by TYGON* tubing
 to a filter holder containing a Cambridge filter (44mm diameter) used to collect the reaction
product. See Pillsbury HC, Smoking machine parameters for collection of total particulate matter
 and gases from low ignition- potential cigarettes. Under contract to the U.S. Consumer Product
 Safety Commission #CPSC-S-92-5472 I i March 14, 1993. The opposing side of the filter
housing was connected to a 100cc syringe by TYGON tubing. The syringe was affixed to an
automated system making up the Controlled Puff Volume Apparatus (CPVA). For detailed
methodology, See Levin ED, Rose JE and Behm F. Controlling puff volume without disrupting
smoking topography. Behavior Research Methods Instruments & Comuters, 21:383-386, 1989,
the teachings of which are incorporated by reference herein. The total time to prepare the set-up
from filling the first chamber to initiating the first sampling interval was approximately 5
minutes. The CPVA was programmed to pull a volume of 35cc air at 2 seconds duration (30
second intervals) for 20 times (20 puffs). The filled chambers were immersed at half height into
a water bath and were allowed to equilibrate at 700C for 10 minutes prior to sampling.
             [0165]     Prior to the evaluation of the candidate acids, a control experiment was
conducted in which only the nicotine free base was kept in a chamber and nicotine vapors were
pulled through a Cambridge filter for 20 times (20 puffs of 35cc air in 2 seconds duration and 30
                                               -26-

 seconds puff interval). All the samples were quantified by Gas Chromatography (GC) utilizing a
 NPD (nitrogen phosphorous detector).

            [0169]      Discussion:
            [0170]      The experimental results show that at approximately 70' C, 3-Methyl-2
oxovaleric acid over nicotine delivers the greatest amount of nicotine (363.89pg/puff), followed
by Pyruvic acid (362.28gg/puff), 2-Oxovaleric acid (297.75pg/puff), 4-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid
(281.39pg/puff), 3-Methyl-2-oxobutanoic       acid (213.99gg/puff) and 2-Oxooctanoic acid

 90.48gg/puff. These candidates were evaluated under ambient conditions as described in the
 following experiment. 3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, Pyruvic acid, 2-Oxovaleric acid, 4-Methyl
 2-oxovaleric acid, 3-Methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid and 2-Oxooctanoic acid represent the genus of
 carboxylic acids termed "2-Keto acids" or "Alpha-Keto acids."
             [0171]    EXPERIMENT #3: Evaluation of Leading Acid Candidates Under
Ambient Temperature
             [0172]    Objective:
            [0173]     The objective of this experiment was to assess which of the leading acid
candidates selected from the experiment described above will deliver the greatest amount of
nicotine under ambient conditions.
            [0174]     Experimental Design:
            (0175]     The current experiment was carried out as described in the previous
experiment except that the glass chambers were not immersed in a heated water bath, but
sampled at ambient temperature. Individual experiments were carried out using the selected acid
candidates: 3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, Pyruvic acid, 2-Oxovaleric acid, 4-Methyl-2-oxovaleric
acid, 3-Methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid and 2-Oxooctanoic acid. For each experiment a different acid
was placed in Chamber A as in the previous experiment with nicotine free base in Chamber B.
A nicotine free base control experiment was also conducted as in the previous experiment.

            [0179]     Discussion:
            [0180)     The data from ambient temperature shows that the Pyruvic acid is the
superior candidate to form nicotine aerosol with the delivery of 44.68pg/puff.
            [0181]     EXPERIMENT # 4: Assessment of Leading Acid Candidates from
the Previous 700 C and Ambient Temperature Experiments (Experiment 2 and 3
Respectively) Utilizing the Prior Art Design for Aerosol Generation
            [0182]     Objective:
            [0183]     The objective of this experiment was to compare the prior at
configuration to the sequential orientation of acid and base to determine which yields higher
nicotine delivery. The two leading acid candidates which generated similar nicotine delivery at
-700C and one acid candidate which delivered the highest amount of nicotine under ambient
temperature (from Experiments #2-3) were tested under 70* C and ambient conditions,
respectively.
            [0184]     Experimental Design:
            [0185      In this experiment, two identical rectangular glass chambers exactly like
those used in Experiment # 2 were employed. Chamber A contained 2 0 0 pL of the leading acid
and chamber B contained 200pL of nicotine free base. The two chambers were connected via a
"Y" shaped glass connector which was then connected to the same PTFE housing containing a
Cambridge filter as described previously.      The vapors from the tubes were allowed to be
admixed instantly in the "Y" shaped glass connector upon pulling a volume of 35cc air in 2
                                              -29-

seconds duration (30 seconds interval) for 20 times (20 puffs) using a controlled puff volume
apparatus (CPVA). For the elevated temperature experiments, the acid and nicotine chambers
were immersed at half height into a water bath with a water temperature of approximately 704C.
The chambers were allowed to equilibrate for 10 minutes prior to sampling. For the ambient
room temperature experiments, both the chambers were placed on a laboratory bench. The
collected samples were analyzed for nicotine using Gas chromatography with a Nitrogen
Phosphorous detector.
           [0186]     Results:
           [0187]     The following table shows the results of the assessment of the leading acid
candidates sampled at an elevated temperature (approximately at 70*C) and ambient conditions
and employing prior art systems; also reported for comparison are the results using a sequential
acid-over-base design (from Experiments # 2-3). Results are reported as the mass of nicotine
measured in each puff.

              [0189]    Discussion:
              [0190]    Based on the current data the nicotine delivery in the prior art design is
 significantly lower than the sequential design and hence the sequential design is the superior
 method for the delivery of nicotine aerosol.

 Reservoir and a Base Reservoir to Provide an Acid Over Base Environment in the
 Development of an Aerosol Plume with Sufficient Concentrations of Nicotine
              [0192]    Objective:
              [0193]    The objective of this experiment was to determine the influence of the
arrangement of the acid and base reservoirs in sequence allowing the acid vapors to be lifted into
the nicotine free base chamber and over the nicotine to generate a plume cloud with sufficient
quantities of nicotine free base. Pyruvic acid was selected for use in this experiment.
             [0194]     Experimental Design:
             [0195]     The experimental design was the same as in Experiment #2.            This
experiment was divided into two parts, A and B. The first part, A, involved the assessment of
the use of 200 pL each of nicotine free base and pyruvic acid in separate chambers collected over
3 samples (20 puffs per sample). The second part of the experiment (part B) involved a
comparison of the above system tested under ambient and 40*C conditions to evaluate the effect
of mild heat on aersol formation and nicotine delivery.

 PTFE medical membrane with a non-woven PET membrane support (sold as SMPL-MMT314
 from W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc.) was used as a matrix to load nicotine free base. The
 membrane sheet was rolled into a straw configuration to provide a polyester inner wall and
 TEFLON* outer wall having approximate dimensions of 1.5mm ID and cut into 4cm long
 pieces.
              [0210]   Experimental design:
              [0211]   A piece of air-freshener wick was loaded with ]80pL of pyruvic acid
 (pyruvic acid source element) and the inner walls (polyester side) of three pieces of the 4cm long
 and 1.5mm ID rolled medical membrane were coated with 90 sL (3x30AL) of nicotine free base.
 The air freshener with loaded pyruvic acid was inserted into the distal end of 8mm ID and 9cm
 long clear TEFLON* tube and the three pieces of the medical membrane with nicotine free base
were inserted tightly into a TEFLON* washer which had three holes (nicotine source element).
The nicotine source element was inserted into the 9cm long, 8mm internal diameter (ID)
TEFLON tube with the pymvic acid source element leaving a gap between the pyruvic acid
source element and nicotine source element of 2cm. The arrangement of the source elements was
in such a way that a measured volume of air (35cc at 2sec duration and 30 second puff interval
for 20 times) pulled by automated syringe pump traveled first through the pynvic acid source
element and then through the nicotine source element to form an aerosol. The proximal end of
the device was connected to a controlled puff volume apparatus (CPVA) containing a Cambridge
                                               - 33 -

 filter (to collect aerosol product). For the elevated temperature (40'C) experiment, the 9cm long
 device (which had both pyruvic acid and nicotine source elements) was completely immersed in
a water bath and equilibrated for 10 minutes prior to sampling. The ambient condition
experiment was carried out by placing the chambers on a laboratory bench,

             [0216]      Discussion:
             [0217]      The data indicates that when both the acid and base were loaded onto a
matrix, in this case, air-freshener wick for acid and medical membrane for nicotine free base, a
comparable nicotine delivery was obtained as with the previous experimental apparatus used in
Experiment 5. In addition, the ~40' C condition showed a significantly higher amount of
nicotine delivery (approximately threefold) when compared to the ambient condition.
             [0218]      EXEMPLARY DEVICES ADAPTED                     FOR USE WITH THE
METHODS HEREIN
             [0219]      Delivery devices of some embodiments comprise a housing which
simulates a tobacco smoking article. The housing may simulate the size, shape, and/or
                                                 - 34 -

 configuration of any article used for smoking tobacco articles. Non-limiting examples of
 smoking articles according to the present invention include cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and
 pipes,
             [0220]     Delivery devices of some embodiments comprise a housing which
 simulates a pharmaceutical inhalation device. The housing may simulate the size, shape, and/or
 configuration of any pharmaceutical device used for inhalation. Non-limiting examples of
pharmaceutical inhalation devices according to the present invention include, metered dose
inhalers, pressurized metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, nebulizers and liquid based
inhalers.
             [0221]     ExemplaryDevice 1
             [0222]     Directing attention to Figure I, a device for the formation and delivery of
a nicotine aerosol to a user according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown.
Specifically, nicotine inhaler 10 having the size, shape, and appearance of a cigarette is shown.
Nicotine inhaler 10 consists of housing 12, which has an elongated cylindrical shape and is
hollow. To allow for a gaseous flow through inhaler 10, housing 12 contains gaseous inlet 14
and gaseous outlet 16 on opposing ends.
             [0223]     The portion of housing 12 between gaseous inlet 14 and gaseous outlet 16
is divided into three compartments capable of holding a first, second, and/or third substance.
The first, second, or third substance can comprise a vapor forming medicament, such as nicotine.
             [0224]     As illustrated in Figure 2, nicotine inhaler 10 includes first compartment
18, second compartment 20, and third compartment 22. Nicotine, preferably in the free base
form, may be placed in any of the three compartments. For example, nicotine can be placed
within second compartment 20. A suitable delivery enhancing compound, such as an acid, is
placed within first compartment 18. Any suitable acid can be used. For example, pyruvic acid
can be placed within first compartment 18. Pyruvic acid is a volatile substance which has a
substantial vapor pressure at oom temperature. As such, any free space within first
compartment 18 will be filled to some degree with pynmvic acid vapor, that is, gaseous pyruvic
acid. Although the vapor pressure of nicotine is less than that of pyruvic acid, nicotine is also a
volatile substance. In the same manner, any free space within second compartment 20 will be
filled to some degree with nicotine vapor.
                                                - 35 -

              [0225]     It should be appreciated that the pyruvic acid is held within first
 compartment 18 on a delivery enhancing compound source element (not shown) and nicotine is
 held within second compartment 20 on a nicotine source element (not shown). Additionally, a
 third substance may be held on a third source element (not shown) within third compartment 22.
 Furthermore, one or more of the source elements may be integral with or part of compartments
  18, 20, and 22, respectively.
              [0226]     The delivery enhancing compound source element can be any size and
 shape that allows a gaseous stream to contact a vapor of the acid and pass through first
 compartment 18. The nicotine source element can be any size and shape that allows a gaseous
 stream to contact a vapor of nicotine and pass through second compartment 20. The third source
 element can be any size and shape that allows a gaseous stream to contact a third substance and
 pass through third compartment 22.
              [0227]     The delivery enhancing compound source element can be composed of
 any suitable material capable of holding the acid on its surface while allowing the acid vapors to
permeate into the surrounding area. The nicotine source element can be composed of any
 suitable material capable of holding nicotine on its surface while allowing the nicotine vapors to
permeate into the surrounding area. The third source element can be composed of any suitable
material capable of holding a third substance. In specific embodiments, the suitable material
holds the third substance on its surface while allowing the vapor of the third substance to
permeate into the surrounding area.
             {0228]      Preferably, a suitable source element material is inert to any substance to
be placed on its surface. Additionally, a suitable material is preferably adsorbing with respect to
any substance to be placed on its surface such that said substance is adsorbed on the surface of
the material, Although a material having both absorptive and adsorptive characteristics can be
employed, a material capable of holding the delivery enhancing compound(s), nicotine and/or
third substance through adsorption is preferred. Non-limiting examples include glass, aluminum,
PET, PBT, PTFE, ePTFE, and BAREX".
             [0229]     The adsorptive material may function via capillary action to continuously
present the substances to the surface of the adsorbing material.
                                                 - 36 -

              [0230]      Third compartment 22 can contain a purifying agent. For example,
  activated charcoal can be incorporated into third compartment 22 using any method which
 provides the resulting third compartment 22 with gas purification capability. Suitable methods
  are well-known in the art. For example, the charcoal may be placed within third compartment 22
  as a charcoal plug or filter.
              [0231]      In operation, a user puffs on gaseous outlet 16 of nicotine inhaler 10, as
 shown in Figure 3. The partial vacuum created by the puffing action draws a gaseous stream into
 housing 12 through gaseous inlet 14. The gaseous stream enters first compartment 18 and
 captures a vapor of the acid by passing over the pyruvic acid source element held in first
 compartment 18. The gaseous stream that exits first compartment 18 and subsequently enters
 second compartment 20 is an acid-containing gaseous stream. The acid-containing gaseous
 stream generates a stream of nicotine-containing particles by passing over the nicotine held by
 the nicotine source element in second compartment 20. The stream of nicotine-containing
 particles passes through third compartment 22 and exits through gaseous outlet 16 into the mouth
 of the user. Any unreacted acid is removed from the stream of nicotine-containing particles via
 the activated charcoal filter in third compartment 22. It should be appreciated that pyrvic acid
 could be held on a first element in first compartment 18 and/or nicotine could be held on a
 second element in second compartment 20. Additionally, a third substance, such as a purifying
or flavoring agent, may be held on a third element in third compartment 22. Furthermore, the
 first, second, and third elements may be integral with or part of compartments 18, 20, and 22,
respectively.
             [0232]      Exemplary Device 2
             [0233]      This exemplary device is illustrated and described by reference to Figures
4-6. In Figure 4, the elements of the device are shown in an assembly flow chart. The delivery
enhancing compound source 30 and the nicotine source 40 are optionally manufactured and
stored as independent components generally having frangible barrier end caps 35 and 45 heat
sealed on the ends. These two elements 30 and 40 are inserted into a first housing 50. First
housing 50, containing delivery enhancing compound source 30 and the nicotine source 40, is
then inserted into a second housing 100. The housings 50 and 100 and the elements 30 and 40
are generally extruded plastic tubing. Also inserted into second housing 100 is heating element
95. The heating element 95 is generally a thin flexible heating foil which is configured to wrap
                                                 - 37 -

 around housing 50 and to contact housing 50 sufficiently to enable heating the delivery
 enhancing compound source 30 and/or the nicotine source 40 to a desired temperature (e.g. 40
 degrees C). Heating element 95 is also adapted to contact battery 130 to supply power to the
 heating foil element 95.
             [0234]      Filter element 80 is adapted to insert and snap-lock into second housing
 100. Filter element 80 comprises a filter cavity 75 adapted to contain a filter 70. Filter 70 is
 generally a charcoal filter and may contain additional volatile compounds such as flavoring
 agents commonly used in cigarettes. Filter element 80 may have foil seal 150 to seal the
 assembled pre-use configuration 160.
             [0235]      Filter element 80 has aperture 90 which aligns with aperture 110 of second
 housing 100. When assembled, air inlet 140 is formed. The filter element 80 and the second
housing 100 are configured to permit rotation to select a desired air inlet 140 aperture dimension.
The air inlet 140 forms when filter element 80 is fully inserted into second housing 100 as shown
by 170. The full insertion of filter element 80 also forces penetrating elements 60 through
frangible barriers 35 and 45 to unseal these elements for an unobstructed air flow pathway frm
air inlet 140 to particle delivery aperture 180.
             [0236]      Figure 5 shows various alternative structures for delivery enhancing
compound source 30 and the nicotine source 40. The delivery enhancing compound in this
configuration is generally a volatile acid which may be held by adsorption onto sintered plug
310, PE wick 320, a fiber bundle 330, a mutilumen tube 340 or 350, woven or non-woven PET,
PBT, or PETG fabric material 360, PET static mixer 370, or a helical path wrapped in nonwoven
material 380.
            [0237]       Figure 6 shows some embodiments of this device where the device
comprises a reusable portion 210 and a disposable portion 200. Referring to Figure 1, disposable
portion 200 comprises the delivery enhancing compound source 30 and the nicotine source 40,
the first housing 50, and the filter element 80. The reusable portion 210 comprises second
housing 100, heating element 95 and battery 130.

             [0238]     Exemplary Device 3
             [0239]     A fully reusable exemplary device is illustrated by Figure 7.          Two
 alternative configurations are illustrated wherein portion 410 and 420 or 430 and 440 are
reversibly attachable,     For example the portions may be extruded plastic adapted and
 dimensioned to permit repeated snap-locking and removal. The removable portions 420 or 440
comprise apertures 430 and 440 for communication with delivery enhancing compound source
445 and nicotine source 435. Portions 420 or 440 insert into recharging element 450 through
aperture 460. Elements 470 are sealing o-rings to seal off the reservoir when recharging delivery
enhancing compound source 445 and nicotine source 435. Loading apertures 480 and 490 are
configured to communicate with delivery enhancing compound source 445 and nicotine source
435 once portion 420 is seated in recharging element 450. In some embodiments, gravity drives
flow from delivery enhancing compound reservoir 500 and nicotine reservoir 510 to delivery
enhancing compound source 445 and nicotine source 435, respectively. In some embodiments,
the flow from the reservoirs to the sources is in part due to wicking of the reservoir liquid by the
source elements. For example, delivery enhancing compound source 445 and nicotine source
435 may comprise a source element containing PET to create rapid wicking and thus reloading
of sources 445 and 435.
             [0240]    Exemplary Device 4
             [0241]    Another exemplary device is illustrated by Figures 8 and 9.             This
exemplary device is rechargeable and configured to simulate a typical cigarette pack, Referring
to Figure 8, delivery device 600 is configured to insert into recharging unit 610 through storage
aperture 620 and recharging aperture 630. When fully seated in the recharging unit 610 on
recharging element 640, the device 600 is recharged with delivery enhancing compound and/or
nicotine.
             [0242]    Figure 9 shows the recharging element 640 in detail. In Figure 9A,
injection element 650 having loading apertures 660 and 670 is in flow communication with
reservoirs 720 and 730 through metered dose actuator pumps 680 and 690 and tubes 700 and
710. In Figure 9B, delivery device 600 is shown seated in recharging unit 640. Injection
element 650 passes through a recharging aperture at the base of the delivery device and into said
device so that apertures 660 and 670 are in communication with nicotine source element 740 and
                                               - 39 -

 delivery enhancing compound source element 750. In Figure 9C, the delivery device 600 is
 further inserted into recharging unit 640 to actuate the pumps 680 and 690 to deliver metered
 doses 770 of nicotine and 760 of delivery enhancing compound through apertures 660 and 670,
 respectively, and into nicotine source element 740 and delivery enhancing compound source
 element 750, respectively.
              [0243]     Exemplary Device 5
              [02441     This exemplary device is illustrated by Figure 10.           This device
 configuration has a heating unit 850 external to the delivery device 800.       Upon insertion of
 delivery device 800 into heating unit 850, electrical contacts 840 are in contact with leads 825
which permit battery 830 to heat foil heating element 860 to control the temperature of the
 delivery enhancing compound source 870 and nicotine source 880 to, e.g., 40+5 degrees C. An
 alternative configuration places the heating foil 860 within the delivery device 800, as shown in
Figure 4.
             [0245]      Exemplary Device 6
             [0246]      The foregoing exemplary devices are generally configured to simulate a
cigarette and cigarette pack. The delivery devices suitable for use with the methods herein are
readily configured in a variety of ways. An example is illustrated in Figure 11. This exemplary
device simulates a metered dose inhaler commonly used for pharmaceutical delivery of inhaled
medicaments.       Delivery device 900 comprises a first housing 910 and a second housing 920.
Second housing 920 is removable (Figure IIA) and in (Figure 11B) for recharging or
replacement of battery 990.       The in position brings electrical contact 1050 and 1060 into
communication thereby allowing battery 990 to heat foil heating element 950 to in turn control
the temperature of delivery enhancing compound source 960 and nicotine source 970. Air intake
actuator 930 is configured to slide anywhere from the position in Figure 11 A to I IB. Power for
heating foil element 950 may be optionally turned on or off using air intake actuator 930 or a
separate switching means (not shown). Air intake aperture 940 may then be opened to a selected
degree thereby controlling the volume of air per inhalation and consequently the amount of
nicotine.    This feature is analogous to adjustable air intake aperture 140 of Figure 1. In
operation, air is drawn through air intake aperture 940, down to chamber 1000, through conduit
1010, through the delivery enhancing compound source 960 where delivery enhancing
                                               -40   -

 compound is captured in the air flow. For example, pyruvic acid vapor may be emanating from a
 PET source element having liquid pyruvic acid adsorbed thereon. This vapor is moved by the air
 flow through conduit 1020 into the nicotine source 970. Here the delivery enhancing compound
 increases the concentration of nicotine in the airflow relative to the amount of nicotine vapor that
 would be contained in the same volume of air flow in the absence of the delivery enhancing
 compound. In the case of pyruvic acid, nicotine pyruvate salt particulates may be formed to
 enhance delivery of nicotine to a subject. Delivery may be further enhanced by elevating the
temperature of, e.g., pyruvic acid and nicotine, by means of heating element 950 to increase the
 vapor pressure of those compounds. The airflow containing nicotine now moves through conduit
 1030, through charcoal filter 980 and out the inhalation aperture 1040.
             [0247]     Figure 11 C and D illustrate an embodiment of the exemplary inhaler
device 900 wherein a portion of the device having the delivery enhancing compound source 960
and nicotine source 970 in a disposable housing 1050 which is configured to slide into and out of
reusable housing 1060 to form a device functionally identical to device 900. Battery housing
element 1070 is detachable from disposable element 1050 and thus reusable with portion 1060
and a replacement element 1050.
             [0248]     Exemplary Device 7
             [0249]     Figure 12, A-C illustrates another configuration of an inhalation device.
In this configuration, the delivery enhancing compound source and the nicotine source are the
lower and upper surface areas of split inner tube 1100. In the usage configuration 12A, an
impermeable cover. 1110 is in place over nicotine reservoir 1120 and delivery enhancing
compound reservoir 1130. The impermeable cover 1110 reduces evaporative loss from the
reservoirs and physically separates the reservoirs from the split inner tube 1100. In use, bottom
housing 1180 is pushed into main housing 1190 until first catch spring 1140 is locked in the
position shown in 12B. This places the reservoirs 1120 and 1130 in parallel proximity to the
split inner tube 1100. Shown in 9C, the bottom housing 1180 is further inserted into main
housing] 190 until second catcb spring 1150 is locked in the position shown in 12C. In this third
position, pressure elements 1160 squeeze split inner tube 1100 to force wall 1170 into contact
with reservoirs 1120 and 1130. This action forces nicotine and delivery enhancing compound
(e.g. pyruvic acid) onto the inner surface of wall 1170 to recharge this surface as the nicotine
source and the delivery enhancing compound source.

              [0250)    Exemplary Device 8
              [0251)    Figure 13 shows a variant of the device of Figure 12. In this version,
 bottom housing 1250 is depressed against conical spring 1230 to force the nicotine reservoir
 1210 and the delivery enhancing compound reservoir 1220 through reservoir cover 1200 and into
 contact with the inner surface of conical inner tube 1240, thereby coating the surface with
 nicotine and delivery enhancing compound (Figure 13B).
              [0252]    Exemplary Device 9
              [0253]    Figure 14 shows another version of the device of Figure 12. In this
version, outer housing 1300 is contiguous with the moving components being switch 1310 and
the various internal elements shown. Switch 1310 is connected to source seating element 1330
by a connecting bar 1320. As switch 1310 is moved up, rigid seating element 1330 moves along
pole 1360. At the charging position, reservoir elements 1340 and 1350 are brought into contact
with flexible element 1370 which is also brought into contact with rigid seating element 1330.
Rigid seating element 1330 is dimensioned to squeeze flexible elements 1370 into contact with
reservoir elements 1340 and 1350 in the final portion of the sliding motion (Fig. 14 B). This
action coats the upper portion of flexible element 1370 with, e.g., nicotine base solution from
reservoir 1350 and the lower portion of flexible element 1370 with pyruvic acid from 1340 to
create a nicotine source and a delivery enhancing compound source, respectively. The top
surface of reservoir 1350 may be covered by an impermeable material to limit the amount of
volatilization of medicament and delivery enhancing compound from the reservoirs when in the
operational position (Figure 14 A). A circular flap of flexible, impermeable material may extend
from elements 1320 or 1330 to close off the volume below reservoir 1350 and further limit
volatilization. In charging position (Figure 14B) the flap would be forced down and away from
the reservoirs by flexible element 1370.
             [0254]     Exemplary Device 10
             [0255]     Figure 15 shows another delivery device configuration. Figure 15A shows
the device 1400 in use mode. Air moves from intake 1410 past delivery enhancing compound
source 1500, nicotine source 1490 and through outlet 1415. The nicotine and delivery enhancing
compound are coated onto the side walls of their respective sources. To recharge the sources,
delivery enhancing compound reservoir 1430 and nicotine reservoir 1420 are provided. Switch
                                              -42-

 1460 may be actuated to recharge the sources. Upon activation by switch 1460, base 1510 is
moved along guide rod 1470 toward delivery enhancing compound source 1500 and nicotine
source 1490. Shown in Figure 15B, upon contact with the delivery enhancing compound source
 1500, the nicotine source 1490 and the upper stop element 1480, impermeable caps 1440 and
 1450 compress reservoirs to force delivery enhancing compound and nicotine out onto the
surfaces of the sources 1490 and 1500. The reservoirs in this device may be made of any
flexible adsorbing or absorbing material capable of holding the nicotine or delivery enhancing
solutions. The reservoirs will generally be motivated back down guide pole 1470 automatically
after recharging the sources, thus making the device a conveniently operated "one click" device.
The movement of the reservoirs may be achieved by any convenient means. For example, a
motive wire 1520 may be provided within a groove on guide pole 1470. The motive wire 1520
may be attached to base 1510 and moves up and down the guide pole 1470 by a motor rotated
element (not shown). In some versions of this device configuration, the top outer portion of
device 1400 may be rotated to define the size of inlet 1410 analogous to element 140 shown in
Figure 4.
