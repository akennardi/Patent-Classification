FRICTION-MODIFYING COATINGS
ABSTRACT
A system and method for the application of friction-modifying coatings to roadways, walkways,
pathways and other areas subject to vehicular, human or animal traffic, the system and method
comprising the controlled, simultaneous application of binder and filler to a surface of a
substrate, using a mobile device which passes over the substrate as the binder and filler are
being applied. Binder is applied from openings in a lower portion of a tube into which binder is
fed, such openings including a single slot, multiple slots, circular opening, arranged in single or
multiple rows with overlap regions. Both the binder and the filler are precisely and accurately
metered onto the substrate, ensuring uniform coating thickness and performance. The method of
this invention also enables the use of different binding systems and precise control over mixing
ratios for multi-component binders.

SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR AUTOMATING
THE APPLICATION OF FRICTION-MODIFYING COATINGS
            10001]   This is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2015223083, the
entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
            10001a] The present invention relates generally to a system, and associated method, for
applying friction-modifying coatings to a surface, and more particularly, for automating the application
from a mobile platform of friction-modifying coatings to a surface of a substrate, such as a roadway.
BACKGROUND
            10002]   The construction and public safety industries are constantly looking for means to
make substrates, such as roadways, pathways, and other high-use areas, safer for vehicular and human
traffic. One developing area is in the application of friction-modifying coatings to surfaces of substrates
to help increase their coefficient of friction, thereby reducing slippage and skidding and making them
safer for their intended use. In particular, the roadway industry is trying to reduce the number of
accidents caused by loss of tire grip on bridges, curves, intersections, and school zones. Speed, tire
condition, and weather conditions can all play a role in these accidents; however, studies have found that
increasing the coefficient of friction of the roadway through the use of high friction coatings can increase
tire grip, regardless of the weather conditions or nature or condition of the tires.
            10003]   Currently, few surfaces are being treated with friction-modifying coatings. The
surfaces that have been coated are typically being done manually. For example, in the case of a two
component epoxy system, the most common type of binder, the process conventionally starts when a
laborer opens the spigot of a tote containing a polymer binder resin, adding it manually to a garbage can
or similar container. The spigot is closed when the resin reaches a predetermined level in the garbage
can. A second spigot on a second tote containing a catalyst hardener is then opened, adding the hardener
to the resin until a second, predetermined level is reached in the garbage can. In some instances, five
gallon pails of hardener and resin are combined in the garbage can. The resin and hardener are then
mixed, using a mixing blade attached to a hand drill.
            10004]   The mixed polymer binder is then poured out onto the surface to be coated by tipping
the garbage can over or dipping smaller buckets into the garbage can and then pouring the composite
polymer binder out of the smaller container onto the surface to be

                                                 2
coated.    The polymer binder is then spread over the surface, using a squeegee or similar
device.
         [0005]      Once the polymer binder is on the surface of the substrate, laborers
manually shovel a friction-modifying filler onto the binder. Manually operated blowers and
similar instruments have also been used to distribute the friction-modifying filler. The most
common filler is bauxite which, once applied, partially sinks into the polymer binder. The
epoxy, when it has hardened, acts to bind the filler to the substrate, creating a uniform
coating. Because the filler is irregularly shaped, typically jagged and protruding from the
polymer binder, it acts to increase the friction coefficient of the surface.
         [0006]      There are a number of drawbacks to the conventional method of
application described above. For example, conventional methods utilize a multi-part binder
which is manually poured, mixed, and applied to the substrate. Combining the multi-part
binder is done using a significant amount of human judgment and imprecise measuring
techniques, which introduce error into the component mixing ratios. Most multi-part systems
have an ideal ratio of resin and catalyst. Too much of either one of these components can
detrimentally affect the properties and performance of the hardened product including, but
not limited to, durability, degradation, filler binding, ductility, and frictional properties.
         [0007]      Furthermore, the conventionally practiced method of coating preparation
utilizes manual mixing of the components. There is the potential for the components not to
be mixed adequately, resulting in pockets of polymer binder wherein the ratio of resin to
hardener is not optimal.      This variability can ultimately affect the quality of the binder,
adhesion to filler, the degree of curing and/or the curing time.
         [0008]      Additionally, if the mixing time of the binder is too long and the binder
starts to cure prior to application on the substrate, it may reduce the spread ability and
substrate adhesion as well as filler penetration and adhesion.
         [0009]      Furthermore, in the conventional practice of application, the binder is
spread on the surface using a squeegee or the like which results in significant variability in
the thickness of the binder across the surface of the substrate. As a result, the binder can be
too thick in some places and too thin in others. Thick binder can increase drying times and
delay the surface availability. Moreover, it can also diminish the integrity of the coating as
well as the performance of the coating if the filler is fully enveloped by the binder and does
not stick up from its surface. Similarly, binder that is too thin can reduce the integrity and

                                                  3
performance of the binder by not providing enough material to hold the filler in place or
adhere it to the substrate.
         [0010]      The way the filler is added to the binder can also influence the quality,
performance and integrity of the coating. In the conventional method of application when the
filler is shoveled or blown onto the surface of the wet binder, it has the tendency to impact
the surface of the binder and displace it away from the impact zone.                Thus the filler
uniformity and overall coating density can vary significantly. In areas with too much filler,
the integrity of the coating can be reduced.         In areas with too little filler, the frictional
properties of the coating can be reduced.
         [0011]      Therefore, what is needed is a system and method for applying friction
modifying coatings to a surface, such as a roadway, without incurring the many drawbacks
discussed above.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
         [0012]      The present invention, accordingly, provides a system and method for
applying friction-modifying coatings to a surface of a substrate, such as a roadway, using
automated equipment mounted on a mobile platform, such as a truck, trailer, cart or the like,
to make a simultaneous application of binder and filler to the surface. The mobile platform is
preferably driven or pulled across the surface to be coated while the binder and filler are
applied to the substrate. Preferably, with respect to the direction of forward movement of the
mobile platform, the binder applicator, which binder may comprise a single component or
plural components in nature, is positioned forward of the filler applicator, such that the binder
gets applied to the substrate and, as the mobile platform moves forward, the filler is then
added to the binder. Thus, the time between the application of the binder and the addition of
the filler is very short, such as less than a few seconds.
         [0013]      The binder applicator preferably comprises a cylindrical tube capable of
being attached to a moving platform. The tube preferably defines at least one cavity within
the tube, and each end of the tube is closed. The tube further defines at least one upper
opening in an upper portion of the tube, and the at least one upper opening is capable of
receiving binder into the cavity. One or more lower openings are defined in a lower portion
of the tube, wherein the one or more lower openings preferably collectively extend
substantially across the length of the tube and are adapted for dispensing binder from the at
least one cavity onto the surface of a substrate. By way of example, the one or more lower

                                                 4
openings may assume the shape of a single slot, multiple slots, or multiple circular openings.
Multiple slots or openings are preferably arranged in two rows and overlap in an overlap
region to facilitate a uniform dispensing of binder to a surface of a substrate.
         [0014]      The systems and methods enable the precise and uniform application of
the coating by mechanically controlling and metering both the binder and filler. This ensures
good control over coating thickness and binder-to-filler ratios, enabling the coating to be
optimized to the surface and desired friction performance. In the case of plural component
binders, the method of this invention preferably utilizes inline mixers located immediately
before a novel binder applicator to ensure excellent component mixing.                The binder
applicator, according to principles of the present invention, ensures the uniform application of
binder to the substrate. In addition, the binder applicator of the present invention is designed
for ease of manufacture.
         [0015]      The systems and methods of this invention have several advantages over
conventional means of applying friction-modifying coatings to substrates. For example, the
method of this invention has the benefit of decreasing the amount of manual labor required to
apply binder and filler to the substrate. The conventional method employs manual labor to
mix binder, apply binder to substrate, apply filler, and remove excess filler.          Using the
method of this invention, the processes of mixing and application of binder and filler are fully
automated, thereby reducing the amount of labor required to apply the system to the
substrate.
         [0016]      A further advantage of this invention is the increased safety benefit to the
workers applying the friction-modifying coating.          In roadway application, the friction
modifying coating is generally applied after traffic is blocked off in one or more lanes, using
barricades and the like. Although signs and markers are used to divert traffic, laborers still
are at risk of being hit by vehicular traffic. In the method of this invention, the mixing and
application equipment is preferably mounted on the back of a truck or trailer pulled by a
motorized vehicle, reducing the number of people required to openly walk on the roadway,
exposed to traffic.
         [0017]      A further benefit of this invention is an increase in the application rate of
the friction-modifying coating.       The conventional method of application results in an
application rate of approximately 1,000 square yards per day.            Using the systems and
methods of this invention, the application rate can be increased to over 10,000 square yards
per day, although conventional rates of application are possible if desired. This will have the

                                                 5
benefit of decreasing the amount of time required to complete a project as well as a reduction
in the disruption of the traffic, due to closure of the surface being coated.
         [0018]     A further benefit of this invention is a reduction in the time that transpires
from the time the binder is applied to the substrate and the time the filler is added to the
binder. For the previous methods of application, several minutes can pass before the filler is
added to the binder. This is the result of the time required to mix and then manually apply
the binder and then the filler to the binder. The method of this invention results in the filler
being added almost immediately to the binder in sequence and in virtually a one-step
process. The lapsed time between application of the binder and addition of the filler should
be short, preferably less than 5 seconds. This results in greater filler penetration and a more
durable coating.
         [0019]     Another benefit of this invention is the uniformity of the friction
modifying coating and filler within the composition. Under the conventional methods of
application, the filler is added to the binder either by manually shoveling it, or through the
use of a manually operated blower. Both of these conventional methods result in variability
in the filler density per square foot of substrate surface, and patches containing too much
filler and others not containing enough filler. The method of the present invention results in
the uniform application of filler across the width and length of the surface being coated.
Thus, there is high uniformity of filler density per square foot, and the filler density can be
controlled at an optimal value to ensure a desired friction coefficient with the least amount of
filler. The correct filler density also has the added benefit of ensuring the best ratio of filler
and binder to produce the greatest coating strength, integrity, and durability.
         [0020]     In the case of multi-component binders, the method of the present
invention has the benefit of enabling accurate metering and control over the component ratio,
excellent component mixing, and rapid application after the components are mixed. The use
of automated flow controls ensure the desired component flow ratios, and the use of inline
mixers located proximate to application ensure good mixing of components.                The short
duration of time from mixing until application, has the benefit of ensuring that the mixed
binder is applied quickly at the ideal curing point and temperature, which in turn will ensure
excellent filler penetration, substrate adhesion, and coating uniformity.
         [0021]     Still another benefit of this invention is reducing costs of repairs. The non
uniformity of the conventional methods as discussed above resulted in sections of coated
substrate with a sub-par coating. Some of these sections lacked sufficient friction-modifying

                                               6
properties due to a lack of filler being applied. Other sections lost their friction-modifying
properties sooner than anticipated because not enough binder had been applied. These issues
resulted in costly repairs to re-coat the substrate. The present invention provides increased
uniformity in the application of binder and filler, thus reducing cost associated with re
coating.
         [0022]    The designs of various components used in the systems and methods of the
present invention are also optimized for ease of manufacture, thereby further reducing costs
associated with practicing the systems and methods of the present invention. For example,
the binder applicator described herein employs a novel and cost-effective design that reduces
the amount of labor associated with laser-drilling the component.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         [0040]     The invention relates to the controlled preparation and application of
friction-modifying coatings, comprising a binder and filler, to surfaces subject to vehicular,
human, and/or animal traffic.      Friction-modifying coatings are applied to areas where the
friction coefficient of the surface needs to be increased in order to reduce skidding or
slipping, making it safer and/or better for its intended purpose.        Included in the many
substrate surfaces which can benefit from the application of these coatings are pathways,
walkways, highways and roadways, bridge decks, parking lots, school zones, road crossings,
railway crossings, dangerous intersections, bike lanes, toll lanes, sharp corners, intersections,
overpasses, hospital zones, playgrounds, gymnasiums, and the like.
         [0041]     In the discussion of the FIGURES, the same reference numerals will
generally be used throughout to refer to the same or similar components. In the interest of
conciseness, various components known to the art, such as metering devices, pumps, positive
displacement pumps, screw pumps, extruders, valves, control valves, orifices, flow
controllers, nozzles, spray nozzles, extruders, brushes, jets, impellers, blowers, rollers,
orifices, pipes, tubes, knives, ribboners, motorized mixers, mixing screws, paddles, impellers,

                                                8
propellers, in-line mixers, static mixers, minerals, rocks, metals, metal oxides, hydrates,
hydroxides, salts, silicates, epoxy hardener and resin, and the like, have not been shown or
discussed in any detail as such are considered to be well-known to persons having ordinary
skill in the art.
         [0042]     Referring to FIGURE 1 of the drawings, the reference numeral 100
generally designates a multi-part coating system embodying features of the present invention.
The system 100 includes a mobile platform 102 coupled to a truck tractor 103 (shown only in
part) adapted for pulling the mobile platform 102 on the surface of a substrate 202 whose
properties are to be modified.      In alternative embodiments of the invention, the mobile
platform 102 coupled to a truck tractor 103 may be replaced with a truck. The truck or truck
tractor 103 is preferably adapted for pulling the mobile platform over the substrate 202 at
between about 0.1 and 5 miles per hour, although speeds of up to 30 miles per hour or even
faster could be used in certain applications. As discussed further below, in operation, the
mobile platform 100 travels over the surface of the substrate 202 to be coated and applies a
coating to the substrate as it moves forward. The mobile platform 100 is typically between
about 1 and 30 feet wide, and preferably between about 8 and 12 feet wide.
         [0043]     One or more storage vessels or containers 104 are positioned on the
platform 102 for containing various binder components, discussed in further detail below.
The storage containers 104 may be operated at atmospheric or elevated pressure. Further, the
storage containers 104 are coupled via lines 106, one or more metering devices 108, and lines
116 to a binder applicator 118. The metering devices 108 may include pumps (e.g., positive
displacement pumps, screw pumps, and the like), extruders, valves, control valves, orifices,
flow controllers and/or the like, or a combination thereof, well-known to those skilled in the
art, for conveying or metering components contained within the containers 104.
         [0044]     A hopper 122 is preferably also positioned on the mobile platform 102 for
storing filler to be added to the binder, as discussed in further detail below. Preferably, one
or more flow zones and/or zone flow controllers 120 are coupled to the hopper, rearward of
the binder applicator 118, for metering filler to be applied onto the binder. A distributor 124
is preferably positioned under the controllers 120 for facilitating an even distribution of filler
onto the binder.
         [0045]     FIGURE 2 is a schematic top view of the trailer 102, taken along the line
2-2 of FIG. 1. In addition to the elements of the invention set forth in FIG. 1, FIG. 2 depicts
optional elements, such as an optional mixer 112 coupled to the meters 108 via lines 110.

                                                 9
The mixer 112 is adapted for mixing the components stored in containers 104 pumped from
the meters 108, although mixing can alternatively occur directly in lines 114 and 116 (e.g.,
inline mixers) if the mixer 112 is not present.
         [0046]      The binder applicator 118 may comprise multiple binder zones (e.g., B
ZONE 1 to B-ZONE x). Each binder zone preferably has at least one line 116 associated
with it, which allows binder zones to be individually turned-on or turned-off. The number of
hopper flow control zones 120 (e.g., F-ZONE 1 to F-ZONE x) preferably corresponds in
number to the number of binder zones 118. In an alternative embodiment of the invention,
depicted in FIG. 3, the binder applicator 118 consists of a single binder zone, and similarly,
there is but a single hopper flow control zone 120.
         [0047]      With reference to both FIGS. 2 and 3, in a preferred embodiment of the
invention, a portion of the surface of the substrate 202 is designated as a heating zone 125
which is heated or dried, prior to application of the binder, using any suitable technique, such
as hot air, radiation, ultraviolet (UV) light, infrared (IR) light, microwaves, or the like, to
prepare the surface of the substrate and facilitate adhesion of the binder to the surface.
         [0048]      In addition to a heating zone 125, there is preferably also a curing zone
126 optionally identified proximate to the hopper flow control zones 120.               Preferably
positioned proximate to the curing zone would be equipment or means for expediting or
facilitating binder curing, including equipment for blowing air onto the binder, or applying to
the binder radiation, such as IR light, UV light, heat, microwaves, and/or the like.
         [0049]      The systems and methods of the invention comprise the use of a multi-part
coating system, preferably comprising a binder and a filler embedded in the binder. The
binder acts as a matrix to suspend and hold the filler in place and causes it to adhere to the
surface of the substrate. The filler acts to change the friction coefficient of the surface by
protruding from the binder or otherwise increasing the overall coefficient of friction. Thus,
the systems and methods of the invention apply binder and filler to surfaces of a substrate
(e.g., roads, highways, and the like) subject to traffic, thereby modifying the frictional
properties of the surfaces.
         [0050]      According to a preferred method of the invention, the filler and binder are
metered and applied to the substrate 202 in an automated, continuous, virtually one-step
process that results in better coating integrity, uniformity, durability, and reduced application
time. The binder is preferably a single or plural component binder that is preferably stored in
one or more storage vessels or containers 104 on the mobile platform 102. In the case of a

                                                 10
single component binder that is solid at ambient conditions, heat may optionally be added to
storage containers 104 and/or lines 106 to liquefy the binder and enable it to be more readily
transferred through lines, piping, or the like. The flow of the binder is precisely metered
using metering devices 108, such as positive pumps, displacement pumps, screw pumps,
extruders, valves, control valves, orifices, or the like, or a combination thereof.
         [0051]     For multi-component binders, the various components are preferably
mixed by way of a mixer 112, and are then passed via lines 114 and 116 to the binder
applicator 118. Alternatively, multi-component binders may be mixed in lines 114 and 116,
for example, using an inline mixer (not shown). For single component binders, the mixer 112
is not needed, and the binder preferably flows directly to the binder applicator 118.
         [0052]     As discussed in further detail below with respect to FIGS. 4-16, the binder
applicator 118 spreads out the binder across the width of the surface to be coated and deposits
a uniform layer of binder across the desired width. The binder applicator 118 may have one
or more binder zones (B-ZONE 1 to B-ZONE X). Each binder zone preferably has at least
one line 116 associated with it. This allows an operator to individually turn-on or turn-off a
particular binder zone. Thus, the width of the substrate being coated can be controlled by the
number of binder zones (B-ZONE I to B-ZONE X) that are activated.
         [0053]     Within a short time, preferably less than five seconds, of application of the
binder to the substrate 202 (FIG. 1), the filler contained in hopper 122 is metered through
zone flow controllers 120 (F-ZONE 1 to F-ZONE x) and applied onto the binder. The
number of hopper flow control zones is preferably the same as the number of binder zones.
The width of application is controlled by controlling the number of binder zones (B-ZONE 1
to B-ZONE x) and filler zones (F-ZONES) used. Additional conveyers (not shown) may be
used to more uniformly distribute the filler across the width of the binder.            Following
application of the binder, and either before or after the application of filler, accelerators such
as UV or IR radiation, heat, microwaves, and/or the like, may be used to facilitate or
accelerate the curing of the binder.
         [0054]     For plural component binders, the binder first flows through lines 110 to
one or more mixers 112, through the lines 114 and 116, and then through the binder
applicator 118.     The one or more mixers 112 preferably comprise contained motorized
mixers, mixing screws, paddles, impellers, propellers, in-line mixers, static mixers, and/or the
like, effective for uniformly mixing a plurality of components. The binder then flows to the

                                               11
binder applicator 118 proximate to B-ZONE 1 to B-ZONE x. The filler is preferably applied
as discussed above after the binder has been applied to the substrate 202.
        [0055]      In one alternative embodiment of the invention, the filler and binder are
mixed prior to application and then applied at the same time.           In accordance with this
embodiment, the filler and binder are metered into a mixing zone comprising a section, such
as a vessel, tank, channel, pipe, box, or other suitable means effective for creating contact
between a plurality of components prior to application on the substrate. A mixing device
such as a paddle, blade, impeller, propeller, screw, conveyor, tumbler or the like, effective for
mixing a plurality of components, may be used to mix the filler and binder.
        [0056]      The binder can be a one or multiple part system, comprising one or more
of polymers, elastomers, thermoplastics, thermosets, or the like, including vulcanized
rubbers, Bakelites, urea-formaldehydes, melamine resins, epoxy resins, polyamides, plastics,

                                                 12
additives such as viscosity modifiers, catalysts, accelerators, UV protectors, inhibitors, anti
oxidants, repellants, oils, and the like, can be added to the binder to change its physical or
chemical properties to enhance characteristics such as pumpability, spreadability, curing rate,
cured binder properties, ductility, motility, hardness, adhesion cohesion sprayability,
extrudability, durability, wear rate, applyability, oxidative stability, thermal stability, UV
stability, and the like.
         [0057]      It is preferable that the binder, once applied and cured, be solid or semi
solid at the normal, or ambient, operating conditions of the substrate.             The binder is
preferably applied as a liquid which then solidifies once it is applied to the substrate;
however, it is possible to apply solids such as powders, pellets, or the like, directly to the
substrate and subsequently melt, react, or dissolve them to form a uniform coating. In the
case of a liquid binder, the binder is applied as a liquid which cures and hardens after
application to the substrate through chemical or physical changes, such as cross-linking,
curing or solidification, and/or the like.      For example, if a thermo-plastic is used as the
binder, the thermoplastic may be heated above its melting point, prior to its application to the
substrate, until it becomes a fluid. Thereafter, the fluid cools to a uniform solid. If a multi
component liquid binder is used, then the liquid parts are preferably combined prior to
application and cured into a solid. Heating may be used depending on the binder to change
the physical properties of the binder to enhance pumping and/or ease of application.
Optionally, a liquid binder may be applied to the substrate, and radiation, heat, microwaves,
light, and/or the like, may be used to cure the binder.
         [0058]      The binder applicator 118 preferably applies the binder to the substrate by
pouring, dripping, spraying, rolling, brushing, extruding, wiping, squeegeeing, ribboning,
baring, and/or the like.
         [0059]      The filler is preferably added to the binder prior to hardening or curing in a
metered fashion at a rate calculated to attain a desired density and respective coating
frictional properties. The filler preferably comprises one or more minerals, rocks, metals,
metal oxides, hydrates, hydroxides, salts, silicates, plastics, polymers, glasses, halides,
sulfides, phosphates, carbonates, carbon, oxides, ores, and/or the like. The filler is preferably
applied to the binder through a hopper or similar device which temporarily stores the filler.
Application of the filler to the binder preferably occurs through a drop or rotary spreader,
blower, conveyor, screw, or similar material transfer device.

                                                13
         [0060]     Other fillers, catalysts, or performance-enhancing materials can also be
added to the binder to enhance the properties of the friction-modifying coating. By way of
example, but not limitation, fillers, catalysts, or performance-enhancing materials may
include catalysts, compatabilizers,     ultra-violet stabilizers, thermal stabilizers, oxidative
stabilizers, chemical stabilizers, wear resistance modifiers, reflectivity enhancers, water
repellants, oil repellants, ice repellants, co-polymers, rubbers, pigments, and/or the like,
effective for changing the properties or performance of the coating.
         [0061]     The application of the binder and filler are preferably mechanically linked
in close proximity to each other on a mobile platform 202, such as a truck or trailer, which
passes over the substrate to be coated.     However, in an alternative embodiment, the binder
can be applied from one mobile platform and the filler can be applied from another mobile
platform.    As the mobile platform(s) moves forward, the binder is precisely metered and
applied to the substrate 202. Within a short period of time, because the platform(s) is (are)
moving forward, the filler is metered and precisely added on top of the binder.         Both the
binder and filler are added in proportion to the speed of the mobile platform(s) to ensure the
proper application thickness and proportions of filler and binder.          Once the binder has
hardened, the excess filler is collected and reused.
         [0062]     The preferred binder is a two part epoxy comprising a catalyst (hardener)
and a resin. The hardener and resin are stored in storage vessels or containers 104 on the
mobile platform 100. Each part of the epoxy, individually, is preferably filtered and then
conveyed using positive displacement pumps on meters 108, or similar means of material
transfer and control, to one large static mixer, or preferably a series of smaller static mixers,
located in close proximity to a binder applicator 118.          Alternatively, inline mixers (not
shown) may be located in lines 116. The ratio of the two parts of the epoxy is precisely
controlled by adjusting the ratio of the flow or hardener to the flow of resin using a hardener
pump and/or resin pump. The ratio of resin to hardener differs with the epoxy system, but
conventionally varies from approximately 5 parts resin and 1 part hardener to 1 part resin and
5 parts hardener. In one preferred embodiment, an approximate ratio of 1 part resin to 1 part
hardener is used.
         [0063]     In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the application rate of the
binder is adjusted to produce a thickness of between about 1 mil and 500 mils, and preferably
between 40 and 80 mils. The desired application thickness is determined by the substrate 202
properties, surface, climate, filler properties, desired frictional properties, and/or the like.

                                                14
Using the method of this invention, the thickness can be precisely controlled by varying the
speed of the mobile platform 100 and the total flow rate of the binder.
         [0064]     In the preferred embodiment of the invention, a series of between 1 and 20
inline mixers, preferably helical static mixers, are used to combine and uniformly mix the two
parts of the epoxy, although other mixer types can also be used. Preferably, the number of
inline mixers corresponds to the number of binder zones (B-ZONES); however, it is possible
to use one mixer and then feed each of the binder zones from the one mixer. The inline
mixers are designed to ensure thorough mixing of the hardener and resin prior to application
through the binder applicator 118.
         [0065]     Turning now to the binder applicator 118 in particular, a first preferred
embodiment of the binder applicator is shown in FIGURES 4-6. As shown in FIG. 4, the
binder applicator 118 preferably comprises a cylindrical tube, such as a pipe, within which is
defined a hollow cavity 405. Optionally, the binder applicator 118 has one or more zone
partitions 410 that define two or more binder zones, as also exemplified by FIG. 2. Lines 116
connect the binder applicator 118 to the upstream components (e.g., storage vessels or
containers, metering devices, and mixers). Preferably there will be at least one line 116 for
each binder zone present. While not required, in a preferred embodiment, an applicator bar
404, comprising a plate shown most clearly in FIG. 6, is attached to the binder applicator 118
to further regulate the uniformity and thickness of binder deposited onto the substrate 202.
The plate constituting the applicator bar 404 is preferably flat, as shown, but may also be
curved.
         [0066]     FIGURE 5 shows a bottom view of the binder applicator 118 shown in
FIG. 4. One or more elongated co-linear openings or slots 402 are formed in the bottom of
the binder applicator 118. Each slot 402 corresponds to a separate binder zone. The binder
applicator 118 is preferably 8 to 12 feet long, although it may be shorter or longer. The
length of the openings or slots 402, collectively, is preferably at least 90% of the length of the
binder applicator 118. The width of the slots 402 is suitably sized for facilitating a desired or
optimal binder flow rate. The slots 402 may be formed in any suitable manner, such as by
way of laser in a single pass while still permitting an optimal binder flow rate.
         [0067]     FIGURE 6 shows a cross-sectional view of the binder applicator 118 taken
along section line 5-5 in FIG. 4. Preferably, the binder applicator 118 is roughly cylindrical
with a diameter between one and six inches. However, in other embodiments, the binder
applicator 118 can be of another shape (e.g., hexagonal, square, or rectangular when viewed

                                              15
from the side). Line 116 is connected to the upper portion of binder applicator 118. Opening
or slot 402 is formed in the lower portion of the binder applicator 118. The applicator bar
404 is preferably attached (e.g., by welding) as shown to the binder applicator 118 behind the
slot 402.
         [0068]     According to a preferred method and operation of binder applicator 118 of
FIGS. 4-6, binder enters the binder applicator 118 via lines 116. Binder fills the cavities 405
and is then dispensed through slot 402 preferably onto the applicator bar 404. The applicator
bar 404 further regulates the uniformity and thickness of binder, which is then dispensed onto
the surface of the substrate 202.       As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 4, the binder
applicator 118 has three binder zones corresponding to the three cavities 405 fed by
corresponding lines 116. Each line 116, and hence each binder zone, may be individually
controlled, e.g., by a switch or valve (not shown). Thus, the width of the surface of the
substrate coated may be controlled.
         [0069]     A second preferred embodiment of the binder applicator 118 is shown in
FIGURES 7-8.       In this embodiment, the zone partitions 410 (see FIG. 4) are omitted. A
single hollow cavity 405 is formed inside the binder applicator 118. A single slot 402 is
formed extending substantially along the length of the binder applicator 118. The slot 402
corresponds to a single binder zone, as exemplified by FIG. 3. The applicator bar 404 is
preferably attached to the binder applicator 118 as in the embodiment of FIGS. 4-6.
         [0070]     According to a preferred method and operation of binder applicator 118 of
FIGS. 7-8, binder enters the binder applicator 118 via lines 116. Binder fills the cavity 405
and is then dispensed through slot 402 preferably onto the applicator bar 404. The applicator
bar 404 further regulates the uniformity and thickness of binder, which is then dispensed onto
the surface of the substrate 202.
         [0071]     In a third preferred embodiment of the binder applicator 118, exemplified
by FIGURES 9 and 10, flanges 602 are attached to the binder applicator 118. The flanges
602 provide additional structural support to the walls of the binder applicator 118 against the
forces applied by the binder, which in some embodiments is pumped into the cavity (or
cavities) 405 at high pressure. Such forces over time may distort the shape of the slots 402
and cavity (or cavities) 405, particularly when zone partitions 410 are omitted. The flanges
602 prevent such distortion and allow the binder applicator 118 to perform optimally for
years. The applicator bar 404 is preferably attached to the binder applicator 118 as in the
embodiments of FIGS. 4-8.

                                              16
        [0072]      According to a preferred method and operation of binder applicator 118 of
FIGS. 9-10, binder enters the binder applicator 118 via lines 116. Binder fills the cavity 405
and is then dispensed through slot 402 preferably onto the applicator bar 404. The applicator
bar 404 further regulates the uniformity and thickness of binder, which is then dispensed onto
the surface of the substrate 202.
        [0073]      In a fourth preferred embodiment of the binder applicator 118, depicted by
FIGURES 11-13, lines 116 are coupled to binder applicator 118. A plurality of openings 802
and 804 are formed in the lower portion of binder applicator 118. Optionally, zone partitions
410 (e.g., FIG. 4) may be utilized, and the applicator bar 404 is preferably attached to the
binder applicator 118 as in the embodiments of FIGS. 4-10. .
        [0074]      A bottom view of binder applicator 118 of FIGURE 11 is shown in
FIGURE 12. In this embodiment, the opening or slot 402 (e.g., FIGS. 5 and 8) are replaced
with openings 802 and 804, which are preferably generally circular in shape, having a
diameter suitable for a desired or optimal binder flow rate and ease of manufacture and
maintenance. The openings 802 and 804 are linearly arranged into two rows along the length
of the binder applicator 118 as shown in FIG. 12.
        [0075]      As shown in FIGURE 13 (a partial view along section line 13), each
opening 802 is offset from a corresponding opening 804, thus forming an overlap region 806.
The overlap region 806 is sized to provide increased uniformity when binder is dispensed.
Preferably, the width of each overlap region 806 is approximately 10-40% of the diameter of
each opening.
        [0076]      In alternate embodiments, the number of rows used may vary, from a
single row of openings to three or more rows of openings.         The size and number of the
openings 802 and 804 may vary to obtain the desired binder flow-rate properties.
        [0077]      The openings 802 and 804 permit binder to be dispensed on the surface of
the substrate in a substantially uniform manner similar to the slot 402 (FIGS. 5 and 8). But,
because more structural material 808 of the binder applicator 118 remains along the bottom
of the applicator after forming the openings 802 and 804 than remains with slot 402 of the
embodiments of FIGS. 5 and 8, there is more structural integrity to the binder applicator 118.
As such, flanges 602 are preferably not used.
        [0078]      According to a preferred method and operation of binder applicator 118 of
FIGS. 11-13, binder enters the binder applicator 118 via lines 116. Binder fills the cavity 405
and is then dispensed through slot 402 preferably onto the applicator bar 404. The applicator

                                               17
bar 404 further regulates the uniformity and thickness of binder, which is then dispensed onto
the surface of the substrate 202.
         [0079]      In a fifth preferred embodiment of the binder applicator 118, depicted by
FIGURES 14-16, the binder applicator is similar to the binder applicator of FIGS. 11-13, but
for using slots 1402 and 1404 in place of circular openings 802 and 804. Optionally, zone
partitions 410 (e.g., FIG. 4) may be utilized, and the applicator bar 404 is preferably attached
to the binder applicator 118 as in the embodiments of FIGS. 4-13..
         [0080]      A bottom view of binder applicator 118 of FIGURE 14 is shown in
FIGURE 15, and a partial view taken along section line 16 is shown in FIG. 16. As shown,
the slots 1402 and 1404 are linearly arranged into two rows along the length of the binder
applicator 118. Each slot 1402 is offset from a corresponding slot 1404, thus forming an
overlap region 1406. The size and number of slots 1402 and 1404 are suitable for dispensing
binder at a desired or optimal flow rate, and the overlap regions 806 are suitably sized to
provide increased uniformity when binder is dispensed.          In alternate embodiments, the
number of rows of slots may vary, from a single row of slots to three or more rows of slots.
         [0081]      The slots 1402 and 1404 permit binder to be dispensed on the surface of
the substrate in a substantially uniform manner similar to the slot 402 (FIGS. 5 and 8). But,
because more structural material 1408 of the binder applicator 118 remains along the bottom
of the applicator after forming the slots 1402 and 1404 than remains with slot 402 of the
embodiments of FIGS. 5 and 8, there is more structural integrity to the binder applicator 118.
As such, flanges 602 are preferably not used.
         [0082]      According to a preferred method and operation of binder applicator 118 of
FIGS. 14-16, binder enters the binder applicator 118 via lines 116. Binder fills the cavity 405
and is then dispensed through slot 402 preferably onto the applicator bar 404. The applicator
bar 404 further regulates the uniformity and thickness of binder, which is then dispensed onto
the surface of the substrate 202.
         [0083]      Turning now to operation of the system of FIGS. 1-3, including the binder
applicator 118 of FIGS. 4-16, and in accordance with principles of the present invention,
binder is applied to the surface of the substrate 202 by the binder applicator 118. The binder
applicator 118 preferably extends over the width of the mobile platform 100 in such a way as
to produce a uniform coating across that width on the substrate 202. Flow to each of one or
more binder zones (B-ZONE) of the binder applicator 118 may be adjusted or turned off,

                                                18
thereby enabling the overall width of the binder to be adjusted to the desired application
width.
          [0084]     Within a short time after the binder is applied to the substrate, preferably
less than five seconds, filler is added to the binder. The time lapse between the application of
the filler and the application of the binder should be sufficiently short to ensure that the filler
adequately penetrates the binder and good adhesion occurs. In the preferred embodiment of
this invention, the filler is applied from hopper 122 through one to twenty zone flow
controllers 120 (preferably four to twelve zone flow controllers are used) onto the binder at a
rate of between about 0.5 and 45 kilograms per square meter (preferably between about 3.5
and 9 kilograms per square meter). The zone flow controllers 120 may comprise broadcast
spreaders, drop spreaders, blowers, pumps, screws, conveyors, or other similar device. The
filler is contained in a hopper 122 positioned on the mobile platform 100. The preferred filler
is bauxite with a particle size in the range of between about 10 microns and 100,000 microns,
and preferably between about 800 microns and 2,000 microns. The bauxite filler preferably
flows by gravity, although mechanical conveyance can be used, through one or more flow
control zone gates (not shown) on the bottom of the hopper 122, which meters the flow rate,
onto a distributor 124 and finally onto the surface of the binder. Because the density of the
bauxite is greater than that of the epoxy, it will tend to sink down into the epoxy. A sufficient
quantity of filler is added to ensure that a portion of the filler is left protruding from the
binder. As the epoxy hardens, it will bind to both the filler and the substrate, creating a
strong, uniform coating.
          [0085]     In an alternate embodiment of this invention, a thermoplastic binder is
used instead of an epoxy binder.         In this embodiment, thermoplastic melting units are
positioned on the mobile platform 100 which act to liquefy the plastic, making it pumpable.
A pressurization and material metering device 108 is used as described herein to provide a
means of material transfer and control. In this embodiment, static mixers are not used and the
thermoplastic flows directly to the nozzles, where it is applied to the substrate.
          [0086]     In a further alternate embodiment of this invention, reflective material is
mixed with the filler or added through a separate hopper, in close sequence with the addition
of the filler, to the binder. The reflective material preferably comprises glass beads or other
suitable material, which would help to increase the light reflectivity of the coating. This
provides the additional benefit of making potentially hazardous areas more visible at night.

                                                   19
Similarly, pigments or other colored fillers could be added to change the appearance of the
coating.
         [0087]      In a still further alternate embodiment of this invention, the filler is added
to the binder by blowing it onto the surface, using air conveyance. The filler is aspirated into
an air stream and blown through one or more nozzles onto the binder surface. This process
may have the added benefit of providing a greater downward force for the filler, resulting in
greater binder penetration and adhesion.
         [0088]      In a still further alternate embodiment of the invention, the filler is applied
to the binder by means of a conveyor or other such flow control devices used to move and
meter solids. In this instance, the speed of the conveyor can be used to control the flow of
filler and adjust the ratio of filler to binder.
         [0089]      In a still further alternate embodiment of this invention, more than one
mobile platform 102 can be used to store, heat, meter, mix, and apply the binder and store,
meter, and apply the filler.         For example, the binder storage, metering, mixing, and
application could be performed from one mobile platform, and the storage, metering, and
application of the filler from another mobile platform. In this embodiment, a first mobile
platform comprising the binder system would apply the binder to the substrate, and a second
mobile platform comprising the filler would follow the first platform and would add the filler
to the binder.
         [0090]      In a still further alternate embodiment of this invention, the applicator bar
404 may be supplemented by or replaced with a squeegee, and/or the like to further regulate
binder uniformity and thickness.
         [0091]      Having thus described the present invention by reference to certain of its
preferred embodiments, it is noted that the embodiments disclosed are illustrative rather than
limiting in nature and that a wide range of variations, modifications, changes, and
substitutions are contemplated in the foregoing disclosure and, in some instances, some
features of the present invention may be employed without a corresponding use of the other
features. Many such variations and modifications may be considered obvious and desirable
by those skilled in the art based upon a review of the foregoing description of preferred
embodiments. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the appended claims be construed broadly
and in a manner consistent with the scope of the invention.
