1.      INTRODUCTION
[002]       The invention relates to dose escalation enzyme replacement therapy using
acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) for the treatment of human subjects having acid
sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), and, in particular, the non-neurological
manifestations ofNiemann Pick Disease (NPD), and in certain embodiments, NPD type
B.
2.      BACKGROUND
[003]       Acid sphingomyelinase, E.C. 3.1.4.12, (ASM) is a lysosomal
phosphodiesterase enzyme that hydrolyzes sphingomyelin, a phospholipid storage
substance found in the brain, liver, lungs, spleen and lymph nodes, to ceramide and
phosphorylcholine.    Deficiencies in ASM activity result in the inability of the body to
break down sphingomyelin, causing a form of the lysosomal storage disease termed
Niemann-Pick disease.
[004]       Niemann-Pick disease is an inherited autosomal recessive lipid storage
disorder characterized by excessive accumulation of sphingomyelin in the lysosomes of
cells such as macrophages and neurons, which impairs normal cellular function.
Niemann- Pick Type A is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease in infants and
typically results in death within two to three years of age. Niemann-Pick Type B results
in the enlargement of the liver and spleen, and respiratory distress with death generally
ensuing by early adulthood. These two forms ofNiemann-Pick disease which are both
associated with ASM deficiencies are referred to collectively herein as Niemann- Pick
disease, or ASM deficiency (ASMD).        Other types ofNiemann-Pick disease, e.g., Type
C, do not involve mutations in the ASM gene and are not directly attributable to the
function of ASM. The nature of the biochemical and molecular defects that underlie the
remarkable clinical heterogeneity of the A and B subtypes remains unknown. Although
patients with both subtypes have residual ASM activity (about I to 10% of normal),

biochemical analysis cannot reliably distinguish the two phenotypes. Moreover, the
clinical course of Type B NPD is highly variable, and it is not presently possible to
correlate disease severity with the level of residual ASM activity.
[0051      NPD occurs more frequently among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry
than in the general population. It is estimated that the incidence of the type A disease
among Ashkenazi Jews is about 1 in 40,000, a gene frequency (q) of about 1 in 200, and
a heterozygote carrier frequency (2 pq) of 1 in 100 (Goodman, 1979, in "Genetic
Disorders Among The Jewish People", John Hopkins Univ. Press, Baltimore, pp. 96
100). The heterozygote carrier incidence of type B NPD in the Ashkenazi Jewish
population is less frequent (Goodman, supra). The combined heterozygote carrier
frequency for types A and B NPD has been estimated to be about 1 in 70 among
individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish decent. Although the enzymatic diagnosis of affected
patients with either type A or B NPD can be made reliably (Spence and Callahan, supra),
the enzymatic detection of obligate heterozygotes has proven problematic, particularly
using peripheral leukocytes as the enzyme source. Presumably, the occurrence of
neutral sphingomyelinases in some sources and/or the presence of residual ASM activity
resulting from the mutant allele have contributed to the inability to reliably discriminate
carriers for either disease subtype. Even the use of cultured skin fibroblasts, which do
not express the neutral sphingomyelinase, has not provided unambiguous results with
heterozygotes. In epidemiologic studies conducted in individual countries, the
combined incidence of Niemann-Pick A and B disease in several countries in the world
is estimated to range from 1 in 167,000 to 1 in 250,000 newborns (Miekle et al., 1999
JAMA 281(3):249-254; Poorthuis et al., 1999 Hum Genet 105:151-156; Pinto et al.,
2004 Euro. J. Hum. Gene. 12:87-92). The heterozygote carrier rate is believed to range
from 1 in 200 to 1 in 250 individuals.
[006]      Enzyme replacement therapy has been used for other lysosomal storage
diseases. Enzyme replacement therapy attempts to supplement the deficient enzyme
activity with exogenously supplied enzyme. In the case of enzyme replacement therapy
for Niemann-Pick disease, the goal would be to enable the affected individual to process
sphingomyelin and avoid its buildup within the lysosomes. To be effective, such
therapy initially would require a sufficiently large amount of the replacement enzyme to
break down the accumulated sphingomyelin as well as continued administration of
replacement enzyme to avoid further accumulation of sphingomyelin.

3.       SUMMARY
[0071       The invention relates to dose escalation enzyme replacement therapy for the
treatment of human subjects having ASMD - particularly subjects having non
neurological manifestations of NPD, and in particular embodiments, NPD type B. More
particularly, the enzyme, ASM, is administered to such patients at an initial low, non
toxic dose that is then escalated in subsequent administrations. The highest dose of
ASM tolerated by the patient can then be used as a maintenance dose. Alternatively, a
therapeutically effective dose less than the highest dose tolerated can be used as a
maintenance dose.
[008]       The invention is based, in part, on the discovery that doses of ASM that
would be required to clear accumulated sphingomyelin substrate in human subjects, i.e.,
ASMD patients or Niemann-Pick patients, result in toxic side effects (including clinical
signs of toxicity). This is especially surprising in the less severe form of ASMD, NPD
type B patients who are deficient but have at least some enzyme activity.
[009]       More particularly, treatment of NPD would require doses high enough to
achieve adequate distribution of the ASM enzyme in organs of pathology (e.g., in
particular, the liver, spleen, lungs, heart, kidney and brain). Studies in an ASM
knockout mouse model (ASKMO mice) showed that the majority of recombinant human
ASM (rhASM) administered distributes to the liver and spleen where it reduces
substrate, but to a much lesser extent in lung, heart and brain (Miranda et al. FASEB
2000, 14:1988; see also, Figure 9B of He et al., 1999, Biochimica et Biophsyica Acta
1432: 251-264). In subsequent studies using higher doses of rhASM in the ASMKO
mouse model, substrate was reduced and toxicity was not observed at doses <3.0 mg/kg;
in fact, clinical symptoms of toxicity was not observed until doses >10 mg/kg were used.

Toxicology 2006.
[0010]       Based on these ASKMO data, we treated non-neuronopathic ASMD human
subjects with a conservative maximum dose of 1.0 mg/kg rhASM as described in
Section 6, infra. Quite unexpectedly, toxicity in the human subjects, including the onset
of related adverse events with clinical symptoms, was observed using doses as low as
0.3 mg/kg! This result was especially surprising, since the ASM enzyme is absent in the
knock out mouse model which should reflect a more severe condition than in these
human subjects having at least some enzyme activity and relatively mild disease.
[0011]       While not intended to be bound by any theory, the toxic side effects that occur
with ASM treatment may result from breakdown of stored sphingomyelin substrate in
the ASMD patient and release of the product, ceramide that is pro-apoptotic and induces
a pro-inflammatory cytokine response and hyperbilirubinemia. To address this issue, we
have developed a regimen to allow for the safe administration of high doses of the ASM
enzyme required to achieve adequate distribution in organs of pathology. In accordance
with this regimen, initial treatment with ASM at very low doses is used to achieve a
slow degradation of the stored substrate which is accompanied by fewer side effects. As
the substrate is depleted in the subject (as the storage substrate is "debulked"), the dose
can be escalated safely.
[0012]       In accordance with this protocol, a low, non-toxic dose of the ASM enzyme
is initially administered to a NPD disease patient and the dose is escalated over time. As
the dose of the ASM enzyme is escalated, the patient can be monitored for total bilirubin
concentration, the production of acute phase reactants, the production of inflammatory
mediators, and related adverse events. The administration of a low dose of ASM and the
escalation of the dose facilitates the debulking of the accumulated sphingomyelin. Once
the patient is debulked, higher doses may be safely administered to the patient to ensure
adequate distribution of the ASM enzyme to target organs (e.g., liver, spleen, lungs,
heart, kidney, brain, bone marrow, skeleton, joints, etc.). In certain embodiments, the
maximum dose tolerated by the patient can be used as the maintenance dose. In some
embodiments, based upon a patient's condition, the maintenance dose may be increased
or decreased over time.
[0013]       In certain embodiments, treatment of the patient is monitored by measuring
the plasma sphingomyelin levels, plasma ceramide levels, the production of "acute phase
reactants" and inflammatory mediators that are a measure of inflammatory responses,
                                               4

bilirubin concentrations (total, direct, and indirect), and/or other biochemical markers to
ensure a stable response before elevating the dose to the next level. These markers
include, but are not limited to C-reactive protein (CRP) or high sensitivity CRP (hs
CRP), cytokines (e.g., IL-8, IL-6), calcitonin and ferritin. In specific embodiments, the
patient may be monitored for one or more related adverse events, which may include,
but are not limited to, constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, nausea, vomiting, pain,
myalgia) and jaundice.
[0014]     Doses less than 1mg/kg are preferable for initiating treatment. The initial
dose is successively elevated until a therapeutic dose is achieved. Such dose escalation
can be used to determine the highest tolerated dose. For example, once the patient is
debulked of the accumulated sphingomyelinase substrate, the dose may be further
escalated until toxicity is observed. The maintenance dose can be adjusted accordingly,
and can be continually and periodically readjusted depending on the status of the patient.
[0015]     In a specific embodiment, a method for treating a human subject having an
acid sphingomyelinase deficiency, comprises: (a) a regimen for debulking accumulated
sphingomyelin substrate in the human subject comprising: (i) administering an initial
low non-toxic dose of ASM to the human subject; (ii) administering successively higher
doses of ASM to the human subject, and monitoring the subject for one or more adverse
side effects after each successive dose as indicated by elevated bilirubin or a related
adverse event; and (b) a maintenance regimen comprising administering a dose equal to
or less than the highest dose tolerated by the subject as the maintenance dose for the
subject.
[0016]     In another specific embodiment, a method for treating a human subject having
an acid sphingomyelinase deficiency, comprises administering rhASM in an escalating
dose regimen at the following sequential doses: 0.1 mg/kg; 0.3 mg/kg; 0.6 mg/kg; and
1.0 mg/kg, wherein each dose of rhASM is administered at least twice, and each dose is
administered at two week intervals, and wherein the patient is monitored for toxic side
effects before elevating the dose to the next level.
[0017]     In another specific embodiment, described herein is an acid sphingomyelinase
(ASM) for use in the treatment of an acid sphingomyelinase deficiency in a human
subject prepared to be administered: (a) in a regimen for debulking accumulated
sphingomyelin substrate comprising: (i) administration of an initial low non-toxic dose
of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM); (ii) administration of successively higher doses of
ASM, and monitoring the subject for one or more adverse side effects after each
                                               5

successive dose as indicated by elevated bilirubin or a related adverse event; and (b) in
a maintenance regimen comprising administration of a dose equal to or less than the
highest dose tolerated by the subject as the maintenance dose for the subject.
[0018]      In another specific embodiment, described herein is a recombinant human
ASM for use in the treatment of an acid sphingomyelinase deficiency in a human subject
prepared to be administered in an escalating dose regimen at the following sequential
doses: 0.1 mg/kg; 0.3 mg/kg; 0.6 mg/kg; and 1.0 mg/kg, wherein each dose of is
administered at least twice, and each dose is administered at two week intervals, and
wherein the subject is monitored for toxic side effects before elevating the dose to the
next level.

after administration of the dose of ASM; or (iv) an acute phase response/reaction. The
"non-toxic dose" of ASM may vary depending upon, e.g., the stability of the enzyme
used, the activity of the enzyme used, and/or the route of administration of the enzyme.
For example, the dose of a modified ASM enzyme with increased activity may be lower
than the dosage of an unmodified ASM. One skilled in the art would be able to adjust
the dose of enzyme administered based on the stability of the enzyme, the activity of the
enzyme, and/or the route of administration of the enzyme.

hours) following administration of ASM that is indicative of an inflammatory response.
An acute phase response can be assessed by a change in the concentration of an acute
phase reactant (such as, e.g., CRP/hs-CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, iron or transferrin), a
change in the percentage of neutrophils, a change in prothrombin time, or a change in
partial thromboplastin time. In a specific embodiment, an increase in CRP/hs-CRP

5.      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0055]     The invention relates to dose escalation enzyme replacement therapy for the
treatment of human subjects having ASMD - particularly subjects having non
neurological manifestations of NPD, and in certain embodiments, NPD type B. More
particularly, the enzyme, ASM, is administered to such patients at an initial low, non
toxic dose that is then escalated in subsequent administrations. The highest dose of
ASM tolerated by the patient can then be used as a maintenance dose. Alternatively, a
therapeutically effective dose less than the highest dose tolerated can be used as a
maintenance dose.
[0056]     Treatment of NPD requires doses high enough to achieve adequate
distribution of the ASM enzyme in organs of pathology (e.g., the spleen, lungs, heart,
kidney and brain). Following intravenous administration of recombinant human ASM in
ASMKO mice, most of the ASM activity distributes to the liver with small amounts of
ASM enzymatic activity detected in other organs of pathology, such as the spleen, heart,
kidney and lung (see, e.g., Figure 9B of He et al., 1999, Biochimia et Biophsyica Acta
1432: 251-264). Thus very high doses would be required to ensure distribution and
delivery of the administered enzyme to the lung, heart and kidney in patients afflicted
with ASMD or Niemann-Pick disease.
[0057]      Studies in an ASM knockout mouse model (ASKMO mice) showed that the
majority of rhASM administered distributes to the liver and spleen where it reduces
substrate, but to a much lesser extent in lungs, heart and brain (Miranda et al. FASEB
                                              18

2000, 14:1988). In subsequent studies using higher doses of rhASM in the ASMKO
mouse model, substrate was reduced and toxicity was not observed at doses 53.0 mg/kg;
in fact, clinical symptons of toxicity were not observed until doses >10 mg/kg were
used. See, "Dose Responsive Toxicological Findings Following Intravenous
Administration of Recombinant Human Acid Sphingomyelinase (rhASM) to Acid
Sphingomyelinase Knock-out (ASMKO) Mice," C. Nickerson, J. Murray, A. Vitsky, M.

Hemodynamics Following Intravenous Administration of Recombinant Human Acid
Sphingomyelinase (rhASM) to Acid Sphingomyelinase Knock-out (ASMKO) Mice," J.

[0058]      Based on these ASKMO data, we treated non-neuronopathic ASMD human
subjects with a conservative maximum dose of 1.0 mg/kg as described in Section 6,
infra. Quite unexpectedly, toxicity in the human subjects, including the onset of adverse
events with clinical symptoms, was observed using doses as low as 0.3 mg/kg! This
result was especially surprising, since the ASM enzyme is absent in the knock out mouse
model which should reflect a more severe condition than the human subjects who have
at least some enzyme activity and relatively mild disease.
[0059]      Without being bound by any theory, the administration of high doses of ASM
to NPD patients can result in the hydrolysis of large amounts of sphingomyelin into
large concentrations of ceramide, which may produce the toxic side effects observed in
those NPD patients. The ASM enzyme hydrolyzes sphingomyelin, which is a major
component of the plasma membrane of cells (see, e.g., Milaus et al., 2010 FEBS Letters
584: 1887-1894), into ceramide and phosphocholine. Ceramide is known to play a role
in cell death and is known to be a pro-apoptotic agent (see, e.g., Smith and Schuchman,
2008, FASEB 22: 3419-343 1).
[0060]      Moreover, unlike other lysosomal enzymes associated with characterized
lysosomal storage diseases, ASM hydrolyzes sphingomyelin at the neutral pH found in
the plasma and the acidic pH found in the lysosome (see, e.g.,. Schissel et al., 1998. J.
Biol. Chem. 273: 2738-2746). The ability of the ASM enzyme to function in the plasma
can result in the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin found in lipoproteins and the plasma
                                             19

membrane of cells, which can increase the amount of the breakdown product, ceramide,
which may cause the toxic side effects observed in NPD patients administered high
doses of ASM enzyme.
[0061]      To solve the problem of achieving adequate distribution of the ASM enzyme
to the organs of pathology while avoiding or minimizing the toxicity associated with
administering high doses of the enzyme, the inventors develop the regimens described
herein, in which a low, non-toxic dose of the ASM enzyme is initially administered to a
NPD patient and the dose is escalated over time. As the dose of the ASM enzyme is
escalated, the patient can be monitored for total/direct/indirect bilirubin concentrations,
the production of acute phase reactants, the production of inflammatory mediators, and
related adverse events. The administration of a low dose of ASM and the escalation of
the enzyme facilitates the debulking of the accumulated sphingomyelin. Once the
patient is debulked, higher doses of the ASM enzyme may be safely administered to the
patient to ensure adequate distribution of the ASM enzyme to target organs (e.g., liver,
spleen, lungs, heart, kidney, brain, bone marrow, skeleton, joints, etc.). In certain
embodiments, the maximum dose tolerated by the patient can be used as the
maintenance dose. Alternatively, a therapeutically effective dose less than the highest
dose tolerated can be used as a maintenance dose. In some embodiments, based upon a
patient's condition, the maintenance dose may be increased or decreased.
[0062]      In certain embodiments, treatment of the patient can be monitored by
measuring the plasma sphingomyelin levels, plasma ceramide levels, the production of
"acute phase reactants" and inflammatory mediators that are a measure of inflammatory
responses, bilirubin concentrations (total, direct or indirect) and/or other biochemical
markers to ensure a stable response before elevating the dose to the next level. These
markers include, but are not limited to CRP/hs-CRP, cytokines (e.g., 1L-8, 11-6),
calcitonin, and ferritin. In specific embodiments, the patient may be monitored for one
or more related adverse events which may include, but is not limited to constitutional
symptoms (e.g., fever, nausea, vomiting, pain, myalgia and jaundice).
        5.1.     DOSE ESCALATION PROTOCOL
[0063]      Methods are described for treating ASMD involving the administration of one
or more initial, low non-toxic doses of ASM to a subject to reduce the amount of
sphingomyelin that has accumulated in the subject. After a certain period of time, the
                                             20

dose of ASM can be escalated until the highest dosage tolerated by the subject that is
therapeutically effective is achieved. Once this dosage is identified, it can be used as the
maintenance dose to treat the subject. The maintenance dose can be administered
weekly, biweekly, or monthly to the subject to treat ASMD. In some embodiments, a
subject receiving a maintenance dose is monitored every 3 months, every 6 months or
yearly for one, two, three or all of the following: (i) a related adverse events; (ii)
total/direct/indirect bilirubin concentrations; (iii) plasma ceramide concentration; or (iv)
an acute phase response. If the subject experiences a related adverse event of moderate
intensity (e.g., a related moderate adverse event), a total bilirubin concentration greater
than the total bilirubin value for a human without ASMD (e.g., a healthy human), a
plasma ceramide concentration greater than the plasma ceramide concentration of a
human without ASMD (e.g., a healthy human), or an acute phase response, then the dose
administered to the subject can be evaluated by a physician or other medical professional
to determine whether the dose should be adjusted.
[0064]      In one embodiment, a method for treating a human subject having an acid
sphingomyelinase deficiency, comprises: (a) a regimen for debulking accumulated
sphingomyelin substrate in the human subject comprising: (i) administering an initial
low non-toxic dose of ASM to the human subject; (ii) administering successively higher
doses of ASM to the human subject, and monitoring the subject for one or more adverse
side effects after each successive dose as indicated by elevated bilirubin or a related
adverse event; and (b) a maintenance regimen comprising administering a dose equal to
or less than the highest dose tolerated by the subject as the maintenance dose for the
subject. In certain embodiments, the initial dose ranges is from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg
or 0.1 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg of ASM. In some embodiments,the successively higher doses
are administered one, two, three or four weeks after the previous dose. In certain
embodiments, the successively higher dose is approximately 0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 0.3
mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, 0.7 mg/kg, 0.8 mg/kg, 0.9 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 1.2
mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 1.75 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg higher than the
previous dose. In some embodiments, the successively higher dose is 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg,
0.1 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg,
2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg higher than the previous dose. In certain
embodiments, the highest dose tolerated by the subject is 1 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg. In some
embodiments, the highest dose is administered to the human subject as a maintenance
dose.
                                              21

[0065]      In certain embodiments, a method for treating a human subject having
ASMD, comprises: (a) a debulking ASM administration to reduce the amount of
sphingomyelin that has accumulated in the human subject, wherein the debulking ASM
administration comprises: (i) administering a low, non-toxic dose of ASM to the human
subject; and (ii) administering successively higher doses of ASM to the human if the
human subject does not manifest one or more adverse side effects as indicated by
elevated total bilirubin concentration, elevated plasma ceramide concentration, the
production of acute phase reactants, the production of inflammatory mediators, or an
adverse event (e.g., such as defined by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards
Consortium Study Data Tabulation Model standard terminology v.3.1.1); and (b) a
maintenance ASM administration, wherein the maintenance ASM administration
comprises repeated administration of a maintenance dose of ASM to the human subject.
In some embodiments, the patient is monitored for a period of time after administration
of a dose of ASM (e.g., 6 hours, 12 hours, 16 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours,
weekly, or up until the next dose) for one or more adverse side effects or total bilirubin.
In certain embodiments, the maintenance dose that is administered may be adjusted
during the course of treatment of the patient. In some embodiments, the maintenance
dose administered to the subject is the highest dose tolerated by the subject.
[0066]      In a particular embodiment, a method for treating ASMD comprises
administering to a subject in need thereof an initial low, non-toxic dose of ASM (e.g., a
dose of 0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, 0.7 mg/kg,
0.8 mg/kg, 0.9 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg, or 0.5 to 1 mg/kg of ASM) and
after a certain period of time (e.g., 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, or 3 weeks) successively
increasing the dose of ASM administered to the subject until the level of ASM activity
in one or more organs of pathology is at least 5%, 6 %, 7 %, 8%, 9%, 10%, 12%, 15%,
20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 50%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or more of the activity of
ASM in the corresponding organ in a subject(s) without ASMD (e.g., a healthy subject
or population of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100, 150 ,175 or more subjects) as
measured by techniques known in the art, such as, e.g., the technique described in He et
al., 2003, Analytical Biochemistry 314: 116-120. In another embodiment, a method for
treating ASMD comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a dose of 0.1 mg/kg
of ASM and after a certain period of time (e.g., 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, or 3 weeks)
successively increasing the dose of ASM administered to the subject until the level of
ASM activity in one or more of the following organs of pathology is 5% to 10%, 5% to
                                              22

15%, 5% to 20%, 10% to 15%, 10% to 20%, 15% to 20%, 15% to 25%, 25% to 50%,
50% to 7 5%, or 7 5% to 95% of the normal activity of ASM in the corresponding organ
in a subject(s) without ASMD (e.g., a healthy subject or population of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30,
40, 50, 75, 100, 150 ,175 or more subjects) as measured by techniques known in the art,
such as, e.g., the technique described in He et al., 2003, Analytical Biochemistry 314:
116-120. In certain embodiments, the dose is successively increased if the total bilirubin
concentration is less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL or 2.1 mg/dL and the subject does not
experience a moderate or severe related adverse event. In specific embodiments, the
activity of ASM in normal healthy subjects is estimated to be approximately 20 to 40
units/mg of protein for the brain, heart, kidney, and liver based upon the activity of ASM
in similar organs in healthy mice using the assay described in Horinouchi et al., 1995,
Nature Genetics 10: 288-293 (which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).
In certain embodiments, the activity of ASM in normal healthy subjects is estimated to
be approximately 15 to 25 units/mg of protein for the lung and 10 to 15 units/mg of
protein for the spleen based upon the activity of ASM in similar organs in healthy mice
using the assay described in Horinouchi et al., 1995, Nature Genetics 10: 288-293. In
certain embodiments, once the ASM activity reaches normal or a certain percentage of
normal in one or more organs of pathology, a dose equal to or less than the highest dose
tolerated by the subject can be administered to the subject as the maintenance dose.
Over time, the maintenance dose may be adjusted depending the health of the subject.
Depending upon a subject's circumstances, the maintenance dose may be increased or
decreased.
[0067]      In one embodiment, a method for treating ASMD comprises: (a)
administering to a human in need thereof an initial low, non-toxic dose of ASM; and (b)
administering successively higher doses of ASM if the human does not manifest one,
two, three or four of the following side-effects after the administration of a dose of
ASM: (i) a severe related adverse event as defined by, e.g., the Clinical Data Interchange

 or (iv) an acute phase response. In accordance with this embodiment, the human in need
 thereof can be administered successively higher doses of ASM so tong the human does
 not manifest any one or more of items (i) to (iv). In the event that the human manifests

[0071]      In a specific embodiment, a method for treating ASMD comprises
administering to a subject in need thereof a dose of 0.1 mg/kg of ASM and after two
weeks a dose of 0.3 mg/kg of ASM every two weeks. In another specific embodiment, a
method for treating ASMD comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a dose
of 0.1 mg/kg of ASM, a dose of 0.3 mg/kg of ASM two weeks after the administration
of the 0.1 mg/kg dose of ASM, and a dose of 0.6 mg/kg of ASM two weeks after the
administration of the dose of 0.3 mg/kg of ASM. In another specific embodiment, a
method for treating ASMD comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a dose
of 0.1 mg/kg of ASM, a dose of 0.3 mg/kg of ASM two weeks after the administration
of the 0.1 mg/kg dose of ASM, a dose of 0.6 mg/kg of ASM two weeks after the
administration of the dose of 0.3 mg/kg of ASM, and a dose of 1 mg/kg of ASM two
weeks after the administration of the dose of 0.6 mg/kg of ASM. In certain
embodiments, each dose may be repeated at least two, and preferably two to four times
before escalating the dose to the next level. In accordance with these embodiments, the
dose is only escalated if the total bilirubin value is equal to or less than 2.0 mg/dL and/or
the subject experiences a mild related adverse event. The dose is not escalated if the
total bilirubin value is between 2.1 and 3 mg/dL and/or the subject experiences a
moderate related adverse event. The dose is reduced to a previously tolerated dose if the
total bilirubin value is greater than 3.0 mg/dL of total bilirubin and/or the subject
experiences a serious related adverse event.
[0072]      In specific embodiments, a patient is treated for ASMD in accordance with
the protocol described in Section 8 or 9 et seq., infra, or an analogous protocol.
[0073]      In a specific embodiment, a method for treating ASMD comprises
administering to a subject in need thereof a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 0.4
mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg., 0.6 mg/kg, 0.7 mg/kg, 0.8 mg/kg, 0.9 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, or 0.1 mg/kg

to 0.5 mg/kg, or 0.1 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg of ASM and after a certain period of time (e.g., 3
days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks or 4 weeks) successively increasing the dose of ASM
administered to the subject if total bilirubin concentration is less than or equal to 2.1
mg/dL and the subject does not experience a moderate or severe related adverse event.
In some embodiments, the dose of ASM is successively increased until the maximum or
highest dose tolerated by the subject which is therapeutically effective is achieved. In
certain embodiments, such highest or maximum dose tolerated is administered until such
time as the accumulated sphingomyelin in the organs of pathology is debulked after
which a maintenance dose that is lower than the maximum dose tolerated which is still
therapeutically effective is administered to the subject. In some embodiments, the
maintenance dose is scaled back over time as the patient's condition improves.
[0074]      In a specific embodiment, the highest dose tolerated that is therapeutically
effective is the highest dosage that is effective in the treatment of ASMD without
causing one, two or more severe related adverse events or related adverse events as
defined by, e.g., the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium Study Data
Tabulation Model standard terminology v.3.1.1. In another embodiment, the highest
dose tolerated that is therapeutically effective is the highest dosage that is effective in
the treatment of ASMD without causing an increase in the total bilirubin concentration
relative to a patient's total bilirubin concentration prior to administration of ASM, which
increase lasts for greater than two days, three days, five days, one week, two weeks, or
three weeks. In another embodiment, the highest dose tolerated that is therapeutically
effective is the highest dosage that is effective in the treatment of ASMD without

concentrations that lasts for greater than 18 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours or 72
hours, 5 days, one week, two weeks or three weeks after administration of the dose of
ASM. The normal total bilirubin concentration in a human without ASMD (e.g., a
healthy human) is less than approximately 1.2 mg/dL. In certain embodiments, the
highest dose tolerated that is therapeutically effective is the highest dosage that is
effective in the treatment of ASMD without causing a total bilirubin concentration that is
greater than approximately 1.5 mg/dL, 1.75 mg/dL, 2.0 mg/dL, 2.1 mg/dL, 2.2 mg/dL,
2.3 mg/dL, 2.4 mg/dL, 2.5 mg/dL, 2.6 mg/dL, 2.7 mg/dL, 2.75 mg/dL, 2.8 mg/dL, 2.9
mg/dL, 3.0 mg/dL, 3.1 mg/dL, 3.2 mg/dL, 3.3 mg/dL, 3.4 mg/dL, 3.5 mg/dL, 3.6 mg/dL,

[0075]       In another embodiment, the highest dose tolerated is the highest dosage that is
effective in the treatment of ASMD without resulting in a plasma ceramide
concentration that is greater than the normal plasma ceramide concentration 6 hours, 8
hours, 12 hours, 16 hours, 18 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours or 72 hours after
administration of the dose of ASM. The normal plasma ceramide concentration in a
human without ASMD (e.g., a healthy human) is approximately 1.5 to 8 pg/mL. In
certain embodiments, the highest dose tolerated is the highest dosage that is effective in
the treatment of ASMD without resulting in a plasma ceramide concentration of greater

36 hours, 48 hours or 72 hours after administration of the dose of ASM.
 [00761      In another embodiment, the highest dose tolerated that is therapeutically
effective is the highest dosage that is effective in the treatment of ASMD without
causing an acute phase response. An acute phase response can be assessed by a change
in the concentration of an acute phase reactant, a change in prothrombin time, a change
 in partial thromboplastin time, or a change in the percentage of neutrophils. For
 example, an acute phase response can be assessed by an increase in one or more of the
 following factors following ASM administration to subject relative to those factors prior
 to administration of ASM to the subject or relative to those factors in a human without
ASMD (e.g., a healthy human): the percentage of neutrophils, the prothrombin time
 (PT), the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), the total bilirubin concentration, C-reactive
protein (CRP/hs-CRP) concentration, serum amyloid A (SAA), serum amyloid P
 component, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ferritin concentration, IL-6
 concentration, IL-8 concentration, calcitonin concentration, albumin concentration, or
 fibrinogen concentration. An acute phase response can also be assessed by a decrease in
 iron concentration or albumin concentration following ASM administration to a subject
 relative to the iron concentration or albumin concentration in the subject prior to ASM
                                               28

[0087]      In another embodiment, the highest dose tolerated is the highest dosage that is
effective in the treatment of ASMD without resulting in a plasma ceramide
concentration that is greater than the normal plasma ceramide concentration 6 hours, 8
hours, 12 hours, 16 hours, 18 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours or 72 hours after
                                               33

 administration of the dose of ASM. The normal plasma ceramide concentration in a
 human without ASMD (e.g., a healthy human) is approximately 1.5 to 8 pg/mL. In

  [0088]     In another embodiment, the highest dose tolerated that is therapeutically
 effective is the highest dosage that is effective in the treatment of ASMD without
 causing an acute phase response. An acute phase response can be assessed by a change
 in the concentration of an acute phase reactant, a change in prothrombin time, a change
 in partial thromboplastin time, or a change in the percentage of neutrophils. For
 example, an acute phase response can be assessed by an increase in one or more of the
 following factors following ASM administration to subject relative to those factors prior
 to administration of ASM to the subject or relative to those factors in a human without
 ASMD (e.g., a healthy human): the percentage of neutrophils, the prothrombin time
 (PT), the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), the total bilirubin concentration, C-reactive
 protein (CRP/hs-CRP) concentration, serum amyloid A (SAA), serum amyloid P
 component, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ferritin concentration, albumin
  concentration or fibrinogen concentration. An acute phase response can also be assessed
 by a decrease in iron concentration or albumin concentration following ASM
  administration to a subject relative to the iron concentration or albumin concentration in
 the subject prior to ASM administration or relative to the iron concentration or albumin
  concentration in a human without ASMD (e.g., a healthy human).

[0099]     Doses of ASM described herein can be administered by any route that is
useful in achieving a therapeutic effect. Specific routes of administration of doses of
ASM include, but are not limited to, intravenous, intraventricular, intradermal,
transdermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intranasal, inhalation, intrapulmonary, topical,
transmucosal, intracranial, intrathecal, epidural and intra-synovial. In one embodiment,
a dose of ASM is administered systemically (e.g., parenterally) to a subject in need
thereof. In another embodiment, a dose of ASM is administered locally to a subject in
need thereof.
[00100]    The dose of ASM enzyme that is effective in treating the somatic (non-central
nervous system) manifestations of ASMD is not able to effectively cross the blood-brain
barrier. Thus, in specific embodiments, ASM is administered to a patient
intraventicularly or intrathetically to the brain of a NPD patient. See, e.g., U.S. Patent
Application Publication No. 2009/0130079 and 2009/012345 1, which are incorporated
herein by reference in their entirety, for methods for intraventricular delivery of
lysosomal storage enzymes to the brain. In certain embodiments, the ASM is
                                               38

administered to a patient intracerebraventricularly. See, e.g., Dodge et al., 2009,
Experimental Neurology 215: 349-357, which is incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety, for methods for intracerebraventricular infusion of ASM. In some
embodiments, the ASM is administered to a patient by indirect intraparenchymal
injections. See, e.g., Yang et al., 2007, Experimental Neurology 207: 258-266. In some
embodiments, a modified form of ASM that targets the enzyme to the brain, such as
described in Section 5.2, infra, is administered to a patient to treat ASMD.
[00101]     Only a small percentage of the ASM enzyme administered to a patient reaches
the lung. Thus, in specific embodiments, ASM is administered to the lungs of a patient.
In certain embodiments, ASM is administered by intranasal or inhalation to a patient.
See, e.g., Ziegler et al., 2009, Molecular Genetics and Metabolism 97: 35-42, which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, for information regarding the intranasal
administration of ASM. In some embodiments, a modified form of ASM that targets the
enzyme to the lung, such as described in Section 5.2, infra, is administered to a patient
to treat ASMD. In certain embodiments, the ASM is administered to a patient using a
nebulizer. Delviery of ASM to the lungs may occur by intrapulmonary injection through
a bronchoscope, a metered-dose inhaler, or a nebulizer.
[00102]     In certain embodiments, the ASM enzyme is administered systemically to a
patient as well as locally administered to specific organs, such the brain and lung. In
some embodiments, the locally administration of the ASM enzyme supplements the
systemic administration of the enzyme. In specific embodiments, the ASM enzyme is
administered locally to, e.g., the brain or lungs, after the accumulated sphingomyelin in
the patient has been debulked by systemic administration (e.g., intravenous
administration).
[00103]     In certain embodiments, a patient is genotyped prior to the administration of
ASM. In some embodiments, the glycosylation pattern of the ASM expressed by a
patient is determined prior to administration of ASM. The administration of ASM that
is similar/compatible with that endogenously expressed by a patient may reduce the
potential for immunogenicity.
[00104]     In certain embodiments, the activity of endogenously expressed ASM is
determined prior to the administration of ASM. The activity of endogenously expressed
ASM can be measured in DBS and in cultured fibroblasts using techniques known to
one of skill in the art.

(SEQ ID NO:1). ASM-2 differs from ASM-1 in that amino acid residues 363 to 374 of
ASM-1 (i.e., IGGFYALSPYPG (SEQ ID NO:2)) are replaced with amino
acids YLSSVETQEGKR (SEQ ID NO:3) and amino acid residues 375 to 418 of ASM
1 are missing from ASM-2. ASM-3 differs from ASM-1 in that amino acid residues 363
to 418 of ASM- 1 are missing from ASM-3. To the extent that ASM-2 and ASM-3 have
enzymatic activity as measured by, e.g., the assay described in He et al., 2003,
Analytical Biochemistry 314: 116-120, they are included as an ASM that could be
administered to a subject. In a specific embodiment, to the extent that ASM-2 and
ASM-3 have at least 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 80%, 90%, 95% or
98%, or 30% to 50%, 40% to 50%, 50% to 75%, 50% to 90%, 75% to 80%, 75% to
90%, 75% to 95%, or 85% to 95% of the activity of ASM-1 as measured by, e.g., the
assay described in He et al., 2003, Analytical Biochemistry 314: 116-120, they are
included as an ASM that could be administered to a subject.
[00109]    In a specific embodiment, the human ASM has the amino acid sequence of
human acid sphingomyelinase disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 1, supra, the amino acid
sequence of a human acid sphingomyelinase disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,541,218
(e.g., SEQ ID NO:2 in U.S. Patent No. 6,541,218), or the amino acid sequence disclosed
in Figure 3 of Schuchman et al., 1991, J. Biol. Chem. 266: 8531-8539, each of which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[00110]    In specific embodiments, the human ASM is the processed mature form. In
other embodiments, the human ASM is the immature, unprocessed form. With respect
to ASM-1, the immature form is 629 amino acids in length and contains the signal
peptide found at amino acid residues I to 46. The mature form of ASM-1 lacks that
signal peptide and is from amino acid residue 47 to amino acid residue 629. Human
ASM-1 contains a saposin B-type domain from amino acid residues 85 to 169. With
respect to ASM-1, the following amino acid residues are glycosylated (in particular, N
linked glycosylated): 86, 175, 335, 395, and 520.
[00111]    In addition to the isoforms of human ASM, there are various naturally
occurring variants of human ASM. For example, naturally occurring variants of the
human ASM gene with different numbers of hexanucleotide repeat units occurring
within the region of the gene encoding the putative signal peptide of ASM have been
                                             43

identified. See, e.g., Wan and Schuchman, 1995, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1270:
207-2 10 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) which the describes
the identification of five alleles corresponding to nine, seven, six, five and four
hexanucleotide repeats. Further, naturally occurring variants of human ASM with single
amino acid variations have been identified. See, e.g., Schuchman et al., 1991, J. of Biol.
Chem 266: 8531-8539 and Schuchman et al., 1991, Nucleic Acids Research 19(11):
3160, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, for information
regarding single polymorphisms. To the extent that any of the naturally occurring
variants of human ASM have enzymatic activity as measured by, e.g., the assay
described in He et al., 2003, Analytical Biochemistry 314: 116-120, they are included as
an ASM that could be administered to a subject. In a specific embodiment, to the extent
that any of the naturally occurring variants of human ASM have at least 30%, 35%,
40%, 45%, 50%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 98%, or 30% to 50%, 40% to
50%, 50% to 75%, 50% to 90%, 75% to 80%, 75% to 90%, 75% to 95%, or 85% to 95%
of the activity of ASM-1 as measured by, e.g., the assay described in He et al., 2003,
Analytical Biochemistry 314: 116-120, they are included as an ASM that could be
administered to a subject.
[00112]    Many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the gene encoding human
ASM have been identified (see, e.g., the ncbi website: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/
for examples of SNPs). To the extent that any of the SNPs in the gene encode of an
ASM that has enzymatic activity as measured by, e.g., the assay described in He et al.,
2003, Analytical Biochemistry 314: 116-120, they are included as an ASM that could be
administered to a subject. In a specific embodiment, to the extent that any of the SNPs
in the gene encode of an ASM that has at least 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 75%, 80%,
85%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 98%, or 30% to 50%, 40% to 50%, 50% to 7 5%, 50% to 90%,
75% to 80%, 7 5% to 90%, 7 5% to 95%, or 85% to 95% of the activity of ASM-1 as
measured by, e.g., the assay described in He et al., 2003, Analytical Biochemistry 314:
116-120, they are included as an ASM that could be administered to a subject.
In certain embodiments, the ASM is a modified form of human ASM. In a specific
embodiment, the modified form of human ASM is one disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
7,527,956, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In another
embodiment, the modified form of human ASM is one disclosed in International
Publication No. WO 2008/136451, which is incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety. In some specific embodiments, the ASM is a modified form of human ASM
                                              44

that has one, two or more of the following properties: (i) increased targeting to sites of
pathology (e.g., the lung and/or brain) relative to unmodified human ASM, (ii) increased
stability relative to unmodified human ASM, and (iii) increased activity relative to
unmodified human ASM. Techniques known in the art can be used to measure the
stability, activity and targeting of ASM. In a specific embodiment, the techniques
described in Gamacho et al., 2008, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 325: 400-408 (which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) for assessing targeting of ASM are used.
In another specific embodiment, the techniques described in He et al., 1999, Biochimica
et Biophysica Acta 1432: 251-264 or Dhami et al., 2001, Lab. Invest. 81: 987-999
(which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety) for assessing stability of
the ASM are used. In another specific embodiment, the techniques described in He et
al., 2003, Analytical Biochemistry 314: 116-120 (which is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety) for assessing ASM activity are used.
[00113]     In one embodiment, the ASM is a modified form of human ASM that has
increased enzymatic activity relative to unmodified human ASM, such as ASM- 1. See,
e.g., Qiu et al., 2003, J. Biol. Chem. 278(35): 32744-32752 and U.S. Patent No.
7,527,956 for a mutant forms of recombinant human ASM with enzymatic activity with
higher activity than wild-type recombinant human ASM (such as, e.g., ASM-1). In
some embodiments, the ASM has increased enzymatic activity relative to unmodified
human ASM (such as, e.g., ASM-1) due to the addition of zinc cations. See, e.g.,
Schissel et al., 1998, J. Biol. Chem 273: 18250-18259, which is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety, for a discussion regarding the role of zinc in ASM activity. In
another embodiment, the ASM is a modified form of human ASM that has increased
affinity for a natural receptor of human ASM (e.g., mannose 6-phosphate or high
mannose) relative to unmodified human ASM (such as, e.g., ASM-1). In a specific
embodiment, the ASM is conjugated to an oligosaccharide, such as described in U.S.
Patent No. 7,001,994 and International Patent Application Publication No.
WO 2010/075010 and United States Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0173385
(which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety), to increase the targeting
the enzyme for its natural receptor. In another embodiment, the ASM is a modified form
of human ASM that binds to an alterative receptor (e.g., intercellular adhesion molecule
(ICAM) -1 which may increase targeting to organs such as the lung) than the natural
receptor for ASM. In embodiment, the ASM is a modified form of human ASM that has
increased stability relative to unmodified human ASM (such as, e.g., ASM-1).
                                               45

[00114]     In some embodiments, the ASM is conjugated or fused, directly or indirectly,
to a targeting moiety, such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF-II, leptin,
granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), or a humanized antibody that binds to
human insulin receptor (HIR). See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No.
2009/0029467 and U.S. Patent No. 7,560,424 (which is incorporated herein by reference
in its entirety) for a discussion of the use of IGF-I as a targeting moiety for lysosomal
storage enzymes, and U.S. Patent No. 7,396,811 (which is incorporated herein by
reference by reference in its entirety) for a discussion of the use of IGF-II as a targeting
moiety for lysosomal storage enzymes. The targeting moieties IGF-I and IGF-II can
facilitate targeting the ASM enzyme to the lyosome. For a discussion of the use of
hormones, such as G-CSF and leptin as targeting moieties see, e.g., International Patent
Application Publication No. WO 2007/091250 and U.S. Patent Application Publication
No. 2010/0183577, which are incorporated herein by reference herein by reference in
their entirety. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0101904, which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, for a discussion of a humanized
monoclonal antibody that binds human insulin receptor (HIR) linked to a pharmaceutical
agent, such as an enzyme. The targeting moieties G-CSF, leptin and an antibody that
binds to HIR can facilitate targeting of the ASM enzyme to the brain.
[00115]     In certain embodiments, the ASM is a modified form of ASM (e.g., a
modified form of human ASM) with a decrease in activity relative to unmodified ASM
(such as, an unmodified human ASM , e.g., ASM-1). In some embodiments, the ASM is
a modified form of ASM (e.g., a modified form of human ASM) with an increase in
targeting to sites of pathology and a decrease in enzymatic activity relative to
unmodified ASM (such as an unmodified human ASM, e.g., ASM-1).
[00116]     In certain embodiments, the ASM is a highly phosphorylated form of ASM.
See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/015098 1, which is incorporated
herein by reference, for a discussion of techniques for producing highly phosphorylated
forms of lysosomal enzymes.
[00117]     The ASM enzyme can be produced by any method known in the art, including
but not limited to recombinant DNA methods, cDNA cloning (see, e.g., Schuchman et
al., 1991, J. Biol. Chem 266: 8531-8539 and U.S. Patent No. 5,773,278, which are
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for cDNA clones of human ASM),
genomic cloning, gene activation (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,641,670, which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for gene activation techniques), or
                                               46

selected cell lines (e.g., mammalian, yeast, prokaryotic, insect cells (e.g., Sf9, SJ21,
Trichoplusiani, Spodopterafrugiperdaand Bombyx mori), and plant cells) that produce
high levels of the ASM enzyme. ASM as well as methods for producing ASM are
described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,773,278; 6,541,218; 5,686,240; and 7,527,956;
each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[00118]    In a specific embodiment, the ASM is a recombinantly produced ASM (e.g., a
recombinantly produced human ASM). Cell expression systems which possess the
cellular machinery and elements for the proper processing, i.e., signal cleavage,
glycosylation, phosphorylation and protein sorting are preferred. For example,
mammalian cell expression systems are preferred for the expression of biologically
active enzymes that are properly folded and processed; when administered in humans
such expression products should exhibit proper tissue targeting and no adverse
immunological reaction.
[00119]    In certain embodiments, the ASM (e.g., human ASM) is produced by
overexpression of ASM cDNA in mammalian cells. In a specific embodiment, the
human ASM is produced by overexpression of human ASM cDNA in Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) cells. See, e.g., He et al., 1999, Biochimia et Biophsyica Acta 1432: 251
264 for methods for overexpression of human ASM cDNA in CHO cells, and US
6,541,218 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In certain
embodiments, the human ASM is produced by overexpression of human ASM cDNA in
CHO cells that co-express alpha-2,6-sialytransferase. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No.
5,047,335, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, which describes CHO cells
engineered to express alpha 2,6-sialytransferase.
[00120]    In another specific embodiment, the mammalian cells are human cells.
Examples of human cells that may be used to recombinantly express ASM (e.g., human
ASM) include, but are not limited to Crucell Per.C6 cells, HT 1080 cells, HeLa cells,
HEK 293 cells, 293T cells, W138 cells, HuT292 cells, LF 1043 (HEL) cells, MRC-5
cells, TMK-1 cells, BT483 cells, Hs578T cells, HTB2 cells, HTB3 cells, HTB4 cells,
BT 20 cells, T47D cells. CRL7030 cells, HsS78Bst cells, 721 cells, A2780 cells, A172
cells., A253 cells, COR-L23/R23 cells, COV-434 cells, DU145 cells, DuCaP cells, EM2
cells, Saos-2 cells, U373 cells, WM39 cells, L132 cells, A-5489 cells, G-293 cells, G
401 cells, CAKI-I cells, RD cells, and YAR cells. Other exemplary human cells that
may be used to express ASM include those human cell lines listed in the Immuno
Polymorphism Database of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, and the
                                             47

database of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, as well as those commercially
available form, for example, the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia,
and Lifeline Cell Technology, Walkersville, Maryland. When using human cell lines for
production, rhASM can be produced using cDNAs, gDNAs for hASM or by gene
activation techniques such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 5,641,670 which is
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
[00121]     Examples of other mammalian cells that may be used to produce ASM (e.g.,
human ASM) include, but are not limited to, Vero cells, VERY cells, BHK cells, COS
cells, MDCK cells, or 3T3 cells. In certain embodiments, myeloma cells are used to
produce ASM (e.g., human ASM). Non-limiting examples of myeloma cells include
NSO cells, 45.6 TG1.7 cells, AF-2 clone 9B5 cells, AF-2 clone 9B5 cells, J558L cells,
MOPC 315 cells, MPC-11 cells, NCI-H929 cells, NP cells, NSO/1 cells, P3 NS1 Ag4
cells, P3/NS1/1-Ag4-1 cells, P3U1 cells, P3X63Ag8 cells, P3X63Ag8.653 cells,

cells, Y3.Ag.1.2.3 cells, and YO cells.
[00122]     In some embodiments, a plant cell culture system is used for expression of the
ASM. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,929,304; 7,504,560; 6,770,799; 6,551,820;
6,136,320; 6,034,298; 5,914,935; 5,612,487; and 5,484,719, U.S. patent application
publication Nos. 2009/0208477, 2009/0082548, 2009/0053762, 2008/0038232,
2007/0275014 and 2006/0204487, and Shoji et al., 2008, Vaccine, 26(23):2930-2934,
and D'Aoust et al., 2008, J. Plant Biotechnology, 6(9):930-940 (which are incorporated
herein by reference in their entirety) for plant cells and methods for the production of
proteins utilizing plant cell culture systems. In particular, U.S. patent application Nos.
2009/0208477, 2008/0038232 and 2006/0204487 describe the expression and
production of enzymatically active high mannose lysosomal enzymes using transgenic
plant root, particularly carrot cells. In a specific embodiment, carrot cells are engineered
to express ASM. In certain embodiments, algae (e.g., Chlamydomonas reinhardtii)may
be engineered to express ASM (see, e.g., Rasala et al., 2010, Plant Biotechnology
Journal (Published online March 7, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in
its entirety).
[00123]     Tissue and cellular uptake of ASM is mediated by both the high mannose
residues (e.g., in macrophages) and by mannose-6-phosphate (e.g., in liver). Thus,
production of ASM with altered glycan content and/or phosphorylation may be desired
                                               48

to enhance drug distribution. For example, ASM can be produced by cells having a
mutation, e.g., a knockout for, at least one Golgi processing mannosidase. In one
embodiment, the mutation reduces the expression of the gene, reduces protein or activity
levels, or alters the distribution or other post translational modifications of the
mannosidase, e.g., the processing of the carbohydrate chains. In a specific embodiment,
the mutation reduces the level of the Golgi processing mannosidase activity. The
mutation can be in a class 1 processing mannosidase; a class 2 processing mannosidase;
a class 1 processing mannosidase and a class 2 processing mannosidase. Class 1
processing mannosidase includes: Golgi mannosidase IA; Golgi mannosidase IB; Golgi
mannosidase IC. Class 2 processing mannosidase includes: Golgi mannosidase II. See,
e.g., International Patent Application Publication No. WO 02/15927 and U.S. Patent No.
7,138,262, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, for methods of
producing a high mannose protein.
[00124]     In certain embodiments, cells expressing ASM are cultured in the presence of
mannosidase inhibitor, such as an antibody, kifunensine, swainsonine, mannostatin, 6
deoxy-1, 4- dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-mannitol (6-deoxy-DIM), or 6-deoxy-6-fluoro-1, 4
dideoxy-1, 4- imino-D-mannitol (6-deoxy-6-fluoro-DIM). The culture of ASM in the
presence of such inhibitors may result in the production of a high mannose ASM. In
some embodiments, the cells expressing ASM include a nucleic acid sequence, such as
an antisense molecule or ribozyme, which can bind to or inactivate a cellular
mannosidase nucleic acid sequence, e.g., mRNA, and inhibit expression of the protein.
See, e.g., International Patent Application Publication No. WO 02/15927 and U.S.
Patent No. 7,138,262, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, for
methods of producing a high mannose protein.
[00125]     In certain embodiments, the carbohydrate chains of the ASM enzyme
recombinantly expressed are remodeled by sequential treatment with various enzymes,
such as neuraminidase, galactosidase and .beta.-N acetylglucosaminidase. See, e.g.,
U.S. Patent No. 5,549,892, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, for a
methods for remodeling carbohydrate chains of a lysosomal enzyme.
[00126]     Uptake of ASM, mediated by mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) can be enhanced
by modification of ASM to produce highly phosphorylated mannose residues and M6P.
For example, ASM can be modified by recombinant technology to introduce additional
mannose-6-phosphate to the ASM for enhancing cellular uptake. See, e.g., Matsuoka et
al., 2010 Mole. Ther.18:1519-1526 which is incorporated herein by reference in its
                                               49

entirety. In other embodiments, ASM can be coupled to highly phosphorylated
oligosaccharide derivatives containing mannose 6-phosphate (M6P). See, e.g., U.S.
Patent No. 7,001,994, U.S Patent Application Publication US2010/0173385 and
International Publication No. W02010/075010. In another approach, a yeast culture
system can be used for the expression of recombinant ASM that contains additional
highly phosphorylated mannose-6-phosphate residues. See, e.g., Akeboshi et al., 2009
Glycobiology 19(9):1002-1009 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
[00127]      Once ASM has been produced, it may be isolated or purified by any method
known in the art for isolation or purification of a protein, for example, by
chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, high performance liquid chromatography, affinity,
particularly by affinity for ASM, by Protein A, and sizing column chromatography),
centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the isolation
or purification of proteins. Where the ASM enzyme is secreted by the cultured cells,
ASM may be readily recovered from the culture medium. See, e.g., He et al., 1999,
Biochimia et Biophsyica Acta 1432: 251-264 for methods for purifying ASM.
[00128]     The ASM enzyme can be formulated for any route of administration (e.g.,
infusion, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intraventricular, intranasal, inhalation
or intradermal). The ASM enzyme can be supplied in a lyophilized form that is
reconstituted before use with, e.g., sterile saline (e.g., 0.9 % sodium chloride) or sterile
water. Alternatively, the ASM enzyme can be supplied in an aqueous form. In certain
embodiments, ASM is administered to a subject in a formulation comprising zinc. In
some embodiments, the ASM enzyme is administered to the patient by infusion using,
e.g., a syringe pump or an infusion bag with a pump.
[00129]     In certain embodiments, ASM is administered to a subject in a carrier, such as
liposomes or a polycationic carrier. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,716,614, which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, for a carriers that can be used to
administered ASM. In some embodiments, the ASM administered to a subject in
ICAM-1-target nanocarriers. See, e.g., Muro et al., 2006, Mol. Ther. 13(1): 135-141,
which is incorporated herein by reference, for ASM delivery using ICAM- 1-targeted
nanocarriers.

[00146]    In accordance with the method provided herein, a number of parameters (e.g.,
factors or markers) can be monitored before, during and/or after the administration of a
dose of ASM. In certain embodiments, a physical examination is performed prior to
administration of ASM and as needed or recommended during the course of treatment
with ASM. A physical examination can include the following assessments: general
appearance, skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat (HEENT), lymph nodes, heart, lungs,
abdomen, extremities/joints, neurological, mental status, and reflexes. In certain
embodiments, vital signs, continuous heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and oxygen
saturation can be assessed before, during and/or after the administration of a dose of
ASM. Heart rates can be monitored continuously by telemetry beginning, e.g., 6 hours
before administration of a dose of ASM up to 72 hours after administration of a dose of
ASM.
[00147]    In specific embodiments, a complete blood count with differential, blood urea
nitrogen (BUN), bicarbonate, creatinine, glucose, uric acid, calcium, phosphate,
albumin, total protein, sodium, potassium, chloride, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine
kinase, creatine kinase with MB fraction, and urinalysis (including urine color,
appearance, specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, hemoglobin, and
microscopy if indicated) can be performed at the times specified before, during and/or
after the administration of a dose of ASM. In certain embodiments, liver tests,
coagulation studies, and/or fasting lipid profile can be performed before, during and/or
after the administration of a dose of ASM. Liver functions tests can include assessing
concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
alkaline phosphatase (AP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and total and direct
bilirubin. Coagulation studies can include assessing prothrombin time (PT), partial
thromboplastin time (PTT), International normalized ratio (INR), D-dimer
                                             60

concentration, and fibrinogen concentration. Fasting lipid profile assessments can
include assessments of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high
density lipoprotein (HDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglycerides.
[00148]     In certain embodiments, a skin biopsy is performed prior to, during and/or
subsequent to the administration of a dose of ASM. In some embodiments, a liver
biopsy is performed prior to, during and/or subsequent to the administration of a dose of
ASM. Sphingomyelin levels in skin and liver biospsies can be assessed by metamorph
histological analysis.
[00149]     In certain embodiments, pulmonary function tests are performed prior to,
during and/or after the administration of a dose of ASM. Pulmonary function testing
equipment calibration and test administration protocols can be standardized accordance
with American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines (ATS, 1991, Am Rev Respir Dis 144:
1202-1218). In certain embodiments, percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) is
assessed prior to, during and after the administration of a dose of ASM. FVC is the total
volume of air expired during a forced maneuver. The FVC can be measured using
standard spirometric techniques.
[00150]     In certain embodiments, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) can be
performed prior to, during and after the administration of a dose of ASM. FEVI is the
volume of air expelled during the first second of FVC. The FEVI can be measured
using standard spirometric techniques.
[00151]     In certain embodiments, total lung capacity (TLC) can be assessed prior to,
during and after the administration of a dose of ASM. TLC is the total volume of air
within the lungs following a maximal inspiratory effort. The TLC can be measured
using whole body plethysmography.
[00152]     In certain embodiments, DLco can be assessed prior to, during and after the
administration of a dose of ASM. DLco measures the rate of diffusion of a diffusion
limited gas (carbon monoxide, CO) per minute across the alveolocapillary membrane.
DLco can be calculated by comparing the amount of carbon monoxide (CO) exhaled
following a known amount of inhaled CO. Helium, which does not diffuse across the
alveolocapillary membrane, can be included as a tracer with the inspired CO to control
for air trapping.
[00153]     In certain embodiments, a chest X-ray (posterior-anterior and lateral) can be
obtained prior to, during and/or after the administration of a dose of ASM. In certain
                                             61

embodiments, an abdominal MRI is obtained before, during and/or after the
administration of a dose of ASM.
[00154]    In certain embodiments, a blood sample is collected before, during and/or
after administration of a dose of ASM for assessment of biomarkers, bilirubin
concentration, and the percentage of neutrophils of total white blood cells. In a specific
embodiment, the concentration of one or more of the following biomarkers is assessed
using techniques known to one skilled in the art: CRP/hs-CRP concentration,
sphingomyelin concentration, iron concentration, ferritin concentration, calcitonin
concentration, albumin concentration, SAA, serum amyloid P component, ACE, CCL18,
chitotriosidase, transferrin, fibrinogen concentration, and plasma sphingomyelin
concentration, plasma ceramide concentration. In certain embodiments, the
concentration of one or more of the following cytokines is assessed using techniques
known to one skilled in the art: IL-6 and IL-8.
[00155]    In certain embodiments, the concentration of antibodies against ASM (e.g.,
anti-recombinant human ASM IgG and/or anti-recombinant human ASM IgE) is

embodiments, the concentration of one, two or more complement factors are assessed
before, during and/or after the administration of a dose of ASM. In certain
embodiments, the concentration of serum tryptase is assessed before, during and/or after
the administration of a dose of ASM. In certain embodiments, a skin test to determine
IgE-mediated reactions to ASM is assessed before, during and/or after the administration
of a dose of ASM.s.
[00156]    In certain embodiments, the pharmacokinetic profile for ASM is measured
before, during and/or after the administration of a dose of ASM. In some embodiments,
the BAL cell count is measured before, during and/or after the administration of a dose
of ASM. See Section 8 et seq, infra, for other parameters that may be assessed before,

        5.4.     BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES
[00159]     In accordance with the methods described herein, a biological sample is
subjected to one or more pretreatment steps prior to the detection and/or measurement of
a cell population, factor or marker (e.g., biomarker). In certain embodiments, a
biological fluid is pretreated by centrifugation, filtration, precipitation, dialysis, or
chromatography, or by a combination of such pretreatment steps. In other embodiments,
a tissue sample is pretreated by freezing, chemical fixation, paraffin embedding,
dehydration, permabilization, or homogenization followed by centrifugation, filtration,
precipitation, dialysis, or chromatography, or by a combination of such pretreatment
steps. In certain embodiments, the sample is pretreated by removing cells of a certain
type from the sample, or removing debris from the sample prior to the determination of
                                              63

the number or amount of a particular cell type(s) in the sample according to the methods
described herein.
[00160]     The biological sample can be a tissue sample, biological fluid, discharge, or
any other sample from a human subject. In some embodiments, the biological sample is
a blood sample or bone marrow sample. In certain embodiments, the biological sample
is a tissue sample (e.g., a liver, skin or lung biopsy). In some embodiments, the
biological sample is a biological fluid such as urine. In certain embodiments, the
biological sample is a sputum or nasal discharge sample. In some embodiments, the
biological sample is mouth swab.
[00161]     Techniques known in the art can be used to assess the presence, number,
amount or percentage of a certain type(s) of cells present in a biological sample. For
example, cells can be sorted using a using a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS).
Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) is a known method for separating particles,
including cells, based on the fluorescent properties of the particles. See, for example,
Kamarch, 1987, Methods Enzymol 151:150-165. Laser excitation of fluorescent
moieties in the individual particles results in a small electrical charge allowing
electromagnetic separation of positive and negative particles from a mixture. An
antibody or ligand used to detect an antigenic determinant present on the cell surface of
particular cells is labeled with a fluorochrome, such as FITC or phycoerythrin. The cells
are incubated with the fluorescently labeled antibody or ligand for a time period
sufficient to allow the labeled antibody or ligand to bind to cells. The cells are
processed through the cell sorter, allowing separation of the cells of interest from other
cells. FACS sorted particles can be directly deposited into individual wells of microtiter
plates to facilitate separation.
[00162]     Magnetic beads can be also used to separate cells. For example, cells can be
sorted using a using a magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) technique, a method for
separating particles based on their ability to bind magnetic beads (0.5-100 tm diameter).
A variety of useful modifications can be performed on the magnetic microspheres,
including covalent addition of an antibody which specifically recognizes a cell-solid
phase surface molecule or hapten. A magnetic field is then applied, to physically
manipulate the selected beads. In a specific embodiment, antibodies to a blood cell
surface marker are coupled to magnetic beads. The beads are then mixed with the blood
cell culture to allow binding. Cells are then passed through a magnetic field to separate
                                               64

out cells having the blood cell surface markers of interest. These cells can then be
isolated.
[00163]    In some embodiments, the surface of a culture dish may be coated with
antibodies, and used to separate cells by a method called panning. Separate dishes can
be coated with antibody specific to particular cells. Cells can be added first to a dish
coated with blood cell specific antibodies of interest. After thorough rinsing, the cells
left bound to the dish will be cells that express the cell markers of interest. Examples of
cell surface antigenic determinants or markers include, but are not limited to, CD2 for T
lymphocytes and natural killer cells, CD3 for T lymphocytes, CD 11 a for leukocytes,
CD28 for T lymphocytes, CD19 for B lymphocytes, CD20 for B lymphocytes, CD21 for
B lymphocytes, CD22 for B lymphocytes, CD23 for B lymphocytes, CD29 for
leukocytes, CD14 for monocytes, CD41 for platelets, CD61 for platelets, CD66 for
granulocytes, CD67 for granulocytes and CD68 for monocytes and macrophages.
[00164]    The presence, concentration or amount of a marker (including a biomarker) or
factor can be assessed used techniques known in the art. The presence, concentration or
amount of a marker (including a biomarker) or factor can be measured at the protein
level and/or RNA level using techniques known to one skilled in the art. At the protein
level, immunoassays, such as ELISAs and immunopreciptation and western blots can be
used to measure the presence, concentration or amount of a marker (including a
biomarker) or factor. In addition, FACS can be used to measure the presence,
concentration or amount of a marker (including a biomarker) or factor. At the RNA
level, RT-PCR and Northern blots can be used to measure the presence, concentration or
amount of a marker (including a biomarker) or factor.
        5.5.    CO-THERAPIES
[00165]    In some embodiments, a method for treating ASMD involves the
administration of ASM in combination with one or more additional therapies. As used
herein, the term "in combination," refers, in the context of the administration of ASM, to
the administration of a dose ASM prior to, concurrently with, or subsequent to the
administration of one or more additional therapies (e.g., agents) for use in treating
ASMD. The use of the term "in combination" does not restrict the order in which ASM
and one or more additional therapies are administered to a subject. In specific
embodiments, the interval of time between the administration of a dose of ASM and the
                                              65

administration of one or more additional therapies may be about 1-5 minutes, 1-30
minutes, 30 minutes to 60 minutes, 1 hour, 1-2 hours, 2-6 hours, 2-12 hours, 12-24
hours, 1-2 days, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3
weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 9 weeks, 10 weeks, 15 weeks, 20
weeks, 26 weeks, 52 weeks, 11-15 weeks, 15-20 weeks, 20-30 weeks, 30-40 weeks, 40
50 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8
months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, 12 months, 1 year, 2 years, or any period of
time in between. In certain embodiments, a dose ASM and one or more additional
therapies are administered less than 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, one
month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or 5 years apart.
[00166]    In some embodiments, the combination therapies provided herein involve
administering a dose of ASM every 2 to 4 weeks, and administering one or more
additional therapies once a week, once every 2 weeks, once every 3 weeks, once every 4
weeks, once every month, once every 2 months (e.g., approximately 8 weeks), once
every 3 months (e.g., approximately 12 weeks), or once every 4 months (e.g.,
approximately 16 weeks). In certain embodiments, ASM and one or more additional
therapies are cyclically administered to a subject. Cycling therapy involves the
administration of ASM for a period of time, followed by the administration of one or
more additional therapies for a period of time, and repeating this sequential
administration. In certain embodiments, cycling therapy may also include a period of
rest where ASM or the additional therapy is not administered for a period of time (e.g., 2
days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5
weeks, 10 weeks, 20 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6
months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, 12 months, 2 years, or 3
years). In an embodiment, the number of cycles administered is from I to 12 cycles,
from 2 to 10 cycles, or from 2 to 8 cycles.
[00167]    In some embodiments, the methods for treating ASMD provided herein
comprise administering ASM as a single agent for a period of time prior to
administering ASM in combination with an additional therapy. In certain embodiments,
the methods for treating ASMD provided herein comprise administering an additional
therapy alone for a period of time prior to administering ASM in combination with the
additional therapy.
[00168]    In some embodiments, the administration of ASM and one or more additional
therapies in accordance with the methods presented herein have an additive effect
                                             66

relative the administration of ASM or said one or more additional therapies alone. In
some embodiments, the administration of ASM and one or more additional therapies in
accordance with the methods presented herein have a synergistic effect relative to the
administration of ASM or said one or more additional therapies alone.
[00169]     As used herein, the term "synergistic," refers to the effect of the
administration of a dose ASM in combination with one or more additional therapies
(e.g., agents), which combination is more effective than the additive effects of any two
or more single therapies (e.g., agents). In a specific embodiment, a synergistic effect of
a combination therapy permits the use of lower dosages (e.g., sub-optimal doses) of
ASM or an additional therapy and/or less frequent administration of ASM or an
additional therapy to a subject. In certain embodiments, the ability to utilize lower
dosages of ASM or of an additional therapy and/or to administer ASM or said additional
therapy less frequently reduces the toxicity associated with the administration of ASM
or of said additional therapy, respectively, to a subject without reducing the efficacy of
ASM or of said additional therapy, respectively, in the treatment of ASMD. In some
embodiments, a synergistic effect results in improved efficacy of ASM and each of said
additional therapies in treating ASMD. In some embodiments, a synergistic effect of a
combination of ASM and one or more additional therapies avoids or reduces adverse or
unwanted side effects associated with the use of any single therapy.
[00170]     In particular embodiments, one or more additional therapies are administered
in combination with ASM to subjects to reduce or ameliorate one or more of the
following that may be associated with the administration of a particular dose of ASM: (i)
a related adverse event, (ii) a total bilirubin value greater than the bilirubin value for a
human without ASMD (e.g., a healthy human), (iii) a plasma ceramide concentration
greater than the plasma ceramide concentration of a human without ASMD (e.g., a
healthy human), or (iv) an acute phase response. In specific embodiments, one or more
additional therapies are administered in combination with ASM to subjects to increase
pulmonary function while minimizing one or more of the following that may be
associated with the administration of a particular dose of ASM: (i) a related adverse
event, (ii) a total bilirubin value greater than the bilirubin value for a human without
ASMD (e.g., a healthy human), (iii) a plasma ceramide concentration greater than the
plasma ceramide concentration of a human without ASMD (e.g., a healthy human), or
(iv) an acute phase response.
                                               67

[00171]     In certain embodiments, one or more additional therapies administered in
combination with ASM to a subject to control or relieve symptoms associated with
ASMD. In some embodiments, one or more additional therapies that are administered in
combination with ASM to a subject are pain relievers. Specific examples of therapies
can be administered in combination with ASM include, but are not limited to, N-Acetyl
L-cysteine (NAC), S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), interleukin (IL)-6 antibody, IL-6
receptor antibody, dexamethasone, L-Nil, (a selective inhibitor of inducible NOS), L
NAME (a selective inhibitor of NOS), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF),
imipramine (a sphingomyelinase inhibitor), D609 (a sphingomyelinase inhibitor), and N
oleoylethanolamine (NOE; a ceramide inhibitor).
[00172]     In certain embodiments, chaperones, such as small molecule chaperones, are
administered in combination with ASM. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,750,050 and
International Publication Nos. WO 2004/045574 and WO 2010/015816, which are
incorporated by reference herein, for agents (e.g., small molecules) that may be
administered in combination with ASM to a subject. In some embodiments, the
chaperone (e.g., small molecule chaperone) does one, two or all of the following:
increases the targeting of ASM to sites of pathology, stabilizes the activity of the ASM,
and enhances the activity of the ASM.
[00173]     In some embodiments, a glucocorticosteroid, such as dexamethasone, are
administered in combination with ASM. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,658,916, which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, for agents (e.g., glucocorticosteriods)
that can be administered in combination with ASM.
[00174]     In some embodiments, a substrate reduction molecule is administered in
combination with ASM to a subject. In specific embodiments, a molecule (e.g., a small
molecule) that either decreases the amount of sphingomyelin, reduces the rate of
sphingomyelin synthesis, or both is administered in combination with ASM to a subject.
See, e.g., Li et al. 2007, Biochim Biophys Act 1771(9):1186-1194 (which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) for sphingomyelin synthase inhibitors,
such as tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate and sphingomyelin synthase siRNAs.
[00175]     In some embodiments, a therapy that reduces the potential immunogenicity of
ASM is administered in combination with ASM to a subject. In certain embodiments,
benedryl is administered in combination with ASM to a subject.
[00176]     The combination of ASM and one or more additional therapies can be
administered to a subject in the same pharmaceutical composition. Alternatively, ASM
                                             68

and one or more additional therapies can be administered concurrently to a subject in
separate pharmaceutical compositions. ASM and one or more additional therapies can
be administered sequentially to a subject in separate pharmaceutical compositions.
ASM and one or more additional therapies may also be administered to a subject by the
same or different routes of administration.
        5.6.     PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS
[00177]     In one aspect, described herein are finished packaged and labeled
pharmaceutical products. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical product comprises a
unit dosage form of ASM in an appropriate vessel or container (e.g., a glass vial or other
container that is hermetically sealed). In some embodiments, the unit dosage form is a
lyophilized form of ASM, and under those circumstances, the pharmaceutical product
may contain a second container with sterile saline or sterile water for reconstituting the
lyophilized form of ASM. In other embodiments, the unit dosage form is an aqueous
form of ASM that does not require reconstitution before administration to a subject. In
specific embodiments, the unit dosage form of ASM contains ASM in an amount
sufficient for the administration of a low, non-toxic dose of the enzyme to a subject. In
certain embodiments, the unit dosage form is suitable for the selected route of
administration of the ASM to the subject. In a specific embodiment, the unit dosage
form is suitable for intravenous delivery to a subject.
[00178]     In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical product comprises a unit dosage form
of ASM in an appropriate vessel or container (e.g., a glass vial or other container that is
hermetically sealed) and an infusion pump or syringe pump for the administration of the
ASM to a subject.
[00179]     As with any pharmaceutical product, the packaging material and container are
designed to protect the stability of the product during storage and shipment. Further, the
pharmaceutical product includes instructions for use or other informational material that
advise the physician, technician or patient on how to appropriately treat ASMD. In
other words, the pharmaceutical product includes instruction means indicating or
suggesting a dosing regimen including, but not limited to, actual doses (e.g., a dose
escalation protocol), monitoring procedures, and other monitoring information. In
certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical produce includes a means for genotyping a
patient (e.g., PCR primers for the SMPD1 gene).

6.       EXAMPLE 1: HUMAN TRIAL OF RECOMBINANT HUMAN ACID
         SPHINGOMYELINASE                (RHASM)          ENZYME         REPLACEMENT
         THERAPY IN HUMAN ADULTS WITH ASM DEFICIENCY
         6.1.    INTRODUCTION
[00180]     ASMD is an autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disorder that results
when sphingomyelin is unable to be normally catabolized to ceramide and
phosphorylcholine. Consequently, sphingomyelin accumulates within cells primarily of
the reticuloendothelial system, leading to hepatosplenomegaly, anemia,
thrombocytopenia, and interstitial lung disease. Growth retardation and an atherogenic
lipid profile also are common findings. Patients who have little to no residual ASM
activity exhibit the most severe symptoms with onset in infancy, failure to thrive,
neurodegeneration, and death by age 3 (Niemann-Pick disease type A, NPD A). Patients
with higher amounts of residual ASM activity have variable ages of onset,
heterogeneous presentations and somatic symptoms, little to no neurologic involvement,
and generally survive into adulthood (NPD B). Currently, there is no treatment for
patients with ASMD.
[00181]     Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been successfully used to treat
several lysosomal storage disorders, including Gaucher disease, Mucopolysaccharidosis
types I, II, and VI, Fabry disease, and Pompe disease. Recombinant human lysosomal
enzymes are administered intravenously and taken up into cells by receptor-mediated
endocytosis for subsequent targeting to lysosomes. Proof of principle for the treatment
of ASMD was demonstrated by Dr. Edward Schuchman's laboratory (Mount Sinai
Medical Center) in an ASM knockout mouse (ASMKO) model where intravenous
injections of recombinant human ASM (rhASM) efficiently reduced sphingomyelin
levels in liver and spleen, and to a lesser extent in lung (Miranda, et al., FASEB
2000;14:1988). However, sphingomyelin levels were not reduced in brain because of
the inability of rhASM to cross the blood-brain barrier. Due to the fact that the ASMKO
mouse has no residual ASM activity or protein and develops rapid and severe
neurological disease, this animal is considered most appropriately a model of NPD
type A (see, Buccinna et al., 2009, J. Neurochem. 109:105-115).
[00182]     Additional studies confirmed that biweekly doses of rhASM reduced
sphingomyelin levels in ASMKO mice in a dose-dependent manner (0.3-3 mg/kg). The
no observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL) for single and repeat dosing were
                                              70

determined to be 0.3 and 3 mg/kg, respectively in ASMKO mice. Subsequent attempts
to deplete sphingomyelin levels in lung with higher doses of rhASM led to unexpected
toxicity. At doses >10 mg/kg, ASMKO mice but not normal animals experienced liver
inflammation, adrenal hemorrhage, cardiovascular shock and death in the setting of very
elevated cytokine levels, suggesting cytokine release syndrome. The toxicity and
cytokine elevations seen with high doses of rhASM could be ameliorated or prevented
by prior treatment of ASMKO mice with several lower doses of rhASM, suggesting that
the rate and amount of sphingomyelin degradation plays a key role.
[00183]     In the ASMKO mouse, a model for NPD-type A, toxicity was not observed
following single doses of < 0.3 mg/kg rhASM and repeat doses of < of 3.0 mg/kg
rhASM; severe toxicity was not observed until single doses >10 mg/kg rhASM were
administered. Therefore, a conservative starting dose of 0.03 mg/kg rhASM was
selected for single-dose treatment of human subjects to ensure a 10-fold safety margin
with respect to the single-dose NOAEL (0.3 mg/kg) observed in ASMKO mice. A
maximum dose of 1.0 mg/kg rhASM was selected for single dose treatment of human
subjects to ensure a 10-fold safety margin with respect to the dose at which serious
toxicity was observed in the ASMKO mouse (10 mg/kg). Upon completion of the
protocol set forth below, toxicity in the human subjects was unexpectedly observed with
a dose as low as 0.3 mg/kg rhASM.
        6.2.     MATERIALS AND METHODS
          6.2.1.        HUMAN PROTOCOL DESIGN
[00184]     This protocol was a single-center, single-dose, dose escalation Phase 1 trial.
The primary trial objectives were to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of single
doses of rhASM in human adults with non-neuronopathic ASMD (Niemann-Pick B).
Single doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 and 1.0 mg/kg rhASM were infused sequentially by
dose cohort. The original trial design called for a minimum of 15 patients (5 cohorts of
3 patients each). Due to difficulties with patient enrollment, the protocol was amended
such that the first 2 cohorts enrolled 3 patients each and the last 3 cohorts were to enroll
2 patients each. An independent data monitoring committee oversaw the conduct of the
trial and all protocol procedures were approved by the IRB. Figure 1 depicts the
protocol patient flow.
          6.2.2.        PATIENTS
                                              71

[00185]     To be eligible for the protocol, patients had to be 18-65 years of age and have
deficient ASM enzyme activity, a spleen volume >2x normal, AST and ALT <250 IU/L,
bilirubin <3.6 mg/dL, INR <1.5, DLco >30% predicted, and platelets >60,000/mL.
Patients were excluded if they had cirrhosis (by liver biopsy), significant cardiac disease,
total splenectomy, or were taking medications or herbal supplements that were
potentially hepatotoxic, promoted bleeding, or inhibited rhASM.
[00186]     A total of 13 patients were enrolled and 11 patients infused with rhASM.
rhASM was produced by over-expression of ASM cDNA in Chinese hamster ovary
cells. The mean age of infused patients was 30.8 yrs, all were Caucasian (non
Hispanic/non-Latino), and mean spleen volume was 10.8 multiples of normal. One had
a partial splenectomy; the remaining patients had intact spleens at protocol entry. Figure
2 depicts the demography and baseline characteristics of the patients in this protocol.
[00187]     Once screening was completed and eligibility was confirmed, patients were
admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU) overnight for baseline telemetry and infused the
following morning with rhASM. Patients were monitored for 72 hrs post-dose while on
telemetry (24 hrs in the CCU and 48 hrs in the General Clinical Research Center).
Patients returned for an overnight visit on Day 14 and an outpatient visit on Day 28.
[00188]     The following sets forth the medical assessments that were made during the
protocol:
                -       Physical exam - Days 0, 1, 2, 14, and 28

        6.3.    RESULTS
[00189]    As depicted in Figures 3A and 3B, plasma ceramide levels and plasma
sphingomyelin levels, respectively, were determined at several time points. Plasma
ceramide levels showed a dose-dependent rise by 6 hrs and peaked at 18-72 hrs. Plasma
sphingomyelin levels were normal at baseline and showed no consistent trend over time.
In patient no. 12112 who received the highest dose (1 mg/kg), the plasma sphingomyelin
level rose post-dose and peaked at 72 hours.
[00190]    Figure 4 depicts total bilirubin levels determined over several time points
during the protocol. Total bilirubin showed a dose-related rise by 24 hrs and peaked at
48-60 hrs. The highest total bilirubin was 4.7 mg/dL in patient no. 12112 who received
the highest dose (1 mg/kg). There were proportional increases in direct and indirect
bilirubin. No increases were seen in ALT, AST, or alkaline phosphatase. There was a
mild increase in GGT through 72 hrs (not shown) in two patients who received the
highest (1 mg/kg, patient no. 12112) and lowest (0.03 mg/kg, patient no. 10503) doses.
Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were stable through the protocol, indicating that
hemolysis was not responsible for elevated bilirubin levels.
[00191]    Figures 5A-5G depict the levels of acute phase response (inflammation)
markers, CRP/hs-CRP, % neutrophils, fibrinogen, ferritin, IL-8, IL-6, and calcitonin,
respectively, determined at several time points for several patients. CRP/hs-CRP
showed a transient dose-related rise by 24 hrs, peaked at 48-72 hrs, and returned to
normal by Day 14. Other acute phase reactants also showed increases (% neutrophils,
fibrinogen, ferritin, PT and PTT) and decreases (iron, albumin). Certain inflammatory
biomarkers, e.g., the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and calcitonin, also showed substantial
                                              73

elevations that were dose dependent and peaked 48 hours post-infusion. Among these
inflammatory mediators, the greatest changes in descending order occurred in IL 8 (peak
33.8x upper limit of normal), calcitonin (peak 33.4x upper limit of normal), CRP (peak
9.8 x upper limit of normal), and ferritin (3.9x upper limit of normal). There was no
trend in platelet count or the level of fibrin-split products (not shown). The rises in
laboratory acute phase reactants correlated with the constitutional clinical symptoms of
fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, pain, and myalgias in some patients.
[00192]     Figure 6 is a chart of treatment emergent adverse events for four patients each
on a different dose of rhASM, which events were considered to be related (possibly,
probably, or definitely) to treatment. As set forth in the chart, patient no. 11509, who
was given a dose of 0.3 mg/kg rhASM, exhibited moderately severe adverse events
starting on day 2.
[00193]     With regard to related adverse events reported in the protocol, there were no
significant cardiovascular changes by telemetry, ECG, echocardiogram, or biomarkers
(BNP, cardiac troponin-I, CPK-MB) or adrenal hormone dysfunction. One patient (no.
12112, 1.0 mg/kg cohort) had an elevated cortisol level in the morning 24 hours post
dose, which most likely represented a normal physiologic stress response to several
ongoing moderate related adverse events. Further, four of six patients receiving >0.3
mg/kg rhASM experienced a total of 19 clinical and laboratory related adverse events
assessed as drug-related. The intensity of related adverse events ranged from mild to
severe, but most were moderate and did not require any intervention. They included
fever (n=2), pain [myalgia; abdominal, leg, and hip pain] (n=2), nausea (n=2), scleral
icterus and urine urobilinogen (n=1), fatigue (n=1), vomiting (n=1), lymphocytic
infiltrate/hepatocellular degeneration on liver biopsy (n=1), acute phase reaction (n=4),
elevated bilirubin (n=2), and increased fibrin D-dimer (n= 1). The onset of clinical
symptoms began 12 hours post-infusion and resolved by 72 hrs, except for hip pain in
one patient that began after 72 hours. At day 14, a liver biopsy in one patient (0.6 mg/kg
rhASM, patient no. 12313) showed two new foci of lymphocytic infiltrates: one was
tiny (0.1 mm diameter), and the other was moderate (0.5 mm diameter) and which was
associated with hepatocellular degeneration. This protocol was stopped when the first
patient in cohort 5 (1 mg/kg rhASM, patient no. 12112) experienced a dose-limiting
toxicity of hyperbilirubinemia (peak 4.7 mg/dL).
[00194]     The results of this showed an unexpected and delayed onset of dose-related
clinical and laboratory adverse events in humans suffering from ASMD at doses of
                                               74

rhASM of 0.3 mg/kg and higher. Further, two major safety laboratory observations
were made in view of the results of this protocol. One regarding hyperbilirubinemia, in
which a proportionate to dose rise in direct and indirect bilirubin was observed with no
consistent markers of liver damage (AST, ALT, AP) or evidence of hemolysis
(hemoglobin and hematocrit). Two patients had mildly elevated GGT at 48-72 hours,
and one patient had two new liver foci of lymphocytic infiltrates, one of which was
associated with hepatocellular degeneration.
[00195]     The other observation concerned the acute phase response, i.e., inflammation.
The results showed an increase in CRP/hs-CRP, % neutrophils, ferritin, IL-6, IL-8,
calcitonion, fibrinogen, PT, PTT, and a decrease in iron and albumin in response to
increasing dosages of rhASM. The constitutional clinical symptoms of fever, nausea,
vomiting, pain, and myalgia were most likely related to the acute phase response. The
results showed no evidence of cytokine release syndrome associated with cardiovascular
changes, and no evidence of adrenal hormone dysfunction.
         6.4.   CONCLUSIONS
[00196]     The above-described protocol is the first experience with enzyme replacement
therapy in adult human patients with ASMD. At bioactive doses in humans, rhASM did
not cause cytokine release syndrome associated with cardiovascular changes, or cause
adrenal hormone dysfunction. The major safety observations were dose-related
hyperbilirubinemia and acute phase response. Both adverse events are likely related to
the breakdown of sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphylcholine, but the exact
molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Several safety biomarkers were
identified, including bilirubin, ceramide, CRP/hs-CRP, 1L-8, 1L-6, calcitonin, and
ferritin. Further, based on the hyperbilirubinemia findings, the maximum tolerated
starting dose of rhASM was 0.6 mg/kg.
[00197]     Moreover, the fact that the onset of adverse events with clinical symptoms in
patients was observed at a dose as low as 0.3 mg/kg was surprising, given that the
NOAEL ("no observed adverse effect level") in the ASMKO mouse was 0.3 mg/kg.
Notably, clinical symptoms of toxicity in the ASMKO mice was not observed until
doses greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg were used.

7.       EXAMPLE 2: REPEAT DOSE INTRAVENOUS INJECTION
         TOXICITY PROTOCOL FOLLOWING DEBULKING PHASE
         IN ACID SPHINGOMYELINEASE KNOCK-OUT MICE
[00198]    This example describes the investigation of the potential toxicity of repeated
intravenous administration of recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase (rhASM)
following a debulking phase in acid sphingomyelinase knockout (ASMKO) mice.
Having established that toxic side effects begin to be observed at intital doses of 10
mg/kg of rhASM in ASMKO mice, the following investigation was designed to
determine if the administration of escalating doses of recombinant human acid
sphingomyelinase (rhASM) in ASMKO mice would debulk enough of the accumulated
sphingomyelin so that a higher dose of rhASM could be administered to the ASMKO
mice to target sites of pathology, such as the lung and brain, with minimal or no
observable toxicity.
[00199]    JK ASMKO mice were administered 3 mg/kg rhASM on study days (SD) 1,
3, 5, 7 (Debulking Phase). Beginning on SD 9 and continuing every other week for 13
weeks (7 doses) mice received treatment doses of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg rhASM (Treatment
Phase).
[00200]    rhASM was intravenously administered via a bolus injection in a lateral tail
vein to male and female ASMKO mice. Groups 1-3 received 3 mg/kg rhASM during
the Debulking Phase (SD 1, 3, 5 and 7). Groups 1, 2, and 3 received 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg
rhASM, respectively, during the Treatment Phase (SD 9, 23, 37, 51, 65, 79, and 93).
One subset of mice in each group (the first 2 mice/sex in Group 1 and the first 4
mice/sex in Groups 2-3) were bled pre-study as well as 5 minutes and 4 hours following
Treatment Phase Doses 1, 4, and 7 for analysis of toxicokinetics (TK) (5 minutes) and
ceramide levels (4 hours). The other subset of mice in each group (the last 2 mice/sex in
Group 1 and the last 4 mice/sex in Groups 2-3) were bled pre-study as well as 4 and 24
hours following Treatment Phase Doses 1, 4, and 7 for analysis of rodent multi-analyte
profiles (4 hours) and acute phase protein/liver function test levels (24 hours). See the
Study Design in Table 2, infra.
[00201]    Due to the likelihood of anaphylactic responses beginning with the first
Treatment Phase dose and each dose thereafter, each mouse was observed closely for
signs of anaphylaxis (e.g., restlessness, chewing, rubbing face, urticaria, edema,
lethargy, and scruffy coat) following test article administration. Mice received
                                             76

diphenhydramine (DPH) beginning prior to the first dose of the Treatment Phase and
each dose thereafter.
[00202]         DPH at a concentration of 5 mg/mL was prepared by diluting a 50 mg/mL
commercially-available stock solution with sterile 0.9% saline. DPH was administered
intraperitoneally (IP) at a dose of 20 mg/kg (4 mL/kg) based on the most recent body
weight, 10-20 minutes prior to dosing rhASM to prevent possible anaphylactic reactions.
If any animal demonstrated a hypersensitivity reaction post-test article administration,
despite DPH pre-treatment, a second dose of DPH was administered IP at 10 mg/kg (2
mL/kg).
[00203]         All mice were euthanized via C02 asphyxiation on SD 100. Following
euthanasia blood were collected for clinical pathology and immunogenicity analysis via
a cardiac puncture. A necropsy was performed on all mice following blood collection.
All tissues were preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) followed by
histopathological analysis. A piece of the liver, spleen, kidney, and lung were preserved
in 2% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde for analysis of the sphingomyelin load. A
piece of the liver, spleen, kidney, and lung were also collected and stored at < -70 0 C for
possible future analysis.
[00204]         Following necropsy all remaining tissues including the carcass were placed in
10% NBF.

* Diphenhydramine will be administered to all mice prior to the 1" Treatment Phase dose and each dose thereafter.
[00205]       In Life Observations:
[00206]       The first day of the study was considered SD1 (the first day of dosing).
Animal body weights were taken once weekly during the course of the study beginning
on SD-I and were taken on the Monday of each week thereafter. Cageside observations
were made once daily Monday through Friday. Any abnormalities and observations of
normal were recorded. Post-dose clinical observations/scoring were made immediately
prior to, 10-20, and 50-70 minutes following each dose administration. Any
abnormalities and observations of normal were recorded. The attending veterinarian
and/or the study director was consulted in the event of an adverse reaction and
appropriate actions were taken based on their recommendations.
[00207]       Euthanasia:
[00208]       If there was an adverse reaction that affected the health and well being of an
animal, then the animal was euthanized via C02 asphyxiation, opened via the thoracic,
abdominal, and cranial cavities and placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for
possible future analysis. If an animal was found dead, the entire carcass was preserved
in 10% NBF for possible future analysis. At the end of the study all surviving animals
were euthanized by C02 asphyxiation.
[00209]       Sample Collection:
[00210]       Dose Analysis: Approximately five-hundred microliters (500 gL) of test
article from all dose levels was collected within 1-10 minutes following formulation on
each day of dosing and stored on dry ice until transfer to a freezer set to maintain a
temperature of < -70'C. Dose analysis samples were transferred on SD 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 23,
                                                                78

37, 51, 65, 79, and 93 and were stored at < -70'C until analysis . Dose analysis samples
were measured via the A280 assay.
[00211]     Blood Collection: For the collection of blood for analysis of TK, rodent
multi-analyte profiles, and acute phase protein/liver function test levels mice were
anesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane and oxygen. Blood collections occurred on SD
-1, 9, 51 and 93 (pre-study and the 1st, 4th, and 7th treatment phase doses, respectively)
according to the Blood Collection Tables (see Tables 4 and 5, infra) and the following
text.
         rhASM Toxicokinetics: The first 2 mice/sex in Group 1 and the first 4 mice/sex
         in Groups 2-3 had a blood sample taken for analysis of peak rhASM levels pre
         study (SD -1), and 5 minutes following the 1st, 4th, and 7th Treatment Phase
         doses. Blood from all animals was collected from the retro-orbital plexus of
         unconscious mice. Approximately 60 gL of whole blood was collected into
         hematocrit tubes and allowed to clot at room temperature for at least 1 minute.
         Serum were prepared from these samples by centrifugation for 5 minutes at
         10,000 revolutions per minute (RPM). Following centrifugation the serum was
         collected and stored on dry ice until transfer to a freezer set to maintain a
         temperature of < -70'C. Once transferred, all samples were stored at < -70'C
         until analysis. TK samples were transferred on SD 1, 9, 51, and 93. TK samples
         were measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
        Analysis of Ceramide Levels: The first 2 mice/sex in Group 1 and the first 4
         mice/sex in Groups 2-3 had a blood sample taken for analysis of ceramide levels
         pre-study (SD -1), and 4 hours following the 1st, 4th, and 7th Treatment Phase
         doses. Blood from these animals was collected from the retro-orbital plexus of
         unconscious mice. Approximately 240 gL of whole blood was collected into
         potassium EDTA tubes and placed on a Nutator rocker for up to 30 minutes to
         prevent the formation of a clot. Plasma was prepared from these samples by
         centrifugation for 5 minutes at 10,000 RPM. Following centrifugation the
         plasma was collected and stored on dry ice until transfer to a freezer set to
         maintain a temperature of < -70'C. Once transferred, all samples were stored at <
         -70'C until analysis by a Mass Spectrometry Group. Ceramide samples were

         rodent multi-analyte profiles pre-study (SD -1), and 4 hours following the 1st,
         4th, and 7th Treatment Phase doses. Blood from these animals was collected
         from the retro-orbital plexus in unconscious mice. Approximately 150 gL of
         whole blood was collected into serum separator tubes and allowed to clot for at
         least 30 minutes. Serum was prepared from these samples by centrifugation for
         5 minutes at 10,000 RPM. Following centrifugation the serum was collected and
         stored on dry ice until transfer to a freezer set to maintain a temperature of <
         70'C. Once transferred, all samples were stored at < -70'C until shipment on no

        ACID SPHINGOMYELINASE (RHASM) ENZYME REPLACEMENT
        THERAPY
        8.1.      INTRODUCTION
[00223]     The protocol described below utilizes within-patient dose escalation as an
option for achieving higher repeat doses of rhASM. The safety, efficacy and
pharmacokinetics (PK) of rhASM infusions at doses of 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 mg/kg
administered every 2 weeks (q2w) for 40 weeks, and long term safety and efficacy of
rhASM infusions are evaluated.
        8.2.      MATERIALS AND METHODS
           8.2.1.         PROTOCOL DESIGN
[00224]     The 12 NP-type B patients to be treated are of either gender. Patients will
receive at least 1 dose of 0.1 mg/kg rhASM initially. Patients that tolerate the 0.1 mg/kg
rhASM infusion are then administered escalating doses of 0.3 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, and 1
mg/kg every 2 weeks, as tolerated. Patients who tolerate 1.0 mg/kg are then stratified by
spleen volume (<12 times or >12 times multiples of normal) and randomized to receive
one of 2 target doses: 1.0 mg/kg rhASM or 3.0 mg/kg; patients randomized to the 3.0
mg/kg group will escalate to 2.0 mg/kg and then 3.0 mg/kg, as tolerated. Patients who
do not tolerate the 0.1 mg/kg dose of rhASM are replaced. Patients who cannot tolerate
escalation at higher doses will remain at their maximum tolerated dose for the duration
of the 26 week maintenance dose period.
[00225]     All patients will have doses escalated from 0.1 mg/kg to their target dose.
Dosage adjustments during the escalation period will occur at every 2 week intervals
until the target dose is reached (if tolerated). Following the initial infusion (0.1 mg/kg
rhASM) as well as subsequent doses, patient outcomes, i.e., adverse event (AE)
occurrence / severity and serum bilirubin, hsCRP, and other acute phase response
proteins, and ceramide, will be reviewed. The following criteria will determine the next
dose to be administered during the dose escalation period:
         1.       Total bilirubin value <2.0 mg/dL or mild AE -> escalate to next dose (if
applicable)
                                               86

          2.      Total bilirubin value  = 2.1 - 3.0 mg/dL or moderate AE -> no dosage
escalation; repeat current dose,
          3.      Total bilirubin value >3.0 mg/dL) or severe AE -> decrease dose to
previously administered/tolerated.
[00226]      Any serious adverse event (SAE) judged to be related to rhASM, a bilirubin
value that does not decrease to <2.0 mg/dL prior to the next scheduled dose or any AE
that raises concern regarding the safety of rhASM at the administered dose may be
considered a dose-limiting-toxicity (DLT). If a patient experiences a DLT, subsequent
doses for the patient should be temporarily halted. Patients may be re-challenged to
receive the dose that resulted in a DLT and if tolerated, treatment will proceed as
originally planned.
[00227]      If a patient cannot tolerate 2 doses of 0.1 mg/kg (i.e., initial infusion and one
re-challenge dose) they will not be treated with escalating doses and will be discontinued
and replaced in the study. Patients who tolerate the 0.3 mg/kg dose will receive the
initial rhASM infusion (0.1 mg/kg) and, after 2 weeks, 0.3 mg/kg rhASM (provided the
dose escalation criteria are met following the 0.1 mg/kg dose). Subsequent rhASM
doses will be administered during the dose escalation period q2w for a maximum of 18
weeks. If a patient successfully escalates to 0.3 mg/kg and subsequently meets criteria
#2 or #3 (above), the patient may be re challenged twice. If re-challenge is unsuccessful
(i.e., target dose cannot be reached), the patient will continue on a rhASM dose of 0.1
mg/kg for the remainder of the 40-week treatment period.
[00228]      Patients to be treated with the 0.6 mg/kg dose regimen will receive the initial
rhASM infusion (0.1 mg/kg), followed by 1 dose of 0.3 mg/kg rhASM, followed by 0.6
mg/kg rhASM q2w for the remainder of the 40-week treatment period (provided the
previous rhASM infusions of 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg are well tolerated). Patients to
be treated with the 1.0 mg/kg regimen will receive the initial rhASM infusion (0.1
mg/kg), followed by 1 dose of 0.3 mg/kg rhASM, followed by 1 dose of 0.6 mg/kg
rhASM, followed by 1.0 mg/kg rhASM q2w for the remainder of the 40-week treatment
period (provided the previous rhASM infusions of 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, and 0.6 mg/kg
are well tolerated). If a patient successfully escalates from 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg or from 0.6
to 1.0 mg/kg and subsequently meets criteria #2 or #3 (above), the patient may be re
challenged twice. If re-challenge is unsuccessful (i.e., target dose cannot be reached),
the patient will continue on the lower tolerated dose for the remainder of the 40-week
treatment period.
                                                 87

[00229]      Following the 40-week treatment phase, patients may be allowed to continue
their treatment at their maintenance dose level.
            8.2.2.        PATIENTS
[00230]      Each patient should meet the following inclusion criteria to be treated in
accordance with these regimens:
         1.        Documented ASM deficiency consistent with Niemann-Pick (N-P)
disease;
         2.        Diffusing capacity (DLCO) >20% and <80% of the predicted normal
value;
         3.        Spleen volume >8 times normal (>1.6% of body weight);
         4.        Female patients of childbearing potential must have a serum pregnancy
test negative for 0-hCG, and agree to use a medically acceptable method of birth control
for the duration of the protocol.
            8.2.3.        TREATMENT
[0051] Patients will receive a single 0.1 mg/kg rhASM IV over an approximate 35
minute time period. Administration guidelines are summarized in Table 8, below.
Patients that tolerate the initial 0.1 mg/kg rhASM infusion will be dose escalated to a
target treatment dose (rhASM 0.3, 0.6 or 1.0 mg/kg). All patients will have doses
escalated from 0.1 mg/kg to their target dose. Dosage adjustments during the escalation
period will occur at every 2 week intervals until the target dose is reached.

[00232]     At each visit, patients should be evaluated for new or ongoing adverse events
(AEs).
[00233]      Clinical endpoints can be measured as the % change from baseline to Week
26 of the maintenance dose period. The primary efficacy endpoint is a decrease in
spleen volume as measured by MRI. Secondary efficacy endpoints include a decrease in
liver sphingomyelin level; an increase in exercise capacity as determined by % predicted
maximum workload by cycle ergometry; increased pulmonary function as a % predicted
DLco; increased lung clearance which can be determined by bronchial alveolar lavage
(BAL) cell count and profile, sphingomyelin, ceramide, cytokine and chitotriosidase
levels. Tertiary efficacy endpoints can include a decrease in liver volume as measured
by MRI; increased pulmonary function which can be determined by % predicted FVC,
FEV 1, TLC; improved lung appearance determined by high resolution CT scan, chest X
ray; improved lipid profile as determined by HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, triglyceride
levels, and total cholesterol: HDL cholesterol ratio; improved platelet count;
hemoglobin; decreased sphingomyelin levels in skin, plasma, DBS; and improvement in
other biomarkers such as CCL18, ACE.

         HUMAN ACID SPHINGOMYELINASE (RHASM) ENZYME
         REPLACEMENT THERAPY
         9.1.    INTRODUCTION
[00234]     The protocol described below utilizes a repeat-dose, dose comparison to
evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of recombinant human acid
sphingomyelinase (rhASM) in adult patients with ASMD. The objectives of the
protocol include: (i) the evaluation of the safety of dose escalation of rhASM; (ii) the
evaluation of the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of the maximum tolerated or
randomized dose of rhASM administered intravenously every 2 weeks for 26 weeks; and
(iii) the evaluation of the long-term safety and efficacy of rhASM infusions administered
intravenously every 2 weeks from week 26 until protocol completion (at least 182 weeks
in duration).

        9.2.      MATERIALS AND METHODS
           9.2.1.        PATIENTS
[00235]     Each patient should meet the following inclusion criteria to be treated in
accordance with these regimens:
        1.        Documented acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficiency consistent with
Niemann-Pick disease (NPD).
        2.        Two or more characteristic clinical features, including thrombocytopenia,
anemia, neutropenia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and pulmonary disease consistent
with non-neuronopathic NPD.
        3.        Diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLco) > 20% and < 80% of the
predicted normal value;
        4.        Spleen volume > 8 multiples of normal (MN) (i.e., > 1.6% of body
weight). A partial splenectomy can be permitted if performed > 1 year from
Screening/Baseline and residual spleen volume is > 8 MN.
        5.        Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum
pregnancy test for p-human chorionic gonadotropin (p-HCG) and agree to use a
medically accepted method of contraception for the duration of the protocol.
           9.2.2.        PROTOCOL DESIGN
[00236]     Patients who can tolerate rhASM at 0.1 mg/kg can be enrolled in the protocol.
For each patient, protocol participation can consist of 3 periods:
                   1.    Screening/Baseline ( -60 to -1 days).
                  2.     Primary Treatment Period (approximately 32 to 46 weeks).
        Dose Escalation (DE) Phase (Primary DE - approximately 6 to 16 weeks).
                  -      Upon safely escalating from 0.1 to 0.3 to 0.6 to 1.0 mg/kg
                         rhASM, patients can be stratified by spleen volume (< 12 and >
                          12 MN) and randomized to either continue dosing at 1.0 mg/kg or
                         continue dose escalation through 2.0 and 3.0 mg/kg and then
                         receive 3.0 mg/kg rhASM or the maximum tolerated dose
                         (Secondary DE - 4 weeks) for the remainder of the protocol.
                  -      Non-randomized patients can remain at their maximum tolerated
                         dose (< 1.0 mg/kg rhASM).
        Dose Maintenance (DM) Phase (26 weeks at maximum tolerated or randomized
dose).
                                              91

                 3.       Long-term Treatment Period (at least 182 weeks at maximum
tolerated or randomized dose)
[00237]     The Screening/Baseline assessments can be completed at least 24 hrs prior to
the initial infusion of rhASM. Enrollment into the protocol is contingent upon the
patient being able to tolerate 2 doses of rhASM at 0.1 mg/kg. Initially, all eligible
patients can receive a single dose of 0.1 mg/kg rhASM on dose escalation (DE) Day 1.
Patients who are unable to tolerate this dose are re-challenged 2 weeks later. Patients
who cannot tolerate 2 doses of 0.1 mg/kg rhASM (i.e., initial dose and re-challenge
dose) are discontinued and replaced, to ensure that approximately 12 patients (who can
tolerate rhASM at 0.1 mg/kg) are enrolled.
[00238]     Doses of rhASM can be escalated every 2 weeks from 0.1 to 0.3 to 0.6 to 1.0
mg/kg during the Primary DE Phase. During the Primary DE Phase, patients can have
rhASM doses safely escalated every 2 weeks from 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg (as indicated in
Figure 7).
[00239]     During the Primary and Secondary DE Phases, the following dose escalation
criteria can determine the next dose of rhASM to be administered:
         1.      If total bilirubin (the highest value prior to the next scheduled dose of
rhASM and includes the pre infusion blood draw) is < 2.0 mg/dL or no/mild related
adverse event (AE) -> Escalate to next dose.
         2.      If total bilirubin is > 2.0 but < 3.0 mg/dL or moderate related AE
->  Repeat same dose.
            *    If total bilirubin remains > 2.0 mg/dL just prior to next dose -> Stop
                 further dosing of patient temporarily (potential dose-limiting toxicity
                 [DLT]).
         3.      If total bilirubin is > 3.0 mg/dL or severe related AE -> Decrease dose.
            *    If total bilirubin remains > 2.0 mg/dL just prior to next dose -> Stop
                 further dosing of patient temporarily (potential DLT).
         4.      Patients can be re-challenged (at a particular dose level) as many times as
needed in the Primary DE Phase only (re-challenge is not permitted in the Secondary DE
Phase), before being randomized or staying on their maximum tolerated dose by the end
of the 16-week Primary DE Phase.
         5.      Enrolled patients (i.e., those who can tolerate rhASM at 0.1 mg/kg) can
not be replaced if they cannot escalate up to a dose of 1.0 mg/kg and be randomized, or
                                                 92

cannot tolerate their target randomization dose (i.e., 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg rhASM). These
patients can continue in the protocol at their maximum tolerated dose.
[00240]     If an infusion is missed, the patient can receive the same dose as the previous
infusion. If the visit window of      5 days is exceeded, that infusion can not be done and
the patient should have his/her next infusion at the scheduled time for that infusion.
[00241]     For the purpose of this protocol, if any of the following criteria are met, the
results can be considered indicative of potential dose limiting toxicity (DLT) for rhASM
at a given dose:
           *     Any serious adverse event (SAE) judged by the physician to be related to
                 rhASM, or
           *     Total bilirubin remains > 2.0 mg/dL just prior to next dose, or
           *     Any adverse event (AE) that, in the opinion of the physician, raises
                 concern regarding the safety of rhASM at the administered dose.
[00242]     The severity of a related adverse event will be assessed by a physician. A
mild related adverse event is ususally transient and may require only minimal treatment
or therapeutic intervention. A moderate related adverse event is usually alleviated with
additional specific therapeutic intervention. This event interferes with usual activities of
daily living, causing discomfort, but poses no significant or permeanent risk of harm to
the subject. A severe advere event interrupts usual activities of daily living, or
significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.
[00243]     All patients who had doses escalated and safely tolerate 1.0 mg/kg rhASM by
Week 16 can be stratified by spleen volume (< 12 and > 12 MN) and randomized in a
1:1 ratio to either:
             *   Continue receiving 1.0 mg/kg rhASM (or maximum tolerated dose) every
                 2 weeks for 26 weeks or
             *   Continue dose escalation (DE) through 2.0 and 3.0 mg/kg and then
                 receive 3.0 mg/kg rhASM (or maximum tolerated dose) every 2 weeks
                 for 26 weeks.
[00244]     During the Secondary DE Phase, patients randomized to the 3.0 mg/kg group
can have only 4 weeks to escalate their rhASM dose to 3.0 mg/kg before starting the
26-week DM Phase at 3.0 mg/kg (or maximum tolerated dose; see Figure 7).
[00245]     The Primary DE Phase can range from approximately 6 to 16 weeks in
duration for each patient. This can depend on individual patient tolerability issues, if
                                               93

any, encountered by the patient during dose escalation of rhASM. During the Primary
DE Phase, each patient can have their dose of rhASM escalated every 2 weeks from 0.1
to 1.0 mg/kg (as indicated in Figure 7).
[00246]    The Primary DE Phase can be completed when a patient receives and tolerates
a dose of 1.0 mg/kg rhASM or reaches Week 16, which ever occurs first. If no criteria
leading to a dose re-challenge or a decrease in dose are met, a patient can receive a
single infusion of each dose (i.e., a total of 4 infusions of rhASM), resulting in a Primary
DE Phase of 6 weeks. However, if criteria leading to dose re-challenge or decrease in
dose are met the duration of the Primary DE Phase can be longer than 6 weeks, but will
not exceed 16 weeks.
[00247]    Patients who had doses escalated and safely tolerate 1.0 mg/kg by Week 16
can be assigned to 1 of 2 target dose groups (i.e., 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg rhASM).
[00248]    Patients randomized to 3.0 mg/kg rhASM can enter the Secondary DE Phase
(see Figure 7), consisting of 2 infusions: the first infusion (i.e., 2.0 mg/kg) being
2 weeks after the first tolerated dose of 1.0 mg/kg, and the second infusion (i.e.,
3.0 mg/kg or maximum tolerated dose) being 4 weeks after the first tolerated dose of
1.0 mg/kg. Therefore the Secondary DE Phase can be completed 4 weeks after the first
tolerated dose of 1.0 mg/kg. No re-challenge dose will be allowed. If the patient cannot
tolerate the first dose at 2.0 mg/kg, the second rhASM dose can be decreased to the
maximum tolerated dose (i.e., 1.0 mg/kg) or temporarily halted in the event of a
potential dose limiting toxicity (DLT).
[00249]    Patients can continue receiving rhASM at the maximum tolerated or
randomized dose administered IV every 2 weeks during the 26-week DM Phase of the
Primary Treatment Period. This can include both randomized and non-randomized
patients.
[00250]    As indicated in Figure 7, patients in the 1.0 mg/kg dose group can start the
DM Phase at their first dose of 1.0 mg/kg following randomization, whereas patients in
the 3.0 mg/kg group can start the DM Phase at their third dose of rhASM following
randomization. Subsequent rhASM doses can be administered IV every 2 weeks for
26 weeks in the DM Phase for all randomized patients.
[00251]    Non-randomized patients can start the DM Phase at their first dose of rhASM
2 weeks after their 16-week DE Phase. These patients can continue on their maximum
tolerated dose of rhASM (< 1.0 mg/kg) every 2 weeks for a total of 26 weeks.
                                               94

[00252]     If a randomized patient experiences a moderate/severe related AE (i.e., an
infusion associated reaction (IAR)) during the infusion in the DM Phase, the patient may
have the rhASM infusion stopped and restarted (i.e., interrupted) or the infusion rate
slowed down. Provided that a potential DLT has not occurred, the patient can continue
on this dose of rhASM for the remainder of the DM Phase.
[00253]     After all Week 26 protocol assessments have been completed, all patients
(including non-randomized patients) can enter the Long-Term Treatment period and
continue rhASM treatment (at the rhASM dose that was administered during the DM
Phase) IV every 2 weeks for at least 182 weeks [3.5 years] in duration or until
termination of the protocol. The Long-Term Treatment Period includes the Protocol
Completion (or patient withdrawal/discontinuation) visit and a safety follow-up phone
call (30 to 37 days after the last dose of rhASM). Individual patient doses of rhASM
may be adjusted in the Long-Term Treatment Period based on the results of the Primary
Treatment Period analyses. Any required dose escalation can occur as previously
described.
        9.3.      TREATMENT
[00254]     Patients will receive intravenous infusions of rhASM at 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 and
1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks during the Primary DE Phase. Patients randomized to
3.0 mg/kg rhASM will receive 2.0 mg/kg prior to receiving 3.0 mg/kg (or maximum
tolerated dose) 2 weeks later during the Secondary DE Phase. During the 26-week DM
Phase, patients will be administered 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg (or maximum tolerated dose)
rhASM every 2 weeks following the DE Phase. During the Long-Term Treatment
Period, the rhASM dose that was administered during the DM Phase will be
administered IV every 2 weeks.
[00255]     Patients will receive each intravenous infusion of rhASM over a period of
approximately 35 to 135 minutes (min) depending on the dose (see Table 9 below).
Protocol treatment (rhASM) will be infused using a standard programmable infusion
pump and a 0.22 micron, low protein-binding, in-line filter. To calculate the dose in
mg/kg, use actual weight for patients with body mass index (BMI) < 30 (weight in
kg)/(height in meters); for patients with BMI > 30, calculate the weight corresponding to
a BMI of 30 using the patient's height.
