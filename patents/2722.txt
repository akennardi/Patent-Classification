             INFLUENZA VIRUS MUTANTS AND USES THEREFOR
                      CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/501,034, filed June
24, 2011, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
                                          BACKGROUND
[0001]    Influenza is a leading cause of death among American adults. Each year, about 36,000
people die from influenza, and more than 200,000 people are hospitalized. Influenza is a highly
contagious disease that is spread by coughing, sneezing and through direct physical contact with
objects that carry the virus such as doorknobs and telephones. Symptoms of influenza include
fever, extreme fatigue, headache, chills and body aches; about 50 percent of infected people have
no symptoms but are still contagious. Immunization is 70-90 percent effective in preventing
influenza in healthy people under the age of 65, as long as the antigenicities of the circulating
virus strain match those of the vaccine.
[0002]    Vaccination is the main method for preventing influenza, and both live attenuated and
inactivated (killed) virus vaccines are currently available. Live virus vaccines, typically
administered intranasally, activate all phases of the immune system and can stimulate an immune
response to multiple viral antigens. Thus, the use of live viruses overcomes the problem of
destruction of viral antigens that may occur during preparation of inactivated viral vaccines. In
addition, the immunity produced by live virus vaccines is generally more durable, more
effective, and more cross-reactive than that induced by inactivated vaccines, and live virus
vaccines are less costly to produce than inactivated virus vaccines. However, the mutations in
attenuated virus are often ill-defined, and reversion is a concern.

                            BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0021]     FIGURE 1 is a graphic depicting the role of M2 ion channel in an influenza virus life
cycle, wherein (1) the influenza virus attaches to sialic acid receptors on a cell surface; (2) the
virus is internalized into the cell; (3) the M2 ion channel is expressed on the viral surface; (4) the
M2 ion channel opens to permit proton entry, leading to a release of viral RNA that enters the
nucleus, is replicated and results in viral protein synthesis; and (5) the viral components are
packaged into virions and released.
[0022]     FIGURE 2 is a schematic diagram of wild-type and mutant M2 genes. The M2 gene of
A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) M segment was deleted by insertion of two stop codons
downstream of the open reading frame of the M1 protein followed by deletion of 51 nucleotides
in the transmembrane domain to inhibit expression of full-length M2 protein.

[0078]     As used herein, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" designate both the singular and
the plural, unless expressly stated to designate the singular only.
[0079]     The term "about" and the use of ranges in general, whether or not qualified by the term
about, means that the number comprehended is not limited to the exact number set forth herein,
and is intended to refer to ranges substantially within the quoted range while not departing from
the scope of the invention. As used herein, "about" will be understood by persons of ordinary
skill in the art and will vary to some extent on the context in which it is used. If there are uses of
the term which are not clear to persons of ordinary skill in the art given the context in which it is
used, "about" will mean up to plus or minus 10% of the particular term.
[0080]     As used herein "subject" and "patient" are used interchangeably and refer to an animal,
for example, a member of any vertebrate species. The methods and compositions of the presently
disclosed subject matter are particularly useful for warm-blooded vertebrates including mammals
and birds. Exemplary subjects may include mammals such as humans, as well as mammals and
birds of importance due to being endangered, of economic importance (animals raised on farms
for consumption by humans) and/or of social importance (animals kept as pets or in zoos) to
humans. In some embodiments, the subject is a human. In some embodiments, the subject is not
human.
[0081]     As used herein, the terms "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" or
"pharmaceutically effective amount" refer to a quantity sufficient to achieve a desired
therapeutic and/or prophylactic effect, e.g., an amount which results in the prevention of, disease,
condition and/or symptom(s) thereof. In the context of therapeutic or prophylactic applications,
the amount of a composition administered to the subject will depend on the type and severity of
the disease and on the characteristics of the individual, such as general health, age, sex, body

      WO 2012/177924                                                           PCT/US2012/043606
Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, multiple therapeutic compositions or
compounds (e.g., immunogenic compositions, such as vaccines) are administered.
[0082]     As used herein, the terms "isolated" and/or "purified" refer to in vitro preparation,
isolation and/or purification of a nucleic acid (e.g., a vector or plasmid), polypeptide, virus or
cell such that it is not associated with unwanted in vivo substances, or is substantially purified
from unwanted in vivo substances with which it normally occurs. For example, in some
embodiments, an isolated virus preparation is obtained by in vitro culture and propagation, and is
substantially free from other infectious agents. As used herein, "substantially free" means below
the level of detection for a particular compound, such as unwanted nucleic acids, proteins, cells,
viruses, infectious agents, etc. using standard detection methods for that compound or agent.
[0083]     As used herein the term "recombinant virus" refers to a virus that has been manipulated
in vitro, e.g., using recombinant nucleic acid techniques, to introduce changes to the viral
genome and/or to introduce changes to the viral proteins. For example, in some embodiments,
recombinant viruses may include both wild-type, endogenous, nucleic acid sequences and mutant
and/or exogenous nucleic acid sequences. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments,
recombinant viruses may include modified protein components, such as mutant or variant matrix,
hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, non-structural and/or polymerase proteins.
[0084]     As used herein the term "recombinant cell" or "modified cell" refer to a cell that has
been manipulated in vitro, e.g., using recombinant nucleic acid techniques, to introduce nucleic
acid into the cell and/or to modify cellular nucleic acids. Examples of recombinant cells includes
prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells carrying exogenous plasmids, expression vectors and the like,
and/or cells which include modifications to their cellular nucleic acid (e.g., substitutions,
mutations, insertions, deletions, etc., into the cellular genome). An exemplary recombinant cell
is one which has been manipulated in vitro to express an exogenous protein, such as a viral M2
protein.
[0085]     As used herein the terms "mutant," "mutation," and "variant" are used interchangeably
and refer to a nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence which differs from a wild-type sequences. In
                                                   14

      WO 2012/177924                                                           PCT/US2012/043606
some embodiments, mutant or variant sequences are naturally occurring. In other embodiments,
mutant or variant sequence are recombinantly and/or chemically introduced. In some
embodiments, nucleic acid mutations include modifications (e.g., additions, deletions,
substitutions) to RNA and/or DNA sequences. In some embodiments, modifications include
chemical modification (e.g., methylation) and may also include the substitution or addition of
natural and/or non-natural nucleotides. Nucleic acid mutations may be silent mutations (e.g., one
or more nucleic acid changes which code for the same amino acid as the wild-type sequence) or
may result in a change in the encoded amino acid, result in a stop codon, or may introduce
splicing defects or splicing alterations. Nucleic acid mutations to coding sequences may also
result in conservative or non-conservative amino acid changes.
[0086]     As used herein, the term "vRNA" refers to the RNA comprising a viral genome,
including segmented or non-segmented viral genomes, as well as positive and negative strand
viral genomes. vRNA may be wholly endogenous and "wild-type" and/or may include
recombinant and/or mutant sequences.
[0087]     As used herein, the term "host cell" refers to a cell in which a pathogen, such as a virus,
can replicate. In some embodiments, host cells are in vitro, cultured cells (e.g., CHO cells, Vero
cells, MDCK cells, etc.) Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, host cells are in
vivo (e.g., cells of an infected vertebrate, such as an avian or mammal). In some embodiments,
the host cells may be modified, e.g., to enhance viral production such as by enhancing viral
infection of the host cell and/or by enhancing viral growth rate. By way of example, but not by
way of limitation, exemplary host cell modifications include recombinant expression of 2-6
linked sialic acid receptors on the cell surface of the host cell, and/or recombinant expression of
a protein in the host cells that has been rendered absent or ineffective in the pathogen or virus.
[0088]     As used herein, the term "infected" refers to harboring a disease or pathogen, such as a
virus. An infection can be intentional, such as by administration of a virus or pathogen (e.g., by
vaccination), or unintentional, such as by natural transfer of the pathogen from one organism to
another, or from a contaminated surface to the organism.

      WO 2012/177924                                                           PCT/US2012/043606
[0089]      As used herein, the term "attenuated," as used in conjunction with a virus, refers to a
virus having reduced virulence or pathogenicity as compared to a non-attenuated counterpart, yet
is still viable or live. Typically, attenuation renders an infectious agent, such as a virus, less
harmful or virulent to an infected subject compared to a non-attenuated virus. This is in contrast
to killed or completely inactivated virus.
[0090]      As used herein, the term "type" and "strain" as used in conjunction with a virus are
used interchangeably, and are used to generally refer to viruses having different characteristics.
For example, influenza A virus is a different type of virus than influenza B virus. Likewise,
influenza A HINI is a different type of virus than influenza A H2N1, H2N2 and H3N2.
Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, different types of virus such as influenza A
H2N1, H2N2 and H3N2 may be termed "subtypes."
[0091]      As used herein, "M2KO" or "M2KO(ATM)" refers to SEQ ID NO:1, a virus
comprising SEQ ID NO: 1, or a vaccine comprising a virus comprising SEQ ID NO: 1, depending
on the context in which it is used. For example, in describing mutations of the M2 gene
demonstrated herein, "M2KO" or "M2KO(ATM)" refers to SEQ ID NO: 1. When describing the
viral component of a vaccine, "M2KO" or "M2KO(ATM)" refers to a recombinant influenza
virus which possesses internal 6 genes of PR8 (nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase genes (PA, PB 1,
PB2), non-structural (NS), matrix (M)), but which does not express functional M2 protein.
When describing a vaccine, "M2KO" or "M2KO(ATM)" refers to a vaccine comprising the
M2KO(ATM) recombinant virus.
[0092]      As used herein, "M2KO(ATM) virus" encompasses a recombinant influenza virus
which possesses internal 6 genes of PR8 (nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase genes (PA, PB 1, PB2),
non-structural (NS), matrix (M)), but which does not express functional M2 protein, alone or in
combination with other viral components and/or genes encoding other viral components. In
some embodiments, the M2KO(ATM) virus comprises genes of other influenza viruses. In some
embodiments, the virus comprises the HA and NA genes of Influenza A/Brisbane/10/2007-like
A/Uruguay/716/2007(H3N2). In some embodiments, the M2KO(ATM) virus comprises the HA
                                                   16

      WO 2012/177924                                                        PCT/US2012/043606
and NA genes of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) virus. In some embodiments, the
M2KO(ATM) virus comprises the HA and NA genes of the A/Califomia/07/2009 (CA07)
(HlNlpdm) virus.
II.     Influenza A virus
A.      General
[0093]    Influenza is a leading cause of death among American adults. The causal agent of
influenza are viruses of the family orthomyxoviridae including influenza A virus, influenza B
virus and influenza C virus, with influenza A being the most common and most virulent in
humans.
[0094]    The influenza A virus is an enveloped, negative-strand RNA virus. The genome of
influenza A virus is contained on eight single (non-paired) RNA strands the complements of
which code for eleven proteins (HA, NA, NP, M1, M2, NS1, NEP, PA, PB1, PB1-F2, PB2). The
total genome size is about 14,000 bases. The segmented nature of the genome allows for the
exchange of entire genes between different viral strains during cellular cohabitation. The eight
RNA segments are as follows. 1) HA encodes hemagglutinin (about 500 molecules of
hemagglutinin are needed to make one virion); 2) NA encodes neuraminidase (about 100
molecules of neuraminidase are needed to make one virion); 3) NP encodes nucleoprotein; 4) M
encodes two proteins (the M1 and the M2) by using different reading frames from the same RNA
segment (about 3000 M1 molecules are needed to make one virion); 5) NS encodes two proteins
(NS 1 and NEP) by using different reading frames from the same RNA segment; 6) PA encodes
an RNA polymerase; 7) PB 1 encodes an RNA polymerase and PB 1-F2 protein (induces
apoptosis) by using different reading frames from the same RNA segment; 8) PB2 encodes an
RNA polymerase.
[0095]    There are several subtypes of influenza A, named according to an H number (for the
type of hemagglutinin) and an N number (for the type of neuraminidase). Currently, there are 16
different H antigens known (HI to H16) and nine different N antigens known (NI to N9). Each
                                                 17

      WO 2012/177924                                                          PCT/US2012/043606
virus subtype has mutated into a variety of strains with differing pathogenic profiles; some
pathogenic to one species but not others, some pathogenic to multiple species. Exemplary
Influenza A virus subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, include, but are not limited to
HINI which caused the "Spanish Flu" and the 2009 swine flu outbreak; H2N2 which caused the
"Asian Flu" in the late 1950s; H3N2 which caused the Hong Kong Flu in the late 1960s; H5N1,
considered a global influenza pandemic threat through its spread in the mid-2000s; H7N7; H1N2
which is currently endemic in humans and pigs; and H9N2, H7N2, H7N3, H5N2, H1ON7.
[0096]     Some influenza A variants are identified and named according to the known isolate to
which they are most similar, and thus are presumed to share lineage (e.g., Fujian flu virus-like);
according to their typical host (example Human flu virus); according to their subtype (example
H3N2); and according to their pathogenicity (example LP, Low Pathogenic). Thus, a flu from a
virus similar to the isolate A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) can be called Fujian flu, human flu, and
H3N2 flu.
[0097]     In addition, influenza variants are sometimes named according to the species (host) the
strain is endemic in or adapted to. The main variants named using this convention are: bird flu,
human flu, swine influenza, equine influenza and canine influenza. Variants have also been
named according to their pathogenicity in poultry, especially chickens, e.g., Low Pathogenic
Avian Influenza (LPAI) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).
B.       Life cycle and structure
[0098]     The life cycle of influenza viruses generally involves attachment to cell surface
receptors, entry into the cell and uncoating of the viral nucleic acid, followed by replication of
the viral genes inside the cell. After the synthesis of new copies of viral proteins and genes, these
components assemble into progeny virus particles, which then exit the cell. Different viral
proteins play a role in each of these steps.
[0099]     The influenza A particle is made up of a lipid envelope which encapsulates the viral
core. The inner side of the envelope is lined by the matrix protein (M1), while the outer surface
                                                   18

      WO 2012/177924                                                         PCT/US2012/043606
is characterized by two types of glycoprotein spikes: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase
(NA). M2, a transmembrane ion channel protein, is also part of the lipid envelope. See e.g.,
Figure 1.
[0100]    The HA protein, a trimeric type I membrane protein, is responsible for binding to
sialyloligosaccharides (oligosaccharides containing terminal sialic acid linked to galactose) on
host cell surface glycoproteins or glycolipids. This protein is also responsible for fusion between
viral and host cell membranes, following virion internalization by endocytosis.
[0101]    Neuraminidase (NA), a tetrameric type II membrane protein, is a sialidase that cleaves
terminal sialic acid residues from the glycoconjugates of host cells and the HA and NA, and thus
is recognized as receptor-destroying enzyme. This sialidase activity is necessary for efficient
release of progeny virions from the host cell surface, as well as prevention of progeny
aggregation due to the binding activity of viral HAs with other glycoproteins. Thus, the
receptor-binding activity of the HA and the receptor-destroying activity of the NA likely act as
counterbalances, allowing efficient replication of influenza.
[0102]    The genome segments are packaged into the core of the viral particle. The RNP (RNA
plus nucleoprotein, NP) is in helical form with three viral polymerase polypeptides associated
with each segment.
[0103]    The influenza virus life cycle begins with binding of the HA to sialic acid-containing
receptors on the surface of the host cell, followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Figure 1.
The low pH in late endosomes triggers a conformational shift in the HA, thereby exposing the N
terminus of the HA2 subunit (the so-called fusion peptide). The fusion peptide initiates the
fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane, and the matrix protein (M1) and RNP complexes
are released into the cytoplasm. RNPs consist of the nucleoprotein (NP), which encapsidates
vRNA, and the viral polymerase complex, which is formed by the PA, PB 1, and PB2 proteins.
RNPs are transported into the nucleus, where transcription and replication take place. The RNA
polymerase complex catalyzes three different reactions: (1) synthesis of an mRNA with a 5' cap
and 3' polyA structure, (2) a full-length complementary RNA (cRNA), and (3) genomic vRNA
                                                  19

      WO 2012/177924                                                           PCT/US2012/043606
using the cDNA as a template. Newly synthesized vRNAs, NP, and polymerase proteins are
then assembled into RNPs, exported from the nucleus, and transported to the plasma membrane,
where budding of progeny virus particles occurs. The neuramimidase (NA) protein plays a role
late in infection by removing sialic acid from sialyloligosaccharides, thus releasing newly
assembled virions from the cell surface and preventing the self aggregation of virus particles.
Although virus assembly involves protein-protein and protein-vRNA interactions, the nature of
these interactions remains largely unknown.
C.       Role of the M2 protein
[0104]     As described above, spanning the viral membrane are three proteins: hemagglutinin
(HA), neuramimidase (NA), and M2. The extracellular domains (ectodomains) of HA and NA
are quite variable, while the ectodomain domain of M2 is essentially invariant among influenza
A viruses. Without wishing to be bound by theory, in influenza A viruses, the M2 protein which
possesses ion channel activity, is thought to function at an early state in the viral life cycle
between host cell penetration and uncoating of viral RNA. Once virions have undergone
endocytosis, the virion-associated M2 ion channel, a homotetrameric helix bundle, is believed to
permit protons to flow from the endosome into the virion interior to disrupt acid-labile M1
protein-ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) interactions, thereby promoting RNP release into the
cytoplasm. In addition, among some influenza strains whose HAs are cleaved intracellularly
(e.g., A/fowl plagues/Rostock/34), the M2 ion channel is thought to raise the pH of the trans
Golgi network, preventing conformational changes in the HA due to conditions of low pH in this
compartment. It was also shown that the M2 transmembrane domain itself can function as an ion
channel. M2 protein ion channel activity is thought to be essential in the life cycle of influenza
viruses, because amantadine hydrochloride, which blocks M2 ion channel activity, has been
shown to inhibit viral replication. However, a requirement for this activity in the replication of
influenza A viruses has not been directly demonstrated. The structure of the M2 protein is
shown in Figure 2. The nucleic acid sequence of the M2 protein, along with the M1 sequence, is
shown in Figure 3.
                                                 20

     WO 2012/177924                                                          PCT/US2012/043606
[0105]    Although influenza B and C viruses are structurally and functionally similar to
influenza A virus, there are some differences. For example, influenza B virus does not have an
M2 protein with ion channel activity. Instead, the NB protein, a product of the NA gene, likely
has ion channel activity and thus a similar function to the influenza A virus M2 protein.
Similarly, influenza C virus does not have an M2 protein with ion channel activity. However, the
CM 1 protein of the influenza C virus is likely to have this activity.
III.    M2 viral mutants
[0106]    In one aspect, influenza A viruses harboring a mutant M2 vRNA sequence are
disclosed. Typically, such mutants do not have M2 ion channel activity, exhibit attenuated
growth properties in vivo, cannot produce infectious progeny and are non-pathogenic or show
reduced pathogenesis in infected subjects. The mutant viruses are immunogenic, and when used
as a vaccine, provide protection against infection with a counterpart wild-type and/or other
pathogenic virus. Additionally, the M2 mutants disclosed herein are stable, and do not mutate to
express a functional M2 polypeptide, regardless of the host cell used. Additionally or
alternatively, in some embodiments, the M1 protein of these mutants is produced without
detectable alteration to its function. In some embodiments, viruses harboring the mutant M2
nucleic acid sequences can not replicate in a host cell in which a corresponding wild-type virus
could be propagated. By way of example, but not by way of limitation, in some embodiments,
the wild-type virus can be grown, propagated and replicate in culturing MDCK cells, CHO cells
and/or Vero cells, while the corresponding virus harboring a mutant M2 sequence cannot grow,
replicate or be propagated in the same type of cells.
[0107]    As noted above, in some embodiments, the M2 mutant virus is stable, and does not
mutate or revert to wild-type or to a non-wild-type sequence encoding a functional M2 protein in
a host cell. For example, in some embodiments, the M2 mutant virus is stable for 2 passages, 3
passages, 5 passages, 10 passages, 12 passages, 15 passages, 20 passages, 25 passages or more
than 25 passages in a host cell. In some embodiments, the host cell is an unmodified host cell.
                                                  21

      WO 2012/177924                                                       PCT/US2012/043606
In other embodiments, the host cell is a modified host cell, such as a MDCK cell which
expresses the M2 protein.
 [0108]    In some embodiments, the M2 mutants include one or more nucleic acid substitutions
and/or deletions. In some embodiments, the mutations are localized in nucleic acids which code
for one or more of the extracellular domain of the M2 protein, the transmembrane domain of the
M2 proteins and/or the cytoplasmic tail of the M2 protein. Additionally or alternatively, in some
embodiments, one or more nucleic acid mutations results in a splice variant, one or more stop
codons and/or one or more amino acid deletions of the M2 peptide In some embodiments,
viruses carrying the mutant M2 nucleic acid produce a non-functional M2 polypeptide. In some
embodiments, viruses carrying the mutant M2 nucleic acid do not produce an M2 polypeptide.
In some embodiments, viruses carrying the mutant M2 nucleic acid produce a truncated M2
polypeptide. In some embodiments, truncated M2 polypeptide has the amino acid sequence
MSLLTEVETPIRNEWGCRCNGSSD.
[0109]    Three exemplary, non-limiting M2 viral mutants (M2-1, M2-2 and M2-3) are provided
below in Tables 1-3. In the tables, lower case letters correspond to the M2 sequence; upper case

[0112]    No M2 polypeptide sequence is produced from this mutant.
[0113]    Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, M2 mutations are introduced into
the cytoplasmic tail. Figure 2. The M2 protein cytoplasmic tail is a mediator of infectious virus
production. In some embodiments, truncations of the M2 cytoplasmic tail result in a decrease in
infectious virus titers, a reduction in the amount of packaged viral RNA, a decrease in budding
events, and a reduction in budding efficiency. It has been shown that the 5' sequence is more
important than 3' sequence for genome packaging, and that a longer 5' sequence is better for
genome packaging. In addition, studies have shown that nucleotide length is important, but the
actual sequence is less so (random sequences are sufficient to generate viruses). Stable M2
cytoplasmic tail mutants have been challenging to develop, and the literature includes numerous
examples of mutant reversion.
[0114]    For example, Pekosz et a JVI, 2005; 79(6): 3595-3605, replaced two codons with stop
codons at amino acid position 70, but the virus soon reverted. Another exemplary M2
cytoplasmic tail mutation is termed M2del 11. In the M2del 11 mutant, 11 amino acid residues
are deleted from carboxyl end of cytoplasmic tail. This truncation is due to the introduction of
                                                  24

     WO 2012/177924                                                          PCT/US2012/043606
two stop codons, and a full length M2 polypeptide is not made. While this mutant is stable when
passaged in M2 expressing MDCK cells (M2CK), it reverts to full length M2 during passaging in
normal MDCK cells (J Virol. 2008 82(5):2486-92). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is
likely that reversion occurs with selective pressure in the MDCK cells.
[0115]    Another M2 cytoplasmic tail mutant, M2Stop9Oala78-81 did not reduce virus titer but
ala70-77 did (JVI 2006; 80 (16) p8178-8189). Alanine-scanning experiments further indicated
that amino acids at positions 74 to 79 of the M2 tail play a role in virion morphogenesis and
affect viral infectivity. (J Virol. 2006 80(11):5233-40.)
[0116]    Accordingly, presented herein are novel cytoplasmic mutants, with characteristics
different than those described above. For example, in some embodiments, the cytoplasmic
mutants are stable (do not revert to express a full-length M2 polypeptide) in MDCK cells. In
some embodiments, the cytoplasmic mutants are stable for 2 passages, 3 passages, 5 passages, 10
passages, 15 passages, 20 passages, 25 passages or more than 25 passages in a host cell.
[0117]    The wild-type M2 polypeptide is shown below in Table 4. For each of the sequences,
the bold text indicates the transmembrane domain. The extracellular domain is first (left),
followed by the transmembrane domain (center) and the cytoplasmic tail sequence (right).

[0118]    M2-4 (M2del FG#1) was generated but was not passagable in normal MDCK cells, but
may be passagable in a modified host cell (e.g., a cell expressing a wild-type M2 polypeptide).
M2-5 (M2del FG#2) and M2-6 (FG#3) were generated and passaged in normal MDCK cells.
The nucleotide sequence of the M gene of these viruses are stable at least to passage 10 in
MDCK cells. These mutants could be propagated and passaged in other cells as well (e.g., cells
that support influenza replication). It was also found that these mutants are not attenuated and
are pathogenic.
[0119]    As described in the Examples below, the M2 mutant viruses described herein do not
replicate in the respiratory tract or disseminate to other organs in the ferret model and are not
transmitted in the ferret model. Vaccines comprising M2 mutant elicit robust immune responses
in mammals and protect mammals against influenza virus challenge. M2KO virus elicits both
humoral and mucosal immune responses in mice, and protects mice from lethal homosubtypic
and heterosubtypic challenge. Vaccines comprising M2 mutant virus as described herein provide
effective protection against influenza challenge and have the advantage of being attenuated in
mammalian hosts. These findings demonstrate that the M2 mutant viruses described herein are
useful for vaccines against influenza.
IV.     Cell-based virus production system
A.      Producing "first generation" mutant viruses
[0120]    Mutant virus, such as those carrying mutant M2 nucleic acid, can be generated by
plasmid-based reverse genetics as described by Neumann et al., Generation of influenza A
viruses entirelyfrom clone cDNAs, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:9345-9350 (1999), herein
incorporated by reference in its entirety. Briefly, eukaryotic host cells are transfected with one
                                                   26

      WO 2012/177924                                                            PCT/US2012/043606
 or more plasmids encoding the eight viral RNAs. Each viral RNA sequence is flanked by an
 RNA polymerase I promoter and an RNA polymerase I terminator. Notably, the viral RNA
 encoding the M2 protein includes the mutant M2 nucleic acid sequence. The host cell is
 additionally transfected with one or more expression plasmids encoding the viral proteins (e.g.,
 polymerases, nucleoproteins and structural proteins), including a wild-type M2 protein.
 Transfection of the host cell with the viral RNA plasmids results in the synthesis of all eight
 influenza viral RNAs, one of which harbors the mutant M2 sequence. The co-transfected viral
 polymerases and nucleoproteins assemble the viral RNAs into functional vRNPs that are
 replicated and transcribed, ultimately forming infectious influenza virus having a mutant M2
 nucleic acid sequence, yet having a functional M2 polypeptide incorporated into the viral lipid
 envelope.
 [0121]     Alternative methods of producing a "first generation" mutant virus include a
 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) transfection system that allows the replacement of influenza virus
 genes with in vitro generated recombinant RNA molecules, as described by Enami and Palese,
 High-efficiencyformation of influenza virus transfectants, J. Virol. 65(5):2711-2713, which is
 incorporated herein by reference.
 [0122]     The viral RNA is synthesized in vitro and the RNA transcripts are coated with viral
 nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerase proteins that act as biologically active RNPs in the
 transfected cell as demonstrated by Luytjes et al., Amph'fication, expression, andpackagingof a
foreign gene by influenza virus, Cell 59:1107-1113, which is incorporated herein by reference.
 [0123]     The RNP transfection method can be divided into four steps: 1) Preparation of RNA:
 plasmid DNA coding for an influenza virus segment is transcribed into negative-sense RNA in
 an in vitro transcription reaction; 2) Encapsidation of the RNA: the transcribed RNA is then
 mixed with gradient purified NP and polymerase proteins isolated from disrupted influenza virus
 to form a biologically active RNP complex; 3) Transfection and rescue of the encapsidated RNA:
 the artificial ribonucleocapsid is transfected to the cells previously infected with a helper
 influenza virus that contains a different gene from the one being rescued; the helper virus will
                                                    27

      WO 2012/177924                                                          PCT/US2012/043606
amplify the transfected RNA; 4) Selection of transfected gene: because both the helper virus and
the transfectant containing the rescued gene are in the culture supernatant, an appropriate
selection system using antibodies is necessary to isolate the virus bearing the transfected gene.
[0124]    The selection system allows for the generation of novel transfectant influenza viruses
with specific biological and molecular characteristics. Antibody selection against a target
surface protein can then be used for positive or negative selection.
[0125]    For example, a transfectant or mutant virus that contains an M2 gene that does not
express an M2 protein can be grown in a suitable mammalian cell line that has been modified to
stably express the wild-type functional M2 protein. To prevent or inhibit replication of the
helper virus expressing the wild-type M2 gene, and therefore the M2e protein at the membrane
surface, antibodies against M2e can be used. Such antibodies are commercially available and
would inhibit the replication of the helper virus and allow for the transfectant/mutant virus
containing the mutant M2 to grow and be enriched in the supernatant. Inhibition of influenza
virus replication by M2e antibodies has been described previously in Influenza A virus M2
protein: monoclonal antibody restrictionof virus growth and detection ofM2 in virions, J Virol
62:2762-2772 (1988) and Treanor et al, Passively transferredmonoclonal antibody to the M2
protein inhibits influenza A virus replication in mice, J. Virol. 64:1375-1377 (1990).
[0126]    Additionally or alternatively, the same antibodies can be used to 'capture' the helper
virus and allow for the enrichment of the transfectant. For example, the antibodies can be used
to coat the bottom of a tissue culture dish or can be used in a column matrix to allow for
enrichment for the transfectant in the supernatant or eluate.
[0127]    The transfectant virus can be grown in M2 expressing cells in multi-well plates by limit
dilution and then be identified and cloned, for example, by creating replica plates. For example,
one-half of an aliquot of a given well of the multi-well plate containing the grown virus can be
used to infect MDCK cells and the other half to infect MDCK cells that express M2 protein.
Both the transfectant virus and helper virus will grow in MDCK cells that express M2 protein.
However, only helper virus will grow in standard MDCK cells allowing for identifying the well
                                                  28

      WO 2012/177924                                                           PCT/US2012/043606
in the multi-well plate that contains the transfectant. The transfectant virus can be further plaque
purified in the cells that express M2 protein.
B.      Propagating viral mutants
[0128]    In some embodiments, viral mutants described herein are maintained and passaged in
host cells. By way of example, but not by way of limitation, exemplary host cells appropriate for
growth of influenza viral mutants, such as influenza A viral mutants include any number of
eukaryotic cells, including, but not limited to Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK cells),
simian cells such as African green monkey cells (e.g., Vero cells), CV-1 cells and rhesus monkey
kidney cells (e.g., LLcomk.2 cells), bovine cells (e.g., MDBK cells), swine cells, ferret cells
(e.g., mink lung cells) BK-I cells, rodent cells (e.g., Chinese Hamster Ovary cells), human cells,
e.g., embryonic human retinal cells (e.g., PER-C6*), 293T human embryonic kidney cells and
avian cells including embryonic fibroblasts.
[0129]    Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the eukaryotic host cell is modified
to enhance viral production, e.g., by enhancing viral infection of the host cell and/or by
enhancing viral growth rate. For example, in some embodiments, the host cell is modified to
express, or to have increased expression, of 2,6-linked sialic acid on the cell surface, allowing for
more efficient and effective infection of these cells by mutant or wild-type influenza A viruses.
See e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2010-0021499, and U.S. Patent No. 7,176,021, herein
incorporated by reference in their entirety. Thus, in some illustrative embodiments, Chinese
Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO cells) and/or Vero cells modified to express at least one copy of a
2,6-sialyltransferase gene (ST6GAL 1) are used. By way of example, but not by way of
limitation, the Homo sapiens ST6 beta-galatosamide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase gene sequence
denoted by the accession number BC040009. 1, is one example of a ST6Gal gene that can be
integrated into and expressed by a CHO cell. One or more copies of a polynucleotide that
encodes a functional ST6Gal I gene product can be engineered into a cell. That is, cells which
have been stably transformed to express 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or more than 12 copies
of a ST6Gal I gene may be used. A single expression cassette may include one or more copies of
                                                  29

      WO 2012/177924                                                            PCT/US2012/043606
the ST6Gal I gene to be expressed, which is operably linked to regulatory elements, such as
promoters, enhancers, and terminator and polyadenylation signal sequences, to facilitate the
expression of the ST6Gal I gene or its copies. Alternatively, a single expression cassette may be
engineered to express one copy of an ST6Gal I gene, and multiple expression cassettes integrated
into a host cell genome. Accordingly, in some embodiments, at least one ST6Gal I gene is
incorporated into the genome of a host cell, such that the cell expresses the ST6Gal I gene and its
enzymatic protein product. Depending on the copy number, a single host cell may express many
functional ST6Gal I gene proteins.
[0130]     Suitable vectors for cloning, transfecting and producing stable, modified cell lines are
well known in the art. One non-limiting example includes the pcDNA3.1 vectors (Invitrogen).
[0131]     Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the eukaryotic host cell is modified
to produce a wild-type version of a mutant viral gene, thereby providing the gene to the virus in
trans. For example, a viral strain harboring a mutant M2 protein may exhibit an enhanced
growth rate (e.g., greater viral production) when passaged in host cells producing the wild-type
M2 protein. In some embodiments, the a viral strain harboring a mutant M2 protein may not
grow or replicate in a cell which does not express a wild-type M2 gene. In addition, such host
cells may slow or prevent viral reversion to a functional M2 sequence, because, for example,
there is no selective pressure for reversion in such a host.
[0132]     Method for producing both expression vectors and modified host cells are well known
in the art. For example, an M2 expression vector can be made by positioning the M2 nucleic
acid sequence (M2 ORF sequence; this is "wild-type" M2's start codon to stop codon (Table 5))
below in a eukaryotic expression vector.

[0133]     Host cells (e.g., MDCK cells) can then be transfected by methods known in the art, e.g.,
using commercially available reagents and kits, such as TransIT® LTI (Mirus Bio, Madison,
WI). By way of example, but not by way of limitation, cells can be selected and tested for M2
expression by cotransfection with a detectable marker or a selectable marker (e.g., hygromycin
resistance) and/or by screening, for example, with indirect irmunostaining using an M2
anti body. M2 expression can be determined by indirect immunostaining, flow cytometry or
ELISA.
[0134]     Byway of example, but not by way of limitation, 293T human embryonic kidney cells
and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and in minimal essential medium (MEM)
containing 5% newborn calf serum, respectively. All cells were maintained at 37 0 C in 5% Co 2 .
Hygromycin-resistant MDCK cells stably expressing M2 protein from A/Puerto Rico/8/34
(HINI) were established by cotransfection with plasmid pRHyg, containing the hygromycin
resistance gene, and plasmid pCAGGS/M2, expressing the full-length M2 protein, at a ratio of
1:1. The stable MDCK cell clone (M2CK) expressing M2 was selected in medium containing
0.15 mg/mL of hygromycin (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) by screening with indirect
immunostaining using an anti-M2 (14C2) monoclonal antibody (Iwatsuki et al.,. VI, 2006,
vol.80, No.1, p.5233~5240). The M2CK cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum and 0.15 mg/mL of hygromycin. In M2CK cells, the expression levels and
localization of M2 were similar to those in virus-infected cells (data not shown). M2 expressing
Vero cells can be made in a similar fashion.
[0135]     In some embodiments, cells and viral mutants are cultured and propagated by methods
well known in the art. By way of example, but not by way of limitation, in some embodiments,
host cells are grown in the presence of MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells
expressing M2 are infected at an MOI of 0.001 by washing with PBS followed by adsorbing

the cells are incubated for 2-3 days until cytopathic effect is observed.
[0136]    Along these lines, disposable bioreactor systems have been developed for mammalian
cells, with or without virus, whose benefits include faster facility setup and reduced risk of cross
contamination. The cells described herein, for instance, can be cultured in disposable bags such
as those from Stedim, Bioeaze bags from SAFC Biosciences, HybridBagTM from Cellexus
Biosytems, or single use bioreactors from HyClone or Celltainer from Lonza. Bioreactors can
be 1 L, 10 L, 50 L, 250 L, 1000 L size formats. In some embodiments, the cells are maintained
in suspension in optimized serum free medium, free of animal products. The system can be a
fed-batch system where a culture can be expanded in a single bag from 1 L to 10 L for example,
or a perfusion system that allows for the constant supply of nutrients while simultaneously
avoiding the accumulation of potentially toxic by-products in the culture medium.
[0137]    For long term storage, mutant virus can be stored as frozen stocks.
V.      Vaccines and method of administration
A.      Immunogenic compositions / vaccines
[0138]    There are various different types of vaccines which can be made from the cell-based
virus production system disclosed herein. The present disclosure includes, but is not limited to,
the manufacture and production of live attenuated virus vaccines, inactivated virus vaccines,
whole virus vaccines, split virus vaccines, virosomal virus vaccines, viral surface antigen
vaccines and combinations thereof. Thus, there are numerous vaccines capable of producing a
protective immune response specific for different influenza viruses where appropriate
formulations of any of these vaccine types are capable of producing an immune response, e.g., a
systemic immune response. Live attenuated virus vaccines have the advantage of being also able
to stimulate local mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract.
[0139]    In some embodiments, vaccine antigens used in the compositions described herein are
"direct" antigens, i.e. they are not administered as DNA, but are the antigens themselves. Such
                                                  32

      WO 2012/177924                                                          PCT/US2012/043606
vaccines may include a whole virus or only part of the virus, such as, but not limited to viral
polysaccharides, whether they are alone or conjugated to carrier elements, such as carrier
proteins, live attenuated whole microorganisms, inactivated microorganisms, recombinant
peptides and proteins, glycoproteins, glycolipids, lipopeptides, synthetic peptides, or ruptured
microorganisms in the case of vaccines referred to as "split" vaccines.
[0140]    In some embodiments a complete virion vaccine is provided. A complete virion vaccine
can be concentrated by ultrafiltration and then purified by zonal centrifugation or by
chromatography. Typically, the virion is inactivated before or after purification using formalin or
beta-propiolactone, for instance.
[0141]    In some embodiments, a subunit vaccine is provided, which comprises purified
glycoproteins. Such a vaccine may be prepared as follows: using viral suspensions fragmented
by treatment with detergent, the surface antigens are purified, by ultracentrifugation for example.
The subunit vaccines thus contain mainly HA protein, and also NA. The detergent used may be
cationic detergent for example, such as hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, an anionic
detergent such as ammonium deoxycholate; or a nonionic detergent such as that commercialized
under the name TRITON X100. The hemagglutinin may also be isolated after treatment of the
virions with a protease such as bromelin, then purified by standard methods.
[0142]    In some embodiments, a split vaccine is provided, which comprises virions which have
been subjected to treatment with agents that dissolve lipids. A split vaccine can be prepared as
follows: an aqueous suspension of the purified virus obtained as above, inactivated or not, is
treated, under stirring, by lipid solvents such as ethyl ether or chloroform, associated with
detergents. The dissolution of the viral envelope lipids results in fragmentation of the viral
particles. The aqueous phase is recuperated containing the split vaccine, constituted mainly of
hemagglutinin and neuraminidase with their original lipid environment removed, and the core or
its degradation products. Then the residual infectious particles are inactivated if this has not
already been done.

      WO 2012/177924                                                          PCT/US2012/043606
[0143]    In some embodiments, inactivated influenza virus vaccines are provided. In some
embodiments, the inactivated vaccines are made by inactivating the virus using known methods,
such as, but not limited to, formalin or B-propiolactone treatment. Inactivated vaccine types that
can be used in the invention can include whole-virus (WV) vaccines or subvirion (SV) (split)
vaccines. The WV vaccine contains intact, inactivated virus, while the SV vaccine contains
purified virus disrupted with detergents that solubilize the lipid-containing viral envelope,
followed by chemical inactivation of residual virus.
[0144]    Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, live attenuated influenza virus
vaccines are provided. Such vaccines can be used for preventing or treating influenza virus
infection, according to known method steps.
[0145]    In some embodiments, attenuation is achieved in a single step by transfer of attenuated
genes from an attenuated donor virus to an isolate or reassorted virus according to known
methods (see, e.g., Murphy, Infect. Dis. Clin. Pract. 2, 174 (1993)). In some embodiments, a
virus is attenuated by mutation of one or more viral nucleic acid sequences, resulting in a mutant
virus. For example, in some embodiments, the mutant viral nucleic acid sequence codes for a
defective protein product. In some embodiments, the protein product has diminished function or
no function. In other embodiments, no protein product is produced from the mutant viral nucleic
acid.
[0146]    The virus can thus be attenuated or inactivated, formulated and administered, according
to known methods, as an immunogenic composition (e.g., as a vaccine) to induce an immune
response in an animal, e.g., an avian and/or a mammal. Methods are well-known in the art for
determining whether such attenuated or inactivated vaccines have maintained similar antigenicity
to that of the clinical isolate or a high growth strain derived therefrom. Such known methods
include the use of antisera or antibodies to eliminate viruses expressing antigenic determinants of
the donor virus; chemical selection (e.g., amantadine or rimantidine); HA and NA activity and
inhibition; and DNA screening (such as probe hybridization or PCR) to confirm that donor genes
encoding the antigenic determinants (e.g., HA or NA genes) or other mutant sequences (e.g.,
                                                   34

      WO 2012/177924                                                         PCT/US2012/043606
M2) are not present in the attenuated viruses. See, e.g., Robertson et al., Giomale di Igiene e
Medicina Preventiva, 29, 4 (1988); Kilbourne, Bull. M2 World Health Org., 41, 643 (1969); and
Robertson et al., Biologicals, 20, 213 (1992).
[0147]    In some embodiments, the vaccine includes an attenuated influenza virus that lacks
expression of a functional M2 protein. In some embodiments, the mutant virus replicates well in
cells expressing M2 proteins, but in the corresponding wild-type cells, expresses viral proteins
without generating infectious progeny virions.
[0148]    Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, suitable for intradermal
administration, inoculation or for parenteral or oral administration, comprise attenuated or
inactivated influenza viruses, and may optionally further comprising sterile aqueous or non
aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. The compositions can further comprise auxiliary
agents or excipients, as known in the art. See, e.g., Berkow et al., The Merck Manual, 15th
edition, Merck and Co., Rahway, N.J. (1987); Goodman et al., eds., Goodman and Gilman's The
Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Eighth Edition, Pergamon Press, Inc., Elmsford, N.Y.
(1990); Avery's Drug Treatment: Principles and Practice of Clinical Pharmacology and
Therapeutics, Third Edition, ADIS Press, LTD., Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, Md. (1987);
and Katzung, ed., Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, Fifth Edition, Appleton and Lange,
Norwalk, Conn. (1992).
[0149]    In some embodiments, preparations for parenteral administration include sterile
aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and/or emulsions, which may contain auxiliary
agents or excipients known in the art. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol,
polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl
oleate. Carriers or occlusive dressings can be used to increase skin permeability and enhance
antigen absorption. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration may generally comprise a
liposome solution containing the liquid dosage form. Suitable forms for suspending liposomes
include emulsions, suspensions, solutions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly
used in the art, such as purified water. Besides the inert diluents, such compositions can also

      WO 2012/177924                                                           PCT/US2012/043606
include adjuvants, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, or sweetening, flavoring,
or perfuming agents.
[0150]     When a composition of the present invention is used for administration to an individual,
it can further comprise salts, buffers, adjuvants, or other substances which are desirable for
improving the efficacy of the composition. For vaccines, adjuvants, substances that augment a
specific immune response, can be used. Normally, the adjuvant and the composition are mixed
prior to presentation to the immune system, or presented separately, but into the same site of the
organism being immunized.
[0151]     In some embodiments, the immunogenic compositions (e.g., vaccines) disclosed herein
include multiple, different types of virus or viral antigens, at least one of which includes a mutant
M2 gene (e.g., a virus comprising the M2KO(ATM) (SEQ ID NO: 1) mutation), and/or a
corresponding mutation in the M2 functional equivalent of that virus (e.g., the NB protein of
influenza B, or the CM1 protein of influenza C). In other embodiments, the immunogenic
compositions include a single type of virus or viral antigen which includes a mutant M2 gene
(e.g., a virus comprising the M2KO(ATM) (SEQ ID NO: 1) mutation) and/or a corresponding
mutation in the M2 functional equivalent of that virus (e.g., the NB protein of influenza B, or the
CM1 protein of influenza C). For example, in some embodiments, the main constituent of an
immunogenic compositions such as a vaccine composition includes one or more influenza
viruses of type A, B or C, or any combination thereof or any combination of antigens from these
viruses, wherein at least one virus includes a mutant M2 gene (e.g., a virus comprising the
M2KO(ATM) (SEQ ID NO: 1) mutation) and/or a corresponding mutation in the M2 functional
equivalent of that virus (e.g., the NB protein of influenza B, or the CM1 protein of influenza
C)For example, in some embodiments, at least two of the three types, at least two of different
subtypes, at least two of the same type, at least two of the same subtype, or a different isolate(s)
or reassortant(s) are provided in an immunogenic composition (e.g., a vaccine). By way of
example, but not by way of limitation, human influenza virus type A includes HINI, H2N2 and
H3N2 subtypes. In some embodiments, the immunogenic compositions (e.g., vaccines) include
a virus comprising a mutant M2 gene (e.g., a virus comprising the M2KO(ATM) (SEQ ID NO: 1)

      WO 2012/177924                                                          PCT/US2012/043606
mutation) and/or a corresponding mutation in the M2 functional equivalent of that virus (e.g., the
NB protein of influenza B, or the CM1 protein of influenza C) and about 0.1 to 200 gg, e.g., 10
to 15 gg of hemagglutinin from each of the strains entering into the composition. Heterogeneity
in a vaccine may be provided by mixing replicated influenza viruses for at least two influenza
virus strains, such as from 2-50 strains, or any range or value therein. In some embodiments,
influenza A or B virus strains having a modem antigenic composition are used. In addition,
immunogenic compositions (e.g., vaccines) can be provided for variations in a single strain of an
influenza virus, using techniques known in the art.
[0152]    In some embodiments, the vaccine comprises a virus comprising the M2KO(ATM)
(SEQ ID NO: 1) mutation together with other viral components and/or genes expressing other
viral components. In some embodiments, the vaccine (e.g., a virus comprising the M2KO(ATM)
(SEQ ID NO: 1) mutation) comprises genes from other viral strains, including but not limited to,
for example, HA and NA genes from other viral strains. In some embodiments, the vaccine
comprises HA and NA genes from human influenza virus type A subtypes H5N1, HiNi, H2N2
or H3N2. In some embodiments, the vaccine comprises HA and NA genes from, for example,
PR8xBrisbane/10/2007, A/Vietnam/1203/2004, or A/Califomia/07/2009 (CA07) viruses.
[0153]    A pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may further or
additionally comprise at least one chemotherapeutic compound, e.g., for gene therapy, an
immunosuppressant, an anti-inflammatory agent or an immunostimulatory agent, or anti-viral
agents including, but not limited to, gamma globulin, amantadine, guanidine,
hydroxybenzimidazole, interferon-a, interferon-,     interferon-y, tumor necrosis factor-a,
thiosemicarbarzones, methisazone, rifampin, ribavirin, a pyrimidine analog, a purine analog,
foscamet, phosphonoacetic acid, acyclovir, dideoxynucleosides, a protease inhibitor, or
ganciclovir.
[0154]    The composition can also contain variable but small quantities of endotoxin-free
formaldehyde, and preservatives, which have been found safe and not contributing to undesirable
effects in the organism to which the composition of the invention is administered.
                                                  37

       WO 2012/177924                                                            PCT/US2012/043606
B.       Administration
[0155]    An immunogenic composition (e.g., vaccine) as disclosed herein may be administered
via any of the routes conventionally used or recommended for vaccines: parenteral route,
mucosal route, and may be in various forms: injectable or sprayable liquid, formulation which
has been freeze-dried or dried by atomization or air-dried, etc. Vaccines may be administered by
means of a syringe or by means of a needle-free injector for intramuscular, subcutaneous or
intradermal injection. Vaccines may also be administered by means of a nebulizer capable of
delivering a dry powder or a liquid spray to the mucous membranes, whether they are nasal,
pulmonary, vaginal or rectal.
[0156]    A vaccine as disclosed herein may confer resistance to one or more influenza strains by
either passive immunization or active immunization. In active immunization, an inactivated or
attenuated live vaccine composition is administered prophylactically to a host (e.g., a mammal),
and the host's immune response to the administration protects against infection and/or disease.
For passive immunization, the elicited antisera can be recovered and administered to a recipient
suspected of having an infection caused by at least one influenza virus strain.
[0157]    The present invention thus includes methods for preventing or attenuating a disease or
disorder, e.g., infection by at least one influenza virus strain. As used herein, a vaccine is said to
prevent or attenuate a disease if its administration results either in the total or partial attenuation
(i.e., suppression) of a symptom or condition of the disease, or in the total or partial immunity of
the individual to the disease.
[0158]    At least one inactivated or attenuated influenza virus, or composition thereof, of the
present invention may be administered by any means that achieve the intended purposes, using a
pharmaceutical composition as previously described. For example, administration of such a
composition may be by various parenteral routes such as subcutaneous, intravenous, intradermal,
intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intranasal, oral or transdermal routes. Parenteral administration
can be by bolus injection or by gradual perfusion over time. In some embodiments, an
immunogenic composition as disclosed herein is by intramuscular or subcutaneous application.
                                                   38

      WO 2012/177924                                                           PCT/US2012/043606
[0159]    In some embodiments, a regimen for preventing, suppressing, or treating an influenza
virus related pathology comprises administration of an effective amount of a vaccine
composition as described herein, administered as a single treatment, or repeated as enhancing or
booster dosages, over a period up to and including between one week and about 24 months, or
any range or value therein. In some embodiments, an influenza vaccine as disclosed herein is
administered annually.
[0160]    According to the present invention, an "effective amount" of a vaccine composition is
one that is sufficient to achieve a desired biological effect. It is understood that, in some
embodiments, the effective dosage will be dependent upon the age, sex, health, and weight of the
recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, and the nature of the
effect wanted. The ranges of effective doses provided below are not intended to be limiting and
represent exemplary dose ranges. Thus, in some embodiments, the dosage will be tailored to the
individual subject, as is understood and determinable by one of skill in the art. The dosage of an
attenuated virus vaccine for a mammalian (e.g., human) adult can be from about 103 -10 7 plaque
forming units (PFU), or any range or value therein. The dose of inactivated vaccine can range
from about 0.1 to 200, e.g., 50 gg of hemagglutinin protein. However, the dosage should be a
safe and effective amount as determined by conventional methods, using existing vaccines as a
starting point.
C.      Intracutaneous delivery
[0161]    Live flu vaccines are traditionally delivered intranasally to mimic the natural route of
infection and promote a similar immune response to that of natural virus infection. As an
alternative, disclosed herein are intradermal delivery methods which involve the use of a novel
microneedle device to capitalize on the immunological benefits of intradermal delivery. In some
embodiments, an attenuated virus (e.g., an M2 viral mutant) is used in a vaccine composition for
intradermal administration. In some embodiments, an M2 viral mutant, which does not produce
infectious progeny virus, is provided in a vaccine. Thus, any potential of reassortment with
wild-type circulating influenza viruses is virtually eliminated.
                                                  39

     WO 2012/177924                                                          PCT/US2012/043606
[0162]    In embodiments disclosed herein, intradermal delivery (intracutaneous) administers
vaccine to the skin. In some embodiments, intradermal delivery is performed using a
microneedle delivery device. As disclosed herein, intracutaneous delivery has numerous
advantages. For example, the immunogenicity of the vaccine is enhanced by triggering the
immunological potential of the skin immune system. The vaccine has direct access to the potent
antigen-presenting dendritic cells of the skin, i.e., epidermal Langerhans Cells and dermal
dendritic cells. Skin cells produce proinflammatory signals which enhance the immune
response to antigens introduced through the skin. Further, the skin immune system produces
antigen-specific antibody and cellular immune responses. Intradermal delivery allows for
vaccine dose sparing, i.e., lower doses of antigen may be effective, in light of the above factors,
when delivered intracutaneously.
[0163]    And, because the vaccine is delivered to the skin through the device's microneedle
array, the risk of unintended needle-sticks is reduced, and intracutaneous vaccine delivery via
microneedle array is relatively painless compared to intramuscular injections with conventional
needle and syringe.
[0164]    Microneedle devices are known in the art, are known in the art, including, for example,
those described in published U.S. patent applications 2012/0109066, 2011/0172645,
2011/0172639, 2011/0172638, 2011/0172637, and 2011/0172609. Microneedle devices may be
made, for example, by fabrication from stainless steel sheets (e.g., Trinity Brand Industries,
Georgia; SS 304; 50 gm thick) by wet etching. In some embodiments, individual microneedles
have a length of between about 500gm and 1000gm, e.g., about 750gm, and a width of between
about 100 gm to 500 gm, e.g., about 200 gm. Vaccine can then be applied to the microneedles
as a coating. By way of example, but not by way of limitation, a coating solution may include
1%(w/v) carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (low viscosity, USP grad; Carbo-Mer, San Diego
CA), 0.5% (w/v) Lutrol F-68 NF (BASF, Mt. Olive, NJ) and the antigen (e.g., soluble HA
protein at 5 ng/ml; live, attenuated virus such as the M2 mutant virus described herein, etc.). To
reach a higher vaccine concentration, the coating solution may be evaporated for 5 to 10 minutes
at room temperature (~23 0 C). Coating may be performed by a dip coating process. The amount
                                                  40

      WO 2012/177924                                                          PCT/US2012/043606
of vaccine per row of microneedles can be determined by submerging the microneedles into 200
gl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 minutes and assaying for the antigen by methods
known in the art.
[0165]     In some embodiments, a microneedle device is used that is made mainly of
polypropylene and stainless steel first-cut pieces that fit together with simple snap fits and heat
seals. In some embodiments, the device is completely self-contained and includes the vaccine, a
pump mechanism, an activation mechanism, and a microneedle unit. These components are
hidden within a plastic cover. With the device, vaccine infusion is initiated by pressing an
actuation button. Pressing the button simultaneously inserts the microneedles into the skin and
initiates the pumping mechanism that exerts pressure on the primary drug container. When a
spring mechanism exerts sufficient pressure on the vaccine reservoir, vaccine begins to flow
through the microneedle array, and into the skin. In some embodiments, the delivery of the
vaccine dose is completed within about 2 minutes after actuation of the device. After infusion is
complete, the device is gently removed from the skin.
[0166]     In some embodiments, a method for intracutaneous administration of an immunogenic
composition (e.g., a vaccine) is provided using a microneedle device. In some embodiments, the
microneedle device comprises a puncture mechanism and an immunogenic composition layer
comprising a plurality of microneedles capable of puncturing skin and allowing an immunogenic
composition to be administered intracutaneously. In some embodiments, the method comprises
depressing the puncture mechanism. In some embodiments, the immunogenic composition (e.g.
vaccine) comprises a virus comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a mutant M2 protein
that is expressed or a mutant M2 protein that is not expressed; wherein the expressed mutant M2
protein comprises, or consists of, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4. In some
embodiments, the microneedle array is initially positioned inside of a device housing, and upon
actuation of a lever allows the microneedles to extend through the device bottom and insert into
the skin thereby allowing infusion of the vaccine fluid into the skin.

[0167]    The delivery device described herein may be utilized to deliver any substance that may
be desired. In one embodiment, the substance to be delivered is a drug, and the delivery device
is a drug delivery device configured to deliver the drug to a subject. As used herein the term
"drug" is intended to include any substance delivered to a subject for any therapeutic,
preventative or medicinal purpose (e.g., vaccines, pharmaceuticals, nutrients, nutraceuticals,
etc.). In one such embodiment, the drug delivery device is a vaccine delivery device configured
to deliver a dose of vaccine to a subject. In one embodiment, the delivery device is configured to
deliver a flu vaccine. The embodiments discussed herein relate primarily to a device configured
to deliver a substance transcutaneously. In some embodiments, the device may be configured to
deliver a substance directly to an organ other than the skin.

[0168]    While the following examples are demonstrated with influenza A, it is understood that
the mutations and methods described herein are equally applicable to other viruses which express
an M2, an M2-like protein or a protein with the same or similar function as the influenza A M2
protein.

Example 2: Generation and culturing of M2 mutant virus
[0179]     This example demonstrates the culturing of the PR8 virus comprising the M2KO(ATM)
(SEQ ID NO: 1) mutation. Mutant viruses were generated as reported in Neumann et al.,
Generationof influenza A viruses entirelyfrom clone cDNAs, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
96:9345-9350 (1999), with some modifications. Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with 17
plasmids: 8 Poll constructs for 8 RNA segments, one of which harbors the mutant M2 sequence,
and 9 protein-expression constructs for 5 structural proteins as follows: NP (pCAGGS-WSN
NPO/14); M2 (pEP24c); PB1 (pcDNA774); PB2 (pcDNA762); and PA (pcDNA787) of A/Puerto
Rico/8/34 (HINI) virus.
[0180]     The plasmids were mixed with transfection reagent (2 gL of Trans IT* LT-1 (Mirus,
Madison, Wis.) per gg of DNA), incubated at room temperature for 15-30 minutes, and added to
ixi06 293T cells. Forty-eight hours later, viruses in the supernatant were serially diluted and
inoculated into M2CK cells. Two to four days after inoculation, viruses in supernatant of the last
dilution well in which cells showing clear cytopathic effect (CPE) were inoculated into M2CK
cells for the production of stock virus. The M genes of generated viruses were sequenced to
confirm the gene and the presence of the intended mutations and to ensure that no unwanted
mutations were present.

[0181]     Mutant M2 viruses were grown and passaged as follows. M2CK host cells were grown
in the presence of MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were infected at an MOI
of 0.001 by washing with PBS followed by adsorbing virus at 37 0 C. Virus growth media
containing trypsin/TPCK was added and the cells were incubated for 2-3 days until cytopathic
effect was observed.
Example 3 M2KO Replication is Restricted in Normal Cells
[0182]     Growth kinetics of the PR8 virus with the M2KO(ATM) (SEQ ID NO:1) mutation and
wild-type PR8 were analyzed in both normal MDCK cells and MDCK cells stably expressing
M2 protein (M2CK). Cells were infected with viruses at multiplicity of infection of 10-5. Virus
titers in cell supernatant were determined in MDCK or M2CK cells. Wild-type PR8 grew to
high titers in both cell types whereas M2KO grew well only in M2CK cells and not at all in
MDCK cells (Figure 4).
Example 4: M2KO Virus Produces Viral Antigens, But Not M2, in Normal Cells
[0183]     This example demonstrates that the PR8 virus with the M2KO(ATM) (SEQ ID NO:1)
mutation produces viral antigens, but not M2 protein, in normal cells. Viral protein expression
was evaluated by infecting wild-type MDCK cells with wild-type PR8 or M2KO at a multiplicity
of infection (MOI) of 0.5 in medium without trypsin to ensure that viruses complete only one life
cycle. Viral proteins in the cell lysates were separated on a 4 - 12 % SDS-PAGE gel and detected
by Western blot using PR8 infected mouse sera (Panel A) or anti-M2 monoclonal antibody
(14C2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (Panel B). Figure 3A shows that antisera against PR8 detects
similar levels of protein expression for both PR8 and M2KO. When the lysates are probed with
an anti-M2 monoclonal antibody (Panel B), M2 expression is detected only in PR8 infected cells,
not M2KO. These results indicate that M2KO virus expresses all viral proteins, except M2
protein, to similar levels as PR8 virus (Figure 5)

Example 5:       M2 mutants Are Attenuated In Vivo
[0184]    An experiment was performed to demonstrate that M2 mutant viruses are attenuated in
vivo. Six weeks old BALB/c, female mice (23 per group) were inoculated intranasally with one
of the following mutants: M2KO(yk) as described in J. Virol (2009) 83:5947-5950; M2-1 (TM
del M2KO aka M2KO(ATM)) and M2-2 (Splice def M2KO) (collectively termed "M2KO
variants"). The mutant was administered at a dose of 1.2x 104 pfu per mouse. A control group of
mice was given PBS. The mice were observed for 14 days after inoculation for any change in
body weight and symptoms of infection. Additionally, after 3 days post-inoculation, virus titers
were taken from the lungs and nasal turbinates (NT) from 3 mice in each group.
[0185]    As shown in Figure 6, mice inoculated with the M2KO variants and PBS did not show
any clinical symptoms of infection nor lose any body weight over the 14 day period. The change
in body weight between the groups were comparable over the 14 day period. Additionally, no
virus was detected in the titers that were gathered from the lungs and NT. Together, the lack of
clinical symptoms, lack of loss of body weight and absence of virus indicate that the M2 mutant
viruses are attenuated and not pathogenic in mice.
Example 6:       M2 Mutants Induce Antibodies Against Influenza Virus and Protect Mice From
Lethal Virus Challenge
[0186]    Testing was also performed to determine antibody titers from the mice described in
Example 5 above and their survival after being challenged with a lethal viral dose. Serum
samples were taken 3 weeks after inoculation and anti-virus IgG antibody titers from the serum
samples were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The humoral
response is shown in Figure 7, which shows that all three M2 mutants elevated anti-influenza
virus antibodies higher than the control PBS group.
[0187]    In addition, half of the mice within each of the groups were boosted 28 days after
inoculation with same amount of M2 mutant virus. Serum was then collected 6 weeks after the
first inoculation and IgG titers against the virus were determined. As shown in Figure 7B, mice

boosted by M2 mutant viruses had a higher level of anti-influenza virus antibodies than ones
were not boosted.
[0188]     49 days after the first inoculation (3 weeks after the boost), the mice were challenged
with a lethal dose of PR8 virus (40 mouse 50% lethal dose (MLD5o)). As shown in Figure 8 and
Figure 9, all mice vaccinated with the M2KO variants survived the challenge and lost no weight.
The control mice that were given only PBS, however, lost body weight and did not survive 8
days past the challenge date. On day 3 after the challenge, lungs and NT were obtained and virus
titers determined in MDCK cells by plaque assay. As depicted in Table 11, lung virus titers in
M2KO variants were at least one log lower than titers in naYve control PBS. And almost no
viruses were detected in nasal turbinates in M2KO variants groups but more than 100,000 PFU/g
were detected in the naYve control PBS group, indicating that the M2 mutant vaccines confer
protection and limits the replication of the challenge virus.

[0189]     In another experiment, six weeks after immunization, the M2KO(ATM) groups were

Aichi (H3N2) virus and scored for survival for 14 days. Results for the heterotypic challenge are
shown in Figure 16.
Example 7:       Intradermal Vaccine Delivery

(Harland Laboratories) were inoculated either intranasally (IN), intramuscularly (IM) or
intradmermally (ID) with PR8 virus (3.5x10 7pfu) at a concentration of 1.8x10 1 , 1.8x10 2, 1.8x10 3
or 1.8x104 pfu (50 gl) per mouse. Control mice were also given PBS through the three different
routes of administration. Body weight and survival were monitored for 14 days after inoculation.
For the mouse experiments, allergy syringes with intradermal bevel needles were used.
[0191]     Most vaccines are administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection using
conventional needles and syringes. However, recent studies demonstrate that intradermal
vaccine delivery achieves better immunogenicity than intramuscular or subcutaneous
administration. Intradermal vaccination delivers antigen directly to the enriched skin immune
system and has been shown to be effective for a range of vaccines, including rabies, hepatitis B
and influenza. Intradermal delivery may also provide dose sparing, achieving the same immune
response using less vaccine than required with intramuscular injection. The current state-of-the
art for intradermal delivery (using conventional needles and syringes) is the Mantoux technique,
which requires extensive training, is difficult to perform, and often results in misdirected
(subcutaneous) or incomplete administration. The lack of suitable delivery devices has
hampered intradermal vaccination research and product development even though superior
immune responses with this administration route have been documented.
[0192]     As shown in Table 12, IN-inoculated mice succumbed to influenza infection at the
higher doses of 1.8x10 3 and 1.8x10 4 pfu per mouse, with complete survival only at the lowest
dose of 1.8x 101. However, IM- and ID-inoculated mice at all dosages survived. Table 13 shows
the median lethal dose for mice in the IN-inoculated group (MLD5 o). Figure 10 shows that IM
and ID-inoculated mice inoculated with 1.8x104 pfu of the virus displayed no change in body
weight, and shows the lack of survival for IN-inoculated mice inoculated with 1.8x104 pfu of
virus.

IM- and ID-inoculated mice at both time periods are similar. At each time period, IN-inoculated
mice presented the highest number of antibodies. Only IN-inoculated mice inoculated with
1.8x 101 pfu were identified (i.e., "Lo"), because by this time, the IN-inoculated mice inoculated
with higher doses had expired. IM- and ID-inoculated mice presented lower levels of antibodies
than the IN-inoculated mice, although mice inoculated at the higher doses exhibited greater
amounts of antibodies when compared with the control mice given only PBS. Additionally, over

time, the intradermal administration route produced more antibodies than the intramuscular
route, as demonstrated by the higher titer levels shown in Figure 11B.
[0194]    In another experiment, groups of IN-, IM- and ID-inoculated mice (5 mice per group,

25% of their body weight were euthanized.
[0195]    As shown in Figure 12, 100% of IM-inoculated mice at a dose of 1.8x10 3 did not
survive 8 days after the challenge. The survival rate of all ID-inoculated mice was between 40%
and 60%. The survival rate of IM-inoculated mice at 1.8x10 4 , however, was 100%. Figure 13
shows that the ID-inoculated and IM-inoculated (1.8x104) groups of mice had an initial average
weight loss, but ended up with a relative low weight loss from the challenge date.
[0196]    An evaluation of the ID-incoulated mice (1.8x104) showed that two mice (1 and 5 in
Figure 14 and Figure 15), elicited a better immune response than the other mice, and further did
not develop symptoms of influenza infection (e.g., body weight loss, rough fur, quietness, etc.).
However, all mice in the IM-inoculated group (1.8x104) showed some symptoms and lost at least
10% in body weight.
Example 8: Stability of M2KO Variants
[0197]    To test the stability of M2 gene of M2KO variants in wild-type cells, the M2KO
variants were passaged in wild-type MDCK cells, which lacks M2 protein expression, along with
M2CK cells which are M2 protein expressing MDCK cells. All M2KO variants were
passageable in M2CK cells without any mutations until at least passage 10. Although, M2-1
(TM del M2KO), M2-2 (Splice def M2KO), and M2-3 (TM del + Splice def M2KO) were not
able to be passaged in wild-type MDCK cells (no cytopathic effect (CPE) is seen in wild-type
MDCK cells), M2KO(yk) showed CPE even after          4 th passage in MDCK cells. M segment
RNAs were extracted from M2KO(yk) passage 4 in wild-type MDCK and the cDNA were

Example 9:      M2KO Vaccinations
[0198]    To demonstrate that the M2KO vaccine can stimulate an immune response similar to a
natural influenza infection, a vaccine experiment was conducted. Natural influenza infection
was represented by a low inoculum of PR8 virus and the standard inactivated flu vaccine was
represented by inactivated PR8 virus (Charles River) delivered the standard intramuscular route
and intranasally.
[0199]    Six to seven week old BALB/c mice were immunized intranasally with live virus (10
pfu PR8), PR8 virus comprising M2KO(ATM) (104 pfu), or 1 gg inactivated PR8 virus, delivered
both intranasally and intramuscularly. Mice given 104 infectious particles of M2KO(ATM)
intranasally lost no weight and showed no signs of infection. Furthermore, the lungs of mice
treated with M2KO(ATM) contained no detectable infectious particles three days post
inoculation. Sera was obtained from the immunized mice on day 21 and antibody titers against
the hemagglutinin were determined by a standard ELISA assay. Figure 17 shows that anti-HA
IgG titers were highest in the live virus and M2KO(ATM) groups relative to the inactivated
vaccine groups. Mucosal IgA antibody against influenza was detected in sera only in the live
PR8 or M2KO vaccinated mice.

[0200]     Six weeks after immunization, all groups were challenged with homosubtypic (PR8,
HINI) or heterosubtypic (Aichi, H3N2) influenza viruses. Both M2KO and inactivated
vaccinations protected mice from homosubtypic virus infection (Figure 18). However, only
M2KO vaccinated mice were protected from heterosubtypic virus challenge (Figure 19). The
mice immunized with inactivated vaccine succumbed to infection similar to naYve mice.
Example 10      The M2KO(ATM) Virus Does not Replicate In The Respiratory Tract Or Other
Organs
[0201]     Summary - This example demonstrates that the M2KO(ATM) virus does not replicate
in the respiratory tract or disseminate to other organs in the ferret model. The M2KO(ATM)
virus was administered intranasally to 3 male ferrets at a dose level of 1x107 TCID5 0 . As a
control, second group of 3 male ferrets was administered A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) influenza
A virus intranasally at a dose of 1x10 7 TCID50 . Following virus inoculation, ferrets were
observed until Day 3 post inoculation for mortality, with body weights, body temperatures and
clinical signs measured daily. Necropsy was performed on all animals 3 days post inoculation.
Organs were collected for histopathology and viral titers.
[0202]     The control group receiving A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) exhibited a transient reduction
in weight and an increase in body temperature 2 days after inoculation which was not observed
in the M2KO(ATM) group. Activity levels were also reduced in the A/Brisbane/10/2007 group
with sneezing observed on days 2-3 post infection. No changes in activity level or clinical signs
associated with virus exposure were observed in the M2KO(ATM) group. Histopathological
analysis revealed changes in the nasal turbinates in animals exposed to influenza
A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) that were not seen in ferrets exposed to the M2KO(ATM) virus.
Exposure to A/Brisbane/10/2007 resulted in atrophy of respiratory epithelium, infiltrates of
neutrophils and edema in the nasal turbinates. No other organ was affected by the virus
inoculation. Under the conditions of the experiment, the M2KO(ATM) virus did not induce
clinical signs of infection or result in histological changes in the organs analyzed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
[0203]    A. Vaccine Material and Control Virus: The M2KO(ATM) virus is a recombinant virus
which possesses internal 6 genes of PR8 (nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase genes (PA, PB 1, PB2),
non-structural (NS), matrix (M)), but which does not express functional M2 protein, as well as
HA and NA genes of Influenza A/Brisbane/10/2007-like A/Uruguay/716/2007(H3N2). The
A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) wild type virus served as the control virus and was supplied by
IITRI. The viruses were kept frozen at -65'C until used.
[0204]    B. Test Article and Positive Control Dose Formulation: The M2KO(ATM) virus dosing
solution of 1x10  7
                    TCID5 o/mL per 316 gL was prepared by diluting 8 gL of Ix1010 TCID 5 o/mL
into 2.528 mL PBS. The A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) at a titer of 1x10 7 TCID5 o/mL per 316 gL
was used undiluted.
[0205]    C. Animals and Animal Care: Eight male ferrets were purchased from Triple F Farms
and six of the ferrets were placed on study. Animals were approximately 4 months of age at the
time of study initiation. The animals were certified by the supplier to be healthy and free of
antibodies to infectious diseases. Upon arrival the animals were single housed in suspended wire
cages with slat bottoms, suspended over paper-lined waste pans. The animal room and cages had
been cleaned and sanitized prior to animal receipt, in accordance with accepted animal care
practices and relevant standard operating procedures. Certified Teklad Global Ferret Diet #2072
(Teklad Diets, Madison WI) and city of Chicago tap water were provided ad libitum and were
refreshed at least once daily. Fluorescent lighting in the animal rooms was maintained on a 12
hr light/dark cycle. Animal room temperature and relative humidity were within respective
protocol limits and ranged from 22.0 to 25.0'C and 33 to 56%, respectively, during the study.
[0206]    D. Animal Quarantine and Randomization: The ferrets were held in quarantine for five
days prior to randomization and observed daily. Based on daily observations indicating general
good health of the animals the ferrets were released from quarantine for randomization and
testing. Following quarantine, ferrets were weighed and assigned to treatment groups using a
computerized randomization procedure based on body weights that produced similar group mean
                                                 54

      WO 2012/177924                                                            PCT/US2012/043606
values [ToxData® version 2.1.E.1 1 (PDS Pathology Data Systems, Inc., Basel, Switzerland)].
Within a group, all body weights were within 20% of their mean. Animals selected for the study
receive a permanent identification number by ear tag and transponder and individual cage cards
also identified the study animals by individual numbers and group. The identifying numbers
assigned were unique within the study.
[0207]    E. Experimental Design: All animal procedures were performed in an animal biosafety
level-2 facility in accordance with the protocols approved by the animal care and use committee
at IIT Research Institute. 6 male ferrets (Triple F Farms, Sayre PA), 4 months of age at the time
of study initiation were utilized for the study. Prior to infection, ferrets were monitored for 3
days to measure body weight and establish baseline body temperatures. Temperature readings
were recorded daily through a transponder (BioMedic data systems, Seaford, DE) implanted
subcutaneously in each ferret. Blood was collected prior to study initiation via the jugular vein,
and serum tested for influenza antibodies. Study animals free of influenza antibodies were
randomized and divided into two groups (3 ferrets/group) as shown in Table 15. A group of 3
ferrets was anesthetized and inoculated intranasally with a single dose of 316 gL at lx107
TCID5 0 of M2KO(ATM) virus. A control group (3 ferrets) was inoculated with 316 gL at 1x107
TCID5 0 of A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2). Ferrets were observed daily to monitor body weight,
body temperature and clinical symptoms. On Day 3 post-inoculation, ferrets (3 ferrets per group)
were euthanized and necropsied. The following tissue samples were collected: nasal turbinates,
trachea, lungs, kidneys, pancreas, olfactory bulbs, brains, livers, spleens, small and large
intestines. One part of the collected samples was fixed with buffered neutral formalin for
histological evaluation and the other part of the samples were stored at -65'C for virus titration.

[0208]    F. Virus Inoculation: Ferrets were inoculated with either the M2KO(ATM) virus or wild
type A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) influenza A virus. A vial of frozen stock was thawed and
diluted to the appropriate concentration in phosphate buffered saline solution. Ferrets were
anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and the virus dose administered intranasally in a volume of
316 gL for the M2KO(ATM) virus and 316 gL for the A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) virus. To
confirm the inoculation titer of the A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) virus, a TCID5 o assay was
performed at IITRI on a portion of the prepared viral challenge solution. The viral titer assay was
performed according to Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute (IITRI) Standard
Operating Procedures.
[0209]    G. Moribundity/Mortality Observations: Following challenge, all animals were
observed twice daily for mortality or evidence of moribundity. Animals were observed for 3
days post-challenge. Animals were euthanized by overdose with Sodium Pentobarbital 150
mg/kg, administered intravenously.
[0210]    H. Body Weights and Body Weight Change: Body weights of animals were recorded
upon receipt (random 10% sample), at randomization (Day -3 to 0), and daily after virus
inoculation.
[0211]    I. Clinical Observations: The change in temperature (in degrees Celsius) was
determined daily for each ferret. Clinical signs of, inappetence, respiratory signs such as
dyspnea, sneezing, coughing, and rhinorrhea and level of activity was assessed daily. A scoring
system based on that described by Reuman, et al., "Assessment of signs of influenza illness in
                                                 56

      WO 2012/177924                                                            PCT/US2012/043606
the ferret model," J. Virol, Methods 24:27-34 (1989), was used to assess the activity level as
follows: 0, alert and playful; 1, alert but playful only when stimulated; 2, alert but not playful
when stimulated; and 3, neither alert nor playful when stimulated. A relative inactivity index
(RII) was calculated as the mean score per group of ferrets per observation (day) over the
duration of the study.
[0212]     J. Euthanasia: Study animals were euthanized by an intravenous dose of sodium
pentobarbital 150 mg/kg. Death was confirmed by absence of observable heartbeat and
respiration. Necropsies were performed on all study animals.
[0213]     K. Necropsy: Nasal turbinates, trachea, lungs, kidneys, pancreas, olfactory bulbs, brain,
liver, spleen, small and large intestines were harvested. One portion of each tissue was fixed in
formalin and the other portion given to IITRI staff for freezing and storage. Tissue harvested for
titers are: right nasal turbinates, upper 1/3 of trachea, right cranial lung lobe, right kidney, right
arm of pancreas (near duodenum), right olfactory bulb, right brain, right lateral lobe of liver,
right half of spleen (end of spleen seen on opening the abdominal cavity), small intestine and
large intestine.
[0214]     L. Histopathological analysis: Tissues were processed through to paraffin blocks,
sectioned at approximately 5-microns thickness, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H &
E).
[0215]     M. Serum Collection: Pre-vaccination (Day -3) serum was collected from all ferrets.
Ferrets were anesthetized with a ketamine (25 mg/kg) and xylazine (2mg/kg) mixture. A sample
of blood (approximately 0.5-1.0 mL) was collected via the vena cava from each ferret and
processed for serum. Blood was collected into Serum Gel Z/1.1 tubes (Sarstedt Inc. Newton, NC)
and stored at room temperature for not more than 1 hour before collecting serum. Serum Gel
Z/1.1 tubes were centrifuged at 10,000xg for 3 minutes and the serum collected. Individual pre
inoculation serum samples were collected and two aliquots made from each sample. One aliquot
was tested prior to the initiation of the study to confirm ferrets are free of antibodies to influenza
A viruses and one aliquot of the serum stored at -65 0 C.

[0216]    N. Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Assay: Serum samples were treated with receptor
destroying enzyme (RDE) (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) to eliminate inhibitors of nonspecific
hemagglutination. RDE was reconstituted per the manufacturer's instructions. Serum was
diluted 1:3 in RDE and incubated 18-20 hours in a 37 0 C ± 20C water bath. After the addition of
an equal volume of 2.5% (v/v) sodium citrate, the samples were incubated in a 56 ± 2'C water
bath for 30 ± 5 minutes. 0.85% NaCl was added to each sample to a final serum dilution of 1:10
after the RDE treatment. The diluted samples were then diluted into four two-fold dilutions
(1:10 to 1:80) in duplicate in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) then incubated with 4
hemagglutinating units of A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) influenza A virus. After incubation,
0.5% chicken red blood cells were added to each sample and incubated. Presence or absence of
hemagglutination was then scored.
[0217]    0. Virus Titers: The concentration of infectious virus in the pre- and post-challenge
virus inoculum samples was determined by TCID50 in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK)
cells. Briefly, samples kept at -65'C were thawed and centrifuged to remove cellular debris.
The resulting supernatant were diluted 10-fold in triplicate in 96-well microtiter plates in
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing
Pencillin/Streptomycin, 0.10% Gentamicin, 30%NaCO 3 , 0.30% BSA fraction V (Sigma St. Louis,
MO), 1% MEM vitamin solution (Sigma) and 1% L-glutamine (Mediatech, Manassas, VA,
USA). After 10-fold serial dilutions were made, 1OOL was transferred into respective wells of a
96-well plate which contained a monolayer of MDCK cells. Plates were incubated at 37 0 C ± 2'C
in 5 ± 2% CO 2 70% humidity. After 48 hours, the wells were observed for cytopathogenic effect
(CPE). Supernatant from each well (50 gl) was transferred to a 96 well plate and the
hemagglutination (HA) activity determined and recorded. The HA activity of the supernatant
was assessed by HA assay with 0.5% packed turkey red blood cells (cRBCs). TCID5 0 titers were
calculated using the method of Reed LJ and Muench H, "A simple method for estimating 50%
endpoints," Am. J. Hygiene 27: 493-497 (1938).

[0218]   P. Data Analysis: Body weights and body weight gains (losses) and changes in body
temperature were determined for each individual animal expressed as mean and standard
deviations of the mean for each test group.
RESULTS
[0219]   After inoculation with either the M2KO(ATM) virus or A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)
influenza A virus, ferrets were monitored for survival and clinical signs of infection. Results are
presented in Table 16A and 16B. All ferrets survived infection with M2KO(ATM) virus and
A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2). Ferrets inoculated with A/Brisbane/10/2007 presented respiratory
signs (sneezing) on Day 2 and 3. The relative inactivity index of ferrets inoculated with
A/Brisbane/10/2007 was 0.67; whereas ferrets inoculated with M2KO(ATM) showed no
reduction activity level with a relative inactivity index of 0.0.
[0220]   Changes in body weight and temperature after virus inoculation are shown in Figure 20
and Figure 21. After inoculation with A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2), a 2-3% loss of body weight
was observed on Day 2 post inoculation in all animals. Minimal to zero weight loss was
observed in ferrets inoculated with the M2KO(ATM) virus. One M2KO(ATM) inoculated ferret
exhibited weight loss on Day 2 post inoculation of 1%. Elevated body temperatures of 40.3
40.7'C were observed in ferrets inoculated with A/Brisbane 10/2007 on Day 2 post inoculation.
Body temperatures returned to normal range by Day 3. Body temperatures for M2KO(ATM)
inoculated ferrets remained in normal range throughout the duration of the study. To determine if
the M2KO(ATM) virus would replicate in the respiratory tract or other organs and induce
pathology, tissues of ferrets were histologically examined on day 3 post inoculation and
compared to those from ferrets inoculated with A/Brisbane/10/2007. In ferrets inoculated with
A/Brisbane/10/2007, pathology was observed only in the nasal turbinates. Atrophy of respiratory
epithelium, infiltrates of neutrophils and edema were observed in the nasal turbinates. No
histopathological changes associated with viral infection were observed in ferrets inoculated with
the M2KO(ATM) virus. The concentrations of pre- and post-challenge virus dosing solutions

CONCLUSION
[0221]    This example shows that by Day 3 post inoculation, the M2KO(ATM) virus does not
induce clinical signs of disease or histopathological changes associated with infection of wild
type virus. This shows that the M2KO(ATM) virus of the present technology is useful for
intranasal influenza vaccines.
Example 11:     Immune Response and Protective Effects M2KO(ATM) Virus Relative To Other
Vaccines
[0222]    Summary - This example demonstrates the immune response elicited by the
M2KO(ATM) vaccine and the protective effects of the vaccine in the ferret model. The
                                                                                            7
M2KO(ATM) virus was administered intransally to 12 male ferrets at a dose level of 1x10
TCID5 0 . As a control, a second group of 12 male ferrets was administered the FM#6 virus
intranasally at a dose of 1x10 7 TCID5 0 . A third group of ferrets was administered OPTI-MEM TM
as a placebo control. A prime only or prime-boost vaccination regimen was utilized for each
treatment group. Ferrets receiving the prime-boost vaccination regimen were administered the
prime vaccine (Day 0) and the boost vaccination 28 days later (Day 28). Ferrets receiving only
the prime vaccine were administered a single vaccination on the same day as the booster vaccine
was given to the prime-boost ferrets (Day 28). Following each vaccination, ferrets were
observed for 14 days post inoculation for mortality, with body weights, body temperatures and
clinical signs measured daily. Nasal washes were collected from ferrets on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9
post-prime vaccination to look for viral shedding. Nasal washes and serum were collected
weekly from all ferrets post-vaccination to evaluate antibody levels over time.
[0223]    All animals were challenged intranasally on Day 56 with 1x10 7 TCID5 0 of
A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2). Following challenge, ferrets were monitored for 14 days post
inoculation for mortality, with body weights, body temperatures and clinical signs measured
daily. Nasal washes were collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 14 post challenge from ferrets in
each group for viral titers. Additionally, serum was collected post-challenge (day 70) from

surviving ferrets for analysis. Necropsy was performed on 3 ferrets per group 3 days post
challenge. Organs were collected for histopathology and viral titers.
[0224]     No vaccine related adverse events were observed among the 5 groups. After challenge,
the placebo control group exhibited an increase in body temperature 2 days after challenge and a
reduction in weight. A reduction in weight was also observed in M2KO(ATM) and FM#6
vaccinated groups; however, the reduction was to less than that observed in the OPTI-MEMTM
group. Activity levels were not reduced in any groups; however sneezing was observed in all
groups after challenge. Histopathological analysis revealed an increase in severity of mixed cell
infiltrates in the lung of vaccinated ferrets when compared to the lung infiltrates in the OPTI
MEMTM      control group. In the nasal turbinates, animals receiving a prime or prime plus boost
regimen of either M2KO(ATM) or FM#6 had lower severity of atrophy of respiratory epithelium
when compared to the OPTI-MEM TM control group. Vaccination with the M2KO(ATM) virus
appeared to provides similar protection against viral challenge as the FM#6 virus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
[0225]     A. Vaccine Material: The M2KO(ATM) virus is a recombinant virus which possesses
internal 6 genes of PR8 (nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase genes (PA, PB 1, PB2), non-structural
(NS), matrix (M)), but which does not express functional M2 protein, as well as HA and NA
genes of Influenza A/Brisbane/10/2007-like A/Uruguay/716/2007(H3N2). The FM#6 virus is
clone #6 of the A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2) influenza A virus from FluMist® (2009-2010
formula). The M2KO(ATM) virus and FM#6 virus were administered intranasally to the animals
in a 316 gL dose of 1x10 7 TCID50 (50% Tissue Culture Infectious Doses).
[0226]     B. Test Article and Positive Control Dose Formulation: The M2KO(ATM) virus dosing
solution of 1x10   7
                     TCID50/mL per 316 gL was prepared by diluting 120 gL of 1x10 9 TCID5 0 /mL
into 3.680 mL PBS. The FM#6 virus at a titer of 1x10 7 TCID 5 o/mL per 316 gL was prepared by
diluting 120 gL of 1x10 9 TCID5 o/mL into 3.680 mL PBS.

[0227]    C. Animals and Animal Care: Thirty-six male ferrets were purchased from Triple F
Farms and 30 of the ferrets were placed on study. Animals were approximately 4 months of age
at the time of study initiation. The animals were certified by the supplier to be healthy and free of
antibodies to infectious diseases. Upon arrival the animals were single housed in suspended wire
cages with slat bottoms, suspended over paper-lined waste pans. The animal room and cages had
been cleaned and sanitized prior to animal receipt, in accordance with accepted animal care
practices and relevant standard operating procedures. Certified Teklad Global Ferret Diet #2072
(Teklad Diets, Madison WI) and city of Chicago tap water were provided ad libitum and were
refreshed at least three time per week. Fluorescent lighting in the animal rooms was maintained
on a 12-hr light/dark cycle. Animal room temperature and relative humidity were within
respective protocol limits and ranged from 20.0 to 25.0'C and 30 to 63%, respectively, during
the study.
[0228]    D. Animal Quarantine and Randomization: The ferrets were held in quarantine for
seven days prior to randomization and observed daily. Based on daily observations indicating
general good health of the animals the ferrets were released from quarantine for randomization
and testing. Following quarantine, ferrets were weighed and assigned to treatment groups using
a computerized randomization procedure based on body weights that produced similar group
mean values [ToxData® version 2.1 .E. 11 (PDS Pathology Data Systems, Inc., Basel,
Switzerland)]. Within a group, all body weights were within 20% of their mean. Animals
selected for the study receive a permanent identification number by ear tag and transponder and
individual cage cards also identified the study animals by individual numbers and group. The
identifying numbers assigned were unique within the study.
[0229]    E. Experimental Design: To assess the M2KO(ATM) vaccine efficacy, ferrets were
immunized with M2KO(ATM) virus, cold adapted live attenuated virus (FM#6) or mock
immunized by medium (OPTI-MEM TM). The animals body weight, body temperature and
clinical symptoms were monitored and immunological responses evaluated. 30 male ferrets
(Triple F Farms, Sayre PA), 4 months of age at the time of study initiation were utilized for the
study. All animal procedures were performed in an animal biosafety level-2 or biosafety level-3
                                                 63

      WO 2012/177924                                                          PCT/US2012/043606
facility in accordance with the protocols approved by the animal care and use committee at IIT
Research Institute. Prior to inoculation, ferrets were monitored for 3 days to measure body
weight and establish baseline body temperatures. Temperature readings were recorded daily
through a transponder (BioMedic data systems, Seaford, DE) implanted subcutaneously in each
ferret. Blood was collected prior to study initiation, and serum tested for influenza antibodies.
Only ferrets with HAI (hemagglutination inhibition) titers 40 to A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)
were considered seronegative and used in this study. Study animals were randomized and
divided into 5 groups (6 ferrets/group) as shown in Table 17. Two groups (1 & 3) received the
M2KO(ATM) virus and 2 groups (2 & 4) received the FM#6 virus. One group (5) was mock
immunized with OPTI-MEMTM . Within each vaccine group, ferrets were divided into two
vaccine regimens, six receiving a prime vaccination only (Prime only) and six receiving a prime
vaccination followed by a booster vaccine 28 days after prime vaccination (Prime/Boost).
                                                                                                     7
Prime/Boost Groups: Ferrets were inoculated intranasally with a single dose of 316 gL of 1x10
TCID5 0 of M2KO(ATM) virus on days 0 and 28. Control groups were inoculated intranasally
with 316 gL of 1x107 TCID50 (same dose as M2KO(ATM)) of FM#6 or mock inoculated with
316 gL of OPTI-MEM TM on days 0 and 28. Ferret body temperatures, weights, and clinical
symptoms were monitored daily for 14 days post-inoculations. Nasal washes were collected from
all ferrets, including OPTI-MEM TM control group, on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 14 post prime
vaccination for virus titration in cells and on days 21 and 49 for antibody titration. Nasal wash
samples were kept at -65 C. Blood was collected prior to inoculation (day -3 to -5) and days 7,
14, 21 35, 42, and 49 and serum kept at -65'C until measurement of antibody titer by ELISA
and HI assay.
[0230]     Prime only Groups: Ferrets were inoculated intranasally with a single dose of 316 gL
of 1x10 7 TCID5 0 of M2KO(ATM) virus on day 28. Control groups were inoculated intranasally
with 316 gL of 1x107 TCID50 (same dose as M2KO(ATM)) of FM#6 or mock inoculated with
316 gL of OPTI-MEM TM on day 28. Ferret body temperatures, weights, and clinical symptoms
were monitored daily for 14 days post-inoculation. Nasal washes were collected from all ferrets
on days 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, and 42 for virus titration in cells and on day 49 for antibody titration.

Nasal wash samples were kept at -65 C. Blood was collected prior to inoculation (day 23 to 25)
and days 35, 42, and 49 and serum was kept at -65'C until measurement of antibody titer by
ELISA and HAI assay. All ferrets were challenged with a dose of 316 gL of 1x10 7 TCID50 of
wild-type A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) influenza virus on day 56, 4 weeks after the prime/boost
vaccine was administered. Ferret body weight, body temperature and clinical symptoms were
monitored for 14 days after challenge and nasal washes and organs collected. Nasal washes were
collected from challenged ferrets on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 14 post-challenge (days 57, 59, 61, 63,
65, and 70) and the samples kept at -65'C for virus titration in cells. On Day 3 post-challenge
(day 59), the animals (3 animals per group, total 15 animals) were euthanized and the following
tissue samples collected: nasal turbinates, trachea, and lungs. One part of the collected samples
was fixed with buffered neutral formalin for histological evaluation and the other part of the
samples was stored at -65'C for virus titration. Blood was collected 14 days post-challenge (day
70) and all surviving animals were euthanized.

[0231]    F. Virus Inoculation: Ferrets were inoculated with either the M2KO(ATM) virus or
FM#6 influenza A virus. A vial of frozen stock was thawed and diluted to the appropriate
concentration in phosphate buffered saline solution. Ferrets were anesthetized with
ketamine/xylazine and the virus dose administered intranasally in a volume of 316 gL for the
M2KO(ATM) virus and 316 gL for the FM#6 virus. To confirm the inoculation titer of the
M2KO(ATM) and FM#6 viruses, aliquots of the dosing solutions were collected prior to dosing
(pre-dose) and after dosing (post-dose). The aliquots were stored at -65'C for virus titration.
[0232]    G. Challenge Virus: Influenza A virus, strain A/Brisbane/10/2007, serotype H3N2 was
used to challenge the ferrets. The virus was stored at approximately -65'C prior to use. The dose
level of challenge virus used was prepared at 1x10 7 TCID50 in a volume of 316 gL. A
quantitative viral infectivity assay, TCID50 assay was performed at IITRI on a portion of the
prepared viral challenge solution. The viral titer assay was performed according to IITRI
Standard Operating Procedures.
[0233]    H. Moribundity/Mortality Observations: Following challenge, all animals were
observed twice daily for mortality or evidence of moribundity. Animals were observed for 14
days after vaccine inoculation and for 14 days after challenge.
[0234]    I. Body Weights and Body Weight Change: Body weights were recorded within two
days of receipt and at randomization. All study animals were weighed prior to inoculation, daily
for 14 days following each vaccination and assessed daily for 14 days post challenge. Prior to
inoculation, ferrets were monitored for 3-5 days to measure establish baseline body temperatures.
Temperature readings were recorded daily for 14 days following each vaccination and recorded
daily for 14 days post challenge through a transponder (BioMedic data systems, Seaford, DE)
implanted subcutaneously in each ferret. The change in temperature (in degrees Celsius) was
calculated at each time point for each animal.
[0235]    J. Clinical Observations: The change in temperature (in degrees Celsius) was
determined daily for each ferret. Clinical signs of, inappetence, respiratory signs such as
dyspnea, sneezing, coughing, and rhinorrhea and level of activity was assessed daily. A scoring

      WO 2012/177924                                                           PCT/US2012/043606
system based on that described by Reuman, et al., "Assessment of signs of influenza illness in
the ferret model," J. Virol, Methods 24:27-34 (1989), was used to assess the activity level as
follows: 0, alert and playful; 1, alert but playful only when stimulated; 2, alert but not playful
when stimulated; and 3, neither alert nor playful when stimulated. A relative inactivity index
(RII) was calculated as the mean score per group of ferrets per observation (day) over the
duration of the study.
[0236]     K. Survival Checks: Two survival checks were performed daily on all study animals
throughout the study. Both survival checks occurred simultaneously with the clinical
observations. The second check was performed later within the same day.
[0237]     L. Nasal Washes: Ferrets were anesthetized with a ketamine (25 mg/kg) and xylazine
(2mg/kg) mixture, and 0.5 ml of sterile PBS containing penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100
gg/ml), and gentamicin (50 gg/ml) was injected into each nostril and collected in a specimen cup
when expelled by the ferret. The nasal wash was collected into a cryovial and the recovered
volume recorded.
[0238]     M. Euthanasia: Study animals were euthanized by an intravenous dose of sodium
pentobarbital 150 mg/kg. Death was confirmed by absence of observable heartbeat and
respiration.
[0239]     N. Necropsy: Necropsy was performed by Charles River Laboratories, Pathology
Associates (PAI). The PAI team was comprised of a supervising pathologist and two prosectors.
Nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs were harvested. One portion of each tissue was fixed in
formalin and the other portion given to IITRI staff for freezing and storage. Tissue harvested for
titers are: right nasal turbinates, upper 1/3 of trachea and right cranial lung lobe.
[0240]     0. Histopathological analysis: Following each necropsy, tissues were transported to the
PAI Chicago facility. Upon receipt, partial tissues from all 15 ferrets were processed through to
paraffin blocks, sectioned at approximately 5-microns thickness, and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H & E). All paraffin H & E slides were evaluated microscopically.

[0241]    P. Serum Collection: Pre-vaccination serum (days -3 to -5 for groups 3, 4, and 5, and
days 23 to 25 for groups 1 and 2) serum was collected from the ferrets. Post inoculation, serum
was collected on days 7, 14, 21, 35, 42, 49, and 70 from groups 3, 4, and 5. Serum was collected
on days 35, 42, 49, and 70 from groups 1 and 2. Ferrets were anesthetized with a ketamine (25
mg/kg) and xylazine (2mg/kg) mixture. A sample of blood (approximately 0.5-1.0 mL) was
collected via the vena cava from each ferret and processed for serum. Blood was collected into
Serum Gel Z/1 .1 tubes (Sarstedt Inc. Newton, NC) and stored at room temperature for not more
than 1 hour before collecting serum. Serum Gel Z/1.1 tubes were centrifuged at 10,000xg for 3
minutes and the serum collected.
[0242]    Q. Hemagglutination   Inhibition (HI) Assay: Serum samples were treated with receptor
destroying enzyme (RDE) (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) to eliminate inhibitors of nonspecific
hemagglutination. RDE was reconstituted per the manufacturer's instructions. Serum was
diluted 1:3 in RDE and incubated 18-20 hours in a 37 0C ± 20C water bath. After the addition of
an equal volume of 2.5% (v/v) sodium citrate, the samples were incubated in a 56 ± 2'C water
bath for 30 ± 5 minutes. 0.85% NaCl was added to each sample to a final serum dilution of 1:10
after the RDE treatment. The diluted samples were then diluted into four two-fold dilutions
(1:10 to 1:80) in duplicate in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) then incubated with 4
hemagglutinating units of A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) influenza A virus. After incubation,
0.5% avian red blood cells were added to each sample and incubated for 30 ± 5 minutes.
Presence or absence of hemagglutination was then scored.
[0243]    R. Virus Titers: The concentration of infectious virus in the pre- and post-challenge
virus inoculum samples was determined by TCID50 assay in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney
(MDCK) cells. Briefly, samples kept at -65'C were thawed and centrifuged to remove cellular
debris. The resulting supernatant were diluted 10-fold in triplicate in 96-well microtiter plates in
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing
Pencillin/Streptomycin, 0. 1% Gentamicin, 3% NaCO3, 0.3% BSA fraction V (Sigma St. Louis,
MO), 1% MEM vitamin solution (Sigma) and 1% L-glutamine (Mediatech, Manassas, VA,
USA). After 10-fold serial dilutions were made, 100 gL was transferred into respective wells of a

      WO 2012/177924                                                       PCT/US2012/043606
96-well plate which contained a monolayer of MDCK cells. Plates were incubated at 37'C ± 2'C
in 5 ± 2% C02 70% humidity. After 48 hours, the wells were observed for cytopathogenic
effect (CPE). Supernatant from each well (50 gl) was transferred to a 96 well plate and the
hemagglutination (HA) activity determined and recorded. The HA activity of the supernatant
was assessed by HA assay with 0.5% packed turkey red blood cells (tRBCs). TCID5 0 titers were
calculated using the method of Reed LJ and Muench H, "A simple method for estimating 50%
endpoints," Am. J. Hygiene 27: 493-497 (1938).
[0244]    S. Data Analysis: Body weights and body weight gains (losses) and changes in body
temperature were determined for each individual animal expressed as mean and standard
deviations of the mean for each test group.
RESULTS
[0245]    After intranasal vaccination with either the M2KO(ATM) virus or the FM#6 virus,
ferrets were monitored daily for clinical signs of infection. Nasal washes were collected after
prime vaccination to monitor viral shedding and serum collected to measure serum antibody
titers. Results are presented in Tables 18A, 18B, and 18C.

[0246]    All ferrets survived vaccination with M2KO(ATM) virus and FM#6 virus. After prime
vaccination, two ferrets inoculated with M2KO(ATM) virus presented respiratory signs
(sneezing) on Day 8. After boost vaccination, ferrets inoculated with the FM#6 virus presented
respiratory signs (sneezing) 7 days post vaccination. Sneezing was also observed in the OPTI
MEMTM     ferrets on day 4 post boost. After prime vaccination, the relative inactivity index of
ferrets inoculated with M2KO(ATM) virus and FM#6 virus was 0.07 and 0.27, respectively.
This reduction in activity was only observed in one group per virus after prime vaccination. After
boost vaccination no reduction in activity level was observed. Changes in body weight and
temperature after virus inoculation are shown in Figure 22 and Figure 23. No weight loss was
observed after vaccination; however, vaccination appeared to have an effect on weight gain.
After vaccination, body weights of OPTI-MEMTM control ferrets increased 20% during the 14
day observation whereas body weight gain of the M2KO(ATM) or FM#6 vaccinated ferrets
ranged from 6-15% after prime and 4-6% after boost. No increase in body temperature was
observed in any groups after vaccination.     Changes in body weight and temperature after
challenge are shown in Figure 24 and Figure 25 and clinical signs summarized in Table 19.

[0247]     After challenge with A/Brisbne/10/2007 (H3N2), a 2-4% loss of body weight was
observed on Day 2 post challenge in all animals. Throughout the 14 day observation period
animal body weights remained below their initial weight. OPTI-MEMTM ferrets lost the most
weight (8%). Weight loss among vaccinated ferrets was dependent on the vaccine regimen.
Ferrets receiving the prime only regimen of M2KO(ATM) or FM#6 lost a maximum of 5% and
4% respectively. Ferrets receiving a booster lost a maximum of 3% for the FM#6 group and 2%
for the M2KO(ATM) group. Elevated body temperatures post challenge were observed on Day 2
in OPTI-MEMTM ferrets and on Day 1 ferrets receiving the prime only regimens of

M2KO(ATM) or FM#6 (Figure 25). Body temperatures for ferrets receiving a booster remained
within normal range.
[0248]    To determine if the vaccination would prevent replication of challenge virus in the
respiratory tract and reduce organ pathology tissues of challenged ferrets were histologically
examined on day 3 post inoculation. Changes in the lungs of animals receiving the
M2KO(ATM) prime only or prime/boost regimen were associated with increase in severity of
mixed cell infiltrates in the lung when compared to the OPTI-MEMTM group. Minor differences
in lung infiltrate incidences were observed between the M2KO(ATM) prime group and the
M2KO(ATM) prime/boost group. An increase in the severity of mixed cell infiltrates in the lung
was also seen in the FM#6 prime group and FM#6 prime/boost group when compared to the
OPTI-MEMTM group. A slight increase in severity in lung mixed cell infiltrates was observed in
the FM#6 prime/boost group over the FM#6 prime only group. In the nasal turbinates, animals
receiving the prime or prime/boost of the M2KO(ATM) virus had lower severity of atrophy of
respiratory epithelium when compared to the OPTI-MEMTM group. There were no differences in
atrophy of the nasal turbinates when comparing prime versus prime/boost M2KO(ATM) groups.
A slight increase in severity of atrophy of respiratory epithelium in animals receiving the FM#6
prime/boost regimen was observed versus animals FM#6 prime only regimen; the severity of
atrophy of respiratory epithelium in all FM#6 animals was lower than that seen in the OPTI
MEMTM     group. There was a decrease in incidence of neutrophilic infiltrates into the nasal cavity
(lumen) in the M2KO(ATM) prime and prime/boost groups compared to the OPTI-MEM TM
group. Neutrophilic luminal infiltrates in the M2KO(ATM) prime only group was interpreted as
not different from the OPTI-MEMTM group. There was a slight increase in severity of luminal
neutrophilic infiltrates in the FM#6 prime only and prime/boost groups when compared to the
OPTI-MEMTM group. The concentrations of pre- and post-challenge virus dosing solutions were
107.83 TCID 5 o/mL and 107.25 TCID 5 o/mL, respectively, indicating good stability of the
challenge material throughout administration.

CONCLUSION
[0254]    This example shows that intranasal administration of the M2KO(ATM) virus was not
associated with any vaccine related adverse events (elevated body temperature, loss of weight or
clinical signs). These results show that the M2KO(ATM) virus of the present technology is
useful for use in an intranasal influenza vaccine.
Example 12:      M2KO(ATM) Virus in Not Transmitted in the Ferret Model
[0255]    Summary - This example demonstrates that the M2KO(ATM) virus is not transmitted
in the ferret model. The M2KO(ATM) virus was administered intransally to 3 female ferrets at a
dose level of 1x10 7 TCID5 0 . As a control, a second group of 3 female ferrets was administered
the A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) virus intranasally at a dose of 1x10 7 TCID5 0 . Twenty four hours
after inoculation, each donor ferret was introduced into a transmission chamber with two naive
ferrets (a direct contact and aerosol contact). Following inoculation, ferrets were observed for 14
days post inoculation for mortality, with body weights, body temperatures and clinical signs
measured daily. Nasal washes were collected from all inoculated donor ferrets on days 1, 3, 5, 7,
9 and from all contact (direct and aerosol) ferrets on days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 to look for viral shedding.
Nasal washes and serum were collected from all ferrets at the inoculation of the study (Day 14)
to evaluate antibody levels. No clinical signs of infection were observed in the M2KO(ATM)

group; however, ferrets in the A/Brisbane/i 0/2007 (H3N2) group had weight loss, increased
body temperatures and were sneezing. After inoculation with Brisbane/i 0, the donor ferrets
exhibited an increase in body temperature 2 days after challenge and a reduction in weight.
Activity levels were not reduced in any groups. Ferrets in direct contact with the donor ferrets
showed progressive weight gain until day 4 post inoculation. A similar trend was observed in the
aerosol contact ferrets beginning on day 6 post inoculation. The loss in body weight in the
contact ferrets correlated with an increase in body temperature. Inoculation with the
M2KO(ATM) virus does not elicit clinical signs of infection in inoculated animals. Spread to
contact ferrets is unlikely.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
[0256]    A. Vaccine Material: The M2KO(ATM) virus is a recombinant virus which possesses
internal 6 genes of PR8 (nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase genes (PA, PB I, PB2), non-structural
(NS), matrix (M)), but which does not express functional M2 protein, as well as HA and NA
genes of Influenza A/Brisbane/10/2007-like A/Uruguay/716/2007(H3N2). M2KO(ATM) virus
was administered intranasally to the animals in a 316 gL dose of ixl07 TCID5 0 (50% Tissue
Culture Infectious Doses).
[0257]    B. Test Article Dose Formulation: The M2KO(ATM) virus dosing solution of Ix10 7
TCID5o/mL per 316 gL was prepared by diluting 45 of ixi0 9 TCID 5 o/mL into 1.377 mL PBS.
[0258]    C. Animals and Animal Care: 22 female ferrets were purchased from Triple F Farms
and 18 of the ferrets were placed on study. Animals were approximately 4 months of age at the
time of study initiation. The animals were certified by the supplier to be healthy and free of
antibodies to infectious diseases. Upon arrival the animals were single housed in suspended wire
cages with slat bottoms, suspended over paper-lined waste pans. The animal room and cages had
been cleaned and sanitized prior to animal receipt, in accordance with accepted animal care
practices and relevant standard operating procedures. Certified Teklad Global Ferret Diet #2072
(Teklad Diets, Madison WI) and city of Chicago tap water were provided ad libitum and were
refreshed at least once daily. Fluorescent lighting in the animal rooms was maintained on a 12-hr
                                                  75

light/dark cycle. Animal room temperature and relative humidity were within respective protocol
limits and ranged from 23.0 to 25.0'C and 36 to 50%, respectively, during the study.
[0259]     D. Animal Quarantine and Randomization: The ferrets were held in quarantine for
seven days prior to randomization and observed daily. Based on daily observations indicating
general good health of the animals the ferrets were released from quarantine for randomization
and testing. Following quarantine, ferrets were weighed and assigned to treatment groups using
a computerized randomization procedure based on body weights that produced similar group
mean values [ToxData® version 2.l.E.1 1 (PDS Pathology Data Systems, Inc., Basel,
Switzerland)]. Within a group, all body weights were within 20% of their mean. Animals
selected for the study receive a permanent identification number by ear tag and transponder and
individual cage cards also identified the study animals by individual numbers and group. The
identifying numbers assigned were unique within the study.
[0260]     E. Experimental Design: To assess the transmissibility of the M2KO(ATM) virus,
ferrets were inoculated with M2KO(ATM) virus or A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) virus. The
animals body weight, body temperature, clinical symptoms and viral shedding were monitored
and immunological responses evaluated. 18 female ferrets (Triple F Farms, Sayre PA), 4 months
of age at the time of study initiation were utilized for the study. All animal procedures were
performed in an animal biosafety level-2 or level 3 facility. Prior to inoculation, ferrets were
monitored for 3 days to measure body weight and establish baseline body temperatures.
Temperature readings were recorded daily through a transponder (BioMedic data systems,
Seaford, DE) implanted subcutaneously in each ferret. Blood was collected prior to study
initiation, and serum tested for influenza antibodies. Only ferrets with HI titers 40 to
A/Brisbane/i 0/2007 (H3N2) virus were considered seronegative and used in this study. Study
animals were randomized and divided into 2 groups (9 ferrets/group, 3/transmission chamber) as
shown in Table 20. Ferrets in group 1 (Chambers A-C) were assigned to receive the
M2KO(ATM) virus. Ferrets in group 2 (Chambers A-C) were assigned to receive the
A/Brisbane/i 0/2007 (H3N2) virus. Within each group, ferrets were divided into inoculated
donors or naive contacts.

   'Each chamber consisted of three female ferrets: an infected donor ferret and 2 naive contact
   ferrets (1 direct contact and 1 aerosol contact).

[0261]       Each group was housed in separate rooms, and individuals working with the animals
followed a strict work flow pattern to prevent cross contamination between the two groups In
each group, one donor ferret was inoculated intranasally with a single dose of 316 gL of 1x10 7
TCID5 0 of M2KO(ATM) (Group I) or 1x10 7 TCID5 0 of A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) virus

naive ferret (direct contact), dual housed within a wire cage. An additional ferret (aerosol
contact) was placed in a separate adjacent wire cage (single housed) within the transmission
chamber separated from the donor's cage by a distance of 10-12 cm. Ferret body temperatures,
weights, and clinical symptoms were monitored daily for 14 days post-inoculation. Nasal washes
were collected from all inoculated donor ferrets on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and from all contact (direct
and aerosol) ferrets on days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 for virus titration in cells. Nasal washes were collected
from all ferrets on day 14 for antibody titration. Nasal wash samples were kept at -65 C.

[0262]    F. Transmission Chambers: Each transmission chamber was 2 cubic meters. A
computerized air handling unit was used for HEPA filtration and to monitor and control
environmental conditions within the transmission chambers. To provide directional airflow,
HEPA-filtered air was supplied through an inlet port located at one end of the chamber, exited
through an outlet port at the opposite end the chamber, HEPA filtered and exhausted into the
room. Air exchange rate was 20 complete air changes per hour for each chamber, airflow was
maintained as <0.1 rm/sec. Chambers were maintained at a negative pressure of -0.15 inches of
water. Ferrets were housed in wire cages with slat bottoms which were suspended over paper
lined waste pans. Ferrets were either dual housed in 32x24x14 cages or single housed in
24x24x14 wire cages which were placed inside each HEPA-filtered transmission chamber.
[0263]    G. Virus Inoculation: Ferrets were inoculated with the M2KO(ATM) virus. A vial of
frozen stock was thawed and diluted to the appropriate concentration in phosphate buffered
saline solution. Ferrets were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and the virus dose administered
intranasally in a volume of 316 gL for the M2KO(ATM). To confirm the inoculation titer of the
M2KO(ATM) virus, aliquots of the dosing solutions were collected prior to dosing (pre-dose)
and after dosing (post-dose). The aliquots were stored at 65'C for virus titration.
[0264]    H. Challenge Virus: Influenza A virus, strain A/Brisbane/10/2007, serotype H3N2 was
used to inoculate the control ferrets. The virus was stored at approximately -65'C prior to use.
The dose level of challenge virus used was prepared at 1xi 07 TCID5 0 in a volume of 316 gL. A
quantitative viral infectivity assay, TCID50 assay was performed at IITRI on a portion of the
prepared viral challenge solution. The viral titer assay was performed according to IITRI
Standard Operating Procedures.
[0265]    I. Moribundity/Mortality Observations: Following challenge, all animals were observed
twice daily for mortality or evidence of moribundity. Animals were observed for 14 days after
vaccine inoculation and for 14 days after challenge.
[0266]    J. Body Weights and Body Weight Change: Body weights were recorded within two
days of receipt and at randomization. All study animals were weighed prior to inoculation, daily
                                                  78

     WO 2012/177924                                                           PCT/US2012/043606
for 14 days following each vaccination and assessed daily for 14 days post challenge. Prior to
inoculation, ferrets were monitored for 3-5 days to measure establish baseline body temperatures.
Temperature readings were recorded daily for 14 days following each vaccination and recorded
daily for 14 days post challenge through a transponder (BioMedic data systems, Seaford, DE)
implanted subcutaneously in each ferret. The change in temperature (in degrees Celsius) was
calculated at each time point for each animal.
[0267]    K. Clinical Observations: The change in temperature (in degrees Celsius) was
determined daily for each ferret. Clinical signs of, inappetence, respiratory signs such as
dyspnea, sneezing, coughing, and rhinorrhea and level of activity was assessed daily. A scoring
system based on that described by Reuman, et al., "Assessment of signs of influenza illness in
the ferret model," J. Virol, Methods 24:27-34 (1989), was used to assess the activity level as
follows: 0, alert and playful; 1, alert but playful only when stimulated; 2, alert but not playful
when stimulated; and 3, neither alert nor playful when stimulated. A relative inactivity index
(RII) was calculated as the mean score per group of ferrets per observation (day) over the
duration of the study.
[0268]    L. Survival Checks: Two survival checks were performed daily on all study animals
throughout the study. Both survival checks occurred simultaneously with the clinical
observations. The second check was performed later within the same day.
[0269]    M. Nasal Washes: Ferrets were anesthetized with a ketamine (25 mg/kg) and xylazine
(2mg/kg) mixture, and 0.5 ml of sterile PBS containing penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100
and gentamicin (50 was injected into each nostril and collected in a specimen cup when expelled
by the ferret.
[0270]    N. Euthanasia: Study animals were euthanized by an intravenous dose of sodium
pentobarbital 150 mg/kg. Death was confirmed by absence of observable heartbeat and
respiration. Necropsies were performed on all study animals.

     WO 2012/177924                                                          PCT/US2012/043606
[0271]    0. Serum Collection: Pre-vaccination serum (days -3 to -5) and post inoculation serum
(day 14) was collected from all ferrets. Ferrets were anesthetized with a ketamine (25 mg/kg) and
xylazine (2mg/kg) mixture. A sample of blood (approximately 0.5-1.0 mL) was collected via the
vena cava from each ferret and processed for serum. Blood was collected into Serum Gel Z/1 .1
tubes (Sarstedt Inc. Newton, NC) and stored at room temperature for not more than 1 hour before
collecting serum. Serum Gel Z/1.1 tubes were centrifuged at 10,000xg for 3 minutes and the
serum collected. Individual pre-inoculation serum samples were collected and two aliquots made
from each sample. One aliquot was tested prior to the initiation of the study to confirm ferrets are
free of antibodies to influenza A viruses and one aliquot of the serum stored at -65'C.
[0272]    P. Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Assay: Serum samples were treated with receptor
destroying enzyme (RDE) (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) to eliminate inhibitors of nonspecific
hemagglutination. RDE was reconstituted per the manufacturer's instructions. Serum was diluted
1:3 in RDE and incubated 18-20 hours in a 37 0 C ± 2'C water bath. After the addition of an equal
volume of 2.5% (v/v) sodium citrate, the samples were incubated in a 56+ 2'C water bath for 30
± 5 minutes. 0.85% NaCI was added to each sample to a final serum dilution of 1:10 after the
RDE treatment. The diluted samples were then diluted into four two-fold dilutions (1:10 to 1:80)
in duplicate in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) then incubated with 4 hemagglutinating units of
A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) influenza A virus. After incubation, 0.5% avian red blood cells
were added to each sample and incubated for 30 ± 5 minutes. Presence or absence of
hemagglutination was then scored.
[0273]    Q. Virus Titers: The concentration of infectious virus in the pre-and post-challenge
virus inoculum samples was determined by TCID50 assay in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney
(MDCK) cells. Briefly, samples kept at -65'C were thawed and centrifuged to remove cellular
debris. The resulting supernatant were diluted 10-fold in triplicate in 96-well microtiter plates in
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing
Pencillin/Streptomycin, 0.10% Gentamicin, 30%NaCO 3 , 0.30% BSA fraction V (Sigma St. Louis,
MO), 1% MEM vitamin solution (Sigma) and 1% L-glutamine (Mediatech, Manassas, VA,
USA). After 10-fold serial dilutions were made, 1 OOflL was transferred into respective wells of
                                                 80

     WO 2012/177924                                                         PCT/US2012/043606
a 96-well plate which contained a monolayer of MDCK cells. Plates were incubated at 37'C
2'C in 5 ± 2% CO 2 70% humidity. After 48 hours, the wells were observed for cytopathogenic
effect (CPE). Supernatant from each well (50 gl) was transferred to a 96 well plate and the
hemagglutination (HA) activity determined and recorded. The HA activity of the supernatant
was assessed by HA assay with 0.5% packed turkey red blood cells (tRBCs). TCID5 0 titers were
calculated using the method of Reed LJ and Muench H, "A simple method for estimating 50%
endpoints," Am. J. Hygiene 27: 493-497 (1938).
[0274]    R. Data Analysis: Body weights and body weight gains (losses) and changes in body
temperature were determined for each individual animal expressed as mean and standard
deviations of the mean for each test group.
RESULTS
[0275]    After inoculation of donor ferrets with either the M2KO(ATM) virus or the
A/Brisbane/i 0/2007 (H3N2) influenza A virus donor ferrets were introduced into transmission
chambers containing naive contact ferrets. Ferrets were monitored daily for clinical signs of
infection, nasal washes were collected to monitor viral shedding and serum collected to measure
serum antibody titers. All ferrets survived inoculation with M2KO(ATM) virus and
A/Brisbane/i 0/2007 (Table 21). No clinical signs of disease were observed in ferrets in the
M2KO(ATM) group. Two of the three donor ferrets inoculated with A/Brisbane/10/2007 virus
presented respiratory signs (sneezing) on Day 6 and 8. Direct contact ferrets in all chambers
presented with sneezing on Day 8. No sneezing was observed in the aerosol contact ferrets. A
reduction in activity level was not observed.

[0276]         Changes in body weight and temperature after virus inoculation are shown in Figure 26
and Figure 27. No significant weight loss was observed after inoculation with the M2KO(ATM)
virus. The aerosol contacts averaged a 1% loss in weight on day; however, it is unlikely this due
to exposure to virus. Body weights of ferrets in the M2KO(ATM) virus increased was 9% for
donor ferrets and 10-11% for contact ferrets during the 14 day observation (Figure 26A). Body
weight gain of the A/Brisbane/10/2007 was only 3% for donor ferrets and 6-8% for contact
ferrets indicating a viral infection (Figure 26B). In the M2KO(ATM) group, body temperatures
remained with in normal levels with the exception of Day 3 post infection (Figure 27A). Body
temperatures were lower than normal for the aerosol contact ferrets. This was attributed to faulty
or failing temperature transponders, temperatures were recorded within normal range throughout
the rest of the study. Elevated body temperatures were observed on Day 2 in A/Brisbane/10/2007
donor ferrets and on Day 7 for aerosol contacts (Figure 27B). The concentrations of pre-and
post-challenge virus dosing solution were 107.50 TCID5 o/mL and 107.25 TCID 5o/mL, respectively,
indicating good stability of the challenge material throughout administration.
                                                                        82

[0277]    Figure 50 shows viral titers in nasal washes from ferrets in a virus transmission study.
The data shows that M2KO(ATM) virus does not transmit (no virus detected), whereas the
control Brisb/10 virus is transmitted.
CONCLUSION
[0278]    This example shows that ferrets inoculated with the A/Brisbane/10/2007 virus exhibited
clinical signs of infection (sneezing, loss in body weight and a transient elevated body
temperature), whereas ferrets inoculated with the M2KO(ATM) virus showed no clinical signs of
disease. Therefore, inoculation of donor ferrets with the M2KO(ATM) did not appear to cause an
infection or transmit virus via contact or via aerosol. These findings show that the M2KO(ATM)
virus of the present technology is useful for intranasal influenza vaccines.
Example 13. M2KO(ATM) Virus Elicits Both Humoral and Mucosal Immune Responses in
Mice.
[0279]    This examples demonstrates that the M2KO(ATM) virus elicits both humoral and
mucosal immune responses in mice. The immunogenicity of M2KO(ATM) was evaluated in
mice and compared to the immune responses generated by other modes of vaccination. An
immunogenicity study was performed containing the following groups as outline in Table 22: 1.

[0280]    To test the immunogenicity of M2KO(ATM) virus, mice were intranasally inoculated
with 1.2x10 4 pfu of M2KO(ATM), 10 pfu of wild-type PR8, 1 gg of inactivated whole PR8
(Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), or PBS as control, along with a group
intramuscularly administered 1 gg of inactivated whole PR8. Three weeks after the
immunization, serum and trachea-lung washes were collected from mice and anti-PR8
immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). Briefly, ELISA plates were coated by whole inactivated PR8, blocked by bovine serum
albumin (BSA), and samples were applied. Mouse IgG and IgA antibodies were detected by
horseradish peroxidase labeled anti-mouse IgG- and IgA- goat antibodies (KPL, Inc.,
Gaithersburg, MD) and SureBlue TMB (KPL, Inc.) substrate.
[0281]    As expected, mice in the immunized groups showed significant elevation of anti-PR8
antibodies in serum and trachea-lung wash compare to the PBS only group (Figure 28). Anti
PR8 IgG levels in sera for M2KO(ATM) virus are higher than the inactivated PR8 groups and
similar to live PR8 virus. More importantly anti-PR8 IgA antibodies were present only in the
PR8 and M2KO(ATM) immunized mice in both sera and trachea-lung washes. These data
suggest that M2KO(ATM) virus elicits significant humoral and mucosal immune response in
mice.

Example 14 M2KO(ATM) Virus Protects Mice From Lethal Homosubtypic and Heterosubtypic
Challenge.
[0282]    This example demonstrates that the M2KO(ATM) virus protects mice from lethal
homosubtypic and heterosubtypic challenge. The protective efficacy M2KO(ATM) virus was
evaluated by challenging the immunized mice with lethal doses of the wild-type PR8 (HINI;
homosubtypic challenge) or mouse-adapted influenza A/Aichi/2/68 (Aichi; H3N2;
heterosubtypic challenge) six weeks post-immunization. None of the mice immunized with
either M2KO(ATM) or 10 pfu of PR8 and subsequently challenged by wild-type PR8 showed
any clinical symptoms including weight loss (Figure 29A). In contrast, naive PBS mice died or
were euthanized due to greater than 20% weight loss by day 5. Virus replication in the
respiratory tracts of challenged mice was determined on day 3 post-challenge by TCID5 0 assay in
MDCK cells. As shown in Figure 30A, no virus was detected (limit of detection
102.75 TCIDso/organ) in the lungs of M2KO(ATM) or PR8 immunized mice indicating that
M2KO(ATM) provided sterile immunity similar to PR8 infection. In contrast, challenge virus
was recovered from the inactivated PR8 and PBS groups.
[0283]    For heterosubtypic challenge, mice were challenged by Aichi (H3N2).      M2KO(ATM)
and wild-type PR8 immunized mice survived challenge whereas mice that received inactivated
PR8 or PBS succumbed to infection (Figure 29). Virus titers in mouse respiratory tracts on day
3 post-challenge did not show significant reduction in M2KO(ATM) -vaccinated mice compared
to mice in other groups (Figure 30). These results suggest that the cross-protection observed
against Aichi challenge may in part be due to T-cell mediated immune responses induced by the
M2KO(ATM) vaccine. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies to Aichi were not detectable
(less than 1:40) in post-challenge sera from challenged mice suggesting that protection was not
mediated by neutralizing antibodies.
[0284]    The M2KO(ATM) virus stimulates both humoral and cellular immune responses and
confers protective immunity to animals against lethal homo- and hetero-subtypic challenge as
summarized in Table 23.

Example 15 M2KO(ATM) Vaccine Compared to Fluzone* and FluMist®
[0285]    This example demonstrates the efficacy of the M2KO(ATM) virus compared to ive
attenuated virus (FluMist*), Fluzone* inactivated flu vaccine. Mice were immunized with
M2KO(ATM) virus, cold adapted live attenuated virus (FluMist®), Fluzone® inactivated flu
vaccine or mock immunized by PBS. M2KO(ATM)-H3 virus was constructed by inserting the
HA and NA coding sequences of Influenza A/Brisbane/10/2007-like,
A/Uruguay/716/2007(H3N2) in to the M2KO(ATM) backbone (SEQ ID NO: 1). FluMist*-H3,
internal genes from the cold-adapted A/AA/6/60 backbone, containing the HA and NA genes of
Influenza A/Brisbane/10/2007-like, A/Uruguay/716/2007(H3N2) was plaque purified from the
2009/20 10 trivalent vaccine formulation. Fluzone* 2009/20 10 formulation was used directly as
the trivalent formulation.
[0286]    Sera was obtained on days 7, 14, 21 post-immunization to compare the kinetics of
antibody response by ELISA (Figure 31). M2KO(ATM)-H3 virus, a replication deficient virus,
developed antibodies earlier than FluMist*-H3, a live flu virus vaccine that undergoes multi

cycle replication in an attenuated manner. The inactivated vaccine Fluzone* had the highest
antibody titers in sera as it is a concentrated presentation of antigen.
[0287]    The presence of anti-HA mucosal antibody in sera, lung wash, and nasal turbinates was
evaluated by ELISA. M2KO(ATM)-H3 and FluMist,* the two live flu vaccines, had higher IgA
in the respiratory tract than the inactivated vaccine Fluzone* . (Figure 32)
Example 16: Comparison of Protection and Immunogenicity Elicited By Live Viruses.
[0288]    Six-week-old female BALB/c mice, anesthetized with isoflurane, were infected
intranasally on days 0 and 28 with 106 TCID5 o/50gl of M2KO(ATM)-H3 (described above),
FluMist® (2009-2010) (H3N2) IVR-147 (PR8xBrisbane/10/2007). IVR-147 is the wild-type
version of the M2KO(ATM) virus; i.e. contains a functional M2 protein. Mock-infected control
mice received 50 pl PBS instead of virus. Serum was collected weekly from all the mice and
analyzed for the presence of anti-HA antibodies by ELISA. As shown in Figure 33,
M2KO(ATM) virus and IVR-147 generated higher antibody levels with rapid kinetics compared
to FluMist®.
[0289]    Body weights of animals were monitored for 14 days after infection. Vaccinated mice
did not lose any weight. On day 21 post-boost, 3 mice per group were euthanized and their
trachea-lung washes, nasal washes, and sera were collected for antibody titer determinations
(Figure 34). M2KO(ATM) induced both humoral and mucosal antibodies to similar levels as
FluMist® and IVR-147 in sera and respiratory tract.
[0290]    Mice were intranasally challenged with 40MLD50 of A/Aichi/2/68 virus six weeks
post-boost. Mice were observed for loss of body weight and survival for 14 days (Figure 35).
M2KO(ATM) protected mice from lethal Aichi challenge as indicated by less body weight loss
(Panel A) and 100% survival (Panel B) in contrast to FluMist®. On day 3 post-challenge, 3 mice
per group were euthanized and their lungs and nasal turbinates were collected for virus titer
determinations (Table 24). M2KO(ATM) controlled the challenge virus better than FluMist® as
shown in Table 24.

Example 17: Generation of an M2KO(ATM) Vaccine Against Highly Pathogenic Avian H5nl
Influenza Virus
 [0291]   Summary: M2KO(ATM) is an influenza virus that lacks expression of a functional M2
protein. The M2 protein is crucial for initiation of influenza viral infection and for efficient viral
RNA incorporation into progeny virions. M2KO(ATM) can enter cells and express viral proteins
but cannot make infectious progeny viruses due to deletion of the M2 gene. M2KO(ATM) is
produced in permissive M2 protein expressing cells but not in non-permissive wild-type cells.
M2KO(ATM) elicits both mucosal and humoral immunity in mice and protects from both homo
and hetero-subtypic lethal challenge.
[0292]    The H5N1 M2KO(ATM) virus contains the HA (avirulent) and NA genes of
A/Vietnam/1203/2004 on the M2KO(ATM) backbone. By "M2KO(ATM) backbone" is meant
the sequence of PR8 comprising the M2KO(ATM) (SEQ ID NO: 1) mutation. The
A/Vietnam/1203/2004 HA (avirulent) and NA sequences used are shown below.

A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) were chemically synthesized by GeneArt* Gene Synthesis based
on the CDC sequences for each gene (CDC ID: 2004706280, Accession Numbers: EF541467
and EF541403). The sequences of the constructs were confirmed and sub-cloned into
appropriate vectors to allow for the generation of seed virus using standard protocols.
[0294]    M2KO(ATM) VN1203avHA,NA (H5N1 M2KO(ATM)) virus was amplified in M2CK
cells (MDCK cells stably expressing the M2 protein), the supernatant clarified of cell debris and
concentrated 100-fold by Centricon Plus-70 (Millipore).     This virus was used as the immunogen
in the mice study.
[0295]    Mouse Study Design:     Mice (7-8 weeks old, female BALB/c) were intranasally
inoculated with H5N1 M2KO(ATM) (106 TCID5O/mouse), M2KO(ATM) CA07HA, NA (106
TCID5 o/mouse) or VN1203 protein (1.5 gg) administered intramuscularly. Body weight and
clinical symptoms were observed for 14 days post-inoculation. Sera was collected on days 7, 14,
21 post-inoculation. Mice were boosted on day 28 with a new prime only group initiated at the
same time.
[0296]    Boost immunization and 'prime only' groups:     On day 28 the mice previously
inoculated with H5N1 M2KO(ATM) were boosted with a second immunization of 106
pfu/mouse. At the same time the 'prime only' groups were given their first dose. Weight loss
was followed for all groups following the day 28 inoculation.     The mice that received a boost
dose of M2KO(ATM) vaccine lost at most 5% of their body weight. The 'prime only' group lost
up to 10% of their body weight.

[0298]     Mice were challenged with a lethal dose of Vietnam/1203/2004 virus (20 MLD5o). All
H5N1 M2KO(ATM) vaccinated (prime only and prime-boost) mice survived (Figures 54 and
55). The high survival rate of mice challenged 5 months post-immunization suggests that the
H5N1 M2KO(ATM) vaccine primes memory responses. Mice challenged 4 weeks post
immunization had received only one dose of vaccine, indicating that the M2KO(ATM) vaccine
stimulates a strong immune response. HlNlpdm M2KO(ATM) immunized mice also survived
H5N1 challenge after 5 months indicating that M2KO(ATM) primes cross-reactive immune
responses that provide protection against heterologous challenge.

[0299]     The HA and NA cDNA clones of A/Califomia/07/2009 (CA07) (HlNlpdm) were
generated by standard molecular biology protocols. The sequences of the constructs were
confirmed and sub-cloned into appropriate vectors to allow for the generation of seed
M2KO(ATM) virus and M2WTCA07/PR8 virus using standard protocols. FluMist® CA07
(HlNlpdm) was plaque purified in MDCK cells from FluMist® 2011-2012 vaccine Lot#

[0300]    Mice (7-8 weeks old, female BALB/c) were intranasally inoculated with M2KO(ATM)
CA07 (106 TCID5o/mouse), M2WT CA07 (106 TCID 5 o/mouse), FluMist* CA07 (106
TCID5o/mouse) or OPTI-MEMTM as naYve control. Body weight and clinical symptoms were
observed for 14 days post-inoculation. Figure 37 shows that M2KO(ATM) and FluMist®
vaccinated mice did not lose weight whereas the virus that contains the WT M2 loses weight and
succumbs to infection. These results demonstrate that deletion of the M2 gene attenuates the
virus and that M2KO(ATM) is attenuated.

M2KO(ATM) immunized mice. In contrast, FluMist® did have virus replication in both the
lung and nasal turbinates although at lower levels than the wild-type virus.
[0302]    Figure 39 M2KO(ATM) and FluMist* titers in sera collected 7, 14, and 21 days post

were reached by both viruses.

Example 19 M2KO(ATM) mRNA Expression Relative to FluMist® and Wild-Type Virus
[0306]    In some embodiments, the M2KO(ATM) virus is produced in cells that stably provide
M2 protein in trans resulting in a virus that has functional M2 protein in the viral membrane but
does not encode M2 in its genome. Therefore, we hypothesize that the M2KO(ATM) virus
behaves similar to wild-type virus in the initial infection and first round of replication in normal
cells. We suggest that mRNA levels of viral antigens are similar to wild-type levels early in
infection and stimulate a potent immune response sooner than attenuated replicating viral
vaccines.
[0307]    Human lung carcinoma (A549) cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5
with M2KO(ATM), FluMist® and wild-type viruses. Unadsorbed virus was removed by washing
five times with PBS. After addition of virus growth media, the infected cells were placed in the
35'C CO 2 incubator. No trypsin was added to the growth medium to ensure single-cycle
                                                    95

replication for all viruses. Cell monolayers were harvested and RNA extracted at 4, 9 and 22
hours post infection.
[0308]    Total RNA (100ng) from control and infected A549 cells were used for quantitative
RT-PCR analysis. cDNA was synthesized with oligo-dT primers and Superscript II reverse
transcriptase(Invitrogen) and quantified by real-time quantitative PCR analysis using gene
specific primers for an early influenza gene, M1, and a late influenza gene, HA and cytokine IP
10 gene. Reactions were performed using SYBR Green reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Reaction efficiency was calculated by using serial 10-fold
dilutions of the housekeeping gene v-actin and sample genes. Reactions were carried out on an
ABI 7300 realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,USA) and the thermal
profile used was Stage 1: 50'C for 30 min; Stage 2: 95'C for 15 min; Stage 3: 94'C for 15 sec,
55'C for 30 sec; and 72'C for 30 see, repeated for 30 cycles. All quantitations (threshold cycle
[CT] values) were normalized to that of the housekeeping gene to generate ACT, and the
difference among the ACT value of the sample and that of the reference (wild-type sample) was
calculated as -AACT. The relative level of mRNA expression was expressed as 2-AACT.
[0309]    M2KO(ATM) virus HA mRNA expression was similar to wild-type M2 virus for H3
(Table 27), PR8 (Table 28) and HlNlpdm (Figure 42) at 4 hour post-infection. Cold-adapted
FluMist® was less than wild-type and M2KO(ATM) in the early timepoints due to slower
replication kinetics. When M1, an early timepoint gene, mRNA expression was tested, similar
results were observed (Table 27, Figure 42). These results suggest that M2KO(ATM) generates
similar levels of mRNA in the early infection cycle to produce de novo viral antigens that create
a 'danger signal' similar to wild-type virus and induce a potent immune response.

[0311]    Generation of M2 Vero cells: The pCMV-PR8-M2 plasmid described earlier and
containing a neomycin resistant gene, was transfected into Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) by using
the Trans IT-LT 1 transfection reagent (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Briefly, on the day before transfection, Vero cells were plated at 5x10 5 cells/100-mm dish. On
day 1, 10 gg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 20 gg of Trans IT-LT1 in 0.3 ml of OptiMEM
(Invitrogen) and was incubated with these cells at 37 0 C in 5% CO 2 overnight. On day 2, the
transfection mixture was replaced with a complete medium that is modified Eagle's medium
(MEM) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum. The medium also contained 1mg/ml of
geneticin (Invitrogen), a broad spectrum antibiotic that is used to select mammalian cells
expressing the neomycin protein. Resistant cells (Vero cells stably expressing M2 gene) began
to grow in the selection medium, the medium was replaced with fresh selection medium and
geneticin-resistant clones were isolated by limited dilution in TC-96 plates. The surface
expression of the M2 protein was demonstrated by immunostaining using a M2 specific
monoclonal antibody, 14C2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
[0312]    Infection of parental and modified M2 Vero cells with M2KO(ATM) virus: The ability
of M2 Vero cells to serve as production cells for M2KO(ATM) virus was tested by infection with
M2KO(ATM)-PR8 virus. Briefly, monolayers of M2 Vero and parent Vero cells were infected
with ten-fold serial dilutions (10-1 to 10-6) of M2KO(ATM)-PR8 virus using standard influenza
infection procedures.    The infected cells were incubated at 35 0 C and observed for cytopathic
effect (CPE) daily. Only M2 Vero cells displayed CPE indicating virus growth. Supernatant
was harvested on day 4 from the 10-3 well and virus titer was determined by TCID5 0 assay on
MDCK cells stably expressing M2 gene (M2CK). M2KO(ATM)-PR8 virus titer grown in M2
Vero cells was 106.75 TCID5 0/ml indicating that M2 Vero cells can serve as production cells for
the manufacture of M2KO(ATM) vaccine.

and using a subcutaneous microneedle device such as that described in published U.S. Patent
Application 2011/0172609. Hairless guinea pigs were inoculated on day 0 and select groups

linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for hemagglutinin-specific IgG responses.
[0314]    Results are shown in Figures 51-53. The data shows qualitative absorbance of antibody
levels to the three strains formulated in the seasonal influenza vaccine FluLaval:
A/Califomia/7/2009 NYMC X-181, A/Victoria/210/2009 NYMC X-187 (an A/Perth/16/2009
like virus), and B/Brisbane/60/2008. At day 30, IM and ID delivery produced identical IgG
responses to all viral HA. The ID prime only groups displayed higher titers at day 60, suggesting
that ID delivery induces long lasting immunity to all viral HA.
