    Background
    As the human population continues to increase, there is a growing need for additional food
    sources, particularly food sources that are inexpensive to produce but nutritious. Moreover, the
    current reliance on meat as the staple of many diets, at least in the most developed countries,
 .0 contributes significantly to the release of greenhouse gases. There is a need for new foodstuffs
    that are less harmful to the environment to produce.
    Requiring only "water and sunlight" to grow, algae have long been looked to as a potential
    source of food. While certain types of algae, primarily seaweed, do indeed provide important
 .5 foodstuffs for human consumption, the promise of algae as a foodstuff has not been fully
    realized. Algal powders made with algae grown photosynthetically in outdoor ponds or
    photobioreactors are commercially available but have a deep green color (from the chlorophyll)
    and a strong, unpleasant taste. When formulated into food products or as nutritional
    supplements, these algal powders impart a visually unappealing green color to the food product
 .0 or nutritional supplement and have unpleasant fish, seaweed or other flavors.
    There are several species of algae that are used in foodstuffs today, most being macroalgae such
    as kelp, purple laver (Porphyra,used in nori), dulse (Palmariapalmate) and sea lettuce (Ulva
    lactuca). Microalgae, such as Spirulina (Arthrospiraplatensis) are grown commercially in open
25  ponds (photosynthetically) for use as a nutritional supplement or incorporated in small amounts
    in smoothies or juice drinks (usually less than 0.5% w/w). Other microalgae, including some
    species of Chlorella are popular in Asian countries as a nutritional supplement.
    Poor flavor is a major factor that has impeded the widespread adoption of microalgae in food.
    W02010/12093 discloses methods of making and using microalgal biomass as a food. That
30  reference discloses the growth of microalgae in the dark, to produce a microalgal biomass.

    However, further improvements in flavor of microalgal biomass should promote further
    adoption.

    Detailed Description of Embodiments of the Invention
    Definitions
    In connection with a culture medium, "dissolved oxygen," abbreviated as "DO" means the
    relative oxygenation of the culture medium as compared to the oxygenation of a culture medium
  5 that is in oxygen equilibrium with the atmosphere.
    A "microalgal flour" is a dry, particulate composition, fit for human consumption, comprising
    cells of microalgae.
    As used herein, an "off-flavor" means a flavor that a consumer would not expect and/or is
    undesired in a food, for example a baked food, such as a cake. Examples of off-flavors include
 .0 flavors of cabbages or fish. Although specific flavors may be measured by modem analytical
    techniques such as Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (abbreviated as GC-MS), often the
    most convenient and effective tool for measuring off-flavors is a tasting panel comprised of
    humans. In connection with human perception of off flavors, these may be determined by a
    sensory panel of, for example, 10 people, where absence of a flavor or odor is established when 2
 .5 or fewer of the 10 people can detect the flavor, or by performing enough tests to establish
    statistical significance.
    Overview
    The preferred embodiments of the present invention are rooted in the discovery that certain
    strains of microalgae can produce an appetizing biomass in terms of flavor, odor and color, when
 .0 cultivated and processed under particular conditions. The improved flavor is believed to result
    not just from the absence of off-flavors but from the presence of desirable flavor compounds
    produced during cultivation and/or processing. In the Examples below, the microalgae is a strain
    of Chlorellaprotothecoides cultivated heterotrophically, in the dark, but could be another species
    of Chlorellaor other species of Chlorophyta, provided that a non-green color can be produced
25  via heterotrophic cultivation and careful processing such as by using the methods given below.
    By use of these techniques, the product may fall within the newly identified acceptability
    criterion disclosed here.
    Human sensory panel data on multiple batches of microalgal flour was correlated with data from
    an extensive analysis of flavor and odor compounds of varying solubility in water to identify a
                                                      8

    clustering in flavor/odor space as represented by a principal component analysis. Thus, a
    microalgal flour that falls within the identified cluster has a high probability of being acceptable
    for human consumption.
    Fig. 1 is a flow diagram of a process for producing microalgal flour having low amounts of off
  5 flavors, in accordance with embodiments of the invention. The resulting flour may be
    incorporated into a variety of foods and beverages.

    Production of improved microalgal flour
 .0 Microalgae are cultured (step 105). It has been found that culturing the microalgae in the dark
    creates microalgal biomass having lower levels of off-flavors such as mushroom and cabbage or
    fish flavors; e.g., when microalgal flour dispersed in deionized water at 10% (w/v), and
    evaluated by a human sensory panel. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the microalgae are
    cultured heterotrophically, in the dark on a fixed (i.e. non-C0 2) carbon source. While glucose
 .5 was used in the examples below, other fixed carbon sources such as fructose, sucrose/fructose
    mixtures, or acetic acid/acetate may produce comparable results. The sugar concentration can be
    controlled by continuous feeding. Favorable results have been achieved with a glucose
    concentration of between 3 and 10 g/l.    Suitable genera of microalgae include Chlorella and
    Protetheca. For example, Chlorellaprotothecoides,Protothecamoriformis or Protothecazopfii
 .0 may be used. Other species of Chlorella used for human nutrition, such as Chlorella
    protothecoides can also be grown and processed as disclosed here. Combinations of microalgal
    species or strains may also be used. Optionally, the microalgal cells are mutated and a strain
    selected to be substantially reduced in pigment that may change the color of a food product into
    which the biomass is incorporated. In the examples below, it was found that suitable flavor and
25  no observable green color could be obtained from cells of Chlorellaprotothecoides. For
    example, the flour may comprise less than 200, 20, or 2 ppm of chlorophyll. In the examples
    below, the color was found to be yellow/gold, but could also be, for example, pale-yellow, off
    white, or white depending on the strain and cultivation/processing codimnditions used.

    The microalgae are cultured to a desired density and lipid concentration. The lipid concentration
    may be increased by culturing under nutrient-limiting and especially nitrogen-limiting
    conditions. In embodiments of the invention, culturing is performed under conditions of limiting
    nitrogen so that the microalgae reach 10-20%, 20-30% 40-50%, 40-60%, 30-70%, 35-75%, 50
  5 60%, 60-70%, or 70-85% lipid, as measured by dry cell weight. In the exemplified
    embodiments, the microalgae comprise about 50% lipid. Elevated levels of lipid are especially
    useful in producing food products with improved fat and cholesterol profiles or improving the
    mouthfeel of such products. When a high lipid microalga is used to produce the flour, the
    stickiness of the lipid can be an impediment to forming a flour that is measurable and/or
 .0 flowable. Alternately, cultivation under nitrogen-replete conditions can give a high-protein
    microalgal flour, such as flour can have, for example 5-20% or 10-18% lipid by dry cell weight.
    As described below, drying methods have been identified that give a flowable powder while
    retaining the desirable taste, odor and color characteristics.
    The microalgae may be cultured in an opaque culture vessel. The microalgae may be cultured
 .5 under aerobic conditions. Surprisingly, it has been found that increasing the oxygen level to
    30% DO or more during heterotrophic culture of Chlorellaprotothecoides can result in a
    microalgal biomass having improved flavor. Variation of ±30% in DO (i.e., 30±9%DO) is
    contemplated. In addition, elevated oxygen (e.g., >40% DO, >50% DO, >60% DO, or 60-70%
    DO) during fermentation can result in a microalgal biomass having a white or off-white color
 .0 with low amounts of off-flavors. Whiteness may be measured with a Hunter colorimeter. In an
    embodiment, the whiteness is greater than the whiteness of a control sample of microalgal
    biomass grown at about 30-40% DO. In a specific embodiment, the oxygen is elevated to about
    60-70% dissolved oxygen. Increased oxygenation can be achieved, for example, by the
    introduction of purified oxygen.
25  The flavor may be improved by culturing the microalgae at a desired pH. For example, the pH
    could be from 4 to 9, or from 5 to 8. The pH may be controlled using buffering and/or pH
    monitoring with titration. If an acidic pH is used, the pH can be neutralized by adjusting to a pH
    of 6 to 8 or 6.5 to 7.8, or about 7; e.g., prior to drying to avoid astringent flavor. The final flour
    may be characterized by a pH of 5.5-8.5, 6.0-8.0, or 6.5-7.5 for a 1% w/v solution of flour in
30  water.

     5496D-AU-D1
     After culturing, the microalgae are inactivated (step 110). Inactivation conditions are chosen to
     be sufficient to inactivate enzymes that produce off-flavors. These conditions may also kill the
     microalgae or stop growth of the microalgae and contaminating species, if any. It has been
     found that rigorous pasteurization (i.e., at high temperature and/or long times) can lead to
  5  undesirable flavor/odor, while treatment that is not rigorous enough also can lead to unacceptable
     flavor/odor. Thus, when pasteurization is used, a delicate balance must be struck. Experiments
     have shown that a high-temperature-short time pasteurization ("HTST") treatment regime can be
     used to produce an acceptable microalgal biomass product. For example, the temperature of the
     treatment may be from 70'C to 95'C, or 72'C to 90'C, for from 10 to 180, 30 to 120, or 45 to 90
 .0  seconds.    In one embodiment, microalgae are treated at 75'C for 1 minute by flowing the
     cultured microalgal broth through a heat exchanger into a collection vessel. Cooling of the
     HTST output is preferred to avoid prolonged heating. Similar results should be obtainable by
     adjustment of both time and temperature. Delay prior to inactivation should be minimized so as
     to prevent the development of off-flavors, which are believed to be created by enzyme activity.
 .5  Thus, in an embodiment of the present invention, the step of inactivating enzymes is performed
     without delay of a time sufficient to allow production in the microalgae of enzymatically
     developed off -flavors. Culture at an acidic pH may also allow for an even more gentle
     pasteurization to be used. For example, the microalgal cells can be cultured at a pH of from 5 to
     6.5, followed by pasteurization at from about 60 to about 70'C for 1 minute, and neutralization
  o0 prior to drying.
     To further improve flavor, the microalgal cells may be washed (step 115). Without wanting to
     be bound by theory, the washing may remove off-flavors. In addition, using an inactivation step
     prior to washing may permeabilize the cells or otherwise promote the removal of unwanted
     flavors or odors from the microalgal biomass. Washing may be performed by centrifugation,
25   filtration, dialysis or other method known in the art. Optionally, the washing is performed with a
     volume of wash liquid (e.g., water or buffer) that is as great or greater than the volume of the
     microalgal cells (e.g., as measured by centrifugation).    The volume of wash liquid may be twice
     the volume of the cells, or preferably, at least 3 times the volume of the cells. It was found that
     centrifugation in 6.4 times the cell volume gave a microalgal biomass with favorable flavor.
30   Accordingly, in an embodiment of the present invention, the cells are washed with between 3
     and 12 volumes of water. For these purposes, measurement of the cell volume is accomplished
                                                        11

    5496D-AU-D1
    by dewatering the cells (i.e., removing them from the liquid growth medium). For example, the
    cells may be dewatered by centrifugation or filtration. Optionally, the washing step may be
    repeated one or more times.
    Optionally, after washing, a preservative may be added (step 120). For example, sodium
  5 benzoate and/or potassium sorbate may be added as a bacteriostatic and fungistatic agent. Since
    sodium benzoate is more active under acidic conditions, the pH may be lowered as necessary. In
    that case, the pH can be raised later in the process to avoid an unwanted acidic flavor.
    Optionally, the microalgal cells are then lysed (step 125). The lysis may be partial, or complete.
    For example, from 5% to 95% or a majority (>50%) of the cells may be lysed. Lysis may be
 .0 especially desirable to release lipids in a high-lipid microalgae, where release of the lipids
    improves the quality or nutritional value of a food product into which the microalgal biomass is
    incorporated. Lysis may be accomplished with a bead mill, or any other suitable method known
    in the art. Optionally, a majority of the cells can be lysed. In one embodiment, about 30-75% of
    the microalgal cells are lysed. In another embodiment, about       3 0 -7 5 % of the microalgal cells are
 .5 lysed and the microalgal cells have about 30-75% lipid by dry cell weight. In yet another
    embodiment, the microalgal cells are    6 0 - 9 0 % lysed. This combination of parameters is believed
    to lead to a microalgal biomass that improves the mouthfeel, air-holding capacity or other
    functional parameters of a food into which it is integrated, while avoiding difficulties in drying
    or other processing steps that may be associated with highly lysed cells. In Example 3 below, the
 .0 cells were lysed to about 80%.
    Optionally, the biomass may be homogenized (step 130). For example, the suspension
    containing the cells and/or lysed cells may be forced through a narrow channel or orifice at
    elevated pressure (i.e., use of a high-pressure homogenizer). Other types of homogenizers such
    as blade or ultrasonic homogenizers may also be employed.
25  An antioxidant may be added to enhance the shelf life of the biomass (step 135). For example,
    tocopherols, BHA, BHT, rosemary extract, or other suitable food-grade antioxidants can be used.
    In addition to enhancement of shelf life, addition of antioxidant at the stage may prevent
    unwanted oxidation flavors from forming in the drying step. At this stage, addition of a base to
                                                          12

    5496D-AU-D1
    raise the pH may prevent astringent flavors associated with a low pH if low pH conditions were
    used in upstream processes.
    Prior to drying (e.g., after homogenization and before or after the optional addition of
    antioxidant), the microalgae can be held at elevated temperature for a period of time (140).
  5 Without wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that this step promotes stability of the
    flavor, ensures inactivation of enzymes, and may promote the formation of positive flavors. For
    example, a suspension of lysed microalgae can be held at 70-85' for 1-6 minutes. In the
    Example 3 below for which acceptable sensory properties were obtained in the flour produced,
    this heating step was performed at 77'C for 3 minutes. Comparable results may be obtained, for
 .0 example, by heating at about 87'C for about 90 seconds or about 67'C for about 6 minutes.
    The biomass is then dried (step 145). In one embodiment, in order to form a flour (a powder
    like) substance, the biomass is spray dried. The spray drying may use, for example, a box-dryer,
    or a tall-form spray-dryer, a fluidized bed dryer, or a moving fluidized bed dryer (e.g., a
    FilterMat@ spray dryer, GEA Process Engineering, Inc.). Example 3 describes conditions used
 .5 for drying with a FilterMat drier.
    The resulting flour may be measureable or flowable, even if high in lipid (e.g, 30-70 or 40-60%
    lipid by dry cell weight). In a specific embodiment, the flour has an aerated density of 0.30 to
    0.50, a bulk density of 0.50 to 0.65, an oversize of 15-35% by weight at 2000 pm (i.e., %too
    large to pass through a 2000 pm sieve), 40-70% at 1400 pm and 1-20% at 800 pim, a wetability
 .0 of 1-25 mm, and a surface area of 0.1 to 0.7 m2/g.
    To test wetability:
               -  introduce 500 ml of deionized water at 20'C into a 600 ml squat-form beaker
                  (Fisherbrand FB 33114),
25             -  place 25 g of the microalgal flour powder uniformly at the surface of the water,
                  without mixing,
               -  observe the behavior of the powder after 3 h of contact,
               -  measure the height of the product that has penetrated the surface of the water and
                  settled at the bottom of the beaker.
                                                       13

    5496D-AU-D1
    The aerated bulk density is determined using a conventional method of measuring aerated bulk
    density, i.e. by measuring the mass of an empty container (g) of known volume, and by
    measuring the mass of the same container filled with the product to be tested.
  5            -    The difference between the mass of the filled container and the mass of the empty
                   container, divided by the volume (ml) then gives the value of the aerated bulk
                   density.
               -   For this test, the 100 ml container, the scoop used for filing and the scraper used are
                   supplied with the apparatus sold by the company Hosokawa under the trademark
 .0                Powder Tester type PTE.
               -   To perform the measurement, the product is screened through a sieve with apertures
                   of 2000 pm (sold by SAULAS). The density is measured on the product that is not
                   retained on that screen.
    The specific surface area is determined over the whole of the particle size distribution of the
 .5 microalgal flour granules, e.g., by means of a Quantachrome specific surface area analyzer based
    on a test for absorption of nitrogen onto the surface of the product subjected to the analysis,
    carried out on a SA3 100 apparatus from Beckmann Coulter, according to the technique described
    in the article BET Surface Area by Nitrogen Absorption by S. BRUNAUER et al. (Journal of
    American Chemical Society, 60, 309, 1938).
 .0 The microalgal flour is tested for acceptable flavor, color odor, and/or mouthfeel (step 150). For
    example, a human sensory panel may be employed and/or analytical technology such as
    headspace GC-MS, SPME, or SBSE. Optionally, the flavor may be evaluated to determine if it
    is grouped with or falls within boundaries associated with acceptable flavor determined by a
    prior sensory panel and/or analytical testing. The groupings/boundaries may be determined with
25  the use of principal component analysis (PCA) (see Examples below). An acceptable lot may
    then be selected for packaging and future use.
    After drying and optional testing, the biomass may undergo any further processing or packaging
    (step 155) needed to make a microalgal flour or a food product that incorporates the biomass.
    For example, to make microalgal flour, the biomass may be agitated or passed through a screen.
                                                       14

    5496D-AU-D1
    The microalgal flour may also be mixed with other ingredients to make a soup, sauce, dough,
    cake, cookie, dry baked-good mix, etc. Testing can also be performed according to Examples 4,
    5 and 8, below.
    In accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention, any two or more of the above
  5 mentioned techniques can be combined to reach a heretofore unprecedented flavor in a
    microalgal biomass product, such as microalgal flour. For example, HTST treatment followed
    by washing with liquid as described above can produce microalgal flour having low off-flavor.
    Oxygenation during cultivation and other steps as described above may further improve the
    flavor.
 .0 By selecting an appropriate microalgal strain and using the methods disclosed herein, a
    microalgal biomass or flour made from the biomass having acceptable sensory characteristics
    may result. The microalgal flour may be non-green and have undetectable levels of fish,
    mushroom or cabbage flavors or odors when diluted in water at a ratio (by volume) of 1:2, 1:5,
    1:10, 1:20, 1:30, or 1:40. In an embodiment, off flavors of fish and cabbage are undetectable
 .5 when diluted 1:20 by volume in water, as detected by a tasting panel.
    The following flavor/odor compounds were determined by the methods of Examples 4 or 5 and
    are believed to correlate with acceptable sensory testing: undecalactone (400-1800ppb), 3
    methyl butanal (0-1 1,000ppb), pentanal (160-10,700ppb), 2-methyl butanal (0-2500ppb), 2
    pentanone (39-10,600ppb), 3-pentene-2-one (0-1500ppb).
 .  Acceptable samples also had less than threshold amounts of pyrrole, pyrazine, or pyridines
    containing compounds, while these compounds were found in the sample of Chlorella vulgaris
    obtained from www.nuts.com, which was green and unacceptable in flavor and odor.
    In an preferred embodiment, the microalgal flour produced by the methods described above
    retain the low amounts of off-flavors mentioned for at least 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months or 6
25  months when stored in the dark at room temperature in moisture and oxygen impermeable
    packaging (e.g. a Mylar@ food storage bag).
                                                    15

    5496D-AU-D1
    Optionally, larger particles, granules or pellets can be made from the dried microalgal material.
    For example, the flour can be agglomerated, granulated, extruded, or pelletized using a variety of
    methods known in the art.
    Example 1. Production of microalgal flour at low pH and using a low-pigment strain.
  5 Multiple fermentations of Chlorellaprotothecoides were performed at scales ranging from 7 L to
    1000 L. Two strains of Chlorellaprotothecoides were used: strain A, and strain B, a low
    pigment mutant. Fermentation was performed in the dark on glucose as a fixed carbon source at
    a pH of about 5 to 6. After fermentation, the fermentation broth containing the microalgae was
    heat treated to inactivate the microalgae, immediately diluted with excess water, centrifuged to
 .0 wash and concentrate the microalgae, the cells were lysed by milling, then spray-dried to make a
    microalgal flour. The microalgal flour made from Strain A was light yellow in color and the
    microalgal flour made from strain B was tan in color. A fermentation of strain B was also
    performed at about neutral pH.
    Example 2. Low-color flour using high oxygen conditions.
 .5 Strain B was cultivated in at high (about 60%-70%) and low levels (about 30-40%) of dissolved
    oxygen and treated as in Example 1 to form microalgal flour. For the high oxygen experiment,
    reduced yellow color was noted in the broth, centrifuged biomass and in the final flour as
    compared to the microalgae produced at lower oxygen.
    Example 3: Production of improved microalgal flour.
20  A seed culture of Chlorellaprotothecoides was added to a defined medium broth to give 9,000 L
    of culture. Heat-sterilized glucose (55% w/w) was used as a carbon source. Dissolved oxygen
    was held to a minimum of 30% by controlling aeration, backpressure and agitation in the
    fermentor. The cultivation temperature was 28'C. The pH of the broth was 6.8 at the start of
    cultivation and dropped to about 6 over the course of cultivation. Glucose was fed to a
25  concentration of 3-10 g/L concentration.     Growth was continued over 4-5 days to the mid-log
    phase as measured by OD750. The resulting product had a dry cell weight (DCW) of 18.5%
    w/v. The nitrogen level in the growth medium was limiting to force the microalgae to
    accumulate approximately 50% lipid as a result of extended sugar feeding.

    5496D-AU-D1
    The broth was then heat-treated by online HTST at 75'C for 1 min and cooled to 6.2'C, then
    stored at 7'C. The HTST-treated broth was then washed by 6.4-fold dilution in decarbonated
    water and centrifuged using an Alfa Laval FEUX 510 centrifuge.
    The pH was lowered to pH to 4.1 with 75% phosphoric acid and 500 ppm sodium benzoate
  5 /1000ppm potassium sorbate (on dry basis) were added as a preservative.
    The material was then stored under agitation below 10 C.
    Lysis was accomplished by milling in a NETZSCH LME500 bead mill using 0.5 mm zirconium
    silicate beads to give 88% cell disruption. The outlet was cooled to 6'C.
    Ascorbic acid (150 ppm on a dry basis) and mixed tocopherols (500 ppm on a dry basis) were
 .0 added to the material to prevent oxidation. Potassium hydroxide was added to neutralize the pH.
    The material was then heated to 77'C for 3 minutes.
    Drying was accomplished on a Filtermat FMD125 drier with a cyclone. The nozzle pressure was
    160-170bar.

    50'C for 20 min while stirring with the orbital shaker of the Gerstel MPS2. The SPME fiber used
    was DVB/CAR/PDMS (Divinylbenzene/Carboxen/ Polydimethylsiloxane), df 50/30 ptm. The
    fiber was desorbed at 260'C in the Agilent split/splitless injector for 3 min. Volatiles were
20  desorbed into a Leco Pegasus GC-TOFMS and separated on a DB5-MS column (30m, 0.25 mm,
    0.25 um) with helium carrier gas flow at 1.0 mL/min. The initial column temperature was 40'C
    (for 3 min) and then increased to 270'C at 15'C/min and held at 270'C for 5 min. Mass detection
    was performed in the electron impact mode (El). All injections were splitless. Peak identification
    is based on comparison of El mass spectra in samples to El mass spectra of the NIST Library.

   Twister. One gram of NaCl was then added to the sample and extraction was continued for
   another hour. The technique is known as sequential SBSE. The Twister is then removed from the
 5 sample, rinsed with distilled water, patted dry with a lintless cloth and thermally desorbed in a
   Gerstel TDU used in the splitless mode. With the TDU, desorbed volatiles were initially trapped
   at -100'C; the volatiles trapped on the Twister were then desorbed at 280'C for 3 min. Volatiles
   were desorbed into an Agilent GC-MSD and separated on a DB5-MS column (30m, 0.25 mm,
   0.25 um) with helium carrier gas flow at 1.0 mL/min. The initial column temperature was 40'C

   duplicate by SBSE and SPME as in Examples 4 and 5, were used. In addition, sensory testing
   was done using a panel of volunteers. Scaled principal component analysis (using a correlation
   matrix) was performed with R software version 2.15.1 (The R project for Statistical Computing,
   www.r-project.org) using the prcomp function. Three principal components were found that well
 5 characterize the variation in flavor/odor compounds. Vectors defining the three principal
   components are listed in the table below as PC 1, PC2, and PC3 along with the method used for
   determining each compound. A cluster of samples was found in this reduced-dimensional space
   that correlated with the samples having acceptable sensory characteristics.

   Example 8: Determination of bounds for acceptable flavor
   Based on the PCA analysis of Example 7, the FactomineR package v. 1.2.1 (Husson, et al.) was used to
   statistically define the cluster of samples that correlated with the acceptable sensory testing. The result
   of the FactomineR analysis was 3 ellipsoids in the three dimensions of PCl, PC2 and PC3; the ellipsoids
 5 characterize 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from center point of the cluster associated with the positive
   human sensory analysis (solid circles from the graph of Example 7). Each 3-dimensional ellipsoid is
   defined by 3 orthogonal 2-dimensional ellipses defined by the equation Ax2+Bxy+Cy 2+Dx+Ey+F                        = 0
   using the data in the table below for the values of A, B, C, D, E, and F. Thus, samples falling within the
   smallest ellipsoid will be expected to have a positive sensory analysis by a human panel about 99.7% of
.0 the time, samples falling within only the mid-sized ellipsoid will be expected to have a positive sensory
   analysis by a human panel about 95% of the time, and samples falling only within the largest ellipsoid
   will be expected to have a positive sensory analysis by a human panel about 68% of the time.

    Example 9: QC Analysis using results of PCA analysis
    The ellipsoids of Example 8 can be used to determine if a sample falls within the cluster
 5  associated with positive flavor. For example, a quality-control experiment can be performed on
    a batch of microalgal flour produced according to the methods given above. The flour is
    analyzed by SPME and SBSE as in Examples 4 and 5 and then one determines if the data falls
    within one or more of the ellipsoids of Example 8.
    To do this, one can use the following procedure (though others may be applicable): Start with
.0  relative concentration for 105 compounds. From each concentration subtract its center factor and
    divide by its scale factor (given in the table below), this centers and scales the data. Take the dot
    product of the scaled and centered data and the principal component (PC) loadings , this will
    yield one value for each PC. Divide each value by its associated plotting factor, this will allow
    the data point to be plotted in three dimensional algal-chemical space. If the point falls within
.5  the space bounded by the confidence ellipsoid it is not statistically different (p < 0.05). For
    example, if the point falls within the space bounded by the 95% confidence ellipsoid it is not
    statistically different (p < 0.05).
