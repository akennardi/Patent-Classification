                                        ABSTRACT
A water soluble polymer, in particular polysialic acid (PSA) or a modified PSA (mPSA), is
conjugated to an oxidized carbohydrate moiety of a glycoprotein other than a blood
coagulation protein or to a ganglioside or drug delivery system by contacting the oxidized
carbohydrate moiety with the water soluble polymer, wherein said water soluble polymer
contains an aminooxy group and an oxime linkage is formed between the oxidized
carbohydrate moiety and the aminooxy group on the water soluble polymer or wherein said
water soluble polymer contains a hydrazide group and a hydrazone linkage is formed between
the oxidized carbohydrate moiety and the hydrazide group on the water soluble polymer.
Conjugates of aminooxy- or hydrazide-water soluble polymer, such as PSA and mPSA, are
thus obtained in which the PSA or mPSA is attached via a carbohydrate moiety.

      GLYCOPOLYSIALYLATION OF NON-BLOOD COAGULATION PROTEINS
                                   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0000]      The present application is a divisional application of Australian Application No.
2015242970, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.
[0001]      The present invention relates to materials and methods for conjugating water soluble
polymers, in particular polysialic acid, to carbohydrate-containing compounds, in particular
glycoproteins other than a blood coagulation proteins, and to the conjugates obtained.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]      Conjugation of polypeptide drugs such as by PEGylation or polysialylation protects
them from degradation in the blood circulation and thus improves their pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic profiles (Harris and Chess, Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2003;2:214-21).               The
PEGylation process attaches repeating units of ethylene glycol (polyethylene glycol (PEG)) to
a polypeptide drug. PEG molecules have a large hydrodynamic volume (5-10 times the size
of globular proteins), are highly water soluble and hydrated, non-toxic, non-immunogenic and
rapidly cleared from the body. PEGylation of molecules can lead to increased resistance of
drugs to enzymatic degradation, increased half-life in vivo, reduced dosing frequency,
decreased immunogenicity, increased physical and thermal stability, increased solubility,
increased liquid stability, and reduced aggregation. The first PEGylated drugs were approved
by the FDA in the early 1990s. Since then, the FDA has approved several PEGylated drugs
for oral, injectable, and topical administration.
[0003]      Sialic acids (also called N-acetyl neuraminic acids) and polysialic acids are found
widely distributed in animal tissues and to a lesser extent in other species ranging from plants
and fungi to yeasts and bacteria, mostly in glycoproteins and gangliosides.
[0004]      The abbreviation "PSA" used herein refers to the term "polysialic acid". Similarly, the
term "mPSA" used herein refers to the term "modified polysialic acid".
[0005]      PSAs consist of polymers (generally homopolymers) of N-acetylneuraminic acid. The
secondary amino group normally bears an acetyl group, but it may instead bear a glycolyl
group. Possible substituents on the hydroxyl groups include acetyl, lactyl, ethyl, sulfate, and
phosphate groups.

                        Structure of sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid)
100061    PSAs and mPSAs generally comprise linear polymers consisting essentially of N
acetylneuraminic acid moieties linked by 2,8- or 2,9- glycosidic linkages or combinations of
these (e.g. alternating 2,8- and 2,9- linkages). In particularly preferred PSAs and mPSAs, the
glycosidic linkages are a-2,8.       Such PSAs and mPSAs are conveniently derived from
colominic acids, and are referred to herein as "CAs" and "mCAs". Typical PSAs and mPSAs
comprise at least 2, preferably at least 5, more preferably at least 10 and most preferably at
least 20 N-acetylneuraminic acid moieties. Thus, they may comprise from 5 to 500 N
acetylneuraminic acid moieties, preferably from 10 to 300 N-acetylneuraminic acid moieties.
PSAs and CAs can be polymers comprising different sugar moieties. They can be
copolymers. PSAs and CAs preferably are essentially free of sugar moieties other than N
acetylneuraminic acid. PSAs and CAs preferably comprise at least 90%, more preferably at
least 95% and most preferably at least 98% N-acetylneuraminic acid moieties.
 [00071    Where PSAs and CAs comprise moieties other than N-acetylneuraminic acid (as,
 for example in mPSAs and mCAs) these are preferably located at one or both of the ends of
 the polymer chain. Such "other" moieties may, for example, be moieties derived from
 terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid moieties by oxidation or reduction.
 [00081    For example, WO-A-0187922 describes such mPSAs and mCAs in which the non
 reducing terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid unit is converted to an aldehyde group by reaction
 with sodium periodate. Additionally, WO 2005/016974 describes such mPSAs and mCAs in
 which the reducing terminal N-acetyineuraminic acid unit is subjected to reduction to
 reductively open the ring at the reducing terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid unit, whereby a
 vicinal diol group is formed, followed by oxidation to convert the vicinal diol group to an
 aldehyde group.

[0009]    Sialic acid rich glycoproteins bind selectin in humans and other organisms. They
play an important role in human influenza infections. For example, sialic acid can hide
mannose antigens on the surface of host cells or bacteria from mannose-binding lectin. This
prevents activation of complement. Sialic acids also hide the penultimate galactose residue
thus preventing rapid clearance of the glycoprotein by the galactose receptor on the hepatic
parenchymal cells.

[00101    CAs are produced, inter alia, by particular strains of Escherichia coli possessing
the KI antigen. CAs have many physiological functions. They are important as a raw material
for drugs and cosmetics.
[0011]    Comparative studies in vivo with polysialylated and unmodified asparaginase
revealed that polysialylation increased the half-life of the enzyme (Fernandes and
Gregoriadis, Biochimica Biophysica Acta 1341: 26-34, 1997).
100121    The preparation of conjugates by forming a covalent linkage between the water
soluble polymer and the therapeutic protein can be carried out by a variety of chemical
methods. One approach for coupling PSA to therapeutic proteins is the conjugation of the
polymers via the carbohydrate moieties of the protein. Vicinal hydroxyl (OH) groups of
carbohydrates in proteins can be easily oxidized with sodium periodate (NaIO 4) to form
active aldehyde groups (Rothfus and Smith, J Biol Chem 1963; 238:1402-10; van Lenten and
Ashwell, J Biol Chem 1971;246:1889-94). Subsequently the polymer can be coupled to the
aldehyde groups of the carbohydrate by use of reagents containing, for example, an active
hydrazide group (Wilchek M and Bayer EA, Methods Enzymol 1987;138:429-42). A more
recent technology is the use of reagents containing aminooxy groups which react with
aldehydes to form oxime linkages (WO 96/40662, W02008/025856).

                                              -4
100131     Additional examples describing conjugation of a PSA to a therapeutic protein are
described in US Publication No. 2009/0076237 which teaches the oxidation of rFVItl and
subsequent coupling to PSA and other water soluble polymers (e.g. PEG, HES, dextran)
using hydrazide chemistry; WO 2008/025856 which teaches oxidation of different
coagulation factors, e.g. rFIX, FVIII and FVIIa and subsequent coupling to a polymer, e.g.
PEG.
[0014]     Recently, an improved method was described comprising mild periodate oxidation
of sialic acids to generate aldehydes followed by reaction with an aminooxy group containing
reagent in the presence of catalytic amounts of aniline (Dirksen A and Dawson PE,
Bioconjugate Chem. 2008;19,2543-8; and Zeng Y et at., Nature Methods 2009;6:207-9). The
aniline catalysis dramatically accelerates the oxime ligation, allowing the use of very low
concentrations of reagents.
[0015]     Notwithstanding the methods available of conjugating water soluble polymers to
therapeutic proteins, there remains a need to develop materials and methods for conjugating
water soluble polymers to carbohydrate-containing compounds other than blood coagulation
proteins that improve the compound's pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic properties
while minimizing the costs associated with the various reagents.
                              SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
10016]     The present invention provides materials and methods for conjugating a water
soluble polymer to a carbohydrate-containing compound other than a blood coagulation

while minimizing the costs associated with the various reagents.
100171     In one embodiment of the invention there is provided a method of conjugating a

perruthenate (KRuO4).

                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0034]     The pharmacological and immunological properties of carbohydrate-containing
compounds, such as glycoproteins other than blood coagulations proteins can be improved by
chemical modification and conjugation with water soluble polymer, in particular PEG or PSA
or mPSA.      The properties of the resulting conjugates generally strongly depend on the
structure and the size of the polymer.       Thus, polymers with a defined and narrow size
distribution are usually preferred. PSA and mPSA, used in specific examples, can be purified
in such a manner that results in a final PSA preparation with a narrow size distribution.

but not limited to cytokines such as interleukins, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-interferons,
colony stimulating factors including granulocyte colony stimulating factors, fibroblast growth
factors, platelet derived growth factors, phospholipase-activating protein (PUP), insulin, plant
proteins such as lectins and ricins, tumor necrosis factors and related alleles, soluble forms of
tumor necrosis factor receptors, interleukin receptors and soluble forms of interleukin

galactosidases,  p-galactosidases,  DNAses, fetuin, fragments thereof, and any fusion proteins
comprising any of the above mentioned proteins or fragments thereof together with
therapeutic glycoproteins in general are contemplated by the invention. In an embodiment the
glycoprotein is EPO. In a further embodiment the glycoprotein is a galactosidase. In a still
further embodiment the glycoprotein is a DNAse. In a yet further embodiment the
glycoprotein is fetuin. Lastly, in a still yet further embodiment the glycoprotein is a
granulocyte colony stimulating factor.
10036]     As used herein "biologically active derivative" or "biologically active variant"
includes any derivative or variant of a molecule having substantially the same functional
and/or biological properties of said molecule, such as binding properties, and/or the same
structural basis, such as a peptidic backbone or a basic polymeric unit.
[0037]     An "analog," "variant" or "derivative" is a compound substantially similar in
structure and having the same biological activity, albeit in certain instances to a differing
degree, to a naturally-occurring molecule. For example, a polypeptide variant refers to a
polypeptide sharing substantially similar structure and having the same biological activity as
a reference polypeptide. Variants or analogs differ in the composition of their amino acid
sequences compared to the naturally-occurring polypeptide from which the analog is derived,
based on one or more mutations involving (i) deletion of one or more amino acid residues at
one or more termini of the polypeptide andlor one or more internal regions of the naturally-

                                               -9
occurring polypeptide sequence (e.g., fragments), (ii) insertion or addition of one or more
amino acids at one or more termini (typically an "addition" or "fusion") of the polypeptide
and/or one or more internal regions (typically an "insertion") of the naturally-occurring
polypeptide sequence or (iii) substitution of one or more amino acids for other amino acids in
the naturally-occurring polypeptide sequence. By way of example, a "derivative" refers to a
polypeptide sharing the same or substantially similar structure as a reference polypeptide that
has been modified, e.g., chemically.
{0038]     Variant or analog polypeptides include insertion variants, wherein one or more
amino acid residues are added to a protein amino acid sequence of the invention. Insertions
may be located at either or both termini of the protein, and/or may be positioned within
internal regions of the protein amino acid sequence.          Insertion variants, with additional
residues at either or both termini, include for example, fusion proteins and proteins including
amino acid tags or other amino acid labels. In one aspect, the protein molecule optionally
contains an N-terminal Met, especially when the molecule is expressed recombinantly in a
bacterial cell such as E. coli.
[00391     In deletion variants, one or more amino acid residues in a protein or polypeptide as
described herein are removed. Deletions can be effected at one or both termini of the protein
or polypeptide, and/or with removal of one or more residues within the protein amino acid
sequence.     Deletion variants, therefore, include fragments of a protein or polypeptide
sequence.
100401     In substitution variants, one or more amino acid residues of a protein or polypeptide
are removed and replaced with alternative residues.         In one aspect, the substitutions are
conservative in nature and conservative substitutions of this type are well known in the art.
Alternatively,   the invention embraces       substitutions    that  are also non-conservative.
Exemplary conservative substitutions are described in Lehninger, [Biochemistry, 2nd
Edition; Worth Publishers, Inc., New York (1975), pp.71-7 7 ] and are set out immediately

                                          GANGLIOSIDES
[0042]     In embodiments, of the invention, gangliosides are conjugated to water soluble
polymers, e.g. PEG or PSA or mPSA. Gangliosides are known to provide cells with
distinguishing surface markers that can serve in cellular recognition and cell-to-cell
communication. They are useful as therapeutic agents.
(0043]     Conjugates of the invention may comprise a ganglioside and a water soluble
polymer, in which the ganglioside            comprises a glycosphingolipid      (ceramide and
oligosaccharide) with one or more sialic acids linked on the sugar chain- Gangliosides can be
classified according to how many sialic acid units are present on the molecule. Examples of
gangliosides are GMI, GM2 and GM3 (monosialo-gangliosides), GDla, GDlb, GD2 and
GD3 (disialo-gangliosides), GTIb (trisialo-ganglioside) and GQI (tetrasialo-ganglioside).
[0044]     For use in the present invention, preferred gangliosides comprise a ceramide linked
to glucose, which is linked to a first galactose, which is linked to N-acetylgalactosamine,
which is linked to a second galactose. This second galactose can be linked to one sialic acid.
The first galactose can be linked to one, two, three or four sialic acids. Sialic acids may be
linked either as monomers (one on each of the galactose molecules), or as oligosialic acids
(2-4 sialic acids) to the first galactose.
100451     Where administered therapeutic gangliosides need to circulate in the blood for long
periods. So that their action on target tissues is more effective, gangliosides can be
polysialylated, for example, by the method of the invention.

                                  DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS
[0046]      In further embodiments, of the invention, drug delivery systems are conjugated to a
water soluble polymer, e.g. PEG or PSA or mPSA. In general, a drug delivery system (DDS)
is any molecular or particulate entity which can control the fate and effect of drugs associated
with the entity. DDSs can be separated into two general types. The first type comprises
macromolecules (MDDSs), for instance antibodies, neoglycoproteins as well as synthetic
polymers, such as poly(hydroxypropylmetbacrylamide), polylysine and polymerised alkyl
cyanoacrylates. The association of drugs with various types of macromolecular carriers,
including monoclonal antibodies to target the drug to the desired sites is described for
 instance by Gregoriadis in Nature 265, 407-411 (1977). The second type is particulate DDSs
 (PDDSs), which comprises for instance nanospheres or microspheres, which comprise
 biodegradable materials such as albumin or semibiodegradable materials such as dextran and
 alkyleyanoacrylate polymers, or vesicles formed of nonionic surfactants or liposomes - for
 details of which see for example Gregoriadis in NIPS, 4, 146-151 (1989).
                                                                                               For
  100471     Drugs can either be covalently linked to, or passively entrapped into, the DDS.
 instance, PDDS comprising surfactant vesicles or liposomes may entrap hydrophilic or
 hydrophobic pharmaceutically active compounds by being formed of an appropriate
 combination of layers of surfactant or lipid molecules. Pharmaceutically active compounds
 are usually covalently linked to MDDSs, by a bond which may or may not be lysed in the
  body, for instance before or after the active compound performs its function.
  100481     Many of the MDDSs have an intrinsic (e.g. antibodies) or acquired (e.g.
  neoglycoproteins) ability to be recognised by target cells or tissues through receptors on the
  latter's surface. Typically, such DDSs are taken up specifically by the target upon injection.
  Specific uptake is, however, limited with the bulk of the DDSs being taken up by other,
  irrelevant (to therapy) tissues. The reason for this is that antibodies and other DDS proteins
  (regardless of their specificity for the target) must be, like other proteins, catabolised at the
  end of their biological life.
   [00491     Synthetic polymers used in the macromolecular type MDDSs are for instance
  poly(hydroxypropylmethacrylamide) polylysine and polymerised alkyl cyanoacrylates. These
  may be catabolised in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) or other tissues by appropriate
   lysosomal enzymes. It would be desirable to reduce the rate of catabolism of such
   biodegradable macromolecular type DDS by some means, for instance by reducing uptake of

                                               - 13
the DDS by the RES or other tissues, or by reducing degradation by lysosomal enzymes once
taken up by the RES.
10050]     Particulate DDSs (PDDSs) are, as a rule, removed from the circulation by the RES.
Because of their propensity for the RES, PDDSs are often used for the delivery of drugs to
these tissues. It is often desirable however, that PDDSs are directed to tissues other than those
of the RES. To achieve this goal, one must block or delay RES interception of PDDSs.
[0051]     DDSs for use in the invention may not initially contain glycons. An option is to add
or otherwise incorporate a glycon into the DDS structure. Examples of such cases are
liposomes incorporating a mannosylated or a galactosylated lipid. These glycoliposomes will
target actives to tissues which express a mannose or galactose receptor respectively.
10052]     Where DDSs need to circulate in the blood for long periods so that e.g. uptake by
target tissues is more effective (as with hepatic parenchymal cells), they are advantageously
polysialylated by the methods of the invention.
                                       ADMINISTRATION
 100531    In one embodiment a conjugated compound of the present invention may be
administered by injection, such as intravenous, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal injection.
The compositions may be useful as therapeutic, diagnostic and/or similar agents
 100541    To administer compositions comprising a conjugated compound of the present
invention to human or test animals, in one aspect, the compositions comprise one or more
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.     The terms "pharmaceutically" or "pharmacologically
acceptable" refer to molecular entities and compositions that are stable, inhibit protein
degradation such as aggregation and cleavage products, and in addition do not produce
allergic, or other adverse reactions when administered using routes well-known in the art, as
described below. "Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers" include any and all clinically useful
solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and
absorption delaying agents and the like, including those agents disclosed above.
 10055]    As used herein, "effective amount" includes a dose suitable for treating a mammal
 having a clinically defined disorder.
 10056]    The     compositions     may  be   administered   orally,   topically,  transdermally,
 parenterally, by inhalation spray, vaginally, rectally, or by intracranial injection. The term
parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular,

                                                - 14
intracistemal injection, or infusion techniques- Administration by intravenous, intradermal,
intramuscular,    intramammary,      intraperitoneal, intrathecal,  retrobulbar,  intrapulmonary
injection and or surgical implantation at a particular site is contemplated as well. Generally,
compositions are essentially free of pyrogens, as well as other impurities that could be
harmful to the recipient.
[0057]     Single or multiple administrations of the compositions can be carried out with the
dose levels and pattern being selected by the treating physician. For the prevention or
treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage will depend on the type of disease to be treated,
as described above, the severity and course of the disease, whether drug is administered for
preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and
response to the drug, and the discretion of the attending physician.
[0058]     The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an
effective amount of a conjugated compound or protein as defined herein. The pharmaceutical
composition may further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, salt, buffer,
or excipient. The pharmaceutical composition can be used for treating clinically-defined
disorders.    The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be a solution or a
lyophilized product. Solutions of the pharmaceutical composition may be subjected to any
suitable lyophilization process.
100591     As an additional aspect, the invention includes kits which comprise a composition
of the invention packaged in a manner which facilitates its use for administration to subjects.
In one embodiment, such a kit includes a compound or composition described herein (e.g., a
composition comprising a conjugated protein), packaged in a container such as a sealed bottle
or vessel, with a label affixed to the container or included in the package that describes use of
the compound or composition in practicing the method. In one embodiment, the kit contains
a first container having a composition comprising a conjugated protein and a second
container having a physiologically acceptable reconstitution solution for the composition in
the first container. In one aspect, the compound or composition is packaged in a unit dosage
form.    The kit may further include a device suitable for administering the composition
according to a specific route of administration- Preferably, the kit contains a label that
describes use of the therapeutic protein or peptide composition.

                                    SIALIC ACID AND PSA
100611     As used herein, "sialic acid moieties" includes sialic acid monomers or polymers
("polysaccharides") which are soluble in an aqueous solution or suspension and have little or
no negative impact, such as side effects, to mammals upon administration of the PSA-protein
conjugate in a pharmaceutically effective amount. PSA and mPSA are characterized, in one
aspect, as having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500
sialic acid units. In certain aspects, different sialic acid units are combined in a chain.
100621     In one embodiment of the invention, the sialic acid portion of the PSA or mPSA
compound is highly hydrophilic, and in another embodiment the entire compound is highly
hydrophilic. Hydrophilicity is conferred primarily by the pendant carboxyl groups of the
sialic acid units, as well as the hydroxyl groups. The saccharide unit may contain other
functional groups, such as, amine, hydroxyl or sulphate groups, or combinations thereof
These groups may be present on naturally-occurring saccharide compounds, or introduced
into derivative polysaccharide compounds. The PSA and mPSA used in the methods and
conjugates of the invention may be further characterized as described above in the
Background of the Invention.
 [0063]    The naturally occurring polymer PSA is available as a polydisperse preparation
showing a broad size distribution (e.g. Sigma C-5762) and high polydispersity (PD). Because
the polysaccharides are usually produced in bacteria carrying the inherent risk of copurifying
endotoxins, the purification of long sialic acid polymer chains may raise the probability of
increased endotoxin content. Short PSA molecules with 1-4 sialic acid units can also be
synthetically prepared (Kang SH et aL., Chem Commun. 2000;227-8; Ress DK and Linhardt
RJ, Current Organic Synthesis. 2004;1:31-46), thus minimizing the risk of high endotoxin
levels. However PSA preparations with a narrow size distribution and low polydispersity,
which are also endotoxin-free, can now be manufactured.              Polysaccharide compounds of
particular use for the invention are, in one aspect, those produced by bacteria. Some of these

                                              - 16
naturally-occurring polysaccharides are known as glycolipids.          In one embodiment, the
polysaccharide compounds are substantially free of terminal galactose units.
[0064]     In various embodiments, the compound is linked to or associated with the PSA or
mPSA compound in stoichiometric amounts (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:7, 1:8,
1:9, or 1:10, etc.). In various embodiments, 1-6, 7-12 or 13-20 PSA and/or mPSA units are
linked to the compound. In still other embodiments, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or more PSA and/or mPSA units are linked to the compound.
[0065]     Optionally, the compound is modified to introduce glycosylation sites (i.e., sites
other than the native glycosylation sites). Such modification may be accomplished using
standard molecular biological techniques known in the art. Moreover, the compound, prior to
conjugation via one or more carbohydrate moieties, may be glycosylated in vivo or in vitm.
                                    AMINOOXY LINKAGE
[0066]     In one embodiment        of the invention, the reaction of hydroxylamine             or
hydroxylamine derivatives with aldehydes (e.g., on a carbohydrate moiety following
oxidation by sodium periodate) to form an oxime group is applied to the preparation of
conjugates of compound. For example, a glycoprotein is first oxidized with a oxidizing agent
such as sodium periodate (NaIO 4) (Rothfus JA et Smith EL., J Biol Chem 1963, 238, 1402
10; and Van Lenten L and Ashwell G., J Biol Chem 1971, 246, 1889-94). The periodate
oxidation of e.g. glycoproteins is based on the classical Malaprade reaction described in
1928, the oxidation of vicinal diols with periodate to form an active aldehyde group
(Malaprade L., Analytical application, Bull Soc Chim France, 1928, 43, 683-96). Additional
examples for such an oxidizing agent are lead tetraacetate (Pb(OAc)4), manganese acetate
(MnO(Ac) 3 ), cobalt acetate (Co(OAc) 2), thallium acetate (TIOAc), cerium sulfate (Ce(S0 4) 2 )
(US 4,367,309) or potassium perruthenate (KRuO 4) (Marko et al., I Am Chem Soc 1997,119,
12661-2). By "oxidizing agent" a mild oxidizing compound which is capable of oxidizing
vicinal diols in carbohydrates, thereby generating active aldehyde groups under physiological
reaction conditions is meant.
[00671     The second step is the coupling of the polymer containing an aminooxy group to
the oxidized carbohydrate moiety to form an oxime linkage. In one embodiment of the
invention, this step can be carried out in the presence of catalytic amounts of the nucleophilic
catalyst aniline or aniline derivatives (Dirksen A et Dawson PE, Bioconjugate Chem. 2008;
Zeng Y et al., Nature Methods 2009;6:207-9). The aniline catalysis dramatically accelerates

                                               -17
  the oxime ligation allowing the use of very low concentrationift the reagents. in another
  embodiment of the invention the oxime linkage is stabilized by reduction with NaCNBH 3 to
  form an alkoxyamine linkage.
  [00681    In one embodiment of the invention, the reaction steps to conjugate PSA or mPSA
  to a protein are carried out separately and sequentially (i.e., starting materials (e.g., protein,
  polymer, etc), reagents (e.g., oxidizing agents, aniline, etc) and reaction products (e.g.,
 oxidized carbohydrate on a protein, activated aminooxy polymer, etc) are separated between
  individual reaction steps).

 Vaccine 2006, 24(6), 716-29; and Heredia KL et al., Macromolecules 2007, 40(14), 4772-9.
  [0070]    Advantages of the invention-include high recovery of conjugate, high retention of
 activity of the conjugated glycoprotein compared to unconjugated protein and high
 conjugation efficiency.

            Polysialylation of rFIX emploving a maleimido/aminooxy linker system
A. Preparation of the modification reagent
[0081]    An Aminooxy-PSA reagent is prepared by use of a maleimido/aminooxy linker
system (Toyokuni et al., Bioconjugate Chem 2003; 14, 1253-9). PSA-SH (20kD) containing
a free terminal SH - group is prepared using a two step procedure: a) Preparation of PSA
NH 2 by reductive amination of oxidized PSA with NH 4C1 according to W005016973A1 and
b) introduction of a sulfhydryl group by reaction of the terminal primary amino group with 2
iminothiolane (Traut's reagent / Pierce, Rockford, IL) as described in US7645860. PSA-SH
is coupled to the maleimido-group of the linker at pH 7.5 in PBS - buffer using a 10-fold
molar excess of the linker and a PSA-SH concentration of 50 mg/ml. The reaction mixture is
incubated for 2 hours under gentle shaking at room temperature. Then the excess linker
reagent is removed and the aminooxy-PSA is buffer exchanged into oxidation buffer (50mM
sodium phosphate, pH 6.0) by diafiltration. The buffer is exchanged 25 times employing a
Pellicon XLSkD regenerated cellulose membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
B. Modification of rFIX after prior oxidation with NalO 4
[0082]    rFIX is oxidized in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 employing 100 pM
sodium periodate in the buffer, The mixture was shaken in the dark for lh at 40 C and
quenched for 15 min at room temperature by the addition of glycerol to a final concentration
of 5mM. Low molecular weight contaminates were removed by means of size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) employing PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT).
Oxidized rFIX is then spiked with aniline to obtain a final concentration of 10mM and mixed
with the aminooxy-PSA reagent to achieve a 5 fold molar excess of PSA.           The reaction
mixture was incubated for 2 hours under gentle shaking in the dark at room temperature.
C. Purification of the conjugates
[0083]    The excess of PSA reagent and free rFIX is removed by means of HIC.            The
conductivity of the reaction mixture is raised to 180 mS/cm and loaded onto a column filled

                                              -23

Hepes, 3 M sodium chloride, 6.7 mM calcium chloride, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 6.9.
Subsequently the conjugate is elated with a linear gradient of 60% elution buffer (50mM
Hepes, 6.7mM calcium chloride, pH 7.4) in 40 CV.            Finally the PSA-rFIX containing
fractions are collected and subjected to UF/DF by use of a 30 kD membrane made of
regenerated cellulose (Millipore). The preparation is analytically characterized by measuring
total protein (BCA) and FIX chromogenic activity. For the PSA-rFiX conjugates prepared
with both variants a specific activity of> 50 % in comparison to native rFIX was determined.

product was diafiltrated against buffer, pH 7.2 (50 mM Hepes) using a 5 kD membrane
(regenerated cellulose, Millipore), frozen at -80"C and lyophilized. After lyophilization the
reagent was dissolved in the appropriate volume of water and used for preparation of PSA
protein conjugates via carbohydrate modification.

dichlorodiethylether (15.84 ml; 0.4Ieq) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 22
hours at 500C. The mixture was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure- The residue
was suspended in 2 L dichloromethane and extracted two times with saturated aqueous NaCl
solution (each I L). The Dichloromethane layer was dried over Na 2 SO4 and then evaporated
to dryness under reduced pressure and dried in high vacuum to give 64.5 g of 3-oxapentane
 1,5-dioxy-endo-2',3'-dicarboxydiimidenorbornene as a white-yellow solid (intermediate 1).

ml Hydrazine hydrate (4.26eq) were added. The reaction mixture was then refluxed for 2
hours. The mixture was concentrated to the half of the starting volume by evaporating the
solvent under reduced pressure. The occurring precipitate was filtered off. The remaining
ethanol layer was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue containing the
crude product 3-oxa-pentane-1,5-dioxyamine was dried in vacuum to yield 46.3g. The crude
product was further purified by column chromatography (Silicagel 60; isocratic elation with
Dichloromethane/Methanol mixture, 9+1) to yield 11.7 g of the pure final product 3-oxa
pentane -1,5-dioxyamine.

referred to as 3,6,9-trioxa-undecane-1,1 I-dioxyamine) was dissolved in minimum amount of
50mM sodium acetate (pH 5.50.02) and was added to the PSA solution. The final colominic
acid concentration was 62.5mg/mi. This reaction mixture was incubated for 20.lhr at
221.0*C on a gentle mixer (22 oscillations per minute). After this, 0.65ml of 160 mg/ml
NaCNBH 3 solution was added to the above reaction mixture so as to make the final
concentration of 5.00 mg/ml. This was incubated for 3.00.20 hours at 4.01.0*C on a shaker
(22 oscillations per minute) in a endotoxin free air tight container with enough headspace for
mixing. For the purification, the sample was diluted with 2mM triethanolamine, pH 8.00.02
to make final colominic acid concentration of 20 mg/ml. The reaction mixture was desalted to
remove excess of 1,11-diamino-3,6,9-trioxaundecane, NaCNBH 3 and byproducts of the
reaction. This was followed by desalting on a Sephadex G25 column using 20mM
triethanolanine buffer (pH 800.02). The pH of the desalted sample was adjusted to pH 7.8
8.0 and was ultrafiltered/diafiltered with 20mM TEA pH 8.0 once and 2mM triethanolamine
(TEA) pH 8.0 twice. The sample was freeze dried and stored at -80*C.
 [00891     Alternatively, purification was done in presence of high salt during desalting and
ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) steps. Anion exchange chromatography in high salt was
also used to make highly pure aminooxy-PSA. By analogy, different molecular weights of
aminooxy-PSA were synthesized.

[00901    For oxidation of p-Galactosidase (p-Gal), different concentrations of NalO4
(ranging from 0.157 mM to 2 mM) were used. 0.5 mg of P-Gal was oxidized under acidic pH
of 5.75 at 4" C for 30 minutes in the dark- Oxidation was stopped by adding NaHSO3 to a
final concentration of 5 mM. The conjugation reaction was carried out using the oxidized p
Gal with diaminooxy PSA polymer (22kDa). The final concentration of polymer in the
reaction mixture was 1.25 mM whereas the concentration of p-Gal ranged from 0.125 mg/ml
to 0.76 mg/ml. All the reactions were done at pH5.75. Sodium cyanoborohydride was added
to the reaction mixture to a concentration of 50 mM or 3.17mg/ml. The reaction was carried
out at 40C and samples were collected at time intervals of 1, 2 and 24 hours. Conjugates were
characterized using SDS PAGE and western blotting. A shift in the band was seen for the
conjugate in SDS PAGE and this was also confirmed by western blotting.
[0091]    Based on the best reactions conditions, 1.9 mg of p-Gal was oxidized with 1.5 mM
of NalO4 for 30 minutes at 40 C and then oxidation was stopped by adding NaHSO 3 to a final
concentration of 5 mM. The conjugation reaction was carried out using the oxidized p-Gal
with diaminooxy PSA polymer. The final concentrations of polymer and protein in the
reaction mixture were 1.25 mM and 0.76 mg/ml respectively. The final pH of the reaction
mixture was around 5.75. Sodium cyanoborohydride was added to the reaction mixture to a
concentration of 50 mM or 3.17mg/mi. The reaction was carried out at 4"C for 2 hours.
Purified and unpurified conjugates were characterized using SDS PAGE and western
blotting. A shift in the band was seen for the conjugate in SDS PAGE and this was confirmed
by western blotting using anti-PSA antibody. The in vitro activity PSA-pGal conjugates were
comparable to native protein using All in one    pGal assay kit (Pierce). Less than 50% activity
was observed in comparable conjugates made using aldehyde linker chemistry. Further, the
overall process was scaled up to 3 fold.
