   Field of the Disclosure
   The present disclosure relates to sanitary apparatus, and more specifically to a sanitary
 5 bin and its lid.
   Background to the Disclosure
   Sanitary bins have long been installed in public toilets and other locations where many
   people are expected to use a single bathroom facility.           Typically, sanitary bins are
10 installed in these areas with their affixation to a wall or the floor of the bathroom facility.
   Whilst such an installation is advantageous as it secures the sanitary bin in position, it
   also has the undesired effect of rendering some surfaces of the bin, and the areas
   surrounding the bin, difficult to clean.
15 Whilst these issues can be mitigated to some extent with the installation of freestanding
   bins, or more sympathetically securing a sanitary bin to a wall or floor, further features of
   sanitary bins as presently available may present a hygiene issue.
   For example, it is common knowledge that a sanitary bin should be closed when not in
20 use, to prevent odours from the bin escaping into the surrounding environment. In the
   state of the art, such closure mechanisms frequently include several moving mechanical
   parts, such as springs or slidable interlocking parts. These mechanical parts often have
   relatively complex surfaces, increasing the difficulty of cleaning the bin as required.
   Additionally, any moving parts may break or require maintenance, potentially resulting in
25 the sanitary bin becoming inoperable or unusable for a period.
   The reference to prior art in this specification is not and should not be taken as an
   acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that the referenced prior art forms part of the
   common general knowledge in Australia or in any other country.

   Detailed Description
   Embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure will now be described by way of
30 example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
   Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of a lid in accordance with the
   present disclosure,
35 Figure 2 is a schematic illustration of an open bin in accordance with an embodiment of
   the present disclosure, using a lid in accordance with an embodiment of the present
   disclosure,
                                                 4

   Figure 3 is a schematic illustration of a partially closed bin in accordance with an
   embodiment of the present disclosure, using a lid in accordance with an embodiment of
   the present disclosure, and
 5
   Figure 4 is a schematic illustration of a closed bin in accordance with an embodiment of
   the present disclosure, using a lid in accordance with an embodiment of the present
   disclosure.
10 Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, there is depicted four views of a lid 100 in
   accordance with the present disclosure. Here, the lid 100 comprises an end wall 110
   and a side wall 120, the side wall 120 extending downwardly from the outer edge of the
   end wall 110. In this formation, the side wall 120 and the end wall 110 together form a
   container structure. As the end wall 110 is generally circular in shape, the container
15 structure formed by the end wall 110 and the side wall 120 is generally cylindrical.
   Figure 1 also illustrates a curved end wall 110. The end wall 110 is curved away from
   the side wall 120, such that the outer surface of the end wall 110 is convex in shape.
   The radius of curvature of the convex end wall 110 is substantially similar across the
20 entire surface of the end wall 100, except in the area of the handle 111. The handle 111
   is located on the exterior surface of the end wall 110, and protrudes outwardly. As such,
   the handle 111 extends beyond the end wall 110 of the lid 100, such that a user may grip
   it. The handle 111 includes a textured surface 112 to increase the grip of the user on
   the handle 111 and thus the lid 100.
25
   The side wall 120 extends from the entire perimeter of the end wall 110, the side wall
   120 and the end wall 110 transitioning smoothly into one another at their interface. The
   side wall 120 extends substantially perpendicularly from the end wall 100, although
   variations from this perpendicular arrangement are envisaged by the applicant. The side
30 wall 120 includes a first end, this first end connected directly to the end wall 110, and a
   second end located away from the first end. The side wall 110 extends between these
   first and second ends, and is curved with a substantially constant radius of curvature.
   The side wall 120 also includes a first slit 121 and a second slit 122. Both the first slit
35 121 and the second slit 122 extend from the second end of the side wall 120 towards the
   first end of the side wall 120. Here, both the first slit 121 and the second slit 122 extend
   substantially perpendicularly to the second end of the side wall 120, towards the first end
                                                  5

   of the side wall and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the container structure formed by
   the end wall 110 and the side wall 120. Both the first slit 121 and the second slit 122
   have a tapered portion located adjacent to the second end of the side wall 120, this
   tapered portion of each slit narrowing as the distance from the second end of the side
 5 wall 120 is increased.
   Where the first slit 121 is closest to the first end of the side wall 120, it terminates with
   an aperture 123. The aperture 123 illustrated in Figure 1 is circular, the outer perimeter
   of this circular aperture 123 intersecting with the elongate slit 121. The second slit 122
10 terminates with a similar aperture 124.        The slits 121, 122 themselves also extend
   through the full thickness of the side wall 120.
   The first 121 and second 122 slits are located on the side wall 120 such that they are
   opposite one another. Located between the first 121 and second 122 slits, the side wall
15 120 also includes a waste aperture 130. The waste aperture 130 is located centrally
   between the first slit 121 and the second slit 122, and is large enough to allow the
   passage of a human hand. The waste aperture 130 is in the form of a rounded rectangle,
   the corners curved to reduce the risk of injury to a user, and to eliminate any well-defined
   vertices which may harbour bacteria.
20
   A first tab 141, a second tab 142 and a third tab 143 also extend outwardly form the side
   wall 120 of the lid 100. These tabs 141,142,143 are located at the second end of the
   side wall 120, and extend outwardly from the side wall 120 to protrude outside of the
   container structure defined by the side wall 120 and the end wall 110. The first tab 141
25 is located below the waste aperture 130, and is longer than the second 142 or third 143
   tabs. The first tab 141 has a length substantially equal to that of the waste aperture 130.
   The second tab 142 is located such that it terminates adjacent to the second slit 121.
   Similarly, the third tab 143 is located such that it terminates adjacent to the second slit
30 122. Both the second tab 142 and the third tab 143 have the substantially the same
   length. In total, the first tab 141, the second tab 142 and the third tab 143 extend around
   the majority of the side wall 120 perimeter. Additionally, the surface of the first 141,
   second 142 and third tabs 143 located closest to the end wall 110 comprises an
   engagement surface. This engagement surface extends across the majority of each tab
35 141, 142 and 143 and comprises a substantially planar surface.
                                                  6

   The lid 100 also includes fins 150 which extend into the interior of the container structure
   defined by the end wall 110 and the side wall 120.         Each of the fins 150 depends
   downwardly from the end wall 110 in the form of a substantially planar, elongate member.
   Here, the lid 100 comprises three fins 150, each fin 150 regularly spaced across the
 5 interior surface of the end wall 110. Each fin 150 extends substantially perpendicularly
   from the end wall 110. Additionally, each fin 150 is positioned such that its length lies
   substantially perpendicularly to the waste aperture 130.
   Overall, the lid 100 is formed in a single moulded structure. This moulded structure may
10 be achieved using an injection moulding process or any other moulding process. The lid
   depicted in Figure 1 comprises a plastics material, commonly polyethylene or
   polypropylene although the use of other materials is also envisaged. The lid 100 is made
   from a resiliently deformable material.
15 Referring now to figure 2, the insertion of the lid 100 into a bin portion 200 to form a
   sanitary bin 300 is depicted. Here, the bin portion 200 takes the form of a base 201 from
   which a tapered tube 202 extends in an upward direction. In Figure 2, the base 201 is a
   circle and the tapered tube 202 is a cylinder with varying diameter, the tapered tube 202
   extending from the perimeter of the base 201 to form a bin interior.
20
   Moving along the tapered tube 202 away from the base, the radius of the tapered tube
   202 increases, this rate of increase varying along the length of the tapered tube 202. An
   alternative version of the tapered tube 202, where the rate of increase of the diameter of
   the tapered tube 202 is constant (and the tapered tube is frustoconical) is also envisaged
25 by the applicant. The tapered tube 202 may comprise metal, with a brushed metal
   surface optionally included to provide an aesthetic appeal. Additionally, the base 201
   comprises pads or rubber feet whish support the sanitary bin 300, providing cushioning
   and support on uneven floors.
30 The bin portion 200 further comprises a flange 203 which extends into the bin interior
   defined by the tapered tube 202 and the base 201. The flange 203 is located at the top
   end of the tapered tube 202, the end furthest from the base portion 201, where it extends
   around the entire perimeter of the tapered tube 202. The flange 203 is made of the same
   material as the tapered tube 202, and comprises substantially planar upper and lower
35 surfaces. As such, as can be seen in Figure 2, the flange 203 forms a ring-shaped
   structure around the top edge of the bin portion 202.
                                                7

   The lid 100 is sized to fit within the bin 200. The diameter of the side wall 120 of the lid
   100 is such that the side wall 120 fits within the diameter defined by the tapered tube
   202. In Figure 2, the side wall 120 of the lid 100 lies in close proximity to the flange 203,
   and the tabs 141, 142, 143 extending outwardly form the side wall 120 are in contact
 5 with the interior surface of the tapered tube 202, below the flange 203. The lid 100 is
   inserted into the bin portion 200 by compressing the side wall 120 of the lid 100 such
   that its diameter is reduced, before the tabs 141, 142, 143 are located below the flange
   203. The compression of the side wall 120 is then released, causing the side wall 120
   to again increase in diameter such that the tabs 141, 142, 143 engage both the interior
10 surface of the tapered tube 202 and the flange 203.
   In use, the tapered tube 202 has a diameter which is slightly smaller that defined by the
   tabs 141, 142, 143, causing the tapered tube 202 to place a compressive force on the
   side wall 120, causing a small reducing in the diameter defined by the side wall 120.
15 This reduction in diameter of the side wall 120 is accommodated by the narrowing of the
   slits 121, 122 in response to the compressive pressure exerted by the tapered tube 202.
   The compressive force on the side wall 120 holds the lid 100 in the open position, such
   that the waste aperture 130 is located above the top edge of the tapered tube 202, such
   that a user may place waste into the sanitary bin 300.
20
   Figure 3 illustrates the sanitary bin 300 in a partially closed state, wherein the lid 100 is
   pushed further into the tapered tube 202 of the bin portion 200. Here, a user may place
   a downward force on the lid 100 pushing it into the tapered tube 202. As the lid 100
   travels further into the bin, the side wall 120 becomes increasingly compressed due to
25 the ever-decreasing diameter of the tapered tube 202. This increased compression of
   the side wall 120 is accommodated by the narrowing of the first slit 121 and the second
   slit 122 as the lid travels further into the tapered tube 202.
   As the lid 100 is inserted into the tapered tube 202, the tabs 141, 142, 143 exert an
30 outwards force on the interior surface of the tapered tube 202. This outward pressure
   ensures the lid 100 remains in position, unless moved by a user, due to a frictional fit
   between the tabs 141, 142, 143 and the interior surface of the tapered tube 202.
   The insertion of the lid 100 into the bin portion 200 continues until the end wall 110 lies
35 adjacent to the flange 203 as illustrated in Figure 3. Here, the movement of the lid is
   ceased as the first slit 121 and the second slit 122 may have no further capacity to
   narrow, or because the side wall 120 comes to rest against a stop located on the inner
                                                   8

   surface of the tapered tube 202. Such features prevent the over insertion of the lid 100
   into the bin portion 200.
   To remove the lid 100 from the bin portion 200 such that waste may be inserted into the
 5 bin via the waste aperture 130, the user may exert an upwards force on the lid 100 using
   the handle 110. This force will cause the lid 100 to be extended from the tapered tube
   202, once again exposing the waste aperture 130 to the user. Complete removal of the
   lid 100 from the tapered tube 202 is prevented by the interaction of the tabs 141, 142,
   143 and the flange 203 when the lid 100 is in the open position. This interaction between
10 the tabs 141, 142, 143 and the flange 203 is an abutment of the respective members.
   Due to resiliently deformable nature of the lid material, the process of opening and
   closing the sanitary bin 300 can be undertaken repeatedly before any fatigue effects or
   mechanical weakening of the lid 100 is seen. As such, the sanitary bin hereinbefore
15 described is suitable for high intensity use in public bathrooms and other communal
   facilities.
   It should be appreciated that the primary purpose of the above detailed description is to
   instruct persons having an interest in the subject matter of the invention how to carry the
20 invention into practical effect. It is to be clearly understood that the specific detail of the
   features and structures illustrated and described in relation to the embodiments is
   provided by way of example only. Modifications and improvements may be incorporated
   without departing from the scope of the invention.
