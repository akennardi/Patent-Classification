          VEHICLE TIRE, AND A WHEEL ASSEMBLY FOR THIS VEHICLE
                                  INCORPORATING IT.
 5                    RELATED APPLICATIONS
                      This application is a divisional application of Australian
   Application No. 2013352221, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
   reference.
                      The present invention relates to a protector shield for a
10 sidewall of a motor vehicle tire, and to a wheel assembly for a motor vehicle
   incorporating     this protector shield. The      invention  particularly but not
   exclusively concerns the protection against rocks, stones, scrap metal or any
   other objects on the ground, of large size tires of heavy vehicles, such as tires
   for industrial vehicles including civil engineering vehicles, earthmovers or
15 military vehicles which operate off-the-road.
                      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
                      It is known to protect outer sidewalls of certain tires by
   protector annular shields each mounted on the wheel rim receiving the tire, as
   for example disclosed by Patent Application US 2009/0315389 Al which
20 presents such a protector shield consisting of one curved shield ring in
   particular for fire protection against flames or flammable substances.
                      Patent Application US 2010/0060072 Al discloses a protector
   shield formed by a ring comprising a plurality of spaced arcuate sectors which
   are independently connected by respective radial springs to a holder attached
25 to the wheel rim. Similarly, Patent GB-A-511,056 discloses such a protector
   shield ring formed of arcuate sectors resiliently mounted on the wheel rim.
                      These separate and independent arcuate sectors allow to
   easy the manufacturing process and the replacement cost of the protector
   shield for large size tires of civil engineering vehicles, for instance, compared
30 to a protector shield made of a single circumferential ring. Nonetheless, a
   major drawback of these protector shields comprising such ring sectors which
   are not connected together is that these sectors may be deformed upwards in

                                                 2
   contact with rocks or stones, so that the facing tire sidewall cannot be fully
   protected in such a case.
                       OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 5                     It is an object of the present invention to provide a protector
   annular shield for a sidewall of a motor vehicle tire, said shield being
   configured to be mounted on a wheel rim receiving said tire, which efficiently
   protects the tire sidewall against impacts of rocks, stones, scrap metal or any
   other objects on the ground susceptible to perforate or damage the sidewall
10 due to significant loads or continuous wear on it.
                       It is also an object of the present invention to provide such a
   protector shield which is easy to manufacture for large size tires of heavy
   vehicles, such as tires for civil engineering vehicles or earthmovers.
                       It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a
15 protector shield which is easily replaceable, in case the shield is partly
   damaged by such impacts.
                       For this purpose, the protector annular shield of the invention
   comprises at least two concentric shield rings comprising a first shield ring and
   a second shield ring which are axially juxtaposed and which respectively
20 comprise, substantially arranged end to end in a circumferential direction, a
   plurality of first arcuate sectors and a plurality of second arcuate sectors which
   angularly overlap each other, so that every two consecutive first or second
   sectors are substantially arranged end to end axially in front of a second or
   first sector short of both ends of this second or first sector, respectively (i.e. so
25 that the two ends of any first or second sector are not positioned axially in
   front of two ends of a facing second or first sector, respectively).
                       By "substantially arranged end to end", it is meant in the
   present description to encompass:
                       - an abutting arrangement end to end without any interstice
30 nor any overlap between two consecutive arcuate sectors, or

                                               3
                      - a nearly abutting arrangement end to end with an interstice
   or slight overlap between two consecutive arcuate sectors without mechanical
   connection nor any contact between these consecutive sectors, or else
                      - an abutting arrangement end to end with a slight overlap
 5 between      two   consecutive arcuate sectors secured            by   a  mechanical
   connection between these consecutive sectors for instance obtained by
   respective mutually engaging shoulders provided in these sectors.
                      It is to be noted that this at least double layer of shield rings
   allows to efficiently protect the tire sidewall in operation, due to the juxtaposed
10 axially second sectors (inner sectors) which may palliate any deformation or
   damage of one or several axially first sectors (outer sectors), and that the
   overlapping sectors of these at least two rings further improve this protection
   by palliating any damage or deformation undergone by any axially first outer
   sector. In addition, the first sectors advantageously prevent the second
15 sectors from lifting up.
                      It is also to be noted that this inventive protector shield is easy
   to manufacture for large size tires, due to the sectors' size which is limited for
   each shield ring.
                      It is further to be noted that this inventive protector shield is
20 easily replaceable, since it is possible to replace just one or several damaged
   first and/or second sectors.
                      Preferably, said plurality of n first arcuate sectors and said
   plurality of m second arcuate sectors, where n and m are identical or different,
   are arranged in angularly staggered rows, defining an overlap angle between
25 the first sectors and the second sectors. Said overlap angle may then be
   equal to 1800 / n, with n being the number of said first sectors and also the
   number m of said second sectors (n = m in this preferred case).
                      According to another feature of the invention, each of said
   plurality of first arcuate sectors and each of said plurality of second arcuate
30 sectors may be separately (i.e. independently) mounted on said wheel rim, so
   that each first sector and each second sector are able to be dismounted from
   said wheel rim without having to dismount the other first sectors nor the other

                                              4
   second sectors, respectively. It is nonetheless to be noted that in order to
   dismount a second sector, several first sectors firstly have to be dismounted.
                     Advantageously, each of said plurality of first arcuate sectors
   may comprise a first flexible arcuate protecting part and, radially inwards, a
 5 first rigid arcuate clamping part which has a first median diameter and with
   which this first protecting part is integrally formed, and each of said plurality of
   second arcuate sectors may comprise a second flexible arcuate protecting
   part and, radially inwards, a second rigid arcuate clamping part which has a
   second median diameter for example identical to said first median diameter
10 and with which this second protecting part is integrally formed, the first arcuate
   clamping parts and the second arcuate clamping parts, when arranged end to
   end, forming two concentric first and second clamp rings attached together
   and configured to be attached to said wheel rim by fastening means.
                     According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, said
15 fastening means may comprise a plurality of threaded fasteners traversing a
   plurality of aligned through holes provided in each of said first arcuate
   clamping parts and of said second arcuate clamping parts.
                     Also advantageously, the protector shield may have an outer
   convex surface defined by said first shield ring and an inner concave surface
20 defined by said second shield ring.
                     According to another feature of the invention, said plurality of
   first arcuate sectors and said plurality of second arcuate sectors may be
   substantially arranged end to end in an abutting manner and devoid of
   connection means between the first sectors and also between the second
25 sectors (i.e. devoid of connection means other than the consecutive first
   sectors and second sectors themselves). By way of an example, the
   consecutive first sectors and/or second sectors may incorporate connection
   means by an overlapping abutment thanks to respective mutually engaging
   shoulders integrally formed in end edges of these consecutive sectors.
30                   Advantageously according to this last inventive example, at
   least several of said plurality of first arcuate sectors and/or at least several of
   said plurality of second arcuate sectors may be arranged in a mutual

                                               5
   overlapping abutment by engaging shoulders integrally formed in end edges
   of the consecutive arcuate sectors. Alternatively, at least several of said
   plurality of first arcuate sectors and/or at least several of said plurality of
   second arcuate sectors may be substantially arranged in a mutual joining
 5 abutment by sloping end edges of each arcuate sector, which end edges
   define symmetrical tapered edges which are beveled to substantially join
   together the consecutive arcuate sectors at their respective thinnest ends.
                      A wheel assembly for a motor vehicle according to the
   invention comprises a wheel rim, a tire having beads respectively mounted
10 against axially inner and outer flanges of said rim, and a protector shield
   mounted adjacent said rim which is as defined above.
                      According to a first embodiment of the invention:
                      - each of said plurality of first arcuate sectors comprises a first
   flexible arcuate protecting part and, radially inwards, a first rigid arcuate
15 clamping part which has a first median diameter and with which this first
   protecting part is integrally formed,
                      - each of said plurality of second arcuate sectors comprises a
   second flexible arcuate protecting part and, radially inwards, a second rigid
   arcuate clamping part which has a second median diameter for example
20 identical to said first median diameter and with which this second protecting
   part is integrally formed, and
                      - the first arcuate clamping parts and the second arcuate
   clamping parts, when arranged end to end, form two concentric first and
   second clamp rings which are attached together and to said wheel rim by
25 fastening means, these clamp rings being directly attached to said axially
   outer flange or to an adapter ring of the wheel rim integral with this flange so
   that the shield is in direct contact with the wheel rim.
                      Said fastening means of this first embodiment may consist of
   a plurality of axial threaded fasteners traversing axially aligned through holes
30 provided in each of said first arcuate clamping parts and second arcuate
   clamping parts and further axially traversing said flange or said adapter ring.

                                               6
                      According to a second embodiment of the invention in which
   the wheel rim comprises several pieces fixed together in a radial junction zone
   (i.e. for a multi-piece wheel rim):
                      - each of said plurality of first arcuate sectors comprises a first
 5 flexible arcuate protecting part and, radially inwards, a first rigid arcuate

                      - each of said plurality of second arcuate sectors comprises a
   second flexible arcuate protecting part and, radially inwards, a second rigid
10 arcuate clamping part which has a second median diameter for example
   identical to said first median diameter and with which this second protecting
   part is integrally formed, and
                      - the first arcuate clamping parts and the second arcuate
   clamping parts, when arranged end to end, form two concentric first and
15 second clamp rings which are attached together and to said wheel rim by
   fastening means, these clamp rings being attached to an intermediate annular
   support member which is attached to said junction zone of the wheel rim, so
   that the shield is axially distant from an adjacent axially outer rim flange of the
   wheel rim.
20                    According to a third embodiment of the invention in which the
   wheel rim is either of the single piece or multi-piece type, the wheel rim being
   fixed to a wheel hub:
                      - each of said plurality of first arcuate sectors comprises a first
   flexible arcuate protecting part and, radially inwards, a first rigid arcuate
25 clamping part which has a first median diameter and with which this first
   protecting part is integrally formed,

   clamping parts, when substantially arranged end to end, form two concentric
   first and second clamp rings which are attached together and to said wheel
   hub by fastening means, these clamp rings being attached to an intermediate
 5 annular support member which is attached to the wheel hub, so that the shield

20                  MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION
                    The expression "front view" and "rear view" applied to the
   inventive arcuate sectors described below respectively refer to views showing
   the outer convex surface and the inner concave surface of these sectors when
   mounted on the wheel rim.
25                  The protector shield 1 of the exemplary embodiment visible in
   Figures 1 to 5 comprises two curved concentric shield rings 10 and 20
   comprising a first axially outer shield ring 10 and a second axially inner shield
   ring 20 which are axially juxtaposed.
                    The first shield ring 10 comprises a first flexible protecting part
30 11 and, radially and axially inwards, a first rigid clamp ring 12 which has a first
   median diameter D1 and with which this first protecting part 11 is integrally
   formed, so that the radially inner circumferential edge of the first protecting

                                             10
   part 11 is fixedly joined to the first clamp ring 12. The first shield ring 10 has
   an axially outer surface 10a which is convex and an axially inner surface 1Ob
   which is concave (see Figure 4). As visible in Figure 1, the first protecting part
   11 is made of n (in this example, n = 4) arcuate flexible sectors 11 a which are
 5 separately fixedly joined to the same number n of arcuate rigid clamping parts
   12a (preferably by overmolding each arcuate rigid clamping part 12a with a
   compression of the material of this flexible arcuate protecting part 11 a), so
   that the arcuate flexible sectors 11 a are arranged end to end substantially in
   mutual abutment just as the radially underlying arcuate rigid clamping parts
10 12a to obtain the flexible sectors 11 a which are fixedly joined to the first clamp
   ring 12 while not being connected together.
                     The second shield ring 20 may present a structure, geometry,
   external diameter and/or thickness identical or different from that of the first
   shield ring 10, and comprises a second flexible protecting part 21 and, radially
15 and axially inwards, a second rigid clamp ring 22 which has a second median
   diameter D2 identical to D1 and with which this second protecting part 21 is
   integrally formed, so that the radially inner circumferential edge of the second
   protecting part 21 is fixedly joined to the second clamp ring 22. The second
   shield ring 20 also has an axially outer convex surface 20a and an axially
20 inner concave surface 20b for instance identical to those of the first shield ring
   10 (see Figure 4). As visible in Figure 1, the second protecting part 21 is made
   of m (in this example, m = n = 4) arcuate flexible sectors 21a which are
   separately fixedly joined to the same number m of arcuate rigid clamping parts
   22a (preferably by overmolding as explained above), so that the arcuate
25 flexible sectors 21a are arranged end to end substantially in mutual abutment
   just as the arcuate rigid clamping parts 22a to obtain the flexible sectors 21a
   which are fixedly joined to the second clamp ring 22 while not being
   connected together.
                     Each of the first and second rigid clamp rings 12 and 22 may
30 be made of a plastic or metal material, and each of the first and second
   flexible protecting parts 11 and 21 may be based on at least one elastomer
   (i.e. either a rubber such as a diene elastomer or a polyurethane rubber for

                                                11
   instance, or a thermoplastic elastomer) and is optionally reinforced by at least
   one reinforcing layer such as a woven or nonwoven fabric (e.g. of aramide), a
   fiberglass mat or mesh or a metal layer. Thus, an inventive protector shield
   may be such that the second flexible protecting part 21 is devoid of any
 5 reinforcement, whereas the first flexible protecting part 11 is reinforced by this
   at least one reinforcing layer.
                      According to instant invention, the first and second arcuate
   flexible sectors 11 a and 21 a angularly overlap each other and form in this
   exemplary embodiment staggered rows, with an overlap angle a between the
10 first and second sectors 11 a and 21 a of 1800 / n (7/n) which is equal to 450
   (7u/4) in this example of four first and second sectors 11 a and 21a, so that the
   abutment line between the ends 23 of every two consecutive second sectors
   21 a is located axially in front of a first sector 11 a short of both ends 13 thereof.
                      As visible in Figures 2 to 5, the protector shield 1 is fastened
15 to a wheel rim 30 or 30' by fastening means 40 or 40' which attach together
   the first and second clamp rings 12 and 22 and which comprise axial bolts 41
   or 41' traversing aligned through holes 14 and 24 provided in each of the first
   and second arcuate clamping parts 12a and 22a.
                      Specifically, the wheel assembly 2 according to the first
20 embodiment of Figure 4 comprises:
                      - a metallic wheel rim 30 which consists in this example of two
   pieces 31 and 32 attached together in a known manner at a radial junction
   zone 33 by circumferentially spaced rim bolts 34, and which comprises axially
   inner and outer flanges (only the outer flange 35 is visible) defining respective
25 seats,
                      - a pneumatic tire 50 having two sidewalls (only the outer
   sidewall 51     is visible in Figure 4) ending with inner and outer beads
   respectively mounted against the inner and outer flanges (only the outer bead
   52 is visible with the outer flange 35), and
30                    - the protector shield 1 substantially extending along the radial
   height of the outer sidewall 51, in such a manner that both shield rings 10 and
   20 are axially juxtaposed with their respective clamp rings 12 and 22 being in

                                             12
   mutual contact thanks to the axial bolts 41 that clamp them via the through
   holes 14 and 24 and that further partially traverse an adapter ring 36
   extending the outer flange 35 radially inwards to attach both shield rings 10
   and 20 directly to the wheel rim 30.
 5                  The wheel assembly 2' according to the second embodiment
   of Figure 5 only differs from that of Figure 4, in that the clamp rings 12 and 22
   are attached by first axial bolts 41' to an intermediate annular support member
   42 which is itself attached by second axial bolts 43 to the junction zone 33 of
   the wheel rim 30', so that the shield 1 is not in contact with the outer flange 35'
10 but axially distant from it. Specifically, the support member 42 (preferably
   made of metal or plastic) has an axially outer circumferential radial portion 42a
   extended radially inwards by a circumferential axial connecting portion 42b
   located radially under the outer flange 35', which connecting portion 42b is
   extended radially inwards by an axially inner circumferential radial portion 42c.
15 As visible in Figure 5, the first bolts 41' traverse the axially aligned through
   holes 14 and 24 provided in both clamp rings 12 and 22 and also through
   holes 42aa formed in the outer radial portion 42a of the support member 42,
   and the second bolts 43 attach the inner radial portion 42c of the support
   member 42 to the junction zone 33 of the wheel rim 30' thanks to the bolts 34'
20 used to attach together the two pieces 31 and 32 thereof.
                    It is to be noted that the protector shield 1 according to this
   second embodiment could alternatively be mounted on a wheel rim of the
   single piece, three-piece type or more generally on a multi-piece type (i.e.
   made of several pieces, even of more than three pieces), the support member
25 42 being in this case bolted adjacent the wheel hub, for instance.
                    Figure 5A shows a wheel assembly 2" for a wheel rim 30"
   which is in this example of the single piece type (the wheel rim according to
   this embodiment could alternatively be of the multi-piece type) and which is
   fixed in a known way to a wheel hub 33" by a plurality of bolts 43", 44 and 45.
30 This inventive wheel assembly 2" only differs from that of Figure 5, in that the
   first and second clamp rings 12 and 22 of the respective first and second
   shield rings 10 and 20 are attached together and to the wheel hub 33" by

                                             13
   fastening means 40" including an intermediate annular support member 42"
   which is analogous to the support member 42 of Figure 5 but which is
   attached to the wheel hub 33" by bolts 43". As visible in Figure 5A, the shield
   1 is also axially distant from the axially outer rim flange 35" of the wheel rim
 5 30".
                    Figures 6 and 7 show a nearly abutting arrangement end to
   end with an interstice between two consecutive arcuate sectors 11 a, 12a
   similar to those visible in Figure 1, without contact between these consecutive
   sectors 11 a, 12a.
10                  Figures 8-9, 10-11       and  14-15 each show in pairs an
   overlapping abutting arrangement end to end with an overlap between the
   respective ends of two consecutive arcuate sectors 111 a, 11 2a secured by
   mutually engaging shoulders 118 and 119 integrally formed in the end edges
    118a, 118a', 118a" and 119a, 119a', 119a" of each arcuate flexible sector
15 111a (radially outside the arcuate rigid clamping part 11 2a). These shoulders
   118 and 119 have the same small depth (in the axial direction of the wheel
   assembly), the same width (in the circumferential direction of the wheel
   assembly) and the same radial height equal to that of the arcuate flexible
   sector 111a so that, when assembled with the overlapping abutments of
20 Figures 9, 11 and 15, the sectors 111a, 112a appear to be joined on either
   side along a radial joining line L defined by the shoulder 118 of the sector
   111a, 112a which has its convex outer surface covered by the overlapping
   concave inner surface of the other sector 111a, 11 2a.
                    Specifically, Figures 8-9 show that both engaging shoulders
25 118 and 119 each define a right angle with the end edges 11 8a and 11 9a of
   the corresponding sectors 111 a, 11 2a, whereas Figures 10-11 show that the
   shoulders 118 and 119 each define an obtuse angle with the tapered end
   edges 118a' and 119a' of the corresponding sectors 111a, 112a, and the
   obtuse shoulders 118 and 119 of Figures 14-15 only distinguish from those of
30 Figures 10-11 in that they have a smaller width.
                    Figures 12 and 13 also show an overlapping abutment with an
   overlap between the end edges 11 8a"' and 11 9a"' of two consecutive arcuate

                                            14
   sectors 111 a, 11 2a secured by shoulders 118 and 119 integrally formed in
   these end edges 118a.' and 119a"' and having the same axial depth and
   radial height, but not having the same circumferential width so that, when
   assembled in the overlapping abutment of Figure 13, the sectors 111a, 112a
 5 appear to be joined only on their convex outer side along a radial joining line L
   defined by the shoulder 118 of the sector 111 a, 11 2a which has its convex
   outer surface covered only by a part of the end edge 119a"' of the concave
   inner surface of the other sector 111 a, 11 2a, whose shoulder 119 does not
   abut against the end edge 11 8a"'.
10                   Figures 16-17 show a nearly abutting arrangement end to end
   of consecutive sectors 211 a, 21 2a characterized in that they have respective
   sloping end edges 218a and 219a which, on the inner concave side of the
   sectors 211 a, 212a, are symmetrically tapered and beveled for instance in a
   curved manner so as to substantially join together at their respective thinnest
15 ends and, on the outer convex side thereof, substantially define a joining line
   L' at these thinnest ends. As visible in Figure 16, these beveled edges 218a
   and 219a extend from the arcuate rigid clamping part 212a to the outer
   circumferential edge 220 of the sectors 211 a, 212a with a large beveled width
   over the radial height of the sectors 211 a, 212a.
20                   Figures 18 and 19 each also show a nearly abutment of the
   consecutive sectors 211 a, 212a which have respective sloping end edges
   218a' and 219a', 218a" and 219a" but which, on the outer convex side of the
   sectors 211 a, 212a, define the symmetrical tapered edges 218a' and 219a',
   218a" and 219a" which are beveled for instance in a curved manner so as to
25 substantially join together at their respective thinnest ends and, on the inner
   concave side thereof, substantially define a joining line L' at these thinnest
   ends. As visible in Figure 18, these beveled edges 218a' and 219a' extend
   from the arcuate rigid clamping part 212a to the outer circumferential edge
   220 of the sectors 211 a, 212a with a small beveled width over the radial
30 height of the sectors 211a, 212a, whereas in Figure 19 the beveled edges
   218a" and 219a" extend over the radial height of the sole arcuate flexible part
   211 a with a large beveled width radially outside the arcuate rigid clamping part

                                              15
   212a (both consecutive assembled clamping parts 212a being spaced by an
   interstice in Figure 19, contrary to the assembled flexible parts 211 a which are
   joined together).
                     The arcuate sector 311 a, 31 2a of a first and/or second shield
 5 ring 310 for a protector shield according to the variant embodiment of Figures
   20 and 21 essentially distinguishes from the embodiment of Figures 1-5, in
   that:
                     - ribs 321 are formed on the inner concave surface of the
   sector 311 a, 312a (see Figure 21), and in that
10                   - the sector 311a, 312a is provided with an axially extending
   bead 322 (see Figure 20) which has a thickness greater than that of the rest of
   the arcuate flexible part 311 a and which defines the outer circumferential edge
   320 of this sector 311 a, 312a.
                     In the example of Figure 21, two radial ribs 321 are provided
15 on the sector 311a, 312a near the two respective end edges 318a and 319a
   thereof designed to be mounted substantially in abutment with corresponding
   end edges 318a and 319a of other consecutive sectors 311 a, 312a.
                     Alternatively, it is to be noted that an arcuate sector of a first
   and/or second shield ring for a protector shield according to the invention
20 could have either this axially extending bead 322 at the outer circumferential
   edge 320 of this sector, or these radial ribs 321 (i.e. not necessarily the
   combination of this bead 322 and of these ribs 321).

                                             16
