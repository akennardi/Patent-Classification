   Field
   The present invention relates to a method of displaying
   performance data, a performance manager and a performance
20 management system for a gaming system.
   Background to the Invention
   Large gaming venues such as casinos typically have on
25 their floor a large number of gaming machines that may be
   in operation simultaneously.
   Recently it has been proposed to provide techniques for
   reconfiguring the gaming machines that are on a gaming
30 floor, for example by using server based gaming to change
   the games that are downloaded onto a gaming terminal.                           In
   such an environment there is a need for tools to assist a
   person seeking to manage the configuration of gaming
   terminals to monitor the performance of a configuration.

   Detailed Description
10 Figure 1 illustrates a casino network system used in
   accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
   Further details of a casino network system 100 may be
   found in WO 2007/014000, the disclosure of which is
   incorporated herein by reference.   The embodiment provides
15 a performance manager and associated performance
   management techniques to be employed in a system such as
   disclosed in WO 2007/014000.
   Referring to Figure 1, a casino network system 100
20 includes a plurality of gaming terminals 110, 120, and 130
   interconnected through network 140 to a slot accounting
   and/or player tracking system 150  (hereinafter
   collectively referring to as a player tracking system),
   slot floor configuration manager 160 and certificate
25 manager 170.  It should be understood that, while Figure 1
   refers to configuring gaming terminals in the form of
   "slot machines" 100, 120 and video poker 120, other gaming
   terminals such as gaming tables for Blackjack, Pai Gow,
   Baccarat and others may be subject to reconfiguration
30 where such tables are so adapted.   As but an example, a
   gaming table layout may be embodied as a number of video
   displays, and reconfiguration may be of a type to
   reconfigure the video layout to change the game to be
   played at the table, bonus features, minimum and maximum
35 bets and the like.   Thus the term "gaming terminal" as
   used herein includes gaming tables as well.           Person
   skilled in the art will also appreciate that some games
                                            10133151_1 (GHMatters) P71888.AU.43/04/18

                              - 7
   such as stepper slots 110 may not be readily configurable
   because they are electro-mechanical in nature.
   Player tracking system 150 and slot floor configuration
 5 manager 160 are connected to database server 180 via a
   communication link 185, which may be integrated with or
   separate from network 140.  Slot floor configuration
   manager 160 and certificate manager 170 are connected to
   game database server 190 via a communication link 195
10 which may be integrated with or separate from network 140.
   In an embodiment, the casino network system 100 may be
   implemented in another gaming environment, such as a
   hotel, restaurant, theatre, store, airport or other venue
15 having one or more gaming systems.
   System 100 also includes a system workstation 200,
   connected to network 140.  In addition, one or more self
   service kiosks 210, and/or one or more external systems
20 220 may be connected to network 140.  External system 220
   is connected to network 140 through firewall 225, and may
   include a player terminal in a hotel room or other
   location external to the casino, for example.            One or more
   kiosks 210 may be used to facilitate operations such as
25 slot ticket redemption, player card point redemption,
   change and/or currency dispensation, promotion redemption
   and/or issuance, advertising, information, event and/or
   dining reservations and/or ticketing, etc.         For example,
   one or more kiosks 210 and/or external systems 220 may
30 used to purchase and/or view sports scores, news, game
   announcements, weather, flight information, show times,
   specials, reward tickets, prize tickets, coupons, airline
   or show tickets, reservation confirmation, or other
   information, for example.  Additionally, a player may be
35 able to locate his or her favorite games, restaurants or
   other facilities and/or services at a kiosk 210.
                                           10133151_1 (GHMatters) P71888.AU.43/04/18

                                - 8
   Gaming terminals 110, 120, and 130 include smart
   communications interfaces   (SCI) 115, 125, and 135
   respectively, which communicate with network 140.                       In
   other embodiments, SCI 115, 125, and 135 may instead
 5 communicate with player tracking system 150 via other
   system and/or method, such as a serial communications
   protocol.   In an embodiment, SCI 115,   125, and 135 may be
   integrated into a game controller for gaming terminals
   110, 120, and 130.
10
   Player tracking and slot accounting system 150 collects
   data from SCI 115, 125, and 135 for purposes of slot
   accounting, monitoring and security, and player tracking
   as is well known in the art.     Player tracking system 150
15 processes and stores said data in database 180.
   Slot floor configuration manager 160 receives information
   relevant to slot floor configuration management from
   player tracking system 150 and database 180.              For example,
20 slot floor configuration manager 160 may include an
   interface to player tracking system 150 to facilitate
   transfer of information between manager 160 and tracking
   system 150.   In an embodiment, slot floor configuration
   manager 160 receives information from a database separate
25 from database 180 used by player tracking system 150.                              In
   an embodiment, slot floor configuration manager 160 may
   receive floor configuration information independent of
   player tracking system 150, for example the slot floor
   configuration manager 160 also may receive information,
30 including performance information such as coin-in, cash
   in, jackpots paid, coin-out and the like, directly from
   gaming terminal 110, 120, 130.     Gaming terminals 110, 120,
   130 may be connected to slot floor configuration manager
   160 and/or player tracking system 150 via separate
35 networks or a common network, such as an Ethernet.
   Slot floor configuration manager 160 processes information
                                              10133151_1 (GHMatters) P71888.AU.4 3/04/18

                              - 9
   to determine and/or suggest configurations of gaming
   terminals on a gaming floor, such as a casino floor.                         Slot
   manager 160 reviews, adjusts, and approves suggested floor
   configurations via system workstation 200.          In an
 5 embodiment, players may be provided with an ability to
   select desired games to be downloaded to a terminal via
   SCI 115, 125, and 135 and/or gaming terminal 110, 120, and
   130.  Players may also review game information or update
   their profiles via kiosk 210 or external system 220, for
10 example.
   System 100 may also include external system 230, which is
   connected to certificate manager 170 via a dedicated,
   secure, communications link via firewall 235, for example.
15 External system 230 may be a workstation in a gaming
   regulator's office, for example.   Gaming regulators may
   monitor and manage game certificates on certificate
   manager 170 via external system 230.   Unless required by a
   particular jurisdiction, the certificate manager 170 and
20 associated equipment and functions may not be required.
   Certificate manager 170 is configured to allow access to
   games to be controlled for a given gaming environment,
   such as governmental regulators or gaming operators acting
25 in compliance with gaming regulations.   The certificate
   manager 170 may work with a certificate database to
   control access to the game(s) being played.           For example,
   the certificate database may include encoded and encrypted
   digital certificates or other authentication/license
30 indicators that uniquely tie to games in the game database
   on a one-to-one basis.  In an embodiment, due to the
   nature of the games and gaming terminals, a game may not
   be played unless a valid certificate for that game exists
   in the certificate database.   In an embodiment, a
35 certificate is also mated to a venue, such as a casino or
   other gaming environment, so that a game may not be played
   at another venue even if the game and certificate were
                                            10133151_1 (GHMatters) P71888.AU.43/04/18

                              - 10
   electronically duplicated and moved to another venue.
   In an embodiment, a certificate may also be mated to a
   binary image of a game file, such that a game may not be
 5 played if the binary image is modified.    If a modification
   or update of a game image is a result of an authorized
   action, a new certificate may be issued by a regulator
   before the game may be played.  Games lacking a valid
   certificate may be handled differently in a player's game
10 catalog interface.  In an embodiment, games lacking a
   valid certificate may be excluded from a player selection
   interface altogether. In an alternate embodiment, games
   lacking a valid certificate may be excluded from certain
   portions of a player catalog and/or visibly marked with an
15 appropriate descriptive phrase such as "Pending approval
   for play in this casino".
   In an embodiment, certificates may be implemented such
   that the number of concurrently playing games of a given
20 title may be limited by regulators or a game provider, for
   example.  In an embodiment, certificates may be
   implemented such that a number of concurrently playing
   games from a given game provider is similarly limited.                             In
   an embodiment, the certificate database may be implemented
25 to facilitate a total number of games being concurrently
   played at a given venue, if regulations enforce such a
   limit, for example.
   In an embodiment, regulators have access to the
30 certificate database, either through an interface local to
   a gaming environment or through a remote interface such as
   a web-based interface through a dedicated and encrypted
   network link between the venue and the regulator.                    Through
   this interface, the regulator may manage the certificate
35 database to approve games for play or similarly revoke
   approval of games, for example.
                                           10133151_1 (GHMatters) P71888.AU.4 3/04/18

                               - 11
   In an embodiment, the casino floor configuration system
   100 uses historical data as well as stored information
   regarding available games to determine and suggest, or in
   certain instances command, a game configuration or mix for
 5 the casino floor or other gaming environment.             Such a mix
   may include, for example, game location(s),         game
   denomination(s),  game content, game appearance, terminal
   appearance, terminal operational mode and/or additional
   parameter(s) such as volatility, return to player (RTP),
10 etc.   In an embodiment, the system 100 may change a gaming
   environment floor configuration automatically.                For
   example, rules, preferences, calendar-based schedules,
   and/or historical data may be used by system 100 to
   automatically reconfigure a gaming environment.                 As but a
15 few examples, the denominations of games may be changed to
   higher denominations for periods such as holidays and
   weekends where tourists or conventioneers are expected and
   lower denominations during the week for local players.
   Where a large influx of tourists is expected, games may be
20 converted from, for example, video poker games to video
   slot machine games which may be more popular with the
   expected demographics of the patrons.   Historical data may
   also be used to control or suggest a configuration regime.
   Prior successful configurations may be accessed and
25 duplicated and even tied to calendar events, e.g.
   reconfigure for the Christmas Holiday the same as last
   Christmas.   Where players are entitled to select
   configurations, a historical record may be maintained with
   respect to player requested configurations and the same
30 may be analyzed to set up configurations for the casino
   floor.
   In an embodiment, the slot floor configuration manager 160
   may include a workstation with an intuitive and easy-to
35 use interface, such as a visual representation of the
   casino floor with installed gaming terminals 110, 120,
   130.   For example, the workstation includes a display.
                                            10133151_1 (GHMatters) P71888.AU.4 3/04/18

                               - 12
   The manager 160 controls the display to display the
   position of terminals on a casino floor and to display
   with each terminal  (or group or banks of terminals) data
   or a visual reference corresponding to at least content
 5 then resident on each terminal   (e.g. the current game or
   advertisements).   For example, each terminal may be shown
   in association with at least one of a number, letter,
   label, icon and/or other indicator.    As a specific
   example, each gaming terminal has associated therewith a
10 graphic icon representing game content such as a
   representation of a unique game symbol, trademark, or
   other pictorial so an operator may determine at a glance a
   resident configuration of each terminal.       Using a data
   input device such as a mouse, keyboard, remote control or
15 touch screen, the operator may enter a prompt at a
   selected icon whereupon the processor is controlled to
   display further details such as denomination, performance,
   maintenance history, or the like.    In this fashion,
   individual terminals or whole banks of terminals may be
20 reconfigured intuitively, for example, in a "drag and
   drop" manner.  The gaming terminals 110, 120, 130 may be
   selected individually and/or in groups for configuration
   changes, for example.   In an embodiment, an operator
   and/or system may view and/or change gaming terminal 110,
25 120, 130 information and/or configuration using the
   configuration manager interface.    Using the floor
   configuration manager 160, an operator may change a game
   available for play at a gaming terminal 110, 120, 130 and
   also information display via a primary and/or additional
30 display at gaming terminal 110, 120, 130.
   Figure 2 illustrates the functional components of a
   performance manager of the slot configuration manager 160.
   The performance manager 169 has a number of user interface
35 components 161 including a terminal selector 162 and a
   performance measure selector 163 operable by a user using
   an input device 168 in order to select the terminals in
                                             10133151_1 (GHMatters) P71888.AU.4 3/04/18

                               - 13
   relation to which a performance measure is to be evaluated
   and to select one or more performance measures to be
   evaluated.   Typically, the options available to the user
   are displayed on display 167 and the input device 168 is
 5 in the form of the keyboard, mouse or the like in order to
   allow a user to make selections as will be described
   further in relation to Figure 3.    Once the user makes
   selections using the user interface components 161 a data
   retriever 164 retrieves the performance data 181 specified
10 by the entered terminal selection and performance measure
   from database 180. The graphical representation processor
   165 processes the performance measure data in order to
   produce a graphical representation of the performance
   measure for display on the display 167.      Further, the
15 performance manager 169 includes a floor displayer 166
   that is configured to produce a display of the gaming
   floor or a portion of the gaming floor depending on
   parameters input by the user.    In the embodiment, the
   floor displayer 166 displays a perspective view of the
20 entire gaming floor based on data stored the database 180.
   The graphical representation processor 165 provides data
   to the floor display 166 which enables the floor displayer
   to overlay the graphical representation on the floor
   configuration display when it is displayed on the display
25 167.
   Person skilled in the art will appreciate that while the
   above embodiment has been described from a functional
   perspective, the components of the performance manager 169
30 will typically be implemented as program code executed on
   a processor that forms part of the slot configuration
   manager.   That is, the performance manager will typically
   be a software routine and each individual component a
   further sub-routine of the floor configuration manager.
35 However, dedicated hardware realisations of the
   performance measure are also possible.
                                             10133151_1 (GHMatters) P71888.AU.4 3/04/18

                               - 14
   Person skilled in the art will appreciate that some
   features, for example graphical representation processor
   165 or the floor displayer 166 may be used for other
   purposes by the slot configurator 160 and hence may be
 5 implemented in conjunction with the performance manager
   169 rather than as part of the performance manager 169.
   Figure 3 illustrates an exemplary graphical user interface
   300 which a user may operate using a pointing device such
10 as a mouse.   The user interface contains a plurality of
   areas.  A first area 310 allows the user to select the
   terminals in relation to which a performance is to be
   displayed.   It can be seen that the user has the options
   to select all terminals 311, slot machines only 312 or to
15 select machines individually 313.    The second area 320
   allows the user to set the time period of the evaluation
   and contains a start period box 321 and end period box 322
   which allows the user to specify time and date for the
   period of evaluation.   In some embodiments, the user may
20 also be allowed to set a hypothetical period, for example
   to show how a particular configuration is expected to
   perform in an upcoming holiday period.    In this example,
   performance measure determiner 164A may determine a
   performance measure based on historical performance data
25 or data obtained from another source, for example data
   from another venue.
   A third area 330 allows the user to select the performance
   measure.   In this example the user has three available
30 performance measures including coin-in 331, payouts 332
   and maintenance problems 333.    The fourth area 340 allows
   the user to select how the measure should be represented,
   in this example as a median 341 or a mean 342.
35 In an embodiment the graphical representation of data is
   displayed as a datum plane.    In another embodiment the
   graphical representation may be as a line or similar.                            A
                                             10133151_1 (GHMatters) P71888.AU.4 3/04/18

                                - 15
   datum plane is advantageous because it allows the
   performance to be overlaid on a perspective view of a
   gaming floor.    This is illustrated schematically in Figure
   4.  A casino floor configuration 410 is displayed having
 5 four electronic gaming machines    (EGMs).     For a casino
   having hundreds or thousands of gaming terminals, the
   floor configuration 410 would be a perspective view of all
   or a portion of the gaming floor preferable showing or at
   least representing the physical locations of the gaming
10 machines.   In this example, the floor configuration is
   modified by moving representations keyed to the gaming
   machines on the gaming floor relative to datum plane 460.
   For example, the casino operator may decide to compare the
   performance of the gaming machines on the floor based upon
15 a calculated "floor average" hold percentage.                This
   percentage would be calculated from the data received from
   the individual terminals on the gaming floor by, for
   example, the following equation:
20            Ewagers (t)  - E Jackpots Paid (t)/           Ewagers (t)
   where:     Ewagers (t)  = the sum of all wagers made at the
              gaming terminal for a time   (t)
              E Jackpots Paid (t) = sum of all payouts from the
              gaming machine for the same time          (t).
25
   As but an example, if a gaming machine received $1000 in
   wagers for a 4 hour period and paid out $800 in jackpots,
   the hold percentage would be 20%, i.e. 1000-800/1000. The
   coin-in  (wagers) for the gaming terminals as well as
30 jackpots paid are constantly being monitored by the player
   tracking and slot accounting system 150 and thus the
   system can calculate for all machines a hold percentage as
   well as a floor average hold percentage, e.g.
35            EHold  Percentage/No. of gaming terminals
   This floor average hold percentage value would be
                                               10133151_1 (GHMatters) P71888.AU.4 3/04/18

                               - 16
   represented in the display as a "ghost" or phantom datum
   plane over the gaming terminals shown in         the perspective
   floor view.   If the floor average is      constantly being
   recalculated as machines become active and inactive it may
 5 be represented as moving vertically.        A value of the floor
   average may be assigned and displayed relate to the datum,
   e.g. 83%.
   According to the present invention in the example of
10 Figure 4, EGMs 420 and 430 are inactive and are merely
   shown with their position represented by lines 421 and 431
   relative to the floor.   Gaming machines 440 and 450 are
   active, as indicated by arrows 442 and 452 respectively.
   In the case of gaming machine 450, a line 451 is used to
15 show the position relative to the datum plane 460 because
   the gaming machine's 450 performance is below the floor
   average.   Gaming machine 440 is performing around the
   average and a line 453 through the representation of the
   EGM demonstrates where the EGM 440 intersects the datum
20 plane 460.   Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the
   gaming machines are shown with their relative position to
   the desired performance measure.
   While the display suggested in FIG. 4 shows
25 representations of slot machines rising or falling
   relative to the datum plane 460, the system and method of
   the present invention could also use balloons, boxes or
   other icons graphically tied to the slot machines depicted
   in the display to represent relative performance.                          In this
30 fashion, by a simple glance, an operator can determine
   which machines are underperforming, over-performing,                              and
   are providing average performance.        The datum plane may be
   selected to be average coin-in for $0.25 machines in which
   case only $0.25 denomination machines would be graphically
35 depicted relate to the datum.        The datum could also
   segregate based upon floor average as well as by
   manufacturer in which case only the selected
                                                 10133151_1 (GHMatters) P71888.AU.4 3/04/18

                               - 17
   manufacturer(s) machines would be depicted relative to the
   datum.
   Based upon historical data the operator can also compare
 5 to selected parameters, e.g. best hold percentage in the
   last month, to graphically see how gaming machines are now
   or in the past performed relative to the selected
   parameter.  In yet a further feature, manufacturers can
   provide the operator with empirical data relative to their
10 machines/games to see, hypothetically, how these games
   would later floor average  (i.e. the datum) and perform
   relative to the datum.   In this fashion an operator can
   determine whether purchase of the machine/game would
   enhance profitability.
15
   It will be appreciated that the position of the active
   machines or alternatively the selected machines relative
   to the floor tells the operator how machines or banks of
   machines are performing.   Further, over time the data may
20 shift up or down and machines will float up to or through
   the datum 460, drop below the datum 460 so the operator
   has a real-time graphical representation of performance.
   As discussed in W02007/014000, a user can select an
   individual machine to obtain detail about that machine.
25
   Person skilled in the art will appreciate that a number of
   performance measures other than those discussed before
   could be used.  For example, an example of a maintenance
   parameter would be "tilts" of the machine.         For example,
30 in respect of table games the gross amount held per unit
   time, i.e. the total wagered minus the total paid out may
   be displayed.
   Person skilled in the art will appreciate that historical
35 analysis can be made.  For example, a first datum plain
   may show the current performance whereas a second datum
   plane may show performance at a peak time.         The
                                            10133151_1 (GHMatters) P71888.AU.4 3/04/18

                              - 18
   performance manager could be used to view how performance
   compares to a different number of configuration.                   For
   example, if banks of gaming machines are moved relative to
   the floor or different games were to be downloaded to the
 5 gaming machines.
   An advantage of certain of the above embodiments is that
   performance can be seen relative to the floor
   configuration.
10
   An advantage of certain of the above embodiments is that
   performance is displayed in a manner in which it can be
   interpreted intuitively.
15 Figure 5 shows the method 500 of an embodiment. A user
   selects terminals to view 510. The user selects a
   performance measure 520. The system derives a performance
   measure 530. The performance measure is graphically
   represented 540. The performance for each terminal is
20 displayed relative to the measure 550.
   Person skilled in the art will appreciate that various
   other modification may be made to the foregoing embodiment
   without departing from the scope of the invention.                      These
25 and other modifications should be considered as falling
   within the scope of the invention defined in the attached
   claims. In particular, it should be apparent that features
   of various of the above embodiments and examples can be
