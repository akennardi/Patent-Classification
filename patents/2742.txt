                           WORK IMPLEMENT, ARM, AND WORK VEHICLE
 5 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
              Field of the Invention
   [0001]     The present invention relates to a work implement, an arm, and a work vehicle.
              Description of the Related Art
   [0002]    With a large hydraulic excavator, because of the large size of the bucket, a great deal of
10 power is needed for rotation, and two hydraulic cylinders are sometimes used. In a case such as
   this, the distal end of the arm branches in two, the distal ends of which are rotatably attached to the
   bracket of the bucket (see Patent Literature 1, for example).
            FIG. 11 shows the configuration of a boom 1800, an arm 1100, and a bucket 1200 in a
   conventional hydraulic excavator. In FIG. 11, the bucket 1200 is attached to the arm 1100 so that
15 its opening faces to the rear of the vehicle.
   [0003]    With a hydraulic excavator such as this, a flat protector 1300 is disposed as a protective
   member to the distal ends of the arm 1100 so that soil excavated by the bucket 1200 will not fall
   into the space 1OOS between the two distal ends of the arm 1100.
            Meanwhile, if the arm 1100 should be twisted during the drive of the hydraulic excavator,
20 there will be greater twisting at the forked portion of the distal end of the arm 1100. Accordingly,
   the protector 1300 is fixed to the arm 1100 at the portion on the proximal end part side, but is not
    1

   fixed to the arm 1100 at the portion on the distal end part side, and a restricting member is attached
   to the arm 1100 so as to restrict movement resulting from this distortion. The conventional
   structure for attaching the protector 1300 to the arm 1100 will now be described.
   [0004]    FIG. 12 is a detail view of the distal end of the arm 1100, and shows a state in which the
 5 protector 1300 has been removed. As shown in the drawing, the distal end of the arm 1100 is
   divided into a first end component 1110 and a second end component 1120, and the above
   mentioned spaces 1OOS is formed between the first end component 1110 and the second end
   component 1120. A seat 1400 is provided to the surface of the arm 1100 so as to surround the
   space 1000S. The protector 1300 is bolted to this seat 1400.
10 [0005]    As shown in FIG. 12, the seat 1400 is made up of a first seat 1410 disposed along the first
   end component 1110, a second seat 1420 disposed along the second end component 1120, and a
   third seat 1430 disposed on the edge on the boom 1800 (see FIG. 12) side of the space 1000S. Two
   bolts 1500 are disposed in the third seat 1430 in the width direction of the arm 1100, and four bolts
   1500 are disposed in each of the first seat 1410 and the second seat 1420 along the lengthwise
15 direction of the arm 1100.
   [0006]    FIG. 13 is a cross section of a state in which the protector 1300 is fixed to the seat 1400.
   FIG. 13 shows the contact portions of the first seat 1410 and the protector 1300, but the
   configuration is the same for the contact portions of the second seat 1420 and the protector 1300.
            As shown in FIG. 13, the two bolts 1500 on the proximal end part side press the protector
20 1300 against the first seat 1410 via washers 1600. Thus, the protector 1300 is fixed to the first seat
   1410 by the bolts 1500.
   2

                                                   3
[0007]    Meanwhile, substantially cylindrical collars 1700 having a large-diameter part 1710
and a small-diameter part 1720 are fitted to the two bolts 1500 on the distal end part side. FIG.
14 is a detail view of the area near a portion of the two bolts 1500 on the distal end part side in
FIG. 13. These collars 1700 are pressed against the first seat 1410 by the bolts 1500 and thereby
fixed to the first seat 1410.
[0008]    In a state in which the hydraulic excavator is not operating, a gap is formed between the
collars 1700 and the protector 1300, and the collars 1700 and the protector 1300 are not
touching. More precisely, in the axial direction of the collars 1700, a gap G1001 is formed
between the large-diameter part 1710 and the protector 1300, and in the radial direction thereof,
a gap G1002 is formed between the small-diameter part 1720 and the protector 1300.
[0009]    Thus, the configuration is such that just the proximal end part side of the protector 1300
is fixed to the arm 1100, but the distal end part side of the protector 1300 is not fixed to the arm
1100 and restricts distortion of the protector 1300.
[0010]    Patent Literature 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 2006-132224
[0011]    However, even when a gap is formed between the collars 1700 and the protector 1300
as in the above-mentioned conventional configuration, depending on the amount of distortion of
the arm 1100, the collars 1700 and the protector 1300 may still come into contact, resulting in
more stress being produced between the seat 1400 and the protector 1300.
[001 la] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate
the above mentioned disadvantage.
[001 1b] Embodiments of the present invention aim to provide a work implement, an arm, and a
work vehicle with which the stress produced in the attachment structure of a protective member
can be reduced.
SUMMARY
[0012]    A work vehicle pertaining to the first aspect of the invention comprises a vehicle main
body and an arm, said arm having an arm main body, a protective member, a fixing component,

                                                   4
and a restrictor. The arm main body has a distal end part and a proximal end part. The distal
end part includes a first end component and a second end component disposed a specific space
apart in the width direction, and a bucket is attached to the arm main body, preferably the distal
end part. The proximal end part is configured to allow attachment on the vehicle main body
side. The protective member covers said specific space. The fixing component is disposed on a
proximal end part side of the specific space and fixes the protective member to the arm main
body. The restrictor is disposed between the first end component and the second end component
in the width direction, and restricts the movement of the protective member.
[0013]    In an embodiment, the restrictor that restricts the movement of the protective member
may be disposed between the first end component and the second end component in the width
direction. If the arm main body should be twisted by operation of the hydraulic excavator, there
will be less twisting on the inside than the outside in the width direction of the arm main body.
[0013a] Accordingly, disposing the restrictor between the first end component and the second
end component in the width direction reduces the stress that is produced in the structure in
which the protective member is attached to the arm main body, even if twisting occurs in the
arm main body.
[0014]    In an embodiment a gap is formed in at least part of the region between the restrictor
and the protective member.
[0014a] Consequently, the protective member may not be fixed to the arm main body on the
distal end part side where twisting is apt to occur, but the protective member may be fixed on
the proximal end part side where twisting is less likely to occur. Accordingly, the stress
generated at the restrictor may be reduced on the distal end part side where stress is more likely
to occur.
[0015]    In an embodiment, the restrictor has a seat and a restricting member. The seat is fixed
to at least one of the side face on the specific space side of the first end component and the side
face on the specific space side of the second end component. The restricting member is fixed to
the seat via a through-hole formed in the protective member. A gap is formed between the
restricting member and the protective member.

                                                  5
[0015a] Thus disposing the seat on at least one of the inside of the first end component and the
inside of the second end component may reduce the stress produced in the connected portion
between the seat and the arm main body more than when the seat is provided on the surfaces of
the first end component and second end component, which are on the outside.
[0016]     In an embodiment, the restricting member is a cylindrical member, and has a small
diameter part that comes into contact with the seat, and a large-diameter part provided on the
opposite side of the seat from the small-diameter part. The gap is formed between the protective
member and the large-diameter part in the axial direction of the restricting member, and between
the protective member and the small-diameter part in the radial direction of the restricting
member.
[0016a] Since the restricting member is such that a gap is formed between itself and the
protective member in its axial direction and radial direction, the stress produced in the restricting
member and the seat can be moderated when the arm main body twists.
[0017]     In an embodiment, the seat is disposed on both the side face on the specific space side
of the first end component, and the side face on the specific space side of the second end
component. The restricting member is fixed to each of the seats.
[0017a] When twisting occurs in the arm main body, there may be less twisting on the inside
than the outside in the width direction of the arm main body, so the stress produced in the
restricting member and the seat may be reduced.
[0018]     In an embodiment, the protective member has a protrusion. This protrusion is fixed to
the face of the protective member main body that is opposite the arm main body, more on the
restrictor side of the arm than the fixing component.
[00 18a] Consequently, when soil, rock, or the like hits the protective member, the impact on the
protective member may be borne by not only the restrictor, but also by the protrusion colliding
with the arm main body. Accordingly, less of a load may be exerted on the portion of the
restrictor that is connected to the arm main body during collision with soil.

                                                    6
[0019]    In an embodiment, the restrictor has a seat and a restricting member. The seat is fixed
to at least one of the side face on the specific space side of the first end component and the side
face on the specific space side of the second end component. The restricting member is fixed to
the seat via a through-hole formed in the protective member. A gap is provided between the
seat and the protective member main body. A gap is also formed between the protrusion and the
arm main body. The gap between the protrusion and the arm main body is smaller than the gap
between the seat and the protective member main body.
[0019a] Consequently, the impact on the protective member when soil, rock, or the like hits the
protective member may be borne by having the protrusion collide with the arm main body prior
to the restrictor. Accordingly, less of a load may be exerted on the portion of the restrictor that
is connected to the arm main body during collision with soil.
[0020]    In an embodiment, the protrusion is provided in at least two places that are opposite
each other on the first end component and the second end component. The protrusions are
formed in a rod shape along the first end component and the second end component.
[0020a] When the protrusions are thus formed in a rod shape, the impact that occurs as a result
of the collision of soil or the like with the protective member may be borne over a larger surface
area.
[0021]    An arm pertaining to the second aspect of the invention has an arm main body, a
protective member, a fixing component, and a restrictor. The arm main body has a distal end
part and a proximal end part. The distal end part has a first end component and a second end
component disposed a specific space apart in a width direction, and a bucket is attached to the
distal end part. The proximal end part is configured to allow attachment on a vehicle main body
side. The protective member covers said specific space. The fixing component is disposed on a
proximal end part side of the specific space and fixes the protective member to the arm main
body. The restrictor is disposed between the first end component and the second end component
in the width direction, and restricts the movement of the protective member.
[0021a] In an embodiment, the restrictor that restricts the movement of the protective member
is disposed between the first end component and the second end component in the width

                                                  7
direction. If the arm main body should be twisted by operation of the hydraulic excavator, there
may be less twisting on the inside than the outside in the width direction of the arm main body.
[0021b] Accordingly, disposing the restrictor between the first end component and the second
end component in the width direction may reduce the stress that is produced in the structure in
which the protective member is attached to the arm main body, even if twisting occurs in the
arm main body.
[0021c] A work implement pertaining to the third aspect of the invention comprises a boom, a
bucket, and an arm. The boom can be pivotably attached to a vehicle main body. The arm is
attached to the boom. The bucket is attached to the arm. The arm has an arm main body, a
protective member, a fixing component, and a restrictor. The arm main body has a distal end
part and a proximal end part. The distal end part includes a first end component and a second
end component disposed a specific space apart in a width direction, and the bucket is attached to
the distal end part. The proximal end part is attached to the boom. The protective member
covers said specific space. The fixing component is disposed on the proximal end part side of
the specific space and fixes the protective member to the arm main body. The restrictor is
disposed between the first end component and the second end component in the width direction,
and restricts the movement of the protective member.
[0022]    In an embodiment, the restrictor that restricts the movement of the protective member
may be disposed between the first end component and the second end component in the width
direction. If the arm main body should be twisted by operation of the hydraulic excavator, there
will be less twisting on the inside than the outside in the width direction of the arm main body.
[0022a] Accordingly, disposing the restrictor between the first end component and the second
end component in the width direction may reduce the stress that is produced in the structure in
which the protective member is attached to the arm main body, even if twisting occurs in the
arm main body.
[0022b] Embodiments of the present invention may provide a work implement, an arm, and a
work vehicle with which the stress produced in the attachment structure of a protective member
can be reduced.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   10

   [0024]    The revolving apparatus of a work vehicle pertaining to an embodiment of the present
   invention will now be described through reference to the drawings.
   1. Configuration
   1-1. Outer Configuration of Hydraulic Excavator
 5          FIG. 1 is an oblique view of the hydraulic excavator in this embodiment. The hydraulic
   excavator 1, which is an example of a work vehicle, mainly comprises a vehicle main body 2 and a
   work implement 3. The vehicle main body 2 has a lower traveling unit 4 having crawler belts 40
   provided on the left and right ends in the travel direction, and an upper structure 5 disposed on top
   of the lower traveling unit 4. The upper structure 5 is provided with an operator's room 51, an
10 engine compartment 52, a counterweight 53, etc. The operator's room 51 is disposed on the front
   left side of the upper structure 5. The engine compartment 52 is disposed to the rear of the
   operator's room 51. The counterweight 53 is disposed at the rear end of the upper structure 5.
   [0025]    Unless otherwise specified in this embodiment, the terms front, rear, left and right here
   will use the operator's seat in the operator's room 51 as a reference. The direction in which the
15 operator's seat faces forward shall be the forward direction, and the direction that is opposite the
   forward direction shall be the rearward direction. The right side and left side in the lateral direction
   when the operator's seat faces forward shall be the right direction and left direction.
            The work implement 3 has a boom 31, an arm 30, and a bucket 33, and is attached in the
   front-center of the upper structure 5. The proximal end part of the boom 31 is rotatably linked to
20 the upper structure 5. The distal end part of the boom 31 is rotatably linked to the proximal end
   part 323 of the arm 30. The distal end part 320 of the arm 30 is rotatably linked to the bucket 33.
    11

   The bucket 33 is attached to the arm 30 so that its opening 33a (see FIG. 2) can face in the direction
   of the vehicle main body 2 (rearward). A hydraulic excavator in which the bucket 33 is attached in
   this orientation is called a backhoe.
   [0026]    Two each of a boom cylinder 34, arm cylinder 35, and bucket cylinder 36 are also
 5 provided corresponding to the boom 31, the arm 30, and the bucket 33, respectively. The boom
   cylinders 34, the arm cylinders 35, and the bucket cylinders 36 are hydraulic cylinders, and when
   these are driven, they drive the work implement 3 to carry out excavation or other such work.
   [0027]     1-2. Arm
            The arm 30 mainly has an arm main body 32, a first protector 6, a second protector 7, and
10 an attachment component 8.
            The arm main body 32 has the above-mentioned distal end part 320 and proximal end part
   323. The distal end part 320 rotatably links the bucket 33 as discussed above. The proximal end
   part 323 is rotatably linked to the distal end of the boom 31.
            The first protector 6 and the second protector 7 protect the distal end part 320. The
15 attachment component 8 attaches the first protector 6 to the distal end part 320.
   1-2-1. Configuration of Distal End Part of Arm
            FIG. 2 is a detail oblique view of the distal end portion of the work implement 3. FIG. 3 is
   a detail view of FIG. 2.
            The bucket 33 has a bucket main body 330 that scoops up soil, and a first bracket 331, a
20 second bracket 332, a third bracket 333, and a fourth bracket 334 that are provided to the rear face
   of the bucket main body 330. The first bracket 331, the second bracket 332, the third bracket 333,
    12

   and the fourth bracket 334 are disposed along the width direction of the bucket 33 (see the arrow
   W). The width direction W can also be called the width direction of the arm 30. The lengthwise
   direction of the arm main body 32 is labeled Y, the proximal end part 323 side is indicated by the
   arrow Yl, and the distal end part 320 side is indicated by the arrow Y2.
 5 [0028]    The distal end part 320 of the arm main body 32 to which the bucket 33 is attached
   branches in two, having a first end component 321 and a second end component 322. The first end
   component 321 and the second end component 322 are disposed a specific space 1OS apart in the
   width direction W.
           The first end component 321 is inserted between the first bracket 331 and the second
10 bracket 332 of the bucket 33, and is rotatably attached to the first bracket 331 and the second
   bracket 332 by a link pin (not shown).
   [0029]    The second end component 322 is inserted between the third bracket 333 and the fourth
   bracket 334 of the bucket 33, and is rotatably attached to the third bracket 333 and the fourth
   bracket 334 by a link pin (not shown).
15         The two bucket cylinders 36 (only one is shown in FIG. 2) are disposed corresponding
   respectively to the linked portion of the first end component 321 and the bucket 33 and the linked
   portion of the second end component 322 and the bucket 33. The two bucket cylinders 36 are
   provided on a first face 32a side of the arm main body 32, which is on the opposite side from the
   vehicle main body 2.
    13

   [0030]    The first protector 6 and the second protector 7, which are disposed so as to cover the
   space 1OS between the first end component 321 and the second end component 322, are provided
   to a second face 32b of the arm main body 32, which is on the same side as the vehicle main body 2.
            The first protector 6 and the second protector 7 are provided in order to prevent soil, rock,
 5 or the like excavated by the bucket 33 from going in between the first end component 321 and the
   second end component 322.
   [0031]    1-2-2. First Protector 6
            The first protector 6 is a substantially flat member, and is attached to the second face 32b of
   the arm main body 32. The first protector 6 is disposed more on the proximal end part 323 side
10 (see the arrow Yl) than the second protector 7. In FIG. 4, the configuration under the first
   protector 6 in FIG. 3 is indicated by dotted lines. FIG. 5 shows the state when the first protector 6
   has been removed.
   [0032]    As shown in FIG. 4, the first protector 6 is disposed from the first end component 321 to
   the second end component 322 so as to cover part of the space 1OS.
15          The first protector 6 mainly has a cover 60 and two rod members 61.
            FIG. 6A is an oblique view of the first protector 6 as seen from the front side, and FIG. 6B
   is an oblique view of the first protector 6 as seen from the back side. FIG. 6C is an oblique view of
   the cover 60 as seen from the back side.
   [0033]    As shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, the cover 60 is a flat member having a shape in which two
20 of the adjacent corners have been cut off from a rectangular shape, and is therefore a hexagonal
   member. In a state of being attached to the arm main body 32, the cover 60 has a first side 601 and
    14

   a second side 602 that are formed along the width direction W and are opposite each other, and a
   third side 603 and a fourth side 604 that are formed along the lengthwise direction Y of the arm
   main body 32 and are opposite each other. The first side 601 is disposed on the proximal end part
   323 side of the cover 60, and is formed shorter than the second side 602. A fifth side 605 that is
 5 inclined to the lengthwise direction Y is provided between one end in the width direction W of the
   first side 601 and the end on the proximal end part 323 side of the third side 603 (see the arrow Yl),
   and a sixth side 606 that is inclined to the lengthwise direction Y is provided between the other end
   in the width direction W of the first side 601 and the end on the proximal end part 323 side of the
   fourth side 604.
10 [0034]     Four recesses 65 are formed near the first side 601 of the cover 60 and toward the center
   in the width direction W. Two of the four recesses 65 are disposed in the width direction W, and
   two are disposed in the lengthwise direction Y.
            As shown in FIGS. 6A to 6C, through-holes 63 that pass through from the bottom faces 65a
   of each of the recesses 65 (see FIG. 6A) to the rear face 60b are formed in the cover 60.
15 [0035]     Also, two recesses 66 are formed near the second side 602 of the cover 60. The recesses
   66 are formed slender in the lengthwise direction Y, and are provided parallel to each other.
            Two through-holes 64 are formed in each of the recesses 66, from the bottom face 66a to
   the rear face 60b. The two through-holes 64 are disposed along the lengthwise direction Y.
   [0036]     As shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, the two rod members 61 have a slender, cuboid shape, and
20 both have the same shape. One of the two rod members 61 is disposed parallel to the third side 603,
   near the third side 603. The other rod member 61 is disposed parallel to the fourth side 604, near
    15

   the fourth side 604. The two rod members 61 are thus disposed parallel to each other, and the two
   recesses 66 and the four through-holes 63 are formed in between the two rod members 61 in the
   width direction W.
   [0037]     1-2-3. Attachment Component
 5          The structure for attaching the first protector 6 to the arm main body 32 will now be
   described.
            As shown in FIG. 5, the attachment component 8 of the first protector 6 to the arm main
   body 32 is provided near the distal end part 320 of the arm main body 32.
            As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the attachment component 8 has a fixing component 81 that
10 fixes the first protector 6, and a restrictor 82 that restricts the movement of the first protector 6.
   [0038]     1-2-3-1. Fixing Component
            As shown in FIG. 5, the fixing component 81 is provided on the proximal end part 323 side
   of the space 1OS (see the arrow Yl), in the center in the width direction W. The fixing component
   81 has two sets, each set consisting of a seat 811, two bolts 812, and two washers 813. The seats
15 811 are members formed longer in the width direction W, and are fixed by welding or the like to
   the second face 32b of the arm main body 32.
   [0039]    FIG. 7 is a cross section of the fixing component 81 and the first protector 6 along the A
   A' line in FIG. 3. As shown in FIG. 7, the upper faces 811 a of the seats 811 are formed parallel to
   the second face 32b. The two seats 811 are disposed along the lengthwise direction Y, and are
20 parallel to each other.
    16

                                                    17
          The first protector 6 is installed on the upper faces 811 a of the two seats 811, with the
rear face 60b of the first protector 6 touching the upper faces 811 a.
[0040]    Two bolt holes 81 lb that are perpendicular to the upper faces 81 la are formed in each
of the two seats 811, and the positions of the bolt holes 81 lb (four total) correspond to the
positions of the four through-holes 63 of the first protector 6 shown in FIGS. 6A to 6C.
          The bolts 812 each have a head 812a and a shaft 812b. The shafts 812b are threaded
into the through-holes 63 and the bolt holes 81 lb from the front face 60a side of the first
protector 6. The heads 812a fit into the recesses 65 and press the bottom faces 65a against the
seats 811 via the washer 813.
[0041]    Thus, the first protector 6 is fixed by the bolts 812 to the seats 811, which are
themselves fixed to the arm main body 32.
          As shown in FIG. 5, disposing the fixing component 81 in the center in the width
direction W reduces the stress that is produced in the fixing component 81 when the arm main
body 32 twists, more than when it is disposed toward the outside.
[0042]     1-2-3-2. Restrictor
          The restrictor 82 is provided between the first end component 321 and the second end
component 322 in the width direction W, and restricts movement produced by twisting of the
first protector 6 during operation of the hydraulic excavator 1. As shown in FIG. 5, the
restrictor 82 has two seats 821, four collars 822, and four bolts 823. Two collars 822 and two
bolts 823 are disposed on each of the seats 821.
[0043]    The two seats 821 have a cuboid shape that is longer in the lengthwise direction Y, and
are disposed aligned in the width direction W. One of the seats 821 is welded to the side face
321a on the space 1OS side of the first end component 321. The other seat 821 is welded to the
side face 322a on the space 10S side of the second end component 322.
          FIG. 8 is a cross section of the first protector 6 and the restrictor 82 along the A-A' line
and the B-B' line in FIG. 3. FIG. 9 is a detail view of the area near the restrictor 82 in FIG. 8.

                                                 18
The seat 821 fixed on the first end component 321 side is shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, but the seat
821 fixed on the second end component 322 has the same configuration.
[0044]   The upper faces 821a of the seats 821 are formed parallel to the second face 32b. The
two seats 821 are disposed aligned in the lengthwise direction Y, and are parallel to each other.
Two bolt holes 821b that are perpendicular to the upper faces 821a are formed in each of the
seats 821, and the positions of the bolt holes 821b (four total) correspond to the positions of the
four through-holes 64 of the first protector 6 shown in FIGS. 6A to 6C.
[0045]   The collars 822 are metal members with a substantially cylindrical shape and having
holes 822c formed in the center. Their center axis is labeled C, and their radial direction is
labeled D. The collars 822 are each formed by a large-diameter part 822a that is thick-walled
and has a large diameter, and a small-diameter part 822b whose diameter is smaller than that of
the large-diameter part 822a. The small-diameter parts 822b of the collars 822 are inserted into
the through-holes 64, and the distal ends of the small-diameter parts 822b hit the upper faces
821a of the seats 821. The large-diameter parts 822a of the collars 822 are disposed in the
recesses 66.

   [0046]    The bolts 823 each have a head 823a and a shaft 823b. The shafts 823b of the bolts 823
   are threaded into the holes 822c of the collars 822 and the bolt holes 821b from the front face 60a
   side of the first protector 6. The heads 823a come into contact with the large-diameter parts 822a
   of the collars 822 from above, and press the collars 822 against the seats 821.
 5          Thus, the collars 822 are fixed to the seats 821 by the bolts 823.
   [0047]    Next, the layout of the collars 822 with respect to the first protector 6 will be described.
            As shown in FIG. 9, a gap is formed between the collars 822 and the first protector 6. More
   precisely, a gap GI is formed between the bottom faces 66a of the recesses 66 and the large
   diameter parts 822a of the collars 822 in a direction that runs along the axis X (also called the axial
10 direction). In the radial direction D, a gap G2 is formed between the inner peripheral faces of the
   through-holes 64 and the small-diameter parts 822b of the collars 822. Also, a gap G3 is formed
   between the rear face 60b of the cover 60 and the upper faces 821a of the seats 821. The gap G3 is
   formed by having the upper faces 821a of the seats 821 be located lower than an extension of the
   upper faces 81 la of the seats 811 of the fixing component 81 in a side view. Also, FIG. 9 shows
15 the layout relation between the first protector 6 and the restrictor 82 on the first end component 321
   side, but the layout relation between the first protector 6 and the restrictor 82 on the second end
   component 322 side is the same.
   [0048]    In a state in which the hydraulic excavator 1 is not operating and no twisting is being
   generated at the arm main body 32, the gaps GI, G2, and G3 are formed between the first protector
20 6 and the restrictor 82, and the first protector 6 is not touching the restrictor 82.
    19

            When the arm main body 32 is then subjected to twisting, the first protector 6 is also
   deformed, but the movement produced by this deformation is restricted when the first protector 6
   hits the restrictor 82. For example, if the first protector 6 deforms so as to move away from the
   second face 32b of the arm main body 32, the gap GI disappears and deformation is restricted by
 5 the large-diameter parts 822a of the collars 822.
   [0049]    Further, a gap G4 is formed between the second face 32b of the arm main body 32 and the
   lower faces 61a of the rod members 61.
            Here, the gap G4 is formed narrower than the gap G3. Consequently, when soil, rock, or
   the like hits the first protector 6, at first the lower faces 61a of the rod members 61 come into
10 contact with the second face 32b of the arm main body 32, so the welded portion between the seats
   811 and the first end component 321 or the second end component 322 is not subjected to any large
   impact.
   [0050]     1-2-4. Second Protector 7
            The second protector 7 is a substantially flat member, and is attached to the second face 32b
15 of the arm main body 32 as shown in FIG. 3. The second protector 7 is disposed more to the
   bucket 33 side (see the arrow Y2) than the first protector 6. The second protector 7 is disposed
   from the first end component 321 to the second end component 322 so as to cover part of the space
   10S.
   [0051]    The seat 11 used for installing the second protector 7 is welded to the first end component
20 321 portion of the second face 32b. Although not shown in the drawings, the seat 11 used for
   20

                                                 21
installing the second protector 7 is also welded to the second end component 322 portion of the
second face 32b.
          The second protector 7 is bolted to the seat 11, as with the above-mentioned fixing
component 81, at either the first end component 321 or the second end component 322, and at
the other one, movement produced by deformation of the second protector 7 is restricted by the
collars fixed to the seat 11.
[0052]    2. Features, etc.
2-1
         As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the hydraulic excavator 1 in this embodiment (an
example of a work vehicle) comprises the vehicle main body 2 and the arm 30, and the arm 30
has the arm main body 32, the first protector 6 (an example of a protective member), the fixing
component 81, and the restrictor 82. The arm main body 32 has the distal end part 320 and the
proximal end part 323. The distal end part 320 includes the first end component 321 and the
second end component 322 disposed a specific space 1OS (an example of a specific space) apart
in the width direction W, and the bucket 33 is attached to the distal end part 320. The proximal
end part 323 is configured to allow attachment on the vehicle main body 2 side. The first
protector 6 covers the specific space 1OS. The fixing component 81 is disposed on the proximal
end part 323 side of the specific space 1OS and fixes the first protector 6 to the arm main body
32. The restrictor 82 is disposed between the first end component 321 and the second end
component 322 in the width direction W, and restricts the movement of the first protector 6.

   [0053]    Here, the restrictor 82 that restricts the movement of the first protector 6 is disposed
   between the first end component 321 and the second end component 322 in the width direction W.
   If the arm main body 32 should be twisted by operation of the hydraulic excavator 1, there will be
   less twisting on the inside than the outside in the width direction of the arm main body 32.
 5          Accordingly, disposing the restrictor 82 between the first end component 321 and the
   second end component 322 in the width direction W reduces the stress that is produced in the
   structure in which the first protector 6 is attached to the arm main body 32, even if twisting occurs
   in the arm main body 32.
   [0054]    2-2
10          As shown in FIG. 4, with the hydraulic excavator 1 in this embodiment (an example of a
   work vehicle), a gap is formed in at least part of the region between the restrictor 82 and the first
   protector 6.
            Consequently, the first protector 6 is not fixed to the arm main body 32 on the distal end
   part 320 side where twisting is apt to occur, but the first protector 6 can be fixed on the proximal
15 end part 323 side where twisting is less likely to occur. Accordingly, the stress generated at the
   restrictor 82 can be reduced on the distal end part 320 side where stress is more likely to occur.
   [0055]    2-3
            As shown in FIG. 5, with the hydraulic excavator 1 in this embodiment (an example of a
   work vehicle), the restrictor 82 has the seats 821 and the collars 822 (an example of a restricting
20 member). The seat 821 is fixed to at least one of the side faces 321a on the specific space 1OS side
   of the first end component 321 and the side face 322a on the specific space 1OS side of the second
   22

                                                   23
end component 322. The collars 822 are fixed to the seats 821 via through-holes 64 formed in
the first protector 6. As shown in FIG. 9, the gaps GI and G2 are formed between the collars
822 and the first protector 6.
[0056]     Thus disposing the seat 821 on at least the side faces 321a of the first end component
321 and the side face 322a of the second end component 322 reduces the stress produced in the
connected portion between the seats 821 and the arm main body 32 more than when the seats
821 are provided on the second face 32b to the first end component 321 and second end
component 322, which are on the outside.
           Also, since the seats 821 are fixed to the side faces 321a and 322a, when they are fixed
with the bolts 823, the bolts 823 of the proper size can be used by adjusting the height, width,
and so forth of the seats 821.
[0057]     2-4
           As shown in FIG. 9, with the hydraulic excavator 1 in this embodiment (an example of
a work vehicle), the collars 822 (an example of a restricting member) are a cylindrical member,
each having a small-diameter part 822b that hits a seat 821, and a large-diameter part 822a
provided on the opposite side of the seat 821 from the small-diameter part 822b. The gap
G1,G2 are formed between the first protector 6 and the large-diameter parts 822a in the axial
direction C of the collars 822, and between the first protector 6 and the small-diameter parts
822b in the radial direction D of the collars 822.
         Thus, since gaps are formed between the collars 822 and the first protector 6 in the radial
direction and the axial direction C, the stress produced in the restrictor 82 and the seats 821
when the arm main body 32 twists can be moderated.
[0058]     2-5
           As shown in FIG. 5, with the hydraulic excavator 1 in this embodiment (an example of
a work vehicle), the seats 821 are disposed on both the side face 321a on the space 1OS side of
the first end component 321, and on the side face 322a on the specific space 1OS side of the

                                                   24
second end component 322. The collars 822 (an example of a restricting member) are fixed to
the seats 821.
          Thus disposing both the seats 821 and the collars 822 more reliably prevents soil from
getting into the space 1OS when soil, rock, or the like hits the protective member.
[0059]    2-6
          As shown in FIG. 4, with the hydraulic excavator 1 in this embodiment (an example of
a work vehicle), the first protector 6 (an example of a protective member) has the rod members
61 (an example of a protrusion). The rod members 61 are fixed to the rear face 60b (an example
of a face) of the cover 60 (an example of a protective member main body) that is opposite the
arm main body 32, more on the restrictor 82 side than the fixing component 81 in the arm 30.
          Consequently, when soil, rock, or the like hits the first protector 6, the impact on the
first protector 6 is borne by not only the restrictor 82, but also by the rod members 61 colliding
with the arm main body 32. Accordingly, less of a load is exerted on the portion of the restrictor
82 that is connected to the arm main body 32 during collision with soil.
[0060]    2-7

            As shown in FIG. 9, with the hydraulic excavator 1 in this embodiment (an example of a
   work vehicle), the restrictor 82 has the seats 821 and the collars 822 (an example of a restricting
   member). The seat 821 is fixed to at least one of the side faces 321a on the space 1OS side of the
   first end component 321 and the side face 322a on the space 1OS of the second end component 322.
 5 The collars 822 are fixed to the seats 821 via the through-holes 64 formed in the first protector 6.
   The gap G3 is provided between the seats 821 and the cover 60 (an example of a protective
   member main body). The gap G4 is formed between the rod members 61 (an example of a
   protrusion) and the arm main body 32. The gap G4 between the rod members 61 and the arm main
   body 32 is smaller than the gap G3 between the seats 821 and the cover 60.
10          Consequently, the impact on the first protector 6 when soil, rock, or the like hits the first
   protector 6 is borne by having the rod members 61 collide with the arm main body 32 prior to the
   restrictor 82. Accordingly, less of a load is exerted on the portion of the restrictor 82 that is
   connected to the arm main body 32 during collision with soil.
   [0061]    2-8
15          With the hydraulic excavator 1 in this embodiment (an example of a work vehicle), the rod
   members 61 (an example of a protrusion) are provided in at least two places that are opposite each
   other on the first end component 321 and the second end component 322. The rod members 61 are
   formed in a rod shape along the first end component 321 and the second end component 322.
            When the rod members 61 are thus formed in a rod shape, the impact that occurs as a result
20 of the collision of soil or the like with the first protector 6 can be borne over a larger surface area.
   [0062]    2-9
   25

            The arm 30 pertaining to the this embodiment comprises the arm main body 32, the first
   protector 6 (an example of a protective member), the fixing component 81, and the restrictor 82.
   The arm main body 32 has the distal end part 320 and the proximal end part 323. The distal end
   part 320 has the first end component 321 and the second end component 322 disposed a specific
 5 space 1OS apart in the width direction W, and the bucket 33 is attached to the distal end part 320.
   The proximal end part 323 is configured to allow attachment on the vehicle main body 2 side. The
   first protector 6 covers the specific space 1OS. The fixing component 81 is disposed on the
   proximal end part 323 side of the specific space 1OS and fixes the first protector 6 to the arm main
   body 32. The restrictor 82 is disposed between the first end component 321 and the second end
10 component 322 in the width direction W, and restricts the movement of the first protector 6.
            Here, the restrictor 82 that restricts the movement of the first protector 6 is disposed
   between the first end component 321 and the second end component 322 in the width direction W.
   If the arm main body 32 should be twisted by operation of the hydraulic excavator 1, there will be
   less twisting on the inside than the outside in the width direction of the arm main body 32.
15          Accordingly, disposing the restrictor 82 between the first end component 321 and the
   second end component 322 in the width direction W reduces the stress that is produced in the
   structure in which the first protector 6 is attached to the arm main body 32, even if twisting occurs
   in the arm main body 32.
   2-10
20          The work implement 3 pertaining to this embodiment comprises the boom 31, the arm 30,
   and the bucket 33. The boom 31 can be pivotably attached to the vehicle main body 2. The arm 30
   26

   is attached to the boom 31. The bucket 33 is attached to the arm 30. The arm 30 has the arm main
   body 32, the first protector 6 (an example of a protective member), the fixing component 81, and
   the restrictor 82. The arm main body 32 has the distal end part 320 and the proximal end part 323.
   The distal end part 320 includes the first end component 321 and the second end component 322
 5 disposed the specific space 1OS apart in the width direction W, and the bucket 33 is attached to the
   distal end part 320. The proximal end part 323 is attached to the boom 31. The first protector 6
   covers the specific space 10S. The fixing component 81 is disposed on the proximal end part 323
   side of the specific space 1OS and fixes the first protector 6 to the arm main body 32. The restrictor
   82 is disposed between the first end component 321 and the second end component 322 in the
10 width direction W, and restricts the movement of the first protector 6.
   [0063]    Here, the restrictor 82 that restricts the movement of the first protector 6 is disposed
   between the first end component 321 and the second end component 322 in the width direction W.
   If the arm main body 32 should be twisted by operation of the hydraulic excavator 1, there will be
   less twisting on the inside than the outside in the width direction W of the arm main body 32.
15          Accordingly, disposing the restrictor 82 between the first end component 321 and the
   second end component 322 in the width direction W reduces the stress that is produced in the
   structure in which the first protector 6 is attached to the arm main body 32, even if twisting occurs
   in the arm main body 32.
   [0064]     3. Other Embodiments
   27

            An embodiment of the present invention was described above, but the present invention is
   not limited to or by the above embodiment, and various modifications are possible without
   departing from the gist of the invention.
            (A)
 5          The rod members 61 are provided to the first protector 6 in the above embodiment, but
   these need not be rod-shaped. For example, as with the first protector 106 shown in FIG. 10, a
   plurality of protrusions 161 may be disposing along the third side 603 and the fourth side 604. In
   FIG. 10, two of the protrusions 161 are provided on the third side 603 and two on the fourth side
   604, but the number is not limited to two.
10          Also, the rod members 61 need not be provided at all, but providing them is preferable from
   the standpoint of strength when rock or the like hits.
   [0065]     (B)
            The first protector 6 in the above embodiment is hexagonal, but this is not the only option.

   end component 322, but this is not the only option. For instance, the seats 821, the collars 822, and
   the bolts 823 may be provided on just the first end component 321 side or the second end
   component 322 side.
   [0067]    (E)
 5          Two of the collars 822 are fixed by the bolts 823 to a single seat 821 in the above
   embodiment, but there may be just one collar 822, or there may be three or more.
   INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
   [0068]    The work implement, arm, and work vehicle pertaining to the present invention have the
   effect of reducing the stress produced in a protective member attachment structure, and therefore
