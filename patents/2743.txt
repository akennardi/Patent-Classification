ABSTRACT
A platform or block for use with roller skates that can be easily installed and replaced on a
skate without requiring the assistance of skilled person. A mounting bar attached to the
platform accommodates different kingpin angles due to at least one open end. The
mounting bar may have two open ends but having an aperture allows it be easily located on
one kingpin before engaging the other. The shape of the platform provides for easy coping
in a skate park.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]       The present invention relates to grind blocks used with roller skates that are easy
to install.
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]       Roller skating is a popular past time by both children and adults. Besides simply
skating around it is also popular to do tricks with roller skates so much so that there are
numerous roller skate parks arounds the world.
[0003]       To facilitate sliding on roller skates it has been known to attach plastic 'wings' to
a roller skate. These are attached with the plate either side of the wheels, within the space
between the trucks and wheels.
[0004]       Alternatively a plastic block accessory of different shapes may either be
connected directly to the roller skate plate or by a metal bar within the trucks.
[0005]       The difficulty with these designs is that wings are flimsy and distort with the
lateral movement. Wings simply do not provide sufficient slide surface but instead catch on
the numerous edges.
[0006]       The alternative block shapes have flat planes that cause too much friction.
[0007]       It is an object of this invention is to alleviate the above problems, or at least
provide the public with a useful alternative. Thus there is provided a platform (plastic block
with radius shape) within the space between the trucks and wheels of a roller skate plate to
facilitate the activity of 'sliding' (moving laterally) and 'stalling' (pausing with balance) on
'coping' (the formed edge of a vertical surface or rail shape). Installation of the plastic block
utilises a metal bar that becomes part of the mechanics of the roller skate truck assembly.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0008]       In a first aspect the invention comprises a platform for roller skates the platform
attached to the king pins using a longitudinal mounting bar that includes at least one open
end.
[0009]        In preference the mounting bar comprises an aperture at one end and the open
end at the other the two ends connected by a flat web fixed to the platform.
[0010]       In preference the underside of the platform is gently curved.

[0011]       In preference all of the edges of the platform are of an arcuate shape.
[0012]       It should be noted that any one of the aspects mentioned above may include any
of the features of any of the other aspects mentioned above and may include any of the
features of any of the embodiments described below as appropriate.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0022]       The following detailed description of the invention refers to the accompanying
drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the
drawings and the following description to refer to the same and like parts. Dimensions of
certain parts shown in the drawings may have been modified and/or exaggerated for the
purposes of clarity or illustration.
[0023]       Illustrated in the Figures is a platform/block 10 adapted to be mounted to a roller
skate 12. The platform 10 is typically a high density polyethylene block shaped with radius.

                                                 _j
It includes holes 14 to reduce the weight of the block. Mounting bar 16 is attached to the
block using screws 18, although other fixing means may be used.
[0024]        Roller skates include two kingpins 20 that extend from base 22 that is attached
to the roller skate 12. Trucks 24 are attached to the kingpins 22 using well known
mechanical arrangements that are not discussed in any detail herein. The trucks include
threaded axles 26 that support wheels 28 there also being bearings 30 and nuts 32 that lock
the wheels to the axles. Pivot pins 34 connect the truck to the outside of the base. Cushions
(bushings) 36 provide shock absorption and can be soft or hard to suit different skating
styles.
[0025]       The present invention teaches a mounting bar that includes an aperture 38 at
one end and an open end or slit 40 at the other end. The aperture allows the mounting bar
to be captured against the kingpin. The slit allows the mounting bar to fit over different
degree kingpin angles (commonly 10, 15, 16, 20 and 32 degrees). The design of the mounting
bar allows for application to different kingpin angles. The open end allows the bar to be
installed at the greatest angle and rest at the smallest angle when fitted. Typically the
mounting bar ends are at an angle to the web connecting the two ends.
[0026]       There are multiple sizes of mounting bars and associated blocks to respond to
the many different sizes of roller skate plates.
[0027]       The block 10 is typically an HDPE (high density polyethylene) block shape with
radius. Holes 14 are included to reduce weight. The plastic material (HDPE) is chosen for the
best performance of slide and durability. Alternatives use UHMWPE (ultra-high molecular
weight polyethylene) which has a wax impregnation that causes a sticky action.
[0028]       The block is connected to the metal bar (mounting bar) which rests against the
skate plate under the bushings 36 that action the trucks 24.
[0029]       The block has two concave surfaces at either end to accommodate the kingpins
and bushings. The underside 42 is also concave with a large radius to reduce friction against
the contact surface,
[0030]       The mounting bar has fixing holes 44 spaced critically between holes 14 of the
block to hide the fixing point. Typically the mounting bar is made of metal.
[0031]       The block has no sharp corners as such and all the edges 46 are of an arcuate
shape.

[0032]       In the case of a tapered kingpin, as illustrated in Figure 5 washer 48 is used to
space the mounting bar off the radius 50. Retainer cap 52 provides support for custom
bushing.
[0033]       The reader will now appreciate the present invention which provides a platform
or block that can be easily installed and replaced on a skate without requiring the assistance
of skilled person. The mounting bar accommodates different king pin angles due to an open
end. The mounting bar may have two open ends but having an aperture allows it be easily
located on one king pin before engaging the other. The shape of the platform provides for
easy coping in a skate park.
