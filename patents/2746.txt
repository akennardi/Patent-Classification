                         Elastomeric gloves and methods for their production
    FIELD
    The present application relates to elastomeric gloves and methods for their production. The
  5 present application relates in particular to low thickness or low weight elastomeric gloves.
    Also described herein are formers suitable for use in the production of such gloves.
    BACKGROUND
    Thin film, disposable elastomeric gloves are used extensively in medical or dental
10  environments, and in other situations where barrier protection for the hands is required. For
    those who use such gloves repeatedly, it is desirable for the glove to be as thin as possible,
    while still having good barrier properties, elasticity, and stretchability, so as to maximise the
    touch sensation that is experienced through the gloves. Thin film elastomeric gloves also
    have the potential to replace the use of polyvinylchloride (PVC) gloves in the food
15  handling/food service industry. PVC gloves contain plasticisers which may be toxic to
    human health, so thin film gloves based on elastomers such as nitrile rubber and the like
    which are free of plasticisers, rather than PVC, are also of interest to such industries. In
    addition, in some less developed countries, there have been reports that the use of
    disposable gloves for hygiene purposes is banned due to the high cost and lack of budget
20  for such products. An alternative product that is of lower cost, due to lower material input,
    would be of potential interest in such countries. Furthermore, it would be of interest to be
    able to produce gloves using less material (i.e. less polymer material), less chemicals (i.e.
    other reagents), less energy and with the production of a reduced volume of waste following
    disposal of the used gloves. Such products would better conform to green technologies.
25
    While it is desirable to produce extremely thin, low weight gloves, in practice the technology
    has not been available to achieve this. In printed publications there may be reference to
    gloves having certain broad-ranging properties and thicknesses (or weight), but without the
    technology being available to enable such thin gloves to be produced with acceptable
30  properties, such disclosures may be read with scepticism. It is particularly difficult to achieve
    this with synthetic elastomers, which are used in place of natural rubber. The use of natural
    rubber is not desirable since it is associated with a potential allergen that causes Type I
    allergy.
35  It is an object of the present invention to provide new elastomeric articles that provide the
    desired features described above, or to at least provide an alternative glove to those
    currently available.

                                                   -2
   SUMMARY
   According to the present invention, there is provided a synthetic elastomeric glove with:
        (a) a thickness at the palm of less than 0.05mm;
        (b) a modulus at 500% above 6.5 MPa; and/or
 5      (c) an elongation at break below 700%.
   According to the present invention there is also provided a method of manufacturing the
   synthetic elastomeric glove described above comprising:
   - dipping a glove-shaped former into an elastomeric film-forming composition;
10 - curing the elastomeric film-forming composition on the former so as to produce the
   synthetic elastomeric glove.
   The applicant has, for the first time, achieved the production of ultra-thin, low weight gloves.
15 Gloves are formed from latex compositions (in this case, synthetic latex compositions),
   which comprise a synthetic polymer and a cross-linking agent. The applicant has produced
   the new ultra-thin gloves using a range of cross-linking agents in the latex composition. In
   some embodiments, the cross-linking agent comprises a multimetal oxide of a multivalent
   metal, a hydroxide of a multivalent metal or a salt of a multivalent metal. This cross-linking
20 agent is suitably pre-formulated into a cross-linking composition that comprises an aqueous
   solution of the multivalent metal source (i.e. the multimetal oxide of the multivalent metal, the
   hydroxide of the multivalent metal or the salt of the multivalent metal), such that the cross
   linking composition comprises an aqueous solution of negatively charged multivalent metal
   complex ions having a pH of at least 9.0. Expressed another way, in some embodiments,
25 the cross-linking agent may comprise a trivalent metal compound, which is used in
   solubilised form. The solubilised trivalent metal compound may be pre-formulated in to a
   cross-linking composition.
   In notable embodiments, the cross-linking agent further comprises either (a) sulphur and a
30 sulphur donor, (b) a multivalent metal oxide or ionic cross-linking agent, (c) sulphur, a
   sulphur donor and an ionic cross-linking agent, or (d) sulphur donor.
   Thus, in some embodiments, the present application provides a synthetic elastomeric glove
   with:
35      (a) a thickness at the palm of less than 0.05mm;
        (b) a modulus at 500% above 6.5 MPa; and/or
        (c) an elongation at break below 700%,

                                                    -3
    and comprising the cured product of a synthetic latex composition comprising a synthetic
    polymer and a cross-linking agent that includes a cross-linking composition, the cross-linking
    composition comprising an aqueous solution of a multimetal oxide of a multivalent metal, a
    hydroxide of a multivalent metal or a salt of a multivalent metal, such that the cross-linking
  5 composition comprises an aqueous solution of negatively charged multivalent metal complex
    ions having a pH of at least 9.0.
    Expressed in alternative terms, in some embodiments the present application provides a
    synthetic elastomeric glove with:
io        (a) a thickness at the palm of less than 0.05mm;
          (b) a modulus at 500% above 6.5 MPa; and/or
          (c) an elongation at break below 700%,
    comprising a synthetic polymer and a cross-linking agent, wherein the cross-linking agent
    comprises a solubilised trivalent metal compound having a pH of at least 9.
15
    The cross-linking agent in the above embodiment may further comprise sulphur, a sulphur
    donor (i.e. an accelerator) and a divalent metal oxide. The amount of each additional cross
    linking agent may be less than 1.0 phr, preferably not more than 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5 or 0.4
    phr.
20
    Where reference is made to a glove having features (a), (b) and/or (c), this means that
    feature (a) is present, and one or both of features (b) and (c) are present. In notable
    embodiments, the synthetic elastomeric glove comprises both of features (b) and (c), being
    the modulus and elongation at break properties.
25
    In some embodiments, the synthetic elastomeric gloves have a palm zone surface
    roughness (as indicated by the Sz value) of between -26 - 41 pm.
    Also described herein is a glove-shaped former comprising (i) a palm zone, (ii) a cuff zone,
30  (iii) between finger zones and (iv) finger zones, wherein:
          -   the surface roughness (Sz) of the palm zone of the former is between 28 and 42pm;
              and/or
          -   the cuff zone of the former includes a textured cuff band region.
35  In one embodiment, the glove-shaped former has a palm zone surface roughness (Sz)
    between 28 and 42pm. This former may be referred to as a controlled roughness former.
    The palm zone surface roughness may be measured as a single surface roughness
    measurement taken at one location in the palm zone, but in preferred embodiments, the

                                                   -4
    palm zone surface roughness is measured as an average of a plurality of roughness
    measurements taken at a plurality of locations in the palm zone. Preferably the surface
    roughness is the average of 4 roughness measurements taken at 4 different locations in the
    palm zone. The surface roughness in some embodiments is between 28 and 40pm, such as
  5 29-40pm, 30-38pm, 30-36pm, 29-36pm or 29-34pm.
     In some embodiments, the cuff zone also has a surface roughness (Sz) within the range of
    28 - 42 pm. The preferred ranges are between 29-40pm, 30-38pm, 30-36pm, 29-36pm or
    29-34pm. Like the palm zone surface roughness measurements, the cuff zone surface
10  roughness measurement may be taken at a single location in the palm zone, or the
    measurement may be based on an average of a plurality of measurements, suitably 4.
     In another embodiment, there is described a glove-shaped former comprising a cuff zone
    including a cuff band region. The cuff band region may have a surface roughness (Sz) that
15  is greater than that of the cuff zone outside the cuff band region, or the cuff band region may
    comprise a visually observable textured area (i.e. a roughened, scored or otherwise textured
    surface) that resists or prevents slippage of a gelled latex on the former. This former may be
    referred to as a cuff-banded former. The cuff-banded former provides resistance to slipping
    of a gelled latex composition on the former during a pre-leaching stage of glove production.
20  Such a feature is of particular pertinence to the production of ultra-thin film gloves, where it
    has been found that there is a greater tendency for slippage.
    The present application also describes a method of manufacturing synthetic elastomeric
    gloves comprising:
25  - dipping a former as described above into an elastomeric film-forming composition;
    - curing the elastomeric film-forming composition on the former so as to produce the
    synthetic elastomeric glove.
    The present application also describes gloves produced on the formers described above,
30  and by the methods described above.

    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    The synthetic elastomeric gloves and methods of manufacture are described in further detail
15  in this section. Also described are new former types that may be used in the production of
    synthetic elastomeric gloves.
    Glove properties
    The gloves of the present application may be classified or described as being disposable
20  gloves, examination gloves, surgical gloves, medical gloves, laboratory gloves, clean room
    gloves, gloves for food contact, food processing and/or biotechnical applications, household
    gloves, and so forth. The gloves are suitable for use in cleanroom applications. The gloves
    may be described as dipped thin film gloves.
25  The gloves may be single layered or multilayered. This refers to the number of elastomeric
    film layers. In the case of multilayered gloves, there may be two elastomeric film layers to
    maintain the thin film properties and low weight, although it is possible for there to be
    additional elastomeric film layers provided each layer is very thin. Coating layers may also
    be applied, such as slip coatings or powder coatings to aid donning.
30
    When calculating the overall thickness of elastomeric gloves, the standard practice in the
    industry (as established by the relevant standard D6319) is to measure the thickness of the
    glove at three points - the cuff, the palm and the finger. The finger thickness is measured 13
    mm +/- 3mm from the fingertip; the palm thickness is measured at the centre of the palm,
35  and the cuff thickness is measured at 25mm +/- 5mm from the cuff edge. The average of
    the three measurements is taken to establish a glove thickness. Thickness measurements
    are taken in accordance with the procedure specified in ASTM D3767-03 (Reapproved
    2014).

                                                    -6
    The thickness as measured at each of these three points can be close together (e.g. the
    thickness measured could be 0.05mm at each point), or there can be greater variation
    between the thickness measurements at each point (e.g. the palm and cuff could be about
  5 0.05mm and the finger could be 0.08mm). The finger thickness may be higher than the
    thickness measured at the cuff and palm, particularly if the glove mould is shaped to create
    a "textured" or "dimpled" grip surface in the finger region of the glove. For a glove with a
    thickness that is approximately 0.050mm at the finger based on a smooth surface, the
    addition of a textured or dimpled surface results in an increase in the measured thickness
10  based on the peak thickness of up to an additional 0.010mm or 0.020mm. At the cuff, the
    measured thickness can be either lower or higher than the measurements taken at the palm
    and the finger. The cuff may be of a lower thickness in some embodiments, particularly
    where the cuff is shaped such that the latex layer that is applied in the dipping process is
    thinner than at the palm region. In other embodiments, the cuff thickness can be
15  significantly higher - this can be achieved by using a series of coagulant dipping and water
    dipping steps, designed to leave a lower coagulant concentration on the mould at all areas
    other than the cuff region (which contains a higher coagulant concentration), so as to ensure
    a thicker latex layer is applied in the cuff. The palm region is the most important of the three
    measurement points to control within the low thickness range specified in the present
20  application. Accordingly, for particular embodiments of the present application, the focus is
    on the palm thickness, and in more specific embodiments, the thickness at the cuff and/or
    the fingertip is also taken into account.
    The thickness of the elastomeric glove at the palm (or the "palm thickness") is less than
25  0.05mm. In some embodiments, the palm thickness may be in the range of 0.005 mm to
    less than 0.050 mm. The palm thickness may, for example, be a minimum of 0.005mm,
    0.007mm, 0.010mm, 0.015mm, 0.020mm, 0.025mm, 0.030mm, 0.035mm, 0.040mm or
    0.045mm. The thickness may be a maximum of 0.048mm, 0.045mm, 0.040mm, 0.035mm,
    0.030mm, 0.028mm or 0.025mm. Any minimum and maximum can be combined to form a
30  range, provided the minimum value is below the maximum value. In some embodiments,
    the palm thickness is between 0.010mm and less than 0.050mm, or between 0.015mm and
    0.045mm, or between 0.020mm and 0.041 mm. In alternative embodiments, the palm
    thickness can be 0.050mm or higher (up to 0.080mm), particularly if the glove has a lower
    cuff and finger thickness, such that the average of the three is below 0.050mm.
35
    In some embodiments, the thickness of the elastomeric glove at the cuff (or the "cuff
    thickness") is less than 0.05mm. The cuff thickness may be in the range of 0.005 mm to
    less than 0.050 mm. The cuff thickness may, for example, be a minimum of 0.005mm,

                                                 -7
   0.007mm, 0.008mm, 0.010mm, 0.015mm, 0.020mm, 0.025mm, 0.030mm, 0.035mm,
   0.040mm or 0.045mm. The cuff thickness may be a maximum of 0.048mm, 0.045mm,
   0.040mm, 0.035mm, 0.030mm, 0.028mm or 0.025mm. Any minimum and maximum can be
   combined to form a range, provided the minimum value is below the maximum value. In
 5 some embodiments, the cuff thickness is between 0.008mm and less than 0.050mm, or
   between 0.008mm and 0.040mm, or between 0.010mm and 0.040 mm. In alternative
   embodiments, the cuff thickness could be up to 0.080mm thick. In such alternative
   embodiments, the palm and finger thickness is typically lower, such that the average
   thickness across the three points is below 0.050mm.
10
   In some embodiments, the thickness of the elastomeric glove at the finger (or the "finger
   thickness") is 0.080mm or less, such as 0.070mm or less. As noted above, the finger
   thickness measurement may be higher than for other parts of the glove, particularly if the
   glove has a "textured" or "dimpled" grip surface in the finger region of the glove. The
15 textured region may contain peaks and troughs, with the peaks being up to an additional
   0.010mm or 0.020mm thicker than the troughs. The finger thickness may be in the range of
   0.005 mm to 0.070 mm. The finger thickness may, for example, be a minimum of 0.005mm,
   0.008mm, 0.010mm, 0.015mm, 0.020mm, 0.025mm, 0.030mm, 0.035mm or 0.040mm. The
   finger thickness may be a maximum of 0.070mm, 0.060mm, 0.055mm, 0.050mm, less than
20 0.050mm, 0.048mm, 0.045mm, 0.040mm, 0.035mm, 0.030mm, 0.028mm or 0.025mm. Any
   minimum and maximum can be combined to form a range, provided the minimum value is
   below the maximum value. In some embodiments, the finger thickness is between 0.010mm
   and less than 0.060mm, or between 0.015mm and 0.060mm, or between 0.015mm and
   0.050 mm. Where the finger thickness is 0.050mm and above, preferably the average
25 thickness across the three points (finger, palm and cuff) is below 0.050mm.
   In some embodiments, the average of the palm and finger thicknesses is below 0.050mm.
   The average of the palm and finger thicknesses may be in the range of 0.005 mm to less
   than 0.050 mm. The average thickness may, for example, be a minimum of 0.005mm,
30 0.007mm, 0.010mm, 0.015mm, 0.020mm, 0.025mm, 0.030mm, 0.035mm, 0.040mm or
   0.045mm. The average thickness may be a maximum of 0.048mm, 0.045mm, 0.040mm,
   0.035mm, 0.030mm, 0.028mm or 0.025mm. Any minimum and maximum can be combined
   to form a range for the average of the palm and finger thicknesses, provided the minimum
   value is below the maximum value. In some embodiments, the average thickness is
35 between 0.010mm and less than 0.050mm, or between 0.015mm and 0.045mm, or between
   0.020mm and 0.040 mm.

                                                  -8
   In some embodiments, the average of the palm and cuff thicknesses is below 0.050mm. The
   average of the palm and cuff thicknesses may be in the range of 0.005 mm to less than
   0.050 mm. The average thickness may, for example, be a minimum of 0.005mm, 0.007mm,
   0.010mm, 0.015mm, 0.020mm, 0.025mm, 0.030mm, 0.035mm, 0.040mm or 0.045mm. The
 5 average thickness may be a maximum of 0.048mm, 0.045mm, 0.040mm, 0.035mm,
   0.030mm, 0.028mm or 0.025mm. Any minimum and maximum can be combined to form a
   range for the average of the palm and cuff thicknesses, provided the minimum value is
   below the maximum value. In some embodiments, the average thickness is between
   0.010mm and less than 0.050mm, or between 0.015mm and 0.045mm, or between
1o 0.020mm and 0.040 mm.
   According to another aspect of the present application, there is provided a synthetic
   elastomeric glove with:
       (a) a thickness based on the average of the palm, cuff and finger thicknesses of less
15         than 0.05mm;
       (b) a modulus at 500% above 6.5 MPa; and/or
       (c) an elongation at break below 700%.
   Preferably both the modulus and elongation at break are within the ranges indicated (i.e. the
20 glove has features (b) and (c)). In some embodiments, the average thickness (based on the
   average of the palm, cuff and finger thicknesses) is in the range of 0.005 mm to less than
   0.050 mm. The average thickness may, for example, be a minimum of 0.005mm, 0.007mm,
   0.010mm, 0.015mm, 0.020mm, 0.025mm, 0.030mm, 0.035mm, 0.040mm or 0.045mm. The
   average thickness may be a maximum of 0.048mm, 0.045mm, 0.040mm, 0.035mm,
25 0.030mm, 0.028mm or 0.025mm. Any minimum and maximum can be combined to form a
   range for the average thickness, provided the minimum value is below the maximum value.
   In some embodiments, the average thickness is between 0.010mm and less than 0.050mm,
   or between 0.010mm and 0.045mm, or between 0.015mm and 0.040 mm.
30 The thickness of the elastomeric film glove is measured, at any point of measurement
   specified in the present application, in accordance with the standard procedure known in the
   art. The measurement procedure is set out in ASTM D3767 - 03 (Re-revised 2014). In
   simple terms, the procedure involves measuring the thickness based on the median of three
   measurements made on each test specimen with a micrometer. The micrometer may be
35 analogue or digital. The present applicant used each of a Mitutoyo analog micrometer,
   model 7301, or a Mitutoyo digital micrometer, model PK-1 01. The exact location for taking
   the thickness measurements for the palm, cuff and finger is set out in ASTM D 6319-10

                                                 -9
   Elastomeric gloves come in a number of lengths, which is largely dependent on the cuff or
   sleeve length. The length of a glove is measured from the longest fingertip to the end of the
   cuff. One standard glove length is 9 inches (229mm), and another is 12 inches (305mm).
   The length of gloves of embodiments of the present application may therefore be between
 5 200mm - 330mm.
   Based on such length dimensions, the weight of the glove having the thickness as indicated
   above should be not more than 2.8 grams for a 12 inch (305mm) glove (e.g. for a glove
   between 270 and 330 mm in length), and 2.2 grams or less for a 9 inch (229mm) glove (e.g.
io for a glove between 200 and 270mm in length).
   In one particular embodiment of the present application, there is provided a synthetic
   elastomeric glove with:
        (a) a weight of not more than 2.4 grams for a glove length of 200 to 270mm, or a weight
15          of not more than 2.8 grams for a glove length of 270 to 330mm;
        (b) a modulus at 500% above 6.5 MPa; and/or
        (c) an elongation at break below 700%.
   Preferably both of features (b) and (c) are present. In some embodiments, the gloves have
20 a weight of not more than 2.4 grams. The weight may be a minimum of 0.3 grams. In some
   embodiments, the glove weight may be a maximum of 2.3 grams, 2.2 grams or 2.1 grams.
   In some embodiments the glove weight is a minimum of 0.3g, 0.4g 0.5g, 0.7g, or 1.0g. The
   glove weight in some embodiments is about 0.5 grams, 1.0 grams, 1.5 grams or 2.0 grams.
   The value may be +/- 0.2g, thus covering 0.5 grams +/-0.2 grams, 1.0 grams +/- 0.2 grams,
25 or 2.0 grams +/- 0.2 grams. In alternative embodiments, suited to the longer length gloves,
   the weight is 2.8 grams or less, such as a maximum of 2.7 grams, 2.6 grams, 2.5 grams or
   2.4 grams. The minimum weight may be any of those indicated above in this paragraph.
   The weight information is based on a medium glove size. Medium sized gloves have a palm
30 width of 90 to 99mm, preferably 94-98mm. Disposable gloves are conventionally sold in a
   selection of sizes - extra-extra-small (XXS), extra-small (XS), small (S), medium (M), large
   (L), extra-large (XL) and extra-extra-large (XXL). The palm widths vary for each size. It will
   be appreciated that there are conventional dimensions for gloves within each size range,
   and the setting of a weight range that is applicable to the medium size allows for valid
35 comparisons to be made. Nevertheless, in some embodiments, the glove weight
   requirements apply irrespective of the size of the glove.

                                                  -10
    The elastomeric glove of an embodiment of the present application has a modulus at 500%
    above 6.5 MPa. The modulus at 500% may be greater than 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10, 12, 15, 20 or
    25. The modulus may in some embodiments be a maximum of 20. When combined with a
    minimum value, the minimum is below 20. The modulus values may be based on the
  5 unaged variant, but is preferably based on the aged variant, or both the unaged and aged
    variants. Having this modulus value for an ultra-thin glove (i.e. less than 0.05mm in
    thickness at palm) has been achieved for the first time.
    The elastomeric glove of the present application has an elongation at break below 700%.
io  The gloves of the present application have this elongation value combined with the
    previously described ultra-low weight (and thickness), and with the above modulus value at
    500%. The elongation at break may be at less than 680%, 660%, 650%, 640%, 630%,
    620%, 610% or less than 600%. The elongation at break is typically greater than 200%,
    such as greater than 250%, or greater than 300%.
15
    The elastomeric glove of the present application preferably also meets or exceeds ASTM
    D6319-00a for water leakage. Despite having a thickness below that set by ASTM D6319
    00a, the present gloves meet this water leakage test.
20  The calculations of weight, thickness, modulus and elongation may be based on a sample of
    at least 10 gloves.
    The synthetic elastomeric gloves suitably have a palm zone surface roughness (Sz) of
    between 26 - 41 pm. This surface roughness is indicative of the glove having been produced
25  on a former with a controlled palm surface roughness that is slightly higher than the glove
    surface roughness - for instance, a former with a palm zone surface roughness between 28
    and 42pm.
    The palm zone surface roughness Sz of the glove may be a minimum of 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,
30  31 or 32pm. The palm zone surface roughness Sz of the glove in some embodiments is not
    more than 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33 or 32pm. Each minimum and maximum can be
    combined to form a suitable range for the palm zone surface roughness of the glove, such
    as 27-38pm, 28-36pm, 28-34pm, 27-34pm or 27-32pm.
35  The palm zone surface roughness comes about as a consequence of the production of the
    glove on a former with a corresponding surface roughness in the same zone. As explained
    in further detail below, such controlled roughness formers having a controlled palm zone
    surface roughness contribute to the production of high quality ultra-low thickness gloves.

                                                   - 11
    The surface roughness (Sz) of the glove in the palm zone of the glove is typically around 1
    10 pm, 1-7pm, 2-6pm or 1-3pm less than the surface roughness of the former in the same
    zone.
  5 Throughout this specification, the surface roughness has been measured using a Keyence
    VHX-6000 High Resolution Digital Microscope. This is operated to determine the Sz value in
    accordance with ISO 25178 (non-contact probe). A suitable lens for determining the surface
    roughness in the required scale is the Z100 lens, at between 400x and 500x magnification.
10  As outlined in further detail below, the applicant has been able to produce on a commercial
    scale for the first time low thickness gloves with very low defect rates. In fact, in a test
    production run of 21 days duration, with 4 formers producing 96 pieces per day (24 cycles of
    approximately 55 minutes duration per day), there was a zero level pin-hole defect rate. All
    2016 gloves were tested and found to be free of pin-hole defects. This result is remarkable
15  for such a low thickness product.
    Elastomers
    The elastomeric film-forming composition comprises an elastomeric film-forming polymer (or
    polymer for short), in suspension or emulsion form. The polymer is a synthetic polymer, in
20  that natural rubber (natural isoprene) is not within the range of polymers to which this
    application applies. The polymer used in the preparation of the elastomeric gloves may be
    selected from synthetic elastomeric film-forming polymers which can be cross-linked to
    produce elastomeric gloves. The polymer may be a single polymer or a combination (blend)
    of two or more polymers. The or each polymer may be a homopolymer or a copolymer, a
25  grafted or modified polymer, or a blend thereof. Blends may contain between 1-99% of each
    component of the blend, with the total amount of polymers adding up to 100% (based on
    polymer content). The number of polymers in a blend is typically two or three.
    The polymer may contain free sonically cross-linkable groups, covalently cross-linkable
30  groups, or a combination of both. Examples of sonically cross-linkable groups are acids,
    including carboxylates (and esters), sulfonates and acid anhydrides, and an example of a
    covalently cross-linkable group is a double bond. In some embodiments, the polymer of the
    elastomeric film-forming composition, or at least one of the polymers in the case of a blend,
    comprises both sonically cross-linkable groups and covalently cross-linkable groups.
35
    The polymers may be selected from nitrile rubber, polyurethane, polyisoprene,
    polychloroprene, acrylic polymers (including acrylic diene block copolymers),
    polybutadienes, copolymers of these and other polymers/monomers (random copolymers,

                                                   -12
    block copolymers or otherwise) and modified forms of these polymers or copolymers (e.g.
    polymers containing additional substituents such as carboxylate, sulfonate, halide or other
    substituents).
  5 One class of polymer that may be used is that obtained by copolymerisation of conjugated
    diene monomers and ethylenically unsaturated acid monomers (carboxylated
    polyacrylonitrile butadiene being an example of such a copolymer), polyisoprene,
    polychloroprene, styrene copolymers and/or polyurethane. Amongst the range of conjugated
    diene monomers, examples are 1, 3-butadiene, isoprene, 2, 3-dimethyl-1, 3-butadiene, 2
io  ethyl-1, 3-butadiene, 1, 3-pentadiene, chloroprene and acrylonitrile. Regarding ethylenically
    unsaturated acid monomers, the acid group may be a carboxyl group, a sulfonic acid group
    or an acid anhydride group. Examples of ethylenically unsaturated acid monomers include
    acrylic acid or methacrylic acid; itaconic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, maleic anhydride,
    citraconic anhydride, styrenesulfonic acid, monobutyl fumarate, monobutyl maleate, mono-2
15  hydroxypropyl maleate, and alkali metal or ammonium salts thereof. The polymers used may
    be carboxylated or non-carboxylated, as desired.
    In some embodiments, the polymer used in the present application is a carboxylated
    polymer. The synthetic carboxylated polymer may be selected from the group consisting of
20  carboxylated nitrile butadiene rubber, carboxylated styrene butadiene rubber, carboxylated
    butyl rubber, carboxylated acrylic butadiene rubber, carboxylated polyisoprene, carboxylated
    polychloroprene, and mixtures or copolymers thereof.
    In some embodiments, the synthetic carboxylated polymer is carboxylated acrylonitrile
25  butadiene polymer, or a co-polymer of this polymer, or a mixture of this polymer with a
    second polymer.
    One notable example of a suitable polymer is polyacryonitrile butadiene. This may be
    carboxylated or non-carboxylated. In one embodiment the polymer is a carboxylated
30  acrylonitrile butadiene rubber. In one particular form, the carboxylated acrylonitrile
    butadiene rubber has a medium acrylonitrile content. Examples of suitable polymers include
    those supplied by Synthomer, Nippon-Zeon, Nantex, Shin-Foong, Khumho, BST and others,
    noting that the grades to be selected from are those indicated as being suitable for dipped
    articles, such as gloves and similar products.
35
    Carboxylated refers to the presence of carboxylate (carboxylic acid or ester) groups on the
    polymer chain. Carboxylation may be achieved by forming the polymer with a monomer
    containing carboxylate groups, or through grafting carboxylate groups to a polymer.

                                                   -13
    The degree of carboxylation of the polymer may influence the decision as to what cross
    linking agents are required. The carboxylation degree may be at the higher end (between 5
    - 15%; more typically 5 - 10%), or at the lower end (between 0.01 - 5%).
  5
    When producing the gloves using a dipping process, the polymer is provided initially in the
    form of an aqueous suspension. The aqueous suspension suitably has a pH of at least 9.0.
    The elastomeric film-forming composition can also be referred to as the "synthetic latex
    composition" or "latex composition". It is common in the art to use the expression "latex" or
10   'rubber" to refer to any polymer in a general sense, and "latex composition" is used in a
    corresponding manner. Latex is not to be read as referring to natural rubber latex.
    In the art of the present invention, it is common to refer to the amount of the elastomer
    forming polymer as being 100 phr (per hundred parts "rubber"), and for the relative amounts
15  of the remaining components of a composition for producing an elastomeric film to be
    calculated as a number of parts compared to the 100phr of the elastomer-forming polymer,
    by weight. Thus, for an amount of cross-linking agent that is 1/1 00th that of the elastomer
    forming polymer in the composition by weight, the amount of cross-linking agent is referred
    to as 1.0 phr.
20
    Cross-linking Agents
    Cross-linking agent classes include ionic cross-linking agents and covalent cross-linking
    agents. The cross-linking agent or agents used in the production of the elastomeric gloves
    may be selected from ionic cross-linking agents, covalent cross-linking agents, and
25  combinations thereof.
    Ionic cross-linking agents include metal oxide cross linking agents (such as zinc oxide and
    magnesium oxide), peroxides (such as 1,1-di(t-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane,
    which can be purchased under the trade name Trigonox 29-40B-pd) and solubilized ionic
30  cross-linking agents such as the trivalent metal compounds, including multimetal oxides of
    multivalent metals (e.g. solubilized sodium aluminate), multivalent metal hydroxides, and
    multivalent metal salts. Other ionic cross-linking agents amongst those known in the art and
    be used.
35  Covalent cross-linking agents include organic cross-linking agents, sulphur and/or sulphur
    donors, and combinations thereof.

                                                    - 14
    Sulphur may be added in the form of elemental sulphur. Sulphur may be added in the form
    of a sulphur donor. Examples of suitable sulphur donors include the carbamates such as
    thiocarbamates (e.g. zinc dibutyl dithiocarbamate (ZDBC), Zinc diethyl dithiocarbamate
    (ZDEC); Zinc dimethyl dithiocarbamate (ZDMC); thiurams (eg. tetraethylthiuram disulfide
  5 (TETD), Tetramethylthiuram disulphide (TMTD)); Dipentamethylene thiuram tetrasulfide
    (DPTT); Dipentamethylene thiuram hexasulfide (DPTH); Dipentamethylene thiuram
    hexasulfide; thiourea (Ethyl thiourea (ETU) and diphenylthiourea (DPTU); thiazoles (e.g.
    Mercapto Benzothiazoles (MBT), Mercapto Benzothiazole disulphide (MBTS), zinc 2
    mercaptobenzothiazole (ZMBT)); guanidines (eg. Diphenylguanidine (DPG)) and
10  aldehyde/amine-based Sulphur donors (eg. hexamethylenetetramine). Other examples are
    well known in the art and can be obtained from various publicly available sources.
    Other cross-linking agents that may be used can be selected from crosslinking monomers,
    reactive oligomers, polyisocyanate oligomers, functional crosslinkable polymers, derivatives
15  of ethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate (such as ethylene glycol diacrylate, di(ethylene glycol)
    diacrylate, tetra(methylene/ethylene glycol) diacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate
    (EDMA), di(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (DEDMA), tri(methylene/ethylene glycol)
    dimethacrylate, tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEDMA)) , derivatives of
    methylenebisacrylamide (such as NN.- methylenebisacrylamide, NN.
20  methylenebisacrylamide, NN.- (1,2 dihydroxyethylene)bisacrylamide), formaldehyde-free
    crosslinking agents (such as N- (1-Hydroxy-2,2-dimethoxyethyl)acrylamide), divinylbenzene,
    divinylether, diallyl phthalate, divinylsulfone, Trimethylolpropane Trimethacrylate (TMPTMA),
    polyfunctional cross-linkers and the like. Combinations of these cross-linking agents can
    also be used.
25
    The total amount of cross-linking agents in the composition may be between 0.01 and 14
    phr. However, it is usually desirable to minimise cross-linker amounts (and the associated
    costs or disadvantages). The total cross-linking agent amount may be within one of the
    following ranges: 0.01 - 14.5phr, 0.2 - 12.5phr, 0.3 - 10 phr, 0.1 - 10 phr, 0.2 - 10 phr, 0.3
30  - 9 phr, 0.5 - 9 phr, 0.8 - 9 phr, 0.3 - 8 phr, 0.5 - 8 phr, 0.8 - 6 phr, 1 - 5 phr, 2 - 9 phr, 3
    10 phr, 3 - 7 phr, 1 - 3 phr, 0.01 - 0.5 phr, 0.01 - 1.0 phr. In one embodiment, the synthetic
    elastomeric glove is made from a synthetic latex composition containing a small amount of
    cross-linking agent or a combination of cross-linking agents, where the total amount of
    cross-linking agent(s) present in the composition is less than 5.0 phr, less than 4.0 phr, less
35  than 3.0 phr, less than 2.5 phr, less than 2.0 phr, less than 1.8 phr or less than 1.5 phr.
    The amount of ionic cross-linking agent may be between 0.0 - 5.0 phr, such as 0.01 - 5.0, or
    0.01 - 4.0 phr. The amount is preferably lower still, at 0.01 - 3.0 phr, or 0.01 - 2.0 phr, 0.01

                                                  -15
   - 1.0 phr, 0.01 - 0.7 phr, 0.01 - 0.6 phr or 0.01 - 0.5 phr. Within the amount of ionic cross
   linking agent, there may be a solubilised trivalent metal cross-linking agent in an amount of
   0.01 - 0.6, 0.01 - 0.5 or 0.01 - 0.45 phr, and a divalent metal oxide within an amount of 0.01
   - 0.8, preferably 0.01 - 0.6, 0.01 - 0.5 phr.
 5
   The amount of sulphur may be between 0.0 - 5.5 phr. The amount may be lower still, at 0.0
   - 3.5phr, such as 0.01 - 3.Ophr, 0.01 - 2.Ophr, 0.01 - 1.5phr, 0.01 - 1.0phr, 0.01 - 0.7phr,
   0.01 - 0.5phr or 0.01 - 0.3phr.
10 The amount of sulphur donor (accelerator) may be between 0.0 - 2.0 phr, such as between
   0.01 - 1.5phr, 0.01 - 1.0phr, 0.2-1.0phr, 0.01 - 0.7phr, 0.01 - 0.5phr, 0.01 - 0.3phr or 0.05
   - 0.2 phr,
   The amount of organic cross-linking agent may be between 0.0 - 4.0 phr, such as 0.01 - 4.0.
15 The amount may be lower still, at 0.01 - 3.0 phr, or 0.01 - 2.0 phr, or 0.01 - 1.0 phr. In
   some embodiments, the cross-linking agent is free of organic cross-linking agents other than
   sulphur and sulphur donors.
   The cross-linking agent can be combined with the latex composition and other components
20 of the elastomeric film-forming composition at suitable time points for the formation of the
   desired type of film. Cross-linking agents are typically added to the latex composition with
   other components, however for some forms of cross-linking agent (such as the solubilised
   ionic cross-linking agents, including sodium aluminate) there is a preliminary step involving
   the formation of a cross-linking composition and combining this with the latex under
25 controlled conditions, followed by the addition of other components and secondary cross
   linking agents.
   Cross-linking Composition
    In some embodiments, the cross-linking agent comprises a cross-linking composition, which
30 comprises an aqueous solution of a negatively-charged multivalent metal complex ion
   having a pH of at least 9.0. Expressed another way, the cross-linking composition is based
   on an aqueous solution of a metal co-ordination complex, in which the metal is a multivalent
   metal, there are ligands co-ordinating to the central metal ion, and the overall complex is
   negatively charged. An example of such a negatively charged multivalent metal complex ion
35 is [AI(OH) 4 ]-, which is based on an aluminium metal ion, four hydroxide ligands co-ordinated
   to the metal, and an overall negative charge. There may be a cation counterion such as Na*
   in the solution. Such solutions can be formed through the dissolution of a multimetal oxide
   of a multivalent metal, a multivalent metal hydroxide, or a multivalent metal salt in water. In

                                                    -16
   the case of [AI(OH) 4]-, this may be produced on solubilisation of sodium aluminate under
   appropriate conditions. Those conditions may include stabilisation with a hydroxide (i.e. an
   alkali in hydroxide form). This so-called "cross-linking composition" may be formed from the
   multimetal oxide of a multivalent metal, a multivalent metal hydroxide, or a multivalent metal
 5 salt prior to combining with other components of the elastomeric film-forming composition. A
   hydroxide (an alkali in hydroxide form) may be required to maintain the negatively-charged
   multivalent metal complex ion in solution form without significant precipitation. Additional
   cross-linking agents may be used with this cross-linking agent/cross-linking composition.
   The ligands in the complex may be of any suitable type. Notable examples are hydroxide
10 and water. It is possible that other ligands could be present in suitable metal complexes,
   such as one or more of hydroxide, water, iodide, bromide, sulphide, thiocyanate, chloride,
   nitrate, fluoride, oxalate, oxo, nitrile isothyacyanate, acetonitrile, ammonia and nitrate.
   In simple terms, in one embodiment, the cross-linking composition may comprise a
15 solubilised trivalent metal compound, such as a solubilised aluminium compound. Examples
   include sodium aluminate, aluminium oxide and aluminium hydroxide. The composition may
   comprise additional hydroxide compound, for pH adjustment to achieve solubilisation, such
   as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and/or ammonium hydroxide. The amount of
   such additional hydroxide may be at least 0.05 phr, 0.1 phr, or 0.2 phr, or 0.3 phr, by way of
20 example. The cross-linking composition may further comprise a mechanical stabiliser and/or
   surfactant, as is further described herein.
   Sodium aluminate is a notable example of a multimetal oxide of a multivalent metal, where
   the multivalent metal is aluminium. Through the techniques described herein, this can be
25 solubilised so as to produce a solution of negatively-charged multivalent metal complex ions.
   Whilst embodiments of the invention are based on sodium aluminate, it is noted that other
   agents within the same class can be used. In this portion of the detailed description,
   reference is made to the example of negatively-charged aluminium complex ions, and
   sodium aluminate as a source for those ions. However, this should be read in this context
30 and should not be understood as confining the scope of the invention.
   The present inventors have managed to produce ultra-thin elastomeric film gloves with good
   performance properties using the solubilised form of multivalent metal cross-linking agent.
   When using solubilised multivalent metal cross-linking agent (such as solubilised sodium
35 aluminate), it is important to solubilise the multivalent metal with an alkali (i.e. an alkali
   hydroxide) in a preliminary step, rather than adding the multivalent metal (e.g. sodium
   aluminate) in solid form to the aqueous suspension of synthetic polymer, followed by
   separate addition of alkali hydroxide to attempt to solubilise the multivalent metal in a later

                                                   -17
   step. The amount of alkali hydroxide used to solubilise the multivalent metal is preferably
   about 0.05 - 0.5phr. Once solubilised (forming a so-called cross-linking composition), the
   composition is added in a controlled manner to the aqueous suspension of synthetic
   polymer. The aqueous suspension may also be subjected to pH control. The streams are
 5 carefully combined while avoiding disruption of the emulsion, latex lump formation through
   micro-coagulation, precipitation or other settling of the components from the composition.
   Multivalent metal
   The term "multivalent metal" refers to a metal having a valency of two or more. The
10 expression "divalent or higher valency" may be used interchangeably with "multivalent". In
   some embodiments, the multivalent metal is a trivalent metal.
   Aluminium is the preferred multivalent metal. In other embodiments the multivalent metal is
   an amphoteric metal. Amphoteric metals are those metals that form amphoteric substances
15 from their oxides and/or hydroxides. This class includes aluminium, beryllium, chromium,
   zinc, copper, iron, cobalt, lead, tin, bismuth, gallium, indium, scandium, titanium, zirconium,
   vanadium, silver, gold, germanium, antimony and tellurium. The multivalent metal is
   preferably selected from the group consisting of aluminium, beryllium, chromium, iron,
   cobalt, copper, zinc, lead, tin and bismuth. The multivalent metal may be selected from
20 aluminium and beryllium. Trivalent (or higher valency) metals are preferred, and aluminium
   is most preferred in selected embodiments.
   To produce a cross-linking composition, initially a solution is formed by dissolving a source
   of the multivalent metal in water. This may be achieved with heating and the optional
25 addition of an alkali and/or a mechanical stabiliser and/or a surfactant. A mechanical
   stabiliser and/or surfactant may be included in the cross-linking composition.
   A suitable source of the multivalent metal should be chosen that is capable of yielding a
   solution of negatively charged multivalent metal complex ions. This may require pH
30 adjustment of the solution to achieve solubilisation. Suitable sources included (A) a
   multimetal oxide of the multivalent metal, (B) a hydroxide of the multivalent metal or (C) a
   salt of the multivalent metal.
   Regarding the first class, being the multimetal oxides of the multivalent metal, this term
35 refers to an oxide of the multivalent metal with another one or more different metal species.
   These may be referred to as "multimetal oxides" in short. Such materials may also be
   viewed as mixed metal oxides. Where there are two metals, the oxide may be described as
   a double metal oxide. The second metal species may be, for example, an alkali metal, such

                                                    -18
    as sodium or potassium. In the case of aluminium as the multivalent metal, the second
    metal species is preferably sodium or potassium, also referred to as sodium aluminate and
    potassium aluminate. In one example, the multimetal oxide of the multivalent metal may be
    an alkali metal-multivalent metal oxide.

    The second class, being hydroxides of the multivalent metal, may simply be referred to as
    metal hydroxides. In practice, to achieve the production of the negatively charged
    multivalent metal complex ion, a second hydroxide (such as an alkali metal hydroxide or
    other alkali in hydroxide form) is required, with a consequent increase in the pH required for
1o  solubilisation of the multivalent metal hydroxide. The hydroxides of the multivalent metals
    may in some cases be viewed as the hydrated multivalent metal oxides, and the source of
    the multivalent metal hydroxide may in practice be a multivalent metal oxide (particularly a
    mixed metal oxide). In solution, there may be a mixture of different hydroxides of the
    multivalent metal, in different complex ion forms.
15
    The third class, being the salts of the multivalent metals, typically require considerable
    alkali/hydroxide addition (such as alkali metal hydroxide or other alkali in hydroxide form) to
    achieve solubilisation of the multivalent metal and production of the negatively charged
    multivalent metal complex ions. Solutions of multivalent metal salts are not typically alkaline,
20  and it may be necessary to add considerable alkali (alkali in hydroxide form) to raise the pH
    to at least 9.0. It is important in such cases for the negatively charged multivalent metal
    complex ions to be produced on raising the pH, without significant precipitation of an
    insoluble salt. Examples of salts include alum (potassium alum, or potassium aluminium
    sulphate), poly aluminium chloride (also referred to as AICl 3), and poly ferric sulphate. The
25  pH of 10% solutions of these salts are 2.83, 3.27 and 1.7, respectively, so considerable
    alkali (in the form of alkali hydroxide) is required to raise the pH to at least 9.0 and to form
    the negatively charged multivalent metal complex ions.
    The first two classes are preferred, thus it is preferred that the cross-linking composition
30  comprises a solution of a multimetal oxide of the multivalent metal or a solution of a
    multivalent metal hydroxide.
    As indicated above, in some embodiments, the cross-linking composition comprises a
    solution of sodium aluminate, producing negatively-charged aluminium complex ions. The
35  primary ions formed are the tetrahydroxoaluminate (Ill) ions - being a complex of a central
    aluminium atom with co-ordinating hydroxo ligands. Aqua (water) ligands may also form
    part of the complex ions. Other ions in the solution will include the aluminium and alkali
    metal (e.g. Na). The range of negatively charged aluminium complex ions produced on

                                                    -19
   solubilising sodium aluminate is reported in the literature. At varying pH levels, the
   equilibrium between the various ions will differ. The key to maintaining soluble aluminium
   complex ions is to maintain the pH above 9.0, as below 9.0 insoluble AI(OH) 3 is formed,
   which precipitates out of solution. With other multivalent metals, the pH must be such that
 5 the soluble negatively-charged complex ions of the multivalent metal are formed, and an
   insoluble precipitate is minimised or avoided. In this regard, preferably not more than 20%,
   more preferably not more than 15%, 10%, 5% or less than 2% of the multivalent metal is in
   the form of an insoluble precipitate (precipitated out of solution). These percentages apply
   regardless of the source used, and regardless of the identity of the multivalent metal that is
io solubilised to form the negatively-charged multivalent metal complex ion.
   Advantages associated with the use of sodium aluminate, or other solubilised cross-linking
   agent sources as described herein, are as follows:
       -   There is no cost associated with milling (in contrast to solid zinc oxide and other prior
15          art solid cross-linking agents). Thus, incorporating at least some sodium aluminate
            in solubilised form in the composition is associated with cost savings compared to
            compositions containing only solid cross-linking agents.
       -   Aluminium has a low atomic weight of 27 and a specific gravity of 2.7. Per molecule
            that requires cross-linking, less weight of aluminium-based reagent is required
20          compared to many other cross-linking agents.
       -   Aluminium has a valency of 3, allowing for 3-links per molecule. In contrast, zinc,
           with a valency of 2, allows for 2-links per molecule. This allows for a theoretical 50%
            in the cross-linking ability of aluminium compared to zinc, even leaving aside the
            solubilising effect (compared to solid zinc oxide).
25     -   Aluminium in this form is not subject to purity concerns, allowing it to be used in a
            range of applications. Aluminium is abundant, and safe for food applications (as
            reflected by the use of aluminium foil food packaging.)
       -    In view of the effectiveness of the cross-linking with the solubilised multivalent metal,
            it is possible to produce products with lower amounts of sulphur and sulphur donor
30          materials. This also applies to embodiments using multivalent metals other than just
            aluminium. It is possible to produce excellent low-weight gloves suitable for
            commercial production containing low levels of the solubilised multivalent metal
            oxide, hydroxide or salt, with low levels of the sulphur and sulphur donor (alone or
           with an ionic cross-linking agent), or sulphur donor alone.
35     -   Homogeneity is improved, as a consequence of lightness and the ionic nature of the
            negatively-charged complex. Intra-particle cross-links can be formed at a similar
            distribution to the inter-particle cross-links. Homogeneity can be further maximised
            through the use of stabilising agents, as described below.

                                                    - 20
        -   Loss due to milling wastage is avoided. Loss due to settling during storage or in the
            dipping tank is avoided.
        -   The multivalent metal, in aqueous ionic form, can instantly react with carboxylic
            groups on the polymer, where a carboxylated polymer is used as the elastomeric
 5          film-forming polymer. This can be achieved at room temperature, thus leading to
            potential cost savings associated with avoided heating. Whilst the cross-linking can
            be conducted at lower temperature (e.g. <400C or <300C), higher temperatures may
            still be used to achieve cross-linking of second cross-linking agent(s), if present.
        -   Embodiments using low levels of aluminium-based solubilised cross-linking agents
10          provide particularly good results with low input of total cross-linking agents (in phr).
        -   Articles, such as gloves, made using the cross-linking composition and through the
            associated method have been found to possess highly favourable characteristics
            such as favourable feel and comfort, and improved softness. The gloves are made
            from a very thin layer (or layers) of elastomeric film without increasing the presence
15          of defects such as pin holes, weak spots or other defects.
        -   Gloves made from the product are easy to don.
   It should be noted that zinc oxide is not an example of a suitable agent for producing a
   solubilised negatively-charged multivalent metal complex ions, even when the pH of the
20 aqueous composition to which it is added has a pH of around 9.0-10.0. Zinc oxide is a metal
   oxide, rather than a mixed metal oxide, and even considerable alkali hydroxide addition to
   an aqueous composition containing zinc oxide is ineffective to produce solubilised
   negatively-charged multivalent metal complex ions. Whilst zinc oxide is not an example of
   an agent for forming the solubilised cross-linking composition, it may be used as an
25 additional (secondary) cross-linking agent.
   Alkali in cross-linking composition and pH
   In embodiments of the invention, the cross-linking composition further comprises alkali. The
   term "alkali" is used to refer to an agent or combination of agents that increase the pH of a
30 solution. pH control may be the predominant function of the alkali. Typically, strong alkalis
   (e.g. hydroxides) are used for this purpose. The amount of alkali that forms part of the
   cross-linking composition is preferably between 0.01 and 5 phr. The maximum is preferably
   not more than 4, 3, 2 or 1 phr in the cross-linking composition (noting that there may be
   additional alkali in the latex composition). The amount may be a maximum of 0.9, 0.8, 0.7,
35 0.6, 0.5, 0.4 or 0.3 phr. The amount may be a minimum of 0.01, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09
   or 0.1 phr. Any maximum and minimum may be combined to form a range. In some
   examples, the amount of alkali is between 0.01 and 0.5 phr, or between 0.01 and 0.4 phr, or
   between 0.05 and 0.5 phr. The alkali may be in the form of a hydroxide. This may be added

                                                   -21
    in the form of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide or a
    combination of two or more thereof. Sodium and/or potassium hydroxide are most typically
    used. The alkali serves to increase the pH to the level required for solubilisation and/or to
    chemically stabilise the solution of negatively charged multivalent metal complex ions. In
  5 some embodiments, potassium hydroxide is used.
     In some embodiments, a combination of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide is used.
    The sodium hydroxide interacts with the aluminium (where this is the multivalent metal) in
    the formation of complex ions. Potassium hydroxide is more commonly used in latex
10  compositions, and the presence of potassium hydroxide as one of the alkalis assists in
    avoiding potential localised coagulation when the cross-linking agent is added to the
    aqueous suspension of synthetic carboxylated polymer. The relative amount of sodium
    hydroxide to potassium hydroxide may be about 3:1 to 1:3. The amount may be about 2:1
    (sodium to potassium) or about 1:1.
15
    Where a solubilised multivalent metal-based cross-linking agent is used as the or one of the
    cross-linking agents, the pH must be such that solubilisation of the multivalent metal is
    achieved, through production of negatively charged multivalent metal complex ions. In
    embodiments, the pH is "matched" to the pH of the aqueous suspension of synthetic film
20  forming polymer. In general terms, the pH should be high enough to achieve solubilisation
    of the multivalent metal. This may be between 9.0 and 13.5, such as between 9.0 and 13.0,
    9.0 and 12.5, 9.0 and 12, between 9.0 and 11.5, such as between 9.0 and 11.0, 9.2 and
     11.0, 9.5 and 11.0, 9.5 and 10.5, 9.8 and 10.8, 10.0 and 11.0, or 10.0 and 10.8. When a salt
    form of the multivalent metal is used, it is preferred to use a higher pH to subdue the acidic
25  properties, so a pH of around 10.0 - 13.0 may be desired, such as between about 11.5 and
     12.5, or about 12.
     In addition to influencing the pH of the cross-linking composition, the alkali has an influence
    on the stability of the complex ions in solution. Sodium from sodium oxide stabilises the
30  complex ions in solution, and produces sodium hydroxide (an alkali hydroxide) in solution.
    Higher amounts of sodium hydroxide allow for greater activation of the multivalent metal
    (e.g. aluminium) in the complex, and allows for a reduced amount of multivalent metal
    source to be used in the composition.
35  Mechanical Stabiliser in the cross-linking composition
    When using a solubilised multivalent metal as one of the cross-linking agents, it is
    advantageous to include in the cross-linking composition a mechanical stabiliser for
    mechanically (i.e. structurally) maintaining the negatively-charged multivalent metal complex

                                                   - 22
    ions in solution. The mechanical stabiliser aids in maintaining the stability of the solution, by
    providing structural support around the complex ions to avoid re-precipitation or re
    crystallisation. The mechanical stabiliser may be any agent that has this function. The
    mechanical stabiliser may be a water-miscible or water-soluble organic polyol, or a water
  5 soluble or water-miscible thickening agent, examples of which are well known in food or
    pharmaceutical manufacture. Examples of such polyols and thickeners include glycerine,
    sugars and sugar alcohols, maltodextrin, polysaccharide, polyglycerol, starch, modified
    starch, and mixtures thereof.
10  The cross-linking composition is suitably free of polyethylene glycol, or contains only an
    amount of polyethylene glycol that is insufficient for it to function as a chain extender. The
    amount is suitably less than 0.5 phr, or less than 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 or less than 0.05 phr. It
    has been postulated in the art that polyethylene glycol functions as a chain extender. Such
    a chain-extender is not required in the present formulation, and preferably avoided.
15
    The latex composition is also suitably free of polyethylene oxide, or contains less than 0.3,
    less than 0.2 or less than 0.1 phr polyethylene oxide. Such agents are indicated to be
    required in the prior art to achieve a low modulus. Polyethylene oxide is not an essential
    component of the present formulation for the production of thin film gloves with a modulus
20  greater than 6.5 MPa.
    Amounts of components in the cross-linking composition
    The amount of (A) multimetal oxide, (B) multivalent metal hydroxide or (C) multivalent metal
    salt in the latex composition may be anywhere between 0.01- 5 phr across the range of
25  embodiments described herein. Although that is the case, in particular embodiments, the
    phr amounts used may fall within a narrower range of values.
    Whilst any amount within this range may be used, in particular embodiments a low amount
    of (A) multimetal oxide, (B) multivalent metal hydroxide or (C) multivalent metal salt is
30  incorporated into the composition. The amount may be within the range of 0.01-0.5 phr. In
    particular embodiments, the amount of multivalent metal ion is not more than 0.4 phr, or not
    more than 0.35 phr. The maximum amount may be not more than 0.35, 0.34, 0.33, 0.32,
    0.31, 0.30, 0.29, 0.28, 0.27, 0.26 or 0.25. The minimum amount may be at least 0.05, 0.06,
    0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14, 0.15, 0.16, 0.17, 0.18, 0.19, or 0.2 phr. Any
35  maximum and minimum value may be combined to form a range. Using low levels of the
    multivalent metal source in the cross-linking composition produces gloves having excellent
    properties, with low reagent utilisation, as demonstrated in various examples in this
    specification.

                                                   - 23
    In other embodiments, the amount may be within the broader range of 0.01 - 5.0 phr, or
   0.01 - 1.0 phr, including ranges up to 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5 phr. These maximums may be
   combined with any minimum indicated in the preceding paragraph. In some embodiments,
 5 the amount of multi metal oxide used could be at the higher end of the range. For example,
   the amount of multi metal oxide as the source for the cross-linking agent could be within one
   of the following ranges: 0.15 to 5 phr, 1.0 to 5 phr, 2.0 to 4.0 phr, 2.5 to 5 phr or 3.0 to 5.0
   phr. In other embodiments, for example, where the degree of carboxylation is low, or there
   is a high percentage of other polymers that undergo covalent cross-linking (or are self
io crosslinkable), the amount of could be lower. Suitable ranges include 0.01 - 1.0, 0.01 - 0.8,
   0.01 - 0.6, 0.01 - 0.5, 0.01 - 0.4, 0.01 - 0.3 or 0.01 - 0.2. These amounts have been
   determined using the example of sodium aluminate as the source. To determine the
   corresponding phr ranges for other agents, the appropriate conversions can be calculated.
15 Preparation of a cross-linking composition
   A cross-linking composition can be formed by solubilising a multimetal oxide of the
   multivalent metal, a hydroxide of the multivalent metal or a salt of the multivalent metal in
   water, and controlling the pH to be at least 9.0. Heating may be useful, or necessary, for
   solubilisation. The forming of the cross-linking composition may further include the step of
20 dissolving alkali in hydroxide form in the cross-linking composition. The hydroxide may be
   added and dissolved into the solution prior to, at the same time as, or following the
   solubilisation of the multimetal oxide of the multivalent metal, hydroxide of the multivalent
   metal or salt of the multivalent metal.
25  In some instances, heating can be avoided. However, heating can assist to maximise
   dissolution. The heating may be to a temperature of at least 350C, at least 400C, at least
   500C, at least 800C or around 950C to boiling. Control of the pH is typically achieved
   through addition of alkali (e.g. alkali hydroxide), as described above, to raise the pH to at
   least 9.0 (to the specific level set or targeted for the process). The pH may alternatively be
30 adjusted for pH stabilisation at a target pH level. Control of the pH may otherwise be
   achieved through the use of a multimetal source that has a high pH. Nevertheless, even if
   the pH is above the required level, it is usually necessary to add further alkali to control the
   pH more precisely, to allow matching of the pH to that of the aqueous suspension of the
   synthetic carboxylated polymer. Further, as described above, having a combination of
35 sodium and potassium hydroxide provides advantages when the cross-linking composition
   and the aqueous suspension of the synthetic carboxylated polymer are combined.

                                                   - 24
   When mechanical stabiliser is used, in accordance with preferred embodiments, the
   mechanical stabiliser is added to the cross-linking composition to maintain the multivalent
   metal complex ions in solution, to form a stabilised cross-linking composition, prior to
   addition of the cross-linking composition to the aqueous suspension of synthetic
 5 carboxylated polymer.
   In addition to, or in place of, the mechanical stabiliser, a surfactant may be used to improve
   stability of the cross-linking composition. In embodiments, the surfactant is combined with
   the cross-linking composition prior to the composition being added to the latex for the
10 purpose of maintaining a multivalent metal in the cross-linking composition in solution as a
   negatively charged multivalent metal complex ion. When a cross-linking composition is
   used, the cross-linking composition needs to be very stable to handle combination into the
   latex composition in a manner that suits the production of the articles described herein.
15 Initially, a relatively highly concentrated cross-linking composition can be prepared. Relative
   amounts of components used in the production of the concentrated cross-linking
   composition may be, per 100 parts by weight of water:
        - Between 0.01 and 5 parts of the (A) multimetal oxide of the multivalent metal, the (B)
             hydroxide of the multivalent metal or the (C) salt of the multivalent metal (preferably
20           between 0.05 and 3 parts, or between 0.1 and 2 parts); and
        -   Between 0.01 and 5 parts of alkali in hydroxide form (preferably between 0.05 and 4
             parts when using component (A) above, between 0.05 and 3 parts when using
             component (B) above, or between 0.05 and 4 parts when using component (C)
             above).
25
   The concentrated composition may further comprise:
        - Between 0.03 and 15 parts of stabiliser (i.e. total stabiliser, in the case of a mixture;
             preferably between 0.5 and 3 parts).
30 There may however be some variation in the amounts shown above - these are indicative
   values that have been shown to work effectively.
   After forming of the concentrated composition, this may be diluted prior to addition of the
   cross-linking composition to the aqueous suspension of the synthetic polymer. The dilution
35 is usually performed to reduce the concentration such that the multivalent metal ion
   concentration is reduced to between 0.33 -3.3% by weight of the cross-linking composition.
   In this case, the amount is based on the metal ion, rather than the total weight of the source
   of multivalent metal ions (A), (B) or (C). If considering the amount of the multivalent metal

                                                     - 25
    source (i.e. (A), (B) or (C)) in the diluted cross-linking composition, the diluted concentration
    of the source is typically between 1-10% by weight of the cross-linking composition. As one
    example, the diluted concentration of sodium aluminate in the cross-linking composition may
    be about 5% (about 1.5% aluminium). The initial concentration of multivalent metal ions
  5 based on the above typical amounts in the concentrated cross-linking composition is around
    3 to 10% by weight.
    Consequently, the cross-linking composition (in a form ready for combination with the latex)
    may comprise, per 100 parts by weight of water:
io        -   Between 0.0001 and 0.5 parts of the multivalent metal source (A), (B) or (C) (e.g.
              between 0.0005 and 0.3 parts or 0.001 and 0.2 parts of one of those components);
              and
          -   Between 0.0001 and 0.5 parts of alkali hydroxide (preferably between 0.001 and 0.4
              parts, between 0.005 and 0.3 parts, or between 0.005 and 0.4 parts).
15
    The cross-linking composition (in a form ready for combination with the latex) may further
    comprise:
          - Between 0.0003 and 1.5 parts of stabiliser (i.e. total stabiliser; preferably between
              0.0005 and 0.3 parts).
20
    Second cross-linking agent
    When a cross-linking composition containing solubilised multivalent metal is used, additional
    cross-linking agent (which may be referred to as a "second cross-linking agent") can be
    used. In other embodiments, the cross-linking agent does not contain the solubilised
25  multivalent metal, and instead the cross-linking agent comprises one or more of a solid
    metal oxide, sulphur and sulphur donor cross-linking agents.
     In this section, embodiments based on a combination of the cross-linking composition and
    one or more "second cross-linking agents" are described. The second cross-linking agent is
30  typically added as a separate component during the formation of the latex composition, and
    in solid form. The solid particulate cross-linking agents may be added to the aqueous
    suspension of the synthetic polymer at the same time as the cross-linking composition, or
    following addition of the cross-linking composition.
35  The second cross-linking agent can be selected from any of the covalent cross-linking
    agents, ionic cross-linking agents, and combinations thereof listed above. In some
    embodiments, the second cross-linking agent comprises sulphur, a sulphur donor, and metal
    oxide.

                                                  - 26
   In some embodiments, the second cross-linking agent may be selected from either:
   - sulphur and a sulphur donor,
   - a multivalent metal oxide or ionic cross-linking agent (e.g. a solid ionic cross-linking agent),
 5 - sulphur, a sulphur donor and an ionic cross-linking agent, or
   - a sulphur donor.
   The solid ionic cross-linking agent class includes such as zinc oxide and magnesium oxide.
   These are typically milled to a fine particle size prior to incorporation into the composition.
10 Preferably, the average particle size is below 5 microns. Uniform particle size is desirable,
   and coarse milling may result in non-uniform particles and therefore a non-uniform film,
   which can result in high fluctuation in film properties.
   Amounts of second cross-linkers
15 In broad terms, any amount of second cross-linker may be used, as required for the final
   article properties. Thus, the total amount of cross-linking agents in the composition
   (including that added in the formation of the cross-linking composition) may be between 0.01
   and 14 phr. However, it is desirable to minimise cross-linker amounts. With the use of the
   cross-linking composition of the present invention, this is possible. The total cross-linking
20 agent amount (including that used to form the cross-linking composition) may be within one
   of the following ranges: 0.01 - 14.5phr, 0.2 - 12.5phr, 0.3 - 10 phr, 0.1 - 10 phr, 0.2 - 10

25 In desirable embodiments, the amount of each secondary cross-linker is preferably not more
   than 1.0 phr, preferably not more than 0.9, 0.8. 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3 or 0.2 phr. The total
   amount of all secondary cross-linkers is preferably also not more than (or is below) 1.0, 0.9,
   0.8. 0.7, 0.6, or 0.5 phr.
30 The amount of sulphur, when used as a second cross-linker, may be between 0.0 - 5.5 phr
   or 0.01 - 5.5 phr. The amount may be lower still, at 0.0 - 3.5phr, such as 0.01 - 3.Ophr,
   0.01 - 2.Ophr, 0.01 - 1.5phr, 0.01 - 1.0phr or 0.01 - 0.5phr. The amount is preferably not
   more than 1.0 phr, preferably not more than 0.9, 0.8. 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3 or 0.2 phr.
35 The amount of sulphur donor, when used as a second cross-linker, may be between 0.0
   2.0 phr, such as between 0.01 - 2.0 phr, 0.01 - 1.5 phr, 0.01 - 1.0 phr, 0.1 - 1.5phr, 0.1

                                                   - 27
   The amount of organic cross-linking agent, when used as a second cross-linker, may be
   between 0.0 - 4.0 phr, such as 0.01 - 4.0. The amount may be lower still, at 0.01 - 3.0 phr,
   or 0.01 - 2.0 phr, or 0.01 - 1.0 phr.

   The amount of ionic cross-linking agent, when used as a second cross-linker, may be
   between 0.0 - 4.0 phr, such as 0.01 - 4.0. The amount is preferably lower still, at 0.01 - 3.0
   phr, or 0.01 - 2.0 phr, 0.01 - 1.0 phr or 0.01 - 0.5 phr. This applies to solid multivalent
   metal oxides such as zinc oxide. The amount is preferably not more than 1.0 phr, preferably
10 not more than 0.9, 0.8. 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3 or 0.2 phr.
   The cross-linking agents preferably consist essentially of one or more of a solubilised
   trivalent metal compound, a divalent metal oxide, sulphur and a sulphur donor, or a
   combination thereof. The cross-linking agent is therefore preferably free of organic cross
15 linking agents, such as polyethylene glycol cross-linker.
   Combining components of the elastomeric film-forming composition
   When a solubilised multivalent metal is used as one of the cross-linking agents (such as
   solubilised sodium aluminate), the best results are obtained when a shock-increase in the
20 pH of the latex composition (i.e. the aqueous suspension of the synthetic polymer, as it is
   combined with other components to produce the latex composition) is avoided. This can be
   achieved in two ways. One way involves very slow addition of the cross-linking composition
   to the aqueous suspension of the synthetic polymer, to allow for equilibration of the pH
   without a shock increase in pH. (It is noted that the higher the pH and concentration of the
25 cross-linking composition, the slower the addition rate, and vice versa.) The second
   alternative is to ensure that the pH of the cross-linking composition is reasonably "matched"
   to the pH of aqueous suspension of the synthetic carboxylated polymer. If the pH's are not
   too far apart, then the rate of addition is not as critical. Ideally, the matching involves
   bringing the pH of both components (or streams) within 1.0 units, or between 0.5 units of
30 each other, preferably within 0.2 units of each other, and most preferably the same pH.
   However, as noted above, an even higher pH difference is permissible if there is very slow
   addition if the cross-linking composition stream, and the cross-linking composition added is
   suitably stabilised with mechanical stabiliser and/or surfactant. By adding the cross-linking
   composition as a diluted stream (i.e. water making up more than 90% of the cross-linking
35 composition, such about 90% or more, about 91% or more, about 92% or more, about 93%
   or more, about 94% or more, or about 95% or more), at a slow rate of addition and/or with a
   matched pH, it is possible to produce a latex composition from which there is no, or minimal,
   precipitation of the multivalent metal. (That is, there is less than 20%, less than 15%, less

                                                   - 28
   than 10%, less than 5%, less than 2% and preferably no precipitation of the multivalent
   metal from the latex composition).
   Supply of an aqueous suspension of a synthetic polymer to a manufacturing facility is
 5 usually performed in the form of a concentrated solution, with a pH below 9.0. In the method
   of the invention, it may be necessary to add alkali to the aqueous suspension of the
   synthetic polymer prior to the addition of the cross-linking composition to raise the pH of the
   aqueous suspension to at least 9.0. Alkali is referred to below in the list of other
   components that may be present in the latex composition, as a stabiliser. The amount
10 should be controlled to ensure the required pH for the aqueous suspension.
   It may also be necessary to dilute the supplied aqueous suspension of synthetic
   carboxylated polymer to a total solids content (TSC) that is closer to that required in the
   production of the elastomeric gloves. For the production of the present low-weight gloves,
15 the final dipping TSC is about 3% to 15%. In some embodiments, the final dipping TSC is
   about 3% to 12%, 4% to 15%, 3% to 11%, 4% to 14%, 4% to 13%, 4% to 12%, 4% to 11%,
   4% to 10%, 3% to 10%, 5% to 14%, 5% to 13%, 5% to 12%, 5% to 11%, 5% to 10%,
   preferably from 3% to 12%. The initial dilution will be to a TSC that is a little higher than the
   final dipping TSC concentration. The supplied aqueous suspension of synthetic
20 carboxylated polymer TSC typically needs to be at least about 3% or 5% higher than the
   TSC at which dipping is performed, in view of the fact that the composition will be diluted
   through the addition of the aqueous form of cross-linking composition of the present
   invention. Supplied latex may be provided at a TSC of around 45%, around 50%, around
   55% or around 60%, in some examples.
25
   In one embodiment, there is provided a synthetic latex composition comprising a synthetic
   polymer and a cross-linking agent, wherein the cross-linking agent is present in an amount
   of less than 1.0 phr and the total solids content of the composition is from about 3% to about
   15%.
30
   Adding of the cross-linking composition to the polymer suspension
   The cross-linking composition may be added to the aqueous suspension of the polymer in
   an amount of between about 0.01 and 0.5 parts per 100 parts by volume of the aqueous
   suspension of the synthetic carboxylated polymer. The cross-linking composition is very
35 dilute, so a relatively high volume of dilute cross-linking composition is required. This is
   another factor found to aid in the formation of a stable latex composition. The typical
   amount is amount in some embodiments is between 0.03 and 0.3 parts (per 100 parts
   synthetic polymer suspension), and in some cases between 0.03 and 0.1 parts.

                                                      - 29
   Prior to, or at the same time that the cross-linking composition is added, it is advantageous
   to add surfactant to the aqueous suspension of synthetic carboxylated polymer. This aids to
   maintain the stability of the emulsion and the stability of the multivalent metal complex ions
 5 in solution. Such surfactants are additional to those that may be used in the formation of the
   cross-linking composition, which may also be selected from the examples set out below.
   The surfactant may be selected from anionic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants, and
   combinations of agents from one or both classes.

   an alkali metal (e.g., sodium or potassium), ammonium, C1-C4 alkylammonium (e.g., mono-,
   di-, tri-), or C1 - C3 alkanolammonium (e.g., mono-, di-, tri-). The specific examples of such

    alkyleneoxypolyethyleneoxyethanol water soluble alcohol ethylene oxide condensates with
    C8- C18 carbon atoms in a straight or branched chain configuration with 5 to 30 moles of
10  ethylene oxide and blends thereof. Other suitable nonionic surfactants include the
    polyethylene oxide condensates of one more of alkyl phenol containing C8- C18 carbon
    atoms in a straight or branched chain configuration with 5 to 30 moles of ethylene oxide and
    blends thereof. Specific examples of alkyl phenol ethoxylates include nonyl condensed with
    about 7-13 / 9.5 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of octyl / nonyl phenol, dinonyl phenol
15  condensed with about 12 /15 moles of EO (ethylene oxide) per mole of phenol and mixtures
    thereof.
    The surfactant is typically added as an aqueous solution. The solution concentration is
    typically around 2 - 10%. The amount of surfactant solution that may be added to the
20  aqueous suspension of the polymer with the cross-linking composition may be such as to
    provide 0.01 - 5 phr to the latex composition. The range may be between 0.1 - 2 phr, or
    about 0.6 phr. It is noted that this surfactant is additional to any surfactant that may be
    present in the concentrated aqueous suspension of synthetic carboxylated polymer supplied
    by the supplier.
25
    Other components of the elastomeric film-forming composition
    Other components may be added to the latex composition to form the elastomeric film
    forming composition. These other components may include components selected from the
    group consisting of plasticizers, anti-ozonants, stabilisers such as pH stabilisers, emulsifiers,
30  antioxidants, vulcanising agents, polymerisation initiators, pigments, fillers, colourising
    agents and sensitisers. Many of these agents are added in particulate form. Others are
    added as liquids. These are added prior to forming the latex composition into the shape of
    the synthetic elastomeric article.
35  Stabilisers may be used in the elastomeric film-forming composition. The stabilizer may be,
    for example, an anionic surfactant and/or a non-ionic surfactant. The elastomer-forming
    polymer can be diluted with a solution of a stabilizer, such as potassium hydroxide,
    ammonium hydroxide and/or sodium hydroxide. The amount of stabiliser used is dependent

                                                   -31
   on the polymer used in the elastomeric film-forming composition, the pH of the composition
   and other factors. The stabiliser can range from 0.1 - 5.Ophr, e.g. 0.5 to 2phr, preferably 1.0
   to 1.5phr, which is diluted with water, preferably filtered water -or de-ionized water, or water
   having a total solid content of around 5 ppm level.
 5
   Emulsifiers may be used in the elastomeric film-forming composition. Suitable emulsifiers
   include comprise sodium alkyl aryl sulphates, sodium alkyl sulphates or other anionic / non
   ionic surfactants. The amount of emulsifier used is dependent on the on the polymer used in
   the elastomeric film-forming composition, the pH of the composition and other factors. The
10 amount of emulsifier can range from about 0.1 to 3 phr.
   pH stabilisers may be used to avoid the possibility of destabilization, which is possible where
   the polymer contains carboxylic acid groups. Suitable pH stabilisers include alkali hydroxides
   such as potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide and / or sodium hydroxide. Preferably,
15 the pH stabiliser is potassium hydroxide. A diluted stabilizer solution can be mixed with the
   polymer. The pH of the mixture is suitably adjusted to between about 8.5 to about 12.5, or
   between about 8.5 to about 11.0. The cross-linking agent(s) can then be added to the
   mixture.
20 Anti-ozonants may be used in the elastomeric film-forming composition. Suitable anti
   ozonants include paraffinic waxes, microcrystalline waxes and intermediate types (which are
   blends of both paraffinic and microcrystalline waxes). The amount of anti-ozonant can range
   from about 0.0 to 5.0 phr.
25 Antioxidants may be added to the elastomeric film-forming composition of the present
   invention. Suitable antioxidants include hindered arylamines or polymeric hindered phenols,
   and Wingstay L (the product of p-cresol and dicyclopentadiene). The antioxidant may, for
   example, be added in an amount ranging from 0.0 - 5.Ophr, 0.0 - 3.Ophr, 0.0 - 1.0phr or
   0.3-0.5phr.
30
   Pigments such as titanium dioxide, selected for its pigmentation, to reduce the transparency
   of the final elastomeric film, may be added in amounts ranging from 0.01 - 10.Ophr, such as
   1.5-2.Ophr or 1.0 - 3.Ophr and colorants can also be added in the desired amounts. The
   mixture is then diluted to the target total solids concentration by the addition of a liquid, such
35 as water. The pigments used in the elastomeric film-forming composition may be selected
   from the group consisting of EN / USFDA approved dyes.

                                                    - 32
    Rubber reoderants may be used in the elastomeric film-forming composition. Suitable rubber
    reoderants include perfume oils of natural or synthetic origins. The amount of rubber
    reoderant can range from about 0.001 to 2.0 phr.
  5 Wetting agents may be used in the elastomeric film-forming composition. Suitable wetting
    agent emulsifiers include anionic surfactants like sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate or
    sodium lauryl ether sulfate, or non-ionic ethoxylated alkyl phenols such as octylphenoxy
    polyethoxy ethanol or other non-ionic wetting agents. The amount of wetting agent can
    range from about 0.001 to 2.0 phr.
10
    Defoamers may be used in the elastomeric film-forming composition. Defoamers may be
    chosen from naphthalene type defoamers, silicone type defoamers and other non
    hydrocarbon type defoamers or defoamers of refined oil of vegetable origin. The amount of
    defoamers can range from about 0.001 to 2.0 phr.
15
    The elastomeric film-forming composition could also be blended with inorganic filler.
    Suitable inorganic fillers include titanium calcium carbonate, carbon black or clay.
    Preferably, the amount of inorganic filler included in the blend would not exceed 75% either
    alone or in combination. It will be appreciated that the blended composition will retain the
20  favorable properties.
    Sensitisers are chemicals that can be used in compositions for producing elastomeric films
    to control the amount of the composition that will remain coated on the mould during dipping
    (film deposition). Examples of sensitisers known in the art that can be used in the
25  composition for producing an elastomeric film include polyvinyl methyl ether, polypropylene
    glycol, ammonium nitrate and ammonium chloride. The amount is generally be between 0.01
    to 2.Ophr, e.g. 0.1 to 1.0phr. When other techniques are used for controlling the film
    thickness on the mould, such as the use of pre-dipping the mould into coagulant before
    undertaking the multiple dipping into the composition for producing the elastomeric film, the
30  composition for producing an elastomeric film may not require a sensitiser.
    Those skilled in the art will readily be able to vary the components of the elastomeric glove
    or film-forming composition to suit the circumstances. It will also be understood by those of
    skill in the art that specific chemicals or compounds which have been listed above are
35  intended to be representative of conventional materials that may be used in formulating the
    elastomeric film-forming composition and are merely intended as non-limiting examples of
    each such component of the composition. Nevertheless, it is preferred to utilize the
    compositions and guidance provided herein, since these have been found to be optimal in

                                                    - 33
    achieving the production of the claimed thin film gloves with acceptable performance
    properties.
    It is noted that a number of the components of the latex composition are particulate, and it is
  5 preferred to ensure that the particle size is sufficiently low to allow for the casting of an ultra
    thin film on the surface of the mould. As indicated above, a solubilised cross-linking
    composition may be used as the (or one of the) cross-linking agents. Using a solubilised
    form of a cross-linking agent in the composition has been found to be preferred for the
    production of ultra-thin films, since it reduces or minimises the number of particulate
io  components that would otherwise enlarge the thickness of the film through overlaying of the
    particles in a particle-dense composition. To achieve the desired elastomeric properties, it is
    further useful to include a secondary cross-linking agent (or combination thereof), in addition
    to the solubilised cross-linking composition. The most useful secondary cross-linking agents
    are typically in solid form, with varying particle size. Some secondary cross-linking agents
15  may be used in solubilised form (e.g. sulphur may be solubilised). In the present application,
    it is desirable for the solid secondary cross-linking agents to be used at a particle size of less
    than 5pm (i.e. at least 95% of the particles are less than 5pm in size). It is also desirable for
    any other solid components that are not dissolved in the latex composition to have a low
    particle size. Further, it is desirable to control the number of particles (measured by total
20  particulate cross-linker phr) to a relatively low level. These factors allow for the formation of
    a thin film product, with the avoidance of excessive accumulation of cross-linker particles on
    top of each other in the film that is cast on the mould.
    The elastomeric film-forming composition is preferably formalin-free.
25
    Final composition preparation stages
    All components of the elastomeric film-forming composition are combined as described
    above, taking care, where necessary, to avoid pH shock which would cause coagulation.
30  After mixing of all components, the elastomeric film-forming composition is then left for
    maturation. The length of maturation may vary depending on the amount of cross-linking
    agent and the degree of carboxylation of the polymer, where the polymer is carboxylated.
    The composition may be left for a minimum of 2 to 18 hours for the purpose of removing air
    bubbles inside the compounded polymer. The compounded elastomeric film-forming
35  composition with suitable additives could be prematured by holding the composition at a
    controlled elevated temperature. For example, the elastomeric film-forming composition
    could be held at 400C to 60 OC for a period of, for example, about 4 hours to about 24 hours
    depending on the temperature, degree of carboxylation of the polymer, the amount and type

                                                  - 34
   of vulcanization activators and Sulphur donors, and type and quantity of pH stabilizer and
   emulsifier stabilizer and wetting agents / surfactants.
   Preparation of elastomeric articles, such as films
 5 The composition is formed into the shape of a glove, and then cured. Curing is used in a
   general sense, to refer to the stage during which cross-linking is performed.
   The forming of the product into the desired shape suitably involves dipping a glove-shaped
   former (which may alternatively be referred to as a mould) into the composition. The former
10 may be of any type known in the art. In some embodiments, the former is of one of the new
   classes described in detail below.
   The steps in the manufacture of the gloves are as generally described in
   PCT/AU2014/000726 and PCT/AU2014/000727. However, particular steps and conditions
15 are used to control the formation of the gloves so as to have the very low thickness as
   required by the present application. In addition, the former design is also controlled so as to
   allow the formation of the ultra-thin gloves, as described below.
   The process steps in some embodiments are as follows:
20
   Step (a) Dipping the former into a coagulant composition
   A glove-shaped former is dipped into a preliminary composition, conventionally referred to
   as a coagulant composition. The coagulant composition typically contains multivalent ions in
   solution. This procedure leaves a thin coating of the charged ions on the surface of the
25 former. The charged ions coating assists in controlling the amount composition for forming
   the elastomeric film (the latex composition) that will subsequently remain on the surface of
   the mould after dipping into the latex composition, through charge interactions.
   The concentration of multivalent ions in the coagulant can broadly be in the range of 0.0
30 20% by weight of the coagulant solution (measured as the compound of the multivalent ion
   in the solution of the multivalent ions), depending on the desired thickness of the elastomeric
   film layers and the number of layers to be applied (i.e. one layer or two or more layers). For
   preparation of thin layers, the concentration is suitably in the range of 0.0 - 20%, 0.0 - 15%,
   0.1 - 20%, 0.0 - 12%, 0.1 - 12%, 0.1 - 10%, 0.1 - 5%, 0.5-12%, 0.5 - 10%, 0.5 - 5%, 1.5
35 20%, 1.5 - 15%, 1.0 - 10%, 1.5 - 10%, and 1-5%.
   Cationic multivalent ion-containing coagulants are typically used, such as a calcium
   coagulant. The coagulant may be selected from calcium chloride, magnesium chloride,

                                                  - 35
   sodium chloride and other forms of monovalent and multivalent metal salts which exhibit a
   cationic ion upon dissolution, since the deposition of the film requires the presence of some
   positively charged ions in the solution.
 5 It will be noted that the coagulant composition may contain a zero amount of coagulating
   multivalent ions. Gloves can be produced without any coagulant. Whilst that is the case,
   the glove former may still be dipped into a preliminary composition (which may be referred to
   as a coagulant composition regardless of the absence of coagulating multivalent ions) for
   the purpose of providing other useful properties, such as mould release properties. A heat
10 sensitiser may be used in addition to, or in place of, a conventional coagulant.
   The preliminary composition into which the former is dipped, conventionally referred to as
   the coagulant composition, may comprise a mould release agent. A mould release agent is
   an agent that aids in the release of the cured glove product from the former on stripping.
15 The mould release agent is a particulate mould release agent. Examples of suitable mould
   release agents include stearate salts, such as alkali and alkaline earth metal stearates - viz.
   calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, zinc stearate, potassium stearate - polymeric mould
   release agents, silicone particulate materials and so forth. In preferred embodiments, the
   mould release agent is a stearate salt.
20
   It is necessary to apply a mould release agent to the surface of the former prior to the latex
   dipping steps, and it is beneficial for the mould release agent to be a particulate mould
   release agent having an average particle size less than 15 pm. In some embodiments, it
   may be less than 14pm, less than 13pm, less than 12pm, less than 11pm or less than 10pm.
25 Such particle sizes refer to a D95 particle size (i.e. at least 95% of the particles are within
   this particle size range.)
   The applicant postulated during performing their extensive test work that a significant
   amount of a mould release agent would be required to allow the very thin, relatively delicate,
30 gloves to be stripped from the former. However, the applicant found that the use of high
   amounts of mould release agent to assist in stripping (slipping) the cured glove product off
   the mould adversely impacted on the article properties, including the uniformity of the glove
   thickness, which lead to areas of weakness and hence breakage on attempted stripping.
   The application of a higher amount of mould release agent also impacted on the colour of
35 the final product. That is, the most commonly used mould release agents are dark in colour,
   and while this can be obscured in thicker gloves, ultra-thin gloves do not contain enough
   bulk to lessen the darkening effect of the mould release agent. The products produced with
   a high amount of mould release agent had an undesirable greyed appearance.

                                                   - 36
   The applicant tried to avoid the use of a mould release agent, to avoid these challenges, but
   found it not possible to take this step without significantly impacting on the cost of production
   and generating other undesirable qualities in the glove products.
 5
   Ultimately, if the particle size of the mould release agent is minimised (i.e. it is brought within
   one of the size range indicated above), and at the same time the surface roughness of the
   former is controlled to be within a particular range, a suitable balance in properties is
   provided that enables the production of good quality, ultra-thin gloves, using conventional
10 glove production lines (with conventional glove production speeds).
   In terms of the former surface, modified formers were produced having a controlled surface
   roughness (Sz) within the range of 28 to 42pm. The surface roughness was carefully
   controlled to be sufficient to allow pick-up of the latex composition (without dripping/pooling
15 off the former), and to achieve the formation of a sufficiently uniform latex film layer on the
   former. Combining this with the particle size of the mould release agent in the coagulant also
   contributes to the production of a strong film with fewer defects. Larger mould release
   particles can change the surface of the coagulant-dipped former, and create areas of quasi
   roughness that reduces the film thickness where such mould release agent particles have
20 accumulated.
   The surface roughness of the former used in the production of the gloves in accordance with
   preferred embodiments is described in detail below.
25 The coagulant composition may comprise any other additional agents as desired. Examples
   include surfactants, thickeners and anti-foaming agents. Thickeners may be cellulose-based
   thickeners or otherwise.
   Typical amounts of components in the coagulant suited for use in the present application are
30 as follows:
        - Coagulant ions - 0 to 20% by weight (e.g. calcium-based coagulant)
        - Mould release agent - 0.1 to 5.0% by weight (e.g. stearate)
        -   Surfactant - 0 to 1.0%, such as 0.001 to 1.0 % by weight
        -   Thickener - 0 to 1.0%, such as 0.01-1.0% by weight
35      -   Anti-forming agent - 0.001 to 1.0% by weight.
   The time period over which the mould is lowered into the coagulant may be between 1 and
   30 seconds, such as 2-30 seconds, 1-10 seconds, or 1-5 seconds. Then, the duration or

                                                     - 37
    dwell time for the mould in the coagulant is suitably between 0 and 50 seconds, such as
    between 1 and 50 seconds or between 1 and 30 seconds. In some embodiments, the dwell
    time for the mould in the coagulant is 1 to 10 seconds. In some embodiments, the dwell time
    for the mould in the coagulant may be longer than 30 seconds. The time period over which
  5 the mould is removed from the coagulant may be between 1 and 30 seconds, such as
    between 3 and 30 seconds or between 1 and 10 seconds. The total time period may, in one
    embodiment, be between 10-24 seconds. The temperature of the coagulant into which the
    mould is dipped may, for example, be between 300C - 800C.
10  It is noted that, in the context of dipping into coagulant or latex (see below), the time period
    for lowering ("in") covers the time from when the mould first touches the coagulant or latex
    composition until complete immersion (i.e. the lowest point to which the mould is lowered
    during immersion). The time period of removal or raising ("out") covers the time from the
    commencement of raising of the mould until the point at which the mould is completely
15  removed from the coagulant or latex, and just breaks contact with the coagulant/latex
    surface.
    It is also noted that the time periods indicated herein for dipping times are dependent on the
    speed of the production of line for glove production, and the size of the tanks present in the
20  production line. These dipping time periods suit about 3.3 to 8 metres of effective length of
    coagulant and a linear speed of 20 metres/minute, which is a conventional line speed for thin
    film glove production. The latex dipping times indicated below suit 5-8 metres of effective
    length of latex at the same linear speed. Adjustments can be made for production lines with
    different tank lengths, and different linear speeds.
25
    Step (b) Drying or partially drying the dipped former
    After the dipping of step (a), former is dried or partially dried.
    Step (i) Dipping the former into the elastomeric film-forming composition to produce a layer
30  of elastomeric article-forming composition on the mould
    The former is dipped into the composition for producing an elastomeric film (i.e. the latex
    composition), which contains the components as described in detail above. The duration of
    dipping, temperature, and former surface temperature may be as described in the PCT
35  publications referred to above. The duration of dipping, or the dwell time refers to the time
    taken from the point at which the glove former is completely immersed into the composition,
    until the point at which the glove former commences being removed from the composition.

                                                   - 38
   The former is in the dipping tank for an amount of time to ensure the former is evenly
   coated, but not so long as to develop a thicker coating than necessary. The time period over
   which the mould is lowered into the dipping tank or latex composition may be between 1 and
   30 seconds, such as 2-30 seconds, 1-10 seconds, or 1 to 5 seconds. Then, depending on
 5 the required thickness of the coating, the dwell time of the former in the dipping tank may be
   between about 0-50 seconds, such as between about 1-50 seconds, 0-15 seconds, 1 to 15
   seconds, 2 to 15 seconds, 0 to 10 seconds, 1 to 10 seconds, 5 to 20 seconds, 10 to 30
   seconds, 15 to 25 seconds, 20 to 40 seconds, 25-40 seconds, 30 to 40 seconds or 20 to 50
   seconds. The time period over which the mould is removed from the latex may be between
10 1 and 30 seconds, such as 3-30 seconds, 1-30 seconds or 1-20 seconds. In some
   embodiments, the total time period may be between about 3 to 50 seconds, such as 5 to 30
   seconds. The time period may be 15-24 seconds in some embodiments.
   The temperature of the composition into which the former is dipped is generally within the
15 range of 10 C to 600C, such as 10 C to 500C, 150C to 500C, 200C to 500C, 250C to 500C,
   250C to 450C, 200C to 400C or 200C to 350C. Preferably, the composition into which the
   former is dipped is constantly cooled with chilled water and the latex bath temperature is
   kept between 20 - 350 C, such as 200 C to 300C and more preferably at 250C. In some
   embodiments, the composition is constantly circulated in the tank to avoid creaming and
20 settling of the chemicals contained in the elastomeric film-forming composition.
   Preferably, the surface temperature of the former does not exceed the temperature of the
   elastomeric film- forming composition by more than 800 C. It has been found by the applicant
   that if the surface temperature of the former is more than 800 C higher than the temperature
25 of the composition for producing an elastomeric film, shrinkage of the coating of elastomeric
   film-forming composition on the former may occur. In some embodiments, the surface
   temperature of the former is lower than the temperature of the elastomeric film-forming
   composition. However, typically, the surface temperature of the former is about 200 C to 600
   C higher than the temperature of the elastomeric film-forming composition.
30
   If a single film-layer glove is produced, the next step performed is step (v).
   Step (ii) Optional step of drying or partially drying the layer of elastomeric film-forming
   composition on the former - not performed if a single film-layer glove
35 If a second dip is performed, then the initial layer of elastomeric film-forming composition is
   dried or partially dried on the former. The time and temperature of the drying stage can be
   controlled as desired to ensure adhesion/intermingling of the second layer on the first layer.

                                                  - 39
   Step (iii) Optional step of dipping the former coated with the dried or partially dried layer of
   elastomeric film-forming composition into the elastomeric film-forming composition to
   produce a further layer of elastomeric film-forming composition on the former
   This step is optional, and is present when multi-layer articles are produced. The conditions
 5 for the second dip may be the same as those for the first dip, or this dip may be performed at
   a different total solids content, and for a shorter dwell time.
   The former is in the dipping tank for an amount of time to ensure the former is evenly
   coated, but not so long as to develop a thicker coating than necessary. The time period over
1o which the mould is lowered into the dipping tank (into the latex composition) may be
   between 1 and 30 seconds, such as 2-30 seconds, 1-10 seconds, or 1 to 5 seconds. Then,
   depending on the required thickness of the coating, the dwell time of the former in the
   dipping tank may be between about 0 and 50 seconds, such as 1-50 seconds, 1 - 20
   seconds, 0- 15 seconds, 1 to 15 seconds, 2 to 15 seconds, 0- 10 seconds, or 1 to 10
15 seconds. In some embodiments, the dwell time for the second dipping step may be shorter,
   such as between about 1 - 15 seconds, such as between about 1 to 10 seconds, or 1 to 5
   seconds. The time period over which the mould is removed from the latex may be between 1
   and 30 seconds, such as 3-30 seconds, 1-30 seconds or 1-20 seconds. In some
   embodiments, the total time period may be between about 3 to 50 seconds, such as 5 to 30
20 seconds.
   The temperature of the composition into which the former is dipped to produce the further
   layer is generally within the range of 10 C to 600C, such as 10 C to 500C, 150C to 500C,
   200C to 500C, 250C to 500C, 250C to 450C, 200C to 400C or 200C to 350C. Preferably, the
25 composition into which the former is dipped to produce the further layer is constantly cooled
   with chilled water and the latex bath temperature is kept between 20 - 350 C, such as 200 C
   to 300C and more preferably at 250C. In some embodiments, the composition is constantly
   circulated in the tank to avoid creaming and settling of the chemicals contained in the
   elastomeric film-forming composition.
30
   Preferably, the surface temperature of the former does not exceed the temperature of the
   elastomeric film- forming composition by more than 800 C. It has been found by the applicant
   that if the surface temperature of the former is more than 800 C higher than the temperature
   of the composition for producing an elastomeric film, shrinkage of the coating of elastomeric
35 film-forming composition on the former may occur. In some embodiments, the surface
   temperature of the former is lower than the temperature of the elastomeric film-forming
   composition. However, typically, the surface temperature of the former is about 200 C to 60
   C higher than the temperature of the elastomeric film-forming composition.

                                                   -40
    Step (iv) Optionally repeating the drying or partial drying step (ii) and the further dipping step
    (iii)
    This step is optional, and is preferably not performed. This step produces three or more
  5 layers of film, following the formation of a second layer of film in optional step (iii).
    Optional additional steps prior to drying and curing
    Further steps can be taken to fine-tune the manufacture of the elastomeric film or article.
    The details of these steps are as described in the PCT publications referred to above. In
10  brief, the film or article can be leached to remove extractable components, there may be a
    coating material applied, beading/cuffing cab be performed and/or the product may be
    passed through a curing or vulcanizing oven to evaporate the water in the film and enable
    better cross linking.
15  Step (v) Drying and/or curing the layered elastomeric film on the former
    The elastomeric film layer produced by the dipping step(s) is dried and/or cured in
    accordance with conventional procedures. The details of this step are as described in the
    PCT publications referred to above.
20  Optional additional steps following drying and curing
    The optional steps that may take place following drying and/or curing can include one or
    more of cooling, chlorination, post-curing rinsing, polymer coating and additional drying
    steps. The cured film may also be cooled / chlorinated / neutralized - post-leached in hot
    water and optionally dipped in lubricant solution or any silicone / silicone free polymers to aid
25  stripping and better donning. The details of these optional steps are as described in the PCT
    publications referred to above.
    Step (vi) Stripping
    The glove is stripped from the former at the conclusion of the formation process.
30
    Stripping is conventionally performed using machine or automated stripping equipment.
    During machine stripping, gloves are removed from the former using techniques such as
    compressed air application, a combination of air and mechanical gearing, and mechanical
    stripping (which involves automation to simulate the human motion of pulling a glove from
35  the cuff off the mould). Stripping by machine rather than hand, while more cost-effective,
    requires the glove to be sufficiently robust to withstand the stripping pressures applied by the
    machinery, and requires the glove to be readily "released" from the mould surface (to slip off
    or over the surface). In conventional thin glove manufacture, there may be a low degree of

                                                     -41
    glove removal failure (i.e. a low percentage of gloves that are not completely removed from
    the formers), which are removed manually before the formers proceed to washing. In the
    case of ultra-thin glove manufacture, the above-described glove production techniques
    enable machine stripping equipment to be used, thus saving considerable cost. The rate of
  5 stripping failure is kept to a relatively low level, such that at least 90% of the gloves are
    successfully removed by machine stripping, and typically at least 92%, at 95%, at 98% or a
    higher percentage of the gloves are successfully removed.
    In the production of other, higher-value, dipped products, other stripping techniques are also
10  available, such as air/water jet stripping. Air jet stripping is not widely used in glove
    production.
    Formers
15  Conventional formers may be used to produce the ultra-thin gloves, although the quality of
    the gloves and/or the defect rates may be adversely impacted by production on such
    formers. In some embodiments, a former of one of the classes specified above (i.e. the
    controlled roughness former and/or the cuff-banded former) is used as the former for
    producing the ultra-thin gloves. Such (new) formers may also be used in the production of
20  elastomeric gloves more generally, including gloves of standard film thickness (including
    gloves with a palm thickness of at least 0.05mm).
    The glove-shaped former may comprise (i) a palm zone, (ii) a cuff zone, (iii) between finger
    zones and (iv) finger zones. The location and size of these zones is described below.
25
    In preferred embodiments, the palm zone has a surface roughness (Sz) of between 28 and
    42pm. Preferably the cuff zone also has this surface roughness.
    Where reference is made to a surface roughness, unless indicated otherwise, this should be
30  read as a reference to maximum peak size (Sz). Sz is suitably measured using an optical
    microscope, in a non-contact method of surface roughness measurement. S. is a
    measurement of the maximum profile height of an area, and is the sum of the largest peak
    height value and the largest pit depth value within a defined area, in pm. S. is the areal
    extension of Rz, which is a measurement of the maximum height profile of a curve along a
35  2D line, calculated as the sum of the maximum peak and maximum trough along the line
    length.   S. is calculated automatically by suitable instrumentation, such as the Keyence
    VHX-6000 High Resolution Digital Microscope. The measurements are calculated in
    accordance with ISO 25178. The surface roughness in a particular zone of the former, or in

                                                   -42
    the zone of the glove, is assessed by taking a surface roughness measurement at one
    location at or near the middle of that zone.
    The Sz of the former at the palm is preferably a minimum of 28, 29, 30, 31, or 32pm. The Sz
  5 of the former at the palm is preferably a maximum of 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37 or 36 at each
    instance. Any minimum and maximum can be combined to form a range. Suitable ranges
    include 29-40pm, 30-38pm, 30-36pm, 29-36pm or 29-34pm.
    In the examples, the surface roughness (Sz) was taken from the reading of a VHS-6000
10  digital microscope, rounded to the closest whole pm value.
    Controlling the surface roughness impacts not only on the degree of uniformity of the film,
    but also on the stickiness of the film to the mould, and release of the cured film from the
    mould. The former must be rough enough for the liquid latex composition to stick, but then
15  not so rough that there is over-sticking of the cured product. The applicant unexpectedly
    found a balance that allows for the commercial-scale production of ultra-thin gloves. The
    gloves could be produced on conventional glove-dipping lines (albeit with modifications to
    the formers, compositions and so forth), but without any slowing (or excessive slowing) of
    the production speed, which is critical to the overall cost of production of each unit of the
20  product. Combining the surface roughness with low particle size for the mould release agent
    in the coagulant is also desirable.
    In some embodiments, the surface roughness (Sz) of the palm zone of the former is different
    to that of one or both of the between finger zones and the finger zones.
25
    In some embodiments, the palm and cuff zones together encompass at least 50% of the
    former surface (specifically, the dipping zone of the former surface), and the combined palm
    and cuff zone has a surface roughness within the ranges indicated previously for the palm
    zone.
30
    In another embodiment, the former is a cuff-banded former. In this embodiment, the glove
    shaped former comprises a cuff zone including a cuff band region with a roughened surface
    that is visible to the naked eye. The cuff band region suitably has a surface roughness (Sz)
    that is greater than that of the cuff zone outside the cuff band region. The cuff band region
35  of the former provides resistance to slipping of a gelled latex composition on the former
    during a pre-leaching stage of glove production. The former is dipped in a fingers-down
    orientation, with the cuff band is at the uppermost end. The former is dipped into the latex
    until there is part-immersion of the cuff band region of the former into the latex, and then it is

                                                    -43
   withdrawn, so that the upper edge of the latex on the former is within the cuff band region.
   Upon later gelling of the latex and washing stages, there can be slippage of the gelled latex
   down the former surface, creating defects. The cuff band region provides a zone of
   resistance at the upper end of the glove on the former that prevents the slippage of the
 5 gelled latex that may otherwise occur. Such a feature is of particular pertinence to the
   production of ultra-thin film gloves, where it has been found that there is a greater tendency
   for slippage. In some embodiments, the cuff band region has a surface roughness that is at
   least as high as, or higher than, the surface roughness of both the palm zone and the cuff
   zone. In some embodiments, the cuff band region surface roughness is a minimum of 110%
10 of the palm zone surface roughness. In such a cuff-banded former, the surface roughness
   of the cuff-band region may be 30pm or above, such as 33pm or above. In the above
   discussion, the cuff zone refers to the part of the cuff zone outside the cuff band region.
   The cuff band region may have an Sz that is a minimum of 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 or 36pm.
15 The Sz is not specifically limited, but it could conceivably be as high as 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
   41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48pm or more. The minimum and maximums can be combined
   without limitation.
   The location of each of the zones (i) - the palm zone P, (ii) the cuff zone C, (iii) the between
20 finger zone BF and (iv) the finger zone F are illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. This figure
   shows a glove former (1), with zones including a palm zone (2), a cuff zone (3), between
   finger zones (4) and finger (fingertip) zones (5). In Figure 4, zones (2) to (5) are illustrated
   as being of a smaller size, denoted by an (a) after the number. In Figure 5, the zones (2) to
   (5) are shown to be of a larger size, denoted by (b). Each of the zones may be defined as
25 follows:
   P: A palm zone ((2a) in Figure 4 and (2b) in Figure 5) is in the region of the glove that
   corresponds to the palm of the hand. This may be present on each side of the former, and
   may be present as a continuous zone that extends around either side of the former, as each
30 former is for the production of gloves of the same shape for wearing on both left or right
   hands. Thus, the palm zone typically extends around the middle part of the former between
   the fingers and the cuff. The palm zone is a minimum of 4 cm 2 (see (2(a)) in Figure 4). The
   palm zone may extend as far as from the end finger zone (indicated by (6) in Figure 5) to the
   start of the cuff zone (which generally commences around a line 200mm from the most
35 remote fingertip - marked by dashed line (8) in Figure 5). A larger size version of the palm
   zone is indicated by (2(b)) in Figure 5, although it is noted that the length of the palm zone
   will depend on where the cuff zone ends (see discussion below). When a plurality of palm
   zone surface roughness measurements are taken, these may, for example, be spaced

                                                     -44
   evenly within the palm zone. For example, the measurements may be taken at the four
   corners of a 2cm x 2cm square region in the centre of the palm zone.
   C: The cuff zone extends as a band of at least 20mm in width encompassing an area further
 5 than 200mm from the most remote fingertip, as indicated by (3(a)) in Figure 4. Typically the
   cuff zone encompasses a broader area of the former, covering the region between dashed
   line (8) as indicated in Figure 5 (which is located 200mm from the most remote fingertip) to
   dashed line (10), which corresponds to the anticipated dipping depth on the former. The cuff
   zone may extend further still, to encompass the area marked as X, in Figure 5, extending
io from line (9) to line (10). The length of the cuff zone may therefore be anywhere between
   that indicated by (3(a)) in Figure 4, to that indicated by X, in Figure 5. According to
   embodiments described above, there may be a sub-section of the cuff zone, referred to as
   the cuff band region (marked as 7(a) in Figure 4 and 7(b) in Figure 5), that has a higher
   roughness than the remaining cuff zone. The cuff band area may be a minimum of 20mm in
15 width (see (7(a)) in Figure 4), and extends across a region of the former corresponding to
   the intended dipping depth. This may correspond to a beading zone of the glove. The cuff
   band area may be up to 40mm in width (see (7(b) in Figure 5).
   BF: A between finger zone (4) refers to the crotch between adjacent finger portions of the
20 former. The between finger zone is suitably a minimum area of 1cm 2 of any suitable shape
   extending across the crotch area (see (4(a)) in Figure 4). The between finger zone may
   extend to an area of up to about 4cm 2 in size, of any suitable dimensions (see (4(b)) in
   Figure 5).
25 F: The former includes 5 fingers (in this case, the thumb is classified as a finger). The finger
   zone (5) covers at least the first 1/ 5th of the finger length extending from the fingertip of each
   finger). The minimum size area is indicated by (5(a)) in Figure 4. The finger zone may
   extend to 2/3rds of the full length of the finger portion, starting at the fingertip (see (5(b)) in
   Figure 5, terminating at the line indicated by numeral (6) in Figure 5). The finger zone may
30 extend further, such as to the end of the finger, where it may meet the start of the palm zone
   and the between finger zones. The finger zone excludes the between finger zone (4).
   For any area between the zones that is not accounted for, the roughness may be set at any
   suitable value. Generally, the glove will be divided into zones such that each of the four
35 zones indicated (plus the cuff band area of the cuff) will abut one another. As one example,
   the palm zone may extend part-way up the fingers of the former, ending at a point where the
   finger zone commences (e.g. point (6) in Figure 5). There may be a gradual transition

                                                    -45
   between the roughness of one zone and the next adjacent zone, or there may be a sharp
   delineation between adjacent zones.
    It will be noted that the roughness values for some adjacent zones of the sets indicated
 5 above are the same, so there will be no need to distinguish between the end of one zone
   and the commencement of the next zone in such situations. Where the roughness values
   differ between adjacent zones, areas of different roughness will be detectable.
   Control of formation of ultra-thin gloves
io  In some embodiments, the combination of the coagulant dipping step and the latex dip is
   controlled to ensure ultra-thin coatings onto the mould. A suitable combination of conditions
   according to particular embodiments are as follows:
         -   Coagulant concentration of between 0-10%, based on multivalent ion concentration
              (e.g. calcium), such as between 0.1 - 10%, 1-10%, 0.1-7%, 1 and 7%, and
15            preferably 1 and 5%;
         -   Total time period covering lowering the mould into the coagulant tank, dwell time, and
              raising out of the coagulant tank of between 10 and 24 seconds;
         -   A latex total solids content of about 1-20%, such as about 3 to about 12%;
         -   A total time period covering lowering the mould into the latex dipping tank, dwell time,
20            and raising out of the tank of between 15 and 24 seconds.
   The conditions may comprise the mould release agent particle size as described previously.
   The conditions may comprise the content of mould release agent in the coagulant described
   previously. The conditions may comprise the formation of the glove on a former having the
25 surface roughness properties as described above. The conditions may also comprise the
   concentration of cross-linking agent, as described previously. The conditions may also
   comprise the identity of the cross-linking agent(s), as described previously.
   Finger Cots
30 The present application also extends to finger cots and methods for their manufacture.
    Finger cots are disposable shields for the finger only, and are used in situations when a full
   glove is not necessary. Finger cots can be made by the same technique and using the
   same compositions as described above for glove production, with the one difference being
35 the shape of the mould and the consequent shape/size of the product. A finger cot
   comprises a finger portion and a beaded rim. In the case of finger cots, the finger thickness
   is the indicator of the thickness of the overall product, and impacts on the weight of the
   product.

                                                   -46
    According to such aspects, there is provided a synthetic elastomeric finger cot with:
          (a) a thickness of less than 0.05mm;
          (b) a modulus at 500% above 6.5 MPa; and/or
  5       (c) an elongation at break below 700%.
    The thickness refers to the finger thickness. Preferred thicknesses for the finger thickness
    are as specified above in the context of the finger thickness for the gloves - although limited
    to a thickness of less than 0.05mm.
10
    The modulus and elongation values for the glove indicated above apply equally to the
    production of finger cots. Using the techniques described herein, it is possible to produce
    such ultra-thin finger cots having elongation and modulus values as described above.
15  According to the present invention there is also provided a method of manufacturing the
    synthetic elastomeric finger cot described above comprising:
    - dipping a finger-shaped former into an elastomeric film-forming composition;
    - curing the elastomeric film-forming composition on the former so as to produce the
    synthetic elastomeric finger cot.
20
    The conditions for manufacture of the finger cot (including composition details) are as
    described above for the glove, with some modifications to be suited to finger cot production.
    One modification is that the former is a finger-shaped former. The finger-shaped former
    preferably has a surface roughness (Sz) that is between 28 and 42pm, or between any of the
25  narrower ranges indicated above for the palm zone of the controlled roughness former. The
    finger-shaped former also preferably has a band-region of higher surface roughness (Sz)
    than the surface roughness of a finger zone adjacent to the band-region. This corresponds
    to the cuff-band region in the glove-shaped former. Another modification is that the time
    period of dipping the mould into the coagulant, and into the latex (covering lowering, dwell,
30  and raising), is shorter due to the smaller size/length of the mould which requires less time
    to lower and raise to become fully immersed in the coagulant or latex. The total time period
    is suitably half those specified for glove production indicated above.
     In the claims and in the preceding description, except where the context requires otherwise
35  due to express language or necessary implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as
     'comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the
    stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in various
    embodiments of the invention.

    EXAMPLES
    The invention will now be described in further detail with reference to the following non
  5 limiting examples which involve the preparation of elastomeric film gloves.
    GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR PRODUCTION OF ELASTOMERIC GLOVES
    In the examples set out below, the following general procedure was utilised to produce
    elastomeric gloves, unless indicated to the contrary.
10
    1.       Preparation of Cross-linking composition
    One part sodium aluminate as the chosen multivalent metal source, together with 1 part
    sodium hydroxide and 1 part potassium hydroxide as alkali and 1 part glycerine as stabiliser,
    were combined with 6 parts of water. Then, one part of this initial concentrate was
15  combined with 10 parts of water, to yield a cross-linking composition containing 96 parts
    water and 1 part of each of the sodium aluminate, NaOH, KOH and glycerine. The
    combination was heated at an elevated temperature (typically around 95'C, but anywhere
    from 80'C to boiling point) to dissolve the multivalent metal, through the formation of
    negatively charged multivalent metal complex ions. The concentration of metal ions in the
20  cross-linking compositions obtained was 0.66% or 0.33% by weight of total solution,
    respectively. The pH of the solution was in the range of about 12 - 13.
    2.       Preparation of latex composition
    A commercially-available aqueous suspension of synthetic carboxylated polymer, supplied
25  at a total solids content of about 45% or more, is diluted to an intermediate total solids
    content using 3% potassium hydroxide solution. The amount of potassium hydroxide
    solution added was such as to provide the amount of KOH indicated in the examples (phr).
    The actual total solids content to which the suspension is diluted is chosen based on the
    desired phr amount of KOH and the final total solids content of the dipping composition for
30  the latex composition. The final total solids content may be anywhere between 3% and
    15%. For a final latex composition having a total solids content of about 5 or 10%, as used
    in these examples, the initial dilution is to about 25% - 30%. The pH of the diluted
    suspension so produced was above 9.0, typically in the range of 9.2 to 9.6.
35  The diluted suspension of synthetic carboxylated polymer is placed in a mixing vessel, and
    the surfactant is added. The amount and identity of the surfactant was as indicated in the
    examples. Next the cross-linking composition added very slowly with constant stirring. The
    cross-linking composition is added in an amount to provide the required phr of multivalent

                                                 -48
   metal to the polymer. In view of the concentrations of the streams used in the examples, the
   relative amounts of the two components was about 0.1 parts of cross-linking composition to
   100 parts polymer suspension. This further reduces the total solids content of the polymer
   closer to 20%.
 5
   Next, any second cross-linking agents were added. The sequence of addition was as
   follows. First, any solid zinc oxide or magnesium oxide was added (if used). Then, sulphur
   and sulphur donors were added.
io Finally, a dispersion in water of final powder materials was added. This included the
   titanium dioxide and antioxidant. The amount of inclusion of each is as required to provide
   the target formulation for the latex composition. After addition of the solid components, the
   pH maybe fine-tuned by the addition of further alkali (the 3% KOH solution in the present
   examples). The total solids content of the final formulation for the latex composition for the
15 examples was about 5-10%. In other cases, it may be between 3% and 15% for the
   formation of thin film gloves.
   3.      Washing
   The formers are subjected to pre-washing, to remove any remaining residues following
20 removal of a glove previously made on the former. The formers are cleaned in mild acid /
   alkali and hot water. The formers are then dried by blowing air by blowers or air curtains or
   using ovens with the hot air having temperature above 1050C.
   4.      Coagulant Dipping
25 The cleaned dry former is immersed in a coagulant bath, which contains a 0 - 50% by
   weight solution of calcium nitrate. The coagulant also contains 0.1% - 5.0% by weight
   metallic stearates, suitable wetting agents (0.001-1.0%) and antifoaming agents (0.001
   1.0%). In some embodiments, coagulant dipping is not required. In the examples practiced
   here, the coagulant contained 2-4% calcium nitrate in addition to the above-indicated
30 metallic stearates (calcium stearate), wetting agent and antifoaming agent. The total time
   period of dipping into the coagulant was about -10 - 24 secs, including the time period of
   lowering and raising into the coagulant (starting from the time when the mould first touches
   the surface of the coagulant composition, to complete removal from the coagulant
   composition.) This time period can apply to the embodiments described herein more
35 generally, and should not be read as applying to these examples only.

                                                   -49
   5.       Drying
   The coagulant coated formers are dried in a hot air circulated oven at a temperature of about
    110 C to 1300C.
 5 6.       Dipping Step
   The former, coated with dried coagulant, is dipped into a tank containing the latex
   composition described in step 2 above. The composition is maintained at temperature of
   around 20 - 350C, and is constantly circulated in the tank to avoid creaming and settling of
   the solids. The former may be dipped into the composition for a total time period from the
10 commencement of lowering into the latex (i.e. when the mould first touches the latex
   composition), to the end of raising of the mould (i.e. when the mould is completely removed
   from the latex) of between 2 and 60 seconds, and preferably from about 2 to about 15
   seconds. In the examples practiced here, the lowering time period ("in") was about 2 to 6
   seconds, the dwell time was about 0 to 8 seconds, and the raising time ("out") was about 3
15 to 15 seconds, with the total time period being about 5 to 30 seconds. These time periods
   can apply more generally across all embodiments described herein, and should not be read
   as applying to these examples only.
   7.       Drying
20 The composition coated formers are gelled in a gelling oven at a temperature of about 100
   3000C and the duration of 2 - 300 seconds. In the examples practiced here, the drying
   conditions were 110 C for 60 seconds.
   8.       Pre-leaching
25 This step is optional. In the case of single dipping of elastomer, preleaching is completed as
   per this sequence. In case of multiple dipping of latex composition, this step is completed
   after the final dip into the latex composition followed by gelling. Pre-leaching is conducted
   by rinsing in warm water for a short period of time. The gelled film coating on the former is
   pre-leached in series of tanks at a temperature anywhere between ambient and 950C. In
30 the examples it was typically about 550C.
   9.       Second Dipping Step
   This step is optional, and is performed if a further layer of elastomeric film is to be formed on
   the initial layer of elastomeric film-forming composition. The gelled elastomeric film coating
35 on the former is dipped into a tank containing the latex composition, which contains the
   components specified for the given example (as prepared through step 2). The composition
   is maintained at temperature of around 20 - 400C, and is constantly circulated in the tank to
   avoid creaming and settling of solids. The former is dipped into the composition for a dwell

                                                   - 50
    time of 5 - 90 seconds. In the examples practiced here, the second dip dwell time was 8
    seconds.
    10.     Gelling / Pre Leaching / Beading
  5 This preleaching step is optional, and is performed as per this sequence in the case of
    multiple dipping of latex composition after forming a further layer of elastomeric film. The
    product following the second dipping step is subjected to gelling and pre-leaching and
    beading. In the case of on-line polymer coating the sequence is gelling / preleaching /
    polymer coating / beading.
10
    In the case of single dipping of elastomer, preleaching is completed as described above.
    The product following the dipping step is subjected to gelling and pre-leaching and beading.
    In the case of on-line polymer coating the sequence is gelling / preleaching / polymer coating
    / beading.
15
    The beading, drying and pre-leaching steps can be carried out in any order. The processes
    of beading and pre-cure leaching could be exchange depending on the quality of cuff
    beading.
20  11.     Curing
    The beaded glove is then cured. Curing was conducted at about 80'C - 1500C for about 15
    - 30 minutes, depending upon the film thickness and intended end product physical
    properties.
25  12.     Post-Leaching / Lubricant / Final Drying / Stripping / Tumbling
    In the case of a glove product, the cured elastomeric article may be subjected to one or
    more process steps including post-leaching, chlorination (noting that this could alternatively
    take place before curing), neutralisation, additional curing/surface treatment and/or lubricant
    application (e.g. through dipping into a lubricant composition). The gloves will be stripped
30  from the former and dried. Packaging may follow. Where additional curing or surface
    treatment is required, the gloves could be tumbled using hot air at a temperature around 80
    - 1200C for about 15 - 120 minutes.
    FORMERS
35  Conventional formers as produced and supplied by a commercial supplier were used for
    Examples 1 to 5. The formers used in Examples 6 to 7 were as described in detail in those
    examples.

                                                   -51
    GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR PRODUCTION OF FINGER COTS
    The same general procedure as described above for glove production can be used for the
    production of finger cots. The differences are the shape of the mould, and the dwell time in
    the coagulant and latex, which is halved (due to the shorter time period to reach complete
  5 immersion and complete removal from the coagulant/latex).
    TEST PROCEDURE
    For all of the Examples, tests were performed to determine the following properties of the
    films:
10  -        Modulus at 300%
    -        Modulus at 500%
    -       Tensile strength (MPa/Psi) (1 MPa = 145 Psi);
    -        Elongation (%); and
    -        Load at Break (N %).
15
    Tensile strength, stress at 300% and 500% modulus and elongation to break were
    measured by testing procedures conducted in accordance with ASTM D 412-06a (2013),
    based on the sample size set by the standard for gloves. The gloves were also tested for
    load at break (or force at break) measured in accordance with EN 455. The standards are
20  readily available. These tests can be applied to multilayer films and gloves (such as
    examination gloves for medical applications). In all tables of results, the values indicated for
    the tensile strength, modulus at 300% and modulus at 500% are in units of MPa, and the
    elongation (or elongation at break) and the load at break in %.
25  Defects were measured and the results represented in terms of defects per million (DPM) or
    AQL. Statistical control was conducted as per ISO 2859-1 (refer to Tables I and IIA of ISO
    2859-1), and quality control was performed as per ISO 13485.

    Analysis of Results:
    The produced low weight gloves have good physical properties.
  5 For the 2 gram glove, the before aging tensile strength values were between 30 MPa and 34
    MPa, and the after aging tensile strength values were between 35 MPa and 40 MPa.
    Considering the ASTM Standard Specification for Nitrile rubber examination gloves (ASTM
    D6319) minimum requirement of 14 MPa for examination gloves, these glove will pass the
    strength criteria comfortably even though they are low weight. Specifically, the gloves of the
10  present application do not meet the minimum thickness required in ASTM D6319, but
    regardless, these meet the tensile strength requirements. This is a significant achievement
    given the ultra-low thickness (below ASTM mandated levels for nitrile gloves).
    The before aging elongation at break is between 640% and 560% at unaged condition and
15  between 630% and 540% in the accelerated aging condition at 100 C, for 22 hrs. Against
    the ASTM Standard Specification for Nitrile rubber examination gloves (ASTM D6319)
    minimum requirement of 500% unaged and 400% after accelerated aging, the 2 gram gloves
    of Example 1 surpass the requirements. Again, the gloves of the present application do not
    meet the minimum thickness required in ASTM D6319, but regardless, these meet the
20  elongation at break requirements. This is a significant achievement given the ultra-low
    thickness (below ASTM mandated levels for nitrile gloves).
    The gloves produced showed no visible signs of defects or holes. The glove film surface
    was complete and cohesive across the entire glove.
25
    The above results may imply that low weight gloves with good properties may be produced.
    Because the gloves are low weight, less material is required to make these gloves, which
    allows them to be produced at lower cost.

   Analysis of Results:
   The produced low weight gloves have good physical properties.
   For the 2 gram glove, the unaged tensile strength values were between 24 MPa and 40
 5 MPa, and the after aging tensile strength values were between 33 MPa and 44 MPa.
   Considering the ASTM Standard Specification for Nitrile rubber examination gloves (ASTM
   D6319) minimum requirement of 14 MPa for examination gloves, these glove will pass the
   strength criteria even though they are low weight.
io The M300 value varies from 2 to 10 MPa and M500 values varies from 7 to 28 Mpa in the
   before aging condition. M300 value varies from 3 to 7 and M500 value varies from 10 to 23
   in the aged condition. This indicates that the film is strong enough to withstand the intended
   use.
15 The elongation at break is between 580% and 620% in the unaged condition, and the
   elongation at break is between 600% and 630% in the accelerated aging condition at 1000C,
   for 22 hrs. Against the ASTM Standard Specification for Nitrile rubber examination gloves
   (ASTM D6319) minimum requirement of 500% unaged and 400% after accelerated aging,
   the 2 gram gloves of Example 2 surpass the requirements.
20
   The gloves produced showed no visible signs of defects or holes. The glove film surface
   was complete and cohesive across the entire glove.
   The above results may imply that low weight gloves with good properties may be produced.
25 Because the gloves are low weight, less material is required to make these gloves, which
   allows them to be produced at lower cost.
   Example 3
30 Finger cots are produced using compositions A-E and G-J as indicated above, using the
   same coagulant and dipping parameters as indicated for the formation of gloves, with the
   exception that the mould is a finger-shaped mould, and the duration of the dipping step is:
        - In - 1-2 seconds; Dwell - 0 - 3 seconds; Out - 1 -5 seconds.

    A conventional former was used for the preparation of the 2.2 gram gloves of this example.
    The gloves were made via a single dip of the former into the coagulant composition
10  described below (in 6 seconds, dwell 4 seconds, out 6 seconds), and a single dip into the
    elastomeric film-forming composition set out above (in 5 seconds, dwell 6 seconds, out 7
    seconds.)
    The coagulant had the following properties:
15        -    8.5 - 10.5% calcium nitrate (which is dissolved),
          -    2.0 - 3.0% calcium stearate, with a particle size of 8-15 microns (as mould release

  32 samples of the 2.2 gram gloves were tested for tensile strength, modulus at 500%, and
  elongation. Before aging and after aging results were produced for each sample, where
  after aging was based on an accelerating aging test at 100 C for 22 hours. As the
5 production run progressed, the variation between samples reduced, and the glove properties
  became more uniform. The average results for the tested samples were as follows:

   In the production run, at the start, the glove tearing at the stripping station was high (17%,
   10%, 5%) and the number of un-stripped gloves going for second dipping (without the
   complete removal from first dip) was high, to the tune of 3%. With due corrective action with
 5 respect to the adjusting the percentage amount of anti-tack (mould release agent) in the
   coagulant and proper cleaning, the strip reject (i.e. the percentage of gloves that were not
   successfully stripped from the former) came down below 2%, and then below 1%. The
   number of un-stripped gloves going for second round of dipping was reduced from 3% to
   0.01%, and then down further to 0%.
10
   The auto stripping machine clamps were re-adjusted to avoid tearing during stripping. The
   cleaning brushes at former cleaning stage were adjusted to minimise the powder mark in the
   gloves.
15 A fine balance needs to be struck between the avoidance of a powder mark (from the
   particulate mould release agent) and easy stripping of the gloves.
   There was some inconsistency noticed in the barrier defect (pin hole defects) rate. The pin
   hole level in the early stages of the trial was higher, at about AQL 4.0 (as determined by ISO
20 2859-1), and then this slowly come down to less than AQL 2.5 and even less than AQL 1.0
   or at times less than AQL 0.65.
   Through the production scale trials, while it was possible to produce thin gloves with the
   required physical properties and without defects, some challenges were faced. These
25 included a lower-than-desired effectiveness rate for machine-stripping, and higher-than
   desired defect rates such as pin-hole defects and tearing.
   Example 6 - Former modification
30 The idea was developed to modify the former surface roughness in an attempt to improve
   the physical properties of the ultra-thin film gloves, and in particular the properties of batches
   (e.g. 500 glove batches) of ultra-thin film gloves.

    Glass formers having a highly uniform surface were considered, but these produce shiny
    films and require different systems for allowing the right amount of elastomeric film-forming
    composition to be picked up onto the former. Further, glass formers require lower speed
    dipping lines, which impacts on the viability of the product from a production cost
  5 perspective.
    Smooth glove-shaped formers denoted "1", "2" and "3"were sourced, based on ceramic
    formers with a glazed surface
    Gloves were made on these formers using the latex formulation of Example 1B set out
10  above, with the latex TSC being 13% and the pH 10.07. The coagulant had a calcium
    nitrate concentration of 9.38% by weight, and calcium stearate of 2.42% (based on a particle
    size of between 3-13 micron - that is, 95% of the particles were between 3 and 13 micron).
    Gloves of 1.8 grams in weight were produced, and these were subjected to the conventional
    testing protocols using Die D. The results are set out in the table below.

    Example 7 - Former roughness testing and control
     Further work was conducted to test the properties of ultra-thin film gloves produced using a
  5 more extensive range of formers.
    A ceramic former supplier was directed to produce formers with varying roughness levels.
    These formers were denoted formers V4 - V12. The formers were made from a ceramic
    material, and dried/cured to a so-called green-state or "biscuit state". The formers were then
1o  subjected to either sand blasting followed by high temperature firing (kiln firing), or sand (or
    ceramic compound) spraying followed by high temperature firing (kiln firing). Some formers
    were produced with ceramics containing agents for producing a more glassy surface during
    the firing step, to increase the smoothness of the surface. Between 3 and 5 of each former
    type were supplied for testing.
15
    Objective
    Tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the formers made with different
    degrees of sand blasting as a means to adjust the former roughness. Gloves produced on
    the formers were tested for the quality of film (barrier, powder mark, slippage of film resulting
20  in beading imperfection), difficulty to remove from the former and glossy nature of the glove
    end product.
    Assumptions and System Followed
    The trial formers V4 to V12 (between 2 and 5 of each) were fixed in a standard glove
25  production line and were subjected to a minimum 2 week testing period using a consistent
    coagulant and latex formulations to produce production-scale quantities of gloves using each
    former. A control former (conventional former design) was also used to produce
    comparative gloves based on the same formulations and processing conditions.
30  The glove products were collected former-wise, and type wise, and the results were
    analysed in these categories. The glove products were inspected in line with established
    quality system management in accordance with the relevant standards. Statistical control
    was conducted as per ISO 2859, and quality control was performed as per ISO 13485.

   Results
   a.      Barrier Function
   The barrier function test (pin hole detection test) was performed to assess the properties of
   the films produced on formers V4 to V12. Large numbers glove samples were produced
 5 from each former (noting that there were between 3-5 formers of each type) and analysed
   for holes at the palm (HOLE P or HP), at the cuff (HOLE CF or HCF), at the finger crotch
   (HOLE CR or HCR), and at the fingertip area (HOLE F or HF). The sample size for each
   former was: V4-360 gloves; V5-540 gloves; V6-900 gloves; V7-540 gloves; V8-900 gloves;
   V9-480 gloves; V10-900 gloves; Vl1-900 gloves; V12-900 gloves. The results are

   For the V8, V10 and V12 formers, the total barrier defects are 11, 5, 5 respectively - i.e. for
   V8 there are 11/900 pieces (12,222 DPM), V10 - 5/900 pcs (5556 DPM) and V12-5/900 pcs
   (5556 DPM). In total, there are 21/2700 pcs (7777 DPM), where DPM means defects per
 5 million pieces.
   However, comparing these results to tear defects (results shown below), it will be noted that
   the tear defects obtained were extremely high for these three formers - V8-67/900 (74,0444
   DPM); V10-85/900 (94,444 DPM); V12 - 136/900 (151,111 DPM).
10
   The tear defects were caused by the stripping machine due to the slipping and/or the
   inability for the auto-stripping machine to grip the gloves. Another issue is the high surface
   gloss of gloves produced from some of the former types.

   99/6420 - 1.54% (15420 DPM).

10  c.        Powder Mark
    In relation to the visual appearance of the glove, a key defect that can be detected
    (particularly in coloured products) is a powder mark, in which residual powder adheres to the
    glove by accumulation on the former and later transfer onto the glove to leave a white patch
    or mark. In dark coloured products powder marks can be very obvious, and this leads to
15  rejection of the gloves by customers.
    The presence or absence of a powder mark was studied in the gloves produced on all the
    trial formers and compared to the control former following conventional inspection and
    recording procedures. The results of the powder mark testing were as follows:

    There are two types are former with a much more shiny polished surface than the other
    formers. In these two cases, there were no powder marks detected across the 1800
    checked pieces.
  5
    The inventors have postulated that the anti-tack material used in the coagulant gets
    accumulated in the micro-sized crevices of the former surface and anti-tack powder material
    is then transferred to the glove once the accumulation is substantial. Controlling the
    roughness of the former may enable a manufacturer to reduce the accumulation of anti-tack
10  material and hence powder marks may be avoided.
    The table includes in the second last line the overall average for all the trial formers put
    together. The defect level as a % of tested gloves was 0.45%, compared to the control
    former results of 1.73% powder mark defects.
15
    d.      Glossiness or shining of gloves
    The glove samples produced on each former were assessed for surface gloss, and the
    number of gloves considered defective for excess glossiness was determined for each
    former type. The results are set out below:
20
    Former     V4         V5       V6         V7      V8       V9         V10         Vi1     V12

    rate
     Formers V6, V8, V1 0 and V1 2 were more glossy than formers V4, V5, V7, V9 and V11.
    Grouping these together and comparing the results by reference to defects per million
    (DPM), the following results are obtained:
25

                                                   - 67

    The results show that the degree of gloss of former surface has an impact on the gloss level
    of the glove product, amongst other things. Whilst this may be a detraction for some
    products, a benefit with a glossy surface is that residues do not stick easily to the former
  5 surface, making the former easier to clean.
    In glove production, a glossy glove surface is undesirable. Glossy gloves give the consumer
    the impression that the glove is slippery, and will result in slipping of items held by a gloved
    hand, particularly in applications where there is water contact (e.g. washing).
10
    Even where a film produces a good quality barrier (in terms of pin-hole defects, and high
    tensile strength), the visual appearance and slipperiness associated with a low roughness
    former detracts from the selection of a former with extremely low surface roughness for
    producing gloves (either thin film or otherwise).
15
    e.      Film strength
    Tests were performed on the tensile strength of the films/gloves produced using the former
    types. M500 and elongation at break (%) were also measured. The results were as follows:

    While the highest tensile strength was obtained for the V12 type former, as noted above, this
    former produced gloves that are excessively glossy and with higher slip properties. It was
    observed that high surface roughness results in low tensile strength and low surface

   slipperiness, a combination of former roughness characteristics at various points was
   selected, to produce a new former V1 3 as outlined in further detail below.
   f.      Coagulant Coating
 5 The inventors observed during the test work that there was improved coagulant coating on
   the surface of the test formers compared to conventional formers, and the coagulant was
   able to stay within the crevices of the mould and remain as a coating on the entire dipped
   portion of the mould surface. This is important for even pickup and even coating of the
   elastomeric film-forming composition.

   q.       Powder residue on the former
   The inventors observed during the test work that there was a greater tendency for powdery
   residue to build up on formers V4 and V6.
15 h.      Slip down at the wet gel stage
   The inventors also observed during the test work that a more glossy former surface could
   lead to a greater tendency for the elastomeric film-forming composition to "slip down" the
   former surface from the top of the cuff area towards the body of the glove during the wet gel
   stage. The inventors then developed a cuff band area at a one end (the upper end in the
20 former-dipping orientation) within the cuff zone having a visually-observable roughened or
   scored surface. The cuff band area is more textured (rougher or more scored) than the
   remainder of the cuff portion of the former. Providing this band gave an improvement in the
   gripping of the wet gel to the mould and avoided slippage of the gel-state film down the
   former. During later stages of the production of the glove, the cuff band area is beaded or
25 rolled to form a beaded opening to the glove.
   i.      Slip down after pre-leaching
   Pre-leaching during glove production is intended to remove soluble material in the wet gel
   and reduce the presence of contaminants. Improper removal of such contaminants will
30 affect the performance of the gloves on usage or during storage. When the wet gel coated
   formers travel through the pre-leaching station, they are subjected to direct fluid forces
   acting on the former and gel by the movement of the formers inside the pre-leach water
   bath. If the adhesion of the gel to the former is not good enough, the film will be distorted.
35 The inventors found that there was a greater tendency for slipping to during this stage for
   formers of higher glossiness - V10 and V12. In the worst case, such slippage is observed
   by the presence of a fold or pleat in the glove surface. Accordingly, the surface roughness is

                                                  - 69
   preferably controlled to ensure a balance of properties including tensile strength compared
   to avoidance of slip-down during/after pre-leaching.
            Uneven bead - bead tear
 5 Slippage on the former as per (h) and (i) above can then lead to problems with the beading
   stage. If the glove length is not long enough due to those factors, then there may be
   insufficient glove cuff length to allow for complete beading to occur - leaving a glove with
   either an incomplete bead, or no bead at all, which may appear as an apparent tear in the
   bead area. The difficulty of bead formation is due to the slippage of the wet gel (film).
10 Accordingly, the surface roughness is preferably controlled to ensure a balance of properties
   including tensile strength on the one hand, and low defect rate due to imperfect beading.
   k.       Auto stripping
   In commercial glove manufacturing, for cost and quality control reasons, it is important for
15 gloves to be capable of being stripped using conventional auto-stripping equipment with
   reasonably high stripping efficiency (i.e. rate of gloves successfully stripped by machine,
   without damage). The bead is used by the auto stripping equipment to allow glove removal
   from the former. If the bead is incomplete, this has a flow-on effect on auto-stripping
   resulting in miss-stripping of the glove, and/or tearing of the glove during stripping. Other
20 glove qualities (e.g. areas of weakness which lead to tears during stripping) may also have
   an impact on this stage of the process. Accordingly, account needs to be taken of the
   impact that the former surface roughness and other factors have on the stripping stage of
   the production process. The inventors have found that controlling the former surface
   roughness allows for auto-stripping to be achieved at a sufficiently high level of stripping
25 efficiency, without overly compromising tensile strength for the low thickness gloves.
   Stripping efficiency can be at least 90%, at least 95% or at least 98%.
   I.       Rubber residue on the former
   Severe adhesion of the glove to the former can also result in improper stripping, and this can
30 lead to residual glove material/rubber residue remaining on the former. This can be a
   particular problem in the formation of ultra-thin-film gloves, due to the lower film thickness
   and cohesiveness of the film, leading to a high degree of rubber residue remaining. This
   was found to be a significant problem when attempting to make ultra-thin gloves on
   conventional formers. By changing the roughness of the former (compared to a
35 conventional former), this problem was found to be significantly reduced.

  m.       Crotch Hole
  Crotch hole, when present, is a serious defect and an indication of the film quality in the
  crotch (between finger) area. Crotch hole is an indication that the film in that zone is weak
  and this can result in premature failure of the glove. The inventors found from the data
5 collected on the trial formers that crotch hole was nil in the V5 former.

   Touching refers to the situation where the latex-coated former (with the latex in the gel or
1o dried film form) touches something during the passage through the production stages
   (stations), causing the film to contain a small or large rupture. While care is taken to avoid
   external factors causing such touching defects, these can occur, and such gloves are
   considered to be defective. The stages or stations where this can occur include pre
   leaching, beading, ovens (curing and/or drying ovens), surface treatment, post-leaching or
15 otherwise.
   Conclusions:
   1.       There are some positive and negative aspects that come from selecting formers with
   different surface roughness levels.
20 2.       Some vital functions such as overall barrier qualities, powder mark, tensile strength
   and cleanliness of the former are better with formers such as V1 0 and V1 2.
   3.       Some functions such as shininess, coating of coagulant, bead formation and ease of
   stripping are better with formers V4, V7.
   4.       Ideally, a roughness (Sz) that gives the right balance of such properties should be
25 selected.
   5.       In the consolidated results table, the most preferred and commercially viable
   attributes were marked with a triangle sign.
   6.       Following from point 5, it was observed that there were different preferences for the
   ultimate former surface roughness for different zones of the former/glove product. In the
30 case of holes at the palm (HP), two types of former are most preferred - V4 and V11. For
   holes in the cuff (HCF), V4 is preferred (note that even though V8 and V12 provided the
   same results, they were considered to be less desired due to the uneven coagulant pick-up,
   uneven beading/tearing, miss-stripping and very high level of cuff tear). For holes in the
   finger crotch (HCR), V5 is preferred, and the achievement of a zero pin-hole defects level in
35 that zone was very desirable. (As an aside, if the surface properties of V5 are present in a
   mould in the finger crotch zone only, the presence of a high palm hole defect rate is
   irrelevant.) Finally, for HF zone, V5 and V6 type former roughness is most preferred.

                                                  - 75
    7.      The idea was then developed of having a former with zones of different roughness
    tailored to the needs of that zone. It was anticipated, based on the results presented in this
    Example, that having zones of the former of different roughness values would give a product
    having a minimum number of the types of defects that are most problematic for that
  5 particular zone. Therefore, controlling the former roughness would assist in achieving an
    acceptably low defect rate for ultra-thin gloves.
    8.      A former denoted V1 3 was devised having the surface roughness in each of 4 zones
    (P, C, BF and F) that was selected based on the best results for that zone in the preliminary
    testing work on formers V4-V1 2. Former V1 3 was also designed with a cuff band area. An
10  additional four sets of formers having similar properties in each zone to V13, but with one or
    two modifications, were also devised for comparison purposes. Former V17 contains the
    same surface properties in each zone as V1 3, but with a sharper V meeting point between
    the fingers, to improve strength in that area. The features of the formers are summarised as
    follows:

    The former manufacturer was directed to produce the formers having the selected properties
    (selected from test formers V4 to V12), in each of the zones indicated in the table above.
    Four formers of each type were produced, and gloves were made on each of the types of
20  the formers V13 to V17 as outlined below. The production of the formers required masking
    of zones of the former for performing the sand (ceramic compound) blasting/sand (ceramic

   compound) spraying operations to produce the target roughness properties for each zone
   separately, although where the zones were based on the same former properties (e.g. palm
   and cuff both V4), those zones were treated together. A cuff band area was also created in
   the formers, which contains etching creating a visible band area around the former with a
 5 higher surface roughness than the adjacent cuff zone.
   In relation to former V1 7, this was produced in a manner consistent with former V1 3, but with
   a sharper crotch area to minimize the occurrence of weak spots in the finger crotch. The
   roughness of the zones was otherwise designed to be similar to the roughness of the zones
10 of former V13.
   The new formers were tested for their surface roughness in each zone. Gloves were
   produced on each of the formers using the latex formulation set out in the table below.
   Gloves with size medium of a nominal 2.2 grams in weight were produced, having a
15 thickness of about 0.04mm at the palm.
