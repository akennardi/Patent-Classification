Field of Invention
     The present invention relates to a security technology, in particular to an
authentication method based on mouse behaviors.
Description of Related Arts
     With the popularization of electronic commerce, Internet banks and online
electronic payment are gradually accepted and favored by netizens. However, the
security of these payment platforms is not optimistic, identity embezzlement
situations frequently occur, the credibility problem is widely concerned and secure
identity authentication becomes a fundamental premise of guaranteeing electronic
transaction security. In order to prevent passwords from being stolen, some Internet
banks and electronic commerce payment platforms adopt technical methods such as
security controls, hardware aids and dynamic soft keyboards, wherein so-called soft
keyboards are not real keyboards but are displayed on "screens". Soft keyboards are
virtual keyboards which are simulated through software and clicked by using mice to
input characters, for the purpose of preventing Trojans from recording passwords
which are input through real keyboards. Generally, soft keyboards are commonly seen
at places that accounts and passwords are required to be input on websites of some
banks. Dynamic soft keyboards can resist against attacks such as keyboard recorders,
spyware, and malicious machine registration. However, soft keyboards cannot prevent
Trojans with screenshot functions, shoulder surfing behaviors and the like.
     In view of these, how to improve security of identity authentication through
dynamic soft keyboards becomes a problem which needs to be urgently solved by one

                                             2

     In view of the above-mentioned disadvantages in the prior art, the purpose of the
present invention is to provide an authentication method based on mouse behaviors,
which is used for solving the security problem existing in the dynamic soft keyboard
technology in the prior art.
     In order to realize the above-mentioned purpose and other related purposes, the
present invention provides an authentication method based on mouse behaviors. The
authentication method based on mouse behaviors comprises: acquiring mouse
behavior data in a process that a preset user inputs a password by using a dynamic soft
keyboard; performing calculation processing to the mouse behavior data to obtain

using a preset model to determine a user behavior pattern of the user.
     Alternatively, the authentication method based on mouse behaviors further
comprises: receiving the mouse behavior data in the process of inputting the password
by using the dynamic soft keyboard, and performing user identity classified
authentication to the received mouse behavior data according to the user behavior
pattern.
     Alternatively, a specific implementation process of performing user identity
classified authentication to the received mouse behavior data according to the user
behavior pattern comprises: processing the received mouse behavior data by adopting
a K majority voting method in combination with the user behavior pattern to
determine whether authentication passes.
     Alternatively, the dynamic soft keyboard comprises an out-of-order keyboard
generated randomly.
     Alternatively, the characteristic selection algorithm comprises a plus-L minus-R

                                             3
selection algorithm.
     Alternatively, the characteristic values comprise at least one of keystroke entering
speed, keystroke leaving speed and key search time.
     Alternatively,   the  characteristic   values  further  comprise     moving   speed,
acceleration and moving angle value.
     Alternatively, the preset model comprises a support vector machine model.
     Alternatively, a specific implementation process of performing processing to the
best characteristic vector by using the preset model to determine the user behavior
pattern comprises: performing normalization processing to the best characteristic
vector; equally dividing the best characteristic vector into a plurality of groups of
subset data, and aiming at each group of subset data, by using the subset data as a
validation set and using other subset data as a training set, respectively obtaining a
model parameter and a classifier performance index; and determining the user
behavior pattern according to the model parameter corresponding to a maximum
value of a plurality of obtained classifier performance indexes.
     As described above, the authentication method based on mouse behaviors
provided by the present invention has the following beneficial effects: user identity
authentication when mouse actions are non-fixed trajectories can be realized; since
new characteristic values such as keystroke entering speed, keystroke leaving speed
and key search time are used in establishment and authentication processes and
traditional characteristic values are refined, the authentication accuracy is improved.
The technical solution of the present invention is particularly suitable for dynamic soft
keyboard application scenarios, and can be used as an assistant means for traditional
username/password authentication mechanisms.

     The present invention provides an authentication method based on mouse
 behaviors, which is particularly suitable for dynamic soft keyboard application
 scenarios. In one embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 1, the authentication method
 based on mouse behaviors comprises:
     In step Sl, mouse behavior data in a process that a preset user inputs a password
by using a dynamic soft keyboard are acquired. In one embodiment, when a user
inputs a password by using a designed dynamic soft keyboard, data generated from
mouse actions during the user inputs the password are acquired and stored. For

                                             5
example, action data of the user are recorded by using the existing open-source
software RUI tool, and a format of recorded data tuples is <t, x, y, action-type>. The
data format is as shown in the following table.

        38                1.456            Released Left         267              87
     Record tuples which do not comply with rules and record tuples which are
obviously abnormal may be deleted and not used as mouse behavior data. The
dynamic soft keyboard comprises an out-of-order keyboard generated randomly. By
adopting the out-of-order keyboard generated randomly, the security of authentication
can be improved.
     In step S2, calculation processing is performed to the mouse behavior data to
obtain characteristic values, and the best characteristic vector is selected by using a
characteristic selection algorithm. With respect to the design of characteristic vectors
(a characteristic vector consists of characteristic values), in consideration of a
dynamic soft keyboard application scenario, by analyzing characteristics of mouse
data, it is found that two actions that the user operates a mouse to search a target key
and leave the target key form major behavior trajectories, and therefore two types of
behaviors, i.e., keystroke and key search, are defined. A keystroke behavior refers to a
behavior that the user operates the mouse to click a certain character key on the soft
keyboard. A key search behavior refers to a behavior that the user operates the mouse
to search a certain character key on the soft keyboard. On this basis, a series of new
characteristic values such as entering speed, leaving speed and key search time are

                                            6
defined and used as supplements to traditional characteristic values (such as average
speed, acceleration and deviation distance). Entering speed is denoted as Vi and is
defined as speed that the mouse enters a certain key before keystroke is started.
Leaving speed is denoted as Vout and is defined as speed that the mouse leaves the key
after keystroke is ended. Entering speed and leaving speed are both calculated by
usingposition information and duration of three sampling points before/after clicking,
and the duration is three sampling periods. Since the duration is very short, the mouse
trajectories in this time interval may be approximated as straight lines for processing.
Besides, in consideration of that the same character fragments exist in a key-in
sequence, a key search time ratio Rto for the same characters, i.e., a ratio of time for
search the same characters in the same character fragments, is defined. Due to the
influence of human memory ability, this value is mostly smaller than 1. In one
embodiment, alternatively, the characteristic values comprise at least one of keystroke
entering speed, keystroke leaving speed and key search time. The characteristic values
may further comprise moving speed, acceleration, moving angle value and the like. In
one embodiment, characteristic values as shown in the following table may be
obtained through simple mathematical calculation.

     Characteristic values may be extracted in combination with a Cumulative
Distribution Function CDF and a plus-L minus-R characteristic selection algorithm.
The dimensions of the characteristic vectors are not the more the better. Categories of
characteristic vectors which do not have strong distinguishability not only increase the
detection workload, but also possibly increase the misjudgment rate. In probability
statistics, there is the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) which is used for
describing probability distribution of a real number random variable, i.e., the
probability that a random variable is smaller than or equal to a certain numerical value.
The cumulative distribution function is statistically collected by using an MATLAB
tool, so as to intuitively compare the distinguishability and stability of each
characteristic    value and select      out characteristic values with more scattered
distribution, i.e., low CDF curve overlapping rate.
     In one embodiment, the characteristic selection algorithm comprises a plus-L
minus-R Selection (LRS) algorithm, including the following two forms: <1> the
algorithm starts from an empty set, firstly L characteristics are added at each round
and then R characteristics are removed to enable an evaluation function value to be
optimal (L>R); and <2>the algorithm starts from a complete set, firstly R
characteristics are removed and then L characteristics are added to enable an

                                              8
evaluation function value to be optimal (L<R). With respect algorithm evaluation, the
plus-L minus-R selection algorithm combines sequential forward selection and
sequential backward selection thoughts, and the selection of L and R is a key of the
algorithm. In one embodiment, in consideration of that the total dimensions of all
characteristics are not great, an interval range of L and R is fixed to be [1, 8], values
of L and R are determined within this range, we enumerate L-R values, the evaluation
function    compares     classification   accuracy   and   makes     evaluation   by    using
classification accuracy, finally the best characteristic vector is selected, and the best
characteristic   vector comprises 9 categories of characteristic values and is a
17-dimension characteristic vector. Components of the characteristic vector are as
shown in the following table:

     In step S3, process the best characteristic vector by using a preset model to
determine a user behavior pattern of the user. Specifically, the best characteristic
vector consists of a plurality of characteristic values. The best characteristic vector
processed by a preset model. A specific implementation process to determine the user

                                              9
behavior pattern comprises the following operations: normalization processing the
best characteristic vector; the best characteristic vector is equally divided into a
plurality of groups of subset data, and aiming at each group of subset data, the subset
data is usd as a validation set and other subset data are used as training set, a model
parameter and a classifier performance index are respectively obtained; and the user
behavior pattern is determined according to the model parameter corresponding to a
maximum value of the plurality of classifier perfonnance indexes. In one embodiment,
the preset model comprises a support vector machine model. The Support Vector
Machine (SVM) model is a supervised learning model and is usually used for
performing pattern recognition, classification, and regression analysis. The mouse
behavior characteristics of the user are processed by the SVM model, which
comprises the following operation: firstly, normalization processing is performed to
the characteristic vector to normalize data to an interval [0, 1]. In order to prevent
over-learning and under-learning states from occurring, 5-CV cross validation is used
for selecting a penalty parameter c and a kernel function parameter g in the SVM
algorithm to improve the classifier authentication accuracy. Specifically, a raw
training set is divided into five groups, each subset is used as a validation set, and
other four subsets are used as a training set, five models are obtained, and a mean
value of the classification accuracy rate of the final validation sets of the five models
is used as a classifier performance index under 5-CV cross validation. A specific
process of establishing a user behavior pattern is as follow:
     Input: acquire mouse behavior data in a process that a preset user inputs a
password by using a dynamic soft keyboard, Data = {DI, D2 ... D,}, Di=<dj1 , di 2 ... di.>,
i:l-P, where p is the sample number acquired and n is number of dimensions of
characteristic vector, i.e., it denotes that a characteristic vector consists of n
characteristic values. Already known are Label = {L 1,L 2,...L,}, L; E {+1, -1}; penalty
parameter range c E [2 ^(-1 0 ), 2 ^10]; and kernel function parameter range g E [2 A(-1 0 ),
2^10].
     Output: best penalty parameter best, best kernel function parameter bestg.

                                             10
      Steps:
       1) [0, 1] normalization processing is performed to the characteristic vector by
using a formula f: x -> y = (x - Xmin)/(Xmax - Xmin)           , where xmin=min(x) and
xmax=max(x).
      2) An RBF kernel function is used.
      3) The characteristic vector is equally divided into five groups and the following
steps are repeated: one group of subset data is selected as a validation set, other four
groups are used as a training set, an interval value step=2 is taken in given ranges of c
and g to obtain a mean value of five classification accuracy values corresponding to
each (cj, gj) and the mean value is used as a classifier performance index Accj under
this parameter.
      4) Maximum Acck=max {Accj} is selected, so bestc=ck and bestg=gk.
      For example, for the sake of convenience in description, the dimensions of the
characteristic vector are simplified to three dimensions, e.g., Data= {D1 , D 2 ... Ds}
five samples are respectively D1=<1.1, 2.2, 3.0>, D2=<I.0, 2.1, 3.2>, D3=<1.2, 2.0,
3.1>, D4=<2.0, 2.9, 4.0>, D5=<1.9, 3.0, 3.8>, andLabel= {L1 , L2 ... Ls}, Li=+1,
L 1=+1, L1=+1, L1=-1, L 1 =-1. Normalization processing is performed to obtain
Data'={Di', D2 '...Ds'}, Dl'=<O.1, 0.2, 0>, D 2 '=<0, 0.1, 0.2>, D 3 '=<0.2, 0, 0.1>,
D 4 '=<1, 0.9, 1>, D5 '=<0.9, 1, 0.8>. According to given ranges c E [2A(10), 2A10], g
 E [2^(-10), 2^10], step=2, setting cj and gjto respectively {2^(-10), 2^(-8)...2^8,
2A10}, aiming at each pair (cj, gj), Data' are divided into five groups, each Di' is a
subset Si, any one Si is used as a validation set, other Si are used as a training set, and
anaverage performance index Accjof an SVM classifiercorresponding to a parameter
is obtained. Finally max {Accj} is selected and the corresponding (cj, gj) is the
required SVM parameter value.
      In one embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the authentication method based on
mouse behaviors further comprises the following step: in step S4, the mouse behavior
data in the process of inputting the password by using the dynamic soft keyboard are

                                             11
received, and user identity classified authentication is performed to the received
mouse behavior data according to the user behavior pattern. In one embodiment, a
specific implementation process of performing user identity classified authentication
to the received mouse behavior data according to the user behavior pattern comprises
the following operation: processing is performed to the received mouse behavior data
by adopting a K majority voting method in combination with the user behavior pattern
to determine whether authentication passes. In one embodiment, a rule of performing
classification by using the majority voting method is defined as that: mouse behavior
data in a process of input a password by using a dynamic soft keyboard are received
and used as data to be tested, the SVM classification obtained in the above-mentioned
pattern establishment process is used to test each sample of data for x times; if the
classifier judges that times that the sample is a positive label exceed k*x times
(0.5<k<1), the sample is marked as a positive label; and otherwise, the sample is
marked as a negative label. This process is called as the k majority voting method. In
experiments, a k value range is (0.5, 1), a progressive increase interval value is
allowedto be 0.05, i.e., k is respectively valued as {0.55, 0.60.. .0.95, 1.00} to perform
authentication, and thereby finally the best k value is obtained. In one embodiment, a
specific process of authentication is as follow:
     One or more mouse behavior data generated from use of a dynamic soft keyboard
are received and corresponding best characteristic vector TestData ={TD 1,TD 2 ... TDq}
is obtained, whereTDi=<tdn1 ,tdi2.. tdin>, q is number of mouse behavior data and n is
dimensions of characteristic vector (i.e., number of characteristic values). A parameter
of SVM classifiers is <bestc, bestg>; and a parameter of the majority voting method is
k. Finally an authentication result of each mouse behavior data is obtained as
Predictedlabel={PLI, PL 2... PLp}, PLiE {+1, -11.
     Steps:
     1) Positive and negative label counters are allowed to be initially 0, respectively
denoted as Num, 1 =0, Num.1=0.

                                              12
     2) x trained SVM classifiers <bestc,bestg> are respectively used for testing
sample data for x times; in each time of testing, the characteristic vector TestData is
used as an input of the SVM classifier; if an output of the classifier is PLi =+1,
Num 1 ++; and if PLi   = -1, Num1++.
     3) Values of the positive and negative label counters are judged: if Num.i>k*x, a
final value of PLi is +1, it indicates that the corresponding mouse behavior data passes
authentication of the user, and the sample is marked as a positive label; otherwise, a
final value of PLi is -1, it indicates that the corresponding mouse behavior data does
not pass authentication of the user and the sample is marked as a negative label.
     In one embodiment, as indicated by repetitive tests by adopting the technical
solution of the present invention, the authentication accuracy of the technical solution
averagely can reach 97.33%. The k majority voting method is used for performing
authentication, FAR and FRR values are obtained through validation by using test
data, and usually FRR (False Rejection Rate) and FAR (False Acceptance Rate) are
two main parameters          which are     used   for evaluating recognition  algorithm
performance. Standardly appellation of FRR, which is commonly called as False
Rejection Rate, is FNMR (False Non-Match Rate). FNMR may be commonly
understood as a probability of "considering fingerprints which should be successfully
matched with each other as fingerprints which cannot be matched with each other".
Standardly appellation of FAR, which is generally called as False Acceptance Rate, is
FMR (False Match Rate). FMR is the most important parameter which is used for
evaluating the performance of the fingerprint recognition algorithm. RMR may be
commonly understood as a probability of "considering fingerprints which should be
not matched with each other as fingerprints which are matched with each other". In
one embodiment, authentication effects obtained by using new characteristic values
(including a series of new characteristic values such as entering speed, leaving speed
and key search time ratio) and without using the new characteristic values are
compared. As indicated by results, after the new characteristic values are added, FAR
and FRR values are decreased, i.e., it indicates that the authentication effects are

                                              13
improved.
     To sum up, the authentication method based on mouse behaviors provided by the
present invention can realize user identity authentication when mouse actions are
non-fixed trajectories. Since new characteristic values such as keystroke entering
speed, keystroke leaving speed and key search time are used in establishment and
authentication processes     and traditional characteristic    values are refined, the
authentication accuracy is improved. The technical solution of the present invention is
particularly suitable for dynamic soft keyboard application scenarios, and can be used
as an assistant means for traditional username/password authentication mechanisms.
Therefore, the present invention effectively overcomes various disadvantages in the
prior art and thus has a great industrial utilization value.
