Abstract
 This device is a folded metal plate used as an interface on a range of proprietary ambulance
stretchers to secure a medical device or transport bed to the stretcher such that, due to its
unique locking clamps, it does not modify the stretcher, yet it is safe during transport because
it is compliant with ambulance transport regulations. It may or may not have a hinge thus
allowing it to fold for storage.
