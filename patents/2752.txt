        DRUG DELIVERY DEVICE FOR PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS
                                        Field of the Invention
            The present invention relates to a dual-chamber pack with a first chamber
   comprising a container; and a second chamber comprising a reservoir, a biphasic
 5 connector, a plunger, and a plug with a breakable polymeric membrane. The container of
   the first chamber is prefilled with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle and the reservoir
   of the second chamber is prefilled with a solid composition of an active ingredient,
   wherein the solid composition of the active ingredient is mixed with the pharmaceutically
   acceptable vehicle to form a liquid pharmaceutical composition upon activation of the
10 dual-chamber pack.
                                    Background of the Invention
            Liquid pharmaceutical compositions are convenient dosage forms for oral
   administration particularly for geriatric and pediatric patients in comparison to solid
   dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. They are easy to administer which leads to
15 enhanced patient compliance. Additionally, liquid pharmaceutical compositions provide a
   unique advantage of having a flexible dosing regimen. Liquid pharmaceutical
   compositions are also preferred over solid dosage forms in case of high-dose drugs
   considering the size and shape requirements imposed by various regulatory authorities
   worldwide and the swallowability of the dosage form. Liquid pharmaceutical
20 compositions are generally in the form of a solution or a suspension, wherein the active
   ingredient remains in the dissolved or dispersed form in a pharmaceutically acceptable
   vehicle such as water.
            However, some of the active ingredients remain unstable in the presence of
   pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as water when stored for a prolonged period of
25 time. To overcome this, the active ingredients are mostly formulated as a dry powder
   which is to be reconstituted with the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle at the time of
   administration. The reconstitution is done by the end user, wherein the dry powder is
   dissolved or suspended in household pre-boiled and cooled water to form a liquid
   pharmaceutical composition. Alternatively, the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or
30 purified water is supplied separately along with the bottle having the dry powder. This
   conventional pack lacks patient compliance and may lead to contamination due to
                                                   1

   improper quality of water. Further, there remains a possibility of dosing errors if the
   pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or water is not added to the marked level.
           U.S. Patent No. 3,156,369; U.S. Patent No. 3,603,469; U.S. Patent No. 3,840,136;
   and U.S. Patent No. 4,982,875 disclose the use of dual-chamber packs for separately
 5 storing two compositions in two compartments which can be admixed at the time of use.
   The two compartments are separated by a breakable membrane which is ruptured by the
   depression of a plunger so that the one composition gets released into another and is
   mixed. However, there remains a possibility that the membrane fragments may get
   detached and fall into the final product. This may lead to undesirable contamination and
10 can pose serious health hazards. Furthermore, the dual-chamber packs disclosed in the
   prior art have a limited capacity for the compartments which may not be suitable for high
   dose drugs or for drugs which require chronic administration. Also, the liquid composition
   may get permeated into the solid composition across the membrane during storage which
   can lead to the agglomeration of the solid composition. This may result in poor flow of the
15 solid composition, thus affecting the content uniformity of the final product. Also, the
   liquid composition on permeation can affect the stability of moisture-sensitive drugs.
           The present invention provides a patient compliant dual-chamber pack with a
   significant improvement over the prior art and which fulfills the unmet need of
   incorporating variety of drugs. The present dual-chamber pack can be suitable for any
20 class of drugs including the high-dose drugs, drugs requiring chronic administration, or
   moisture-sensitive drugs. Multi-dose liquid compositions can be conveniently
   administered using this pack. Further, the plunger used in the pack of the instant invention
   is designed in a way such that the breakable membrane remains adhered to the plug at the
   time of activation and membrane fragments do not fall into the final product. During
25 activation, the pack ensures that the final product remains safe for the use of patients. The
   pack also ensures that the solid composition is completely released into the liquid
   composition thereby maintaining the content uniformity of the final product. Further, the
   pack also ensures that there is no permeation of moisture into the chamber having solid
   composition comprising the active ingredient, and the stability of the active ingredient
30 remains unaffected during storage.

                                      Summary of the Invention
            The present invention relates to a dual-chamber pack with a first chamber
   comprising a container; and a second chamber comprising a reservoir, a biphasic
   connector, a plunger, and a plug with a breakable polymeric membrane. The container of
 5 the first chamber is prefilled with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle and the reservoir
   of the second chamber is prefilled with a solid composition of an active ingredient,
   wherein the solid composition of the active ingredient is mixed with the pharmaceutically
   acceptable vehicle to form a liquid pharmaceutical composition upon activation of the
   dual-chamber pack. The pack allows the end-users ease of dispensing with only a few
10 simple steps required for reconstitution. The pack is suitable for drugs required for chronic
   administration, high-dose drugs, and moisture-sensitive drugs. The pack ensures that the
   solid composition falls completely into the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle thereby
   maintaining the content uniformity. The pack also ensures that final product remains free
   of any contamination from the pack components and is safe to the end-users. Further, the
15 pack ensures the stability of the active ingredient during storage.

                   upper end;
           b)      a second chamber comprising:
25                 (i)      a reservoir (1) adapted to fit into a plunger (2) prefilled with a solid
                            composition of an active ingredient; the plunger (2) is further

30         (c)     prefilling a reservoir (1) of the second chamber with a solid composition;
                                                    6

           (d)     fixing the biphasic connector (5) into the reservoir (1);
           (e)     fixing the plunger (2) in the biphasic connector (5);
           (f)     mounting the plug (3) onto the plunger of the biphasic connector (5) to
                   form the second chamber;
 5         (g)     mounting the second chamber onto the opening (7) of the container (8) of
                   the first chamber;
           (h)     activating the dual-chamber pack by screwing the reservoir (1) of the
                   second chamber so that the plunger partially ruptures the circumference of

10         (i)     removing the second chamber and replacing it with a cap (9); and
           (j)     shaking the container (8) to allow the mixing of the solid composition with
                   the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle to obtain the liquid pharmaceutical
                   composition.
           According to one embodiment of the above aspect, the reservoir of the second
15 chamber is prefilled with the solid composition in a volume greater than about 40 cc. In a
   preferred embodiment of above aspect, the reservoir of the second chamber is prefilled
   with the solid composition in a volume ranging from about 40 cc to about 500 cc.
           According to another embodiment of above aspect, the biphasic connector has a
   tamper evident band on the side connected to the container of the first chamber and

   evident band is removed first to start the activation process.
           The active ingredient used to form a solid composition of the present invention
   may be present in a form to provide an immediate release, delayed release or an extended
   release. The solid composition may comprise of an active ingredient directly mixed with
25 one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Alternatively, the solid composition
   may comprise of cores of an active ingredient, optionally admixed with one or more
   pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The cores may be coated with an immediate
   release or an extended release coating. The immediate release coating may comprise a
   film-forming agent to mask the taste of bitter active ingredients or to improve the stability.
30 Said coating remains insoluble in the reconstituted liquid pharmaceutical composition
   during storage and releases the active ingredient only once ingested. The film-forming
                                                   7

   agent can be a water-soluble polymer in which the release of active ingredient is prevented
   by using a high molar concentration of the solutes in the reconstituted composition,
   wherein the solutes have a higher affinity towards water. The high molar concentration of
   the solutes generates hypertonic conditions leading to high osmolality and thus prevents
 5 the leaching of the active ingredient from the coated cores. This would help to mask the
   taste of the bitter active ingredients or to improve the stability of active ingredients.
   Further, the film-forming agent can be having a pH-dependent solubility in which the
   release of active ingredient is prevented by using a pre-adjusted pH of the reconstituted
   composition such that the film-forming agent does not get dissolved in the reconstituted
10 composition but get dissolved when exposed to the physiological conditions.
   Alternatively, the solid composition comprises of active ingredient in a complexed form
   such as ion-exchange resin complex or a cyclodextrin complex, optionally admixed with
   one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. In this case, the active ingredient is
   released when exposed to the physiological conditions upon ingestion. The extended
15 release coating may comprise of a pH-dependent release-controlling agent, a pH
   independent release-controlling agent, or mixtures thereof
           Suitable examples of pH-dependent release-controlling agents are selected from
   the group comprising acrylic copolymers such as methacrylic acid and methyl
   methacrylate copolymers, e.g., Eudragit* L 100 and Eudragit* S 100, methacrylic acid and

   as a flute shaped plunger. The plunger can further have one or more grooves. The body of
   the plunger can be in the form of a cylinder or a funnel. The funnel shaped plunger
 5 provides additional capacity for storing high-dose active ingredients or active ingredients
   required for chronic administration.
            The plunger used in the instant invention ensures that the breakable polymeric
   membrane remains attached to the plug during activation. The plug and the plunger may
   be made up of a polymeric material selected from the group comprising polyolefin,
10 polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, cyclic olefm polymer, cyclic olefin co
   polymer, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate - G, polypropylene, and
   polycarbonate. Particularly, the plug and the plunger are made up of polyethylene. More
   particularly, the plug and the plunger are made up of linear low density polyethylene
   (LLDPE).
15          The compositions of the first and second chambers of the container are separated
   by a polymeric breakable membrane of the plug. The plunger used in the instant invention
   helps to rupture the breakable polymeric membrane upon the application of pressure by a
   screw-based mechanism. When pressure is applied on the reservoir, the breakable
   polymeric membrane is ruptured by the plunger. The intact polymeric membrane remains
20 attached to the circumference of the plug. In cases, where a bottle liner exists between the
   first and the second chambers, the plunger would break the bottle liner in the same manner
   as it ruptures the breakable polymeric membrane. The unabridged part of the bottle liner
   remains attached to the opening of the container. The plug with the breakable polymeric
   membrane prevents moisture permeation from the first chamber into the second chamber.
25          The material used for making the plug may also include moisture barrier additives
   selected from the plastic additive group comprising of monomers and co-polymers that get
   activated through polymerization process to form an effective organic chemical. The
   moisture barrier additives used in the present invention may include any material that
   prevent moisture permeation. The moisture barrier additives may be present in the form of
30 a layer inside the plug. The moisture barrier additives may be present in an amount of
   0.1% to 10% w/w, in particularly, 0.5% to 5% w/w based on total weight of the material
   used for making plug.
                                                 21

            The material used for making the reservoir may also include the moisture barrier
   additives. The moisture barrier additives may be present in the form of a layer inside the
   reservoir.
            The moisture permeation test was carried out on dual chamber packs with moisture
 5 barrier additives and without moisture barrier additives as per USP (37) - 671 Containers
   Performance Testing. The moisture barrier additives used in the present invention improve
   the moisture barrier properties by up to 50%. In particular, the moisture barrier additives
   improves the moisture barrier properties by up to 30%.
            The use of moisture barrier additives thus help to prevent the moisture permeation
10 from the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle into the solid composition comprising the
   active ingredient during storage. The active ingredient, particularly moisture-sensitive
   active ingredients thus remains stable during storage.
            The invention may be further illustrated by the following example, which is for
   illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the
15 invention in any way.

   suspension prepared as per Example 1 remains stable even after storing at accelerated
   conditions for 3 months.
   Antimicrobial Efficacy Test of Extended Release Reconstituted Powder for
20 Suspension
            The powder for suspension and suspension base prepared as per Example I was
   stored in the drug delivery device for twenty four months at 25'C/60% R.H. After twenty
   four months, the drug delivery device was activated to form an extended release
   reconstituted suspension which was tested for antimicrobial efficacy as per USP and also
                                                   27

   by inoculating with Burkholderia cepacia complex. Extended release reconstituted
   suspension prepared after activation of the drug delivery device was found to comply with
   the Antimicrobial Efficacy Test as per USP. Growth of Burkholderia cepacia complex
   was found to be inhibited in the reconstituted suspension.
 5         It is evident from the above test that microbial growth was not promoted in the
   extended release reconstituted powder for suspension composition prepared after
   activation of the drug delivery device.
   In- Vitro Studies of Extended Release Coated Cores
10 Extended release coated cores of Example 1 (step 4) were stored in the drug delivery
   device and kept for 1, 3 and 6 months at accelerated conditions i.e., 40'C/75% RH. Coated
   cores were then subjected to determination of water content after 1, 3 and 6 months of
   storage at 40'C/75% RH using Karl Fischer Apparatus. The results of the water content
   determination are represented in Table 5A.

    Flow Properties of Extended Release Coated Cores
             Extended release coated cores of Example 2 (step 5) were evaluated for the
    following parameters:
    Angle of Repose (AoR) - Angle of Repose was determined by passing the extended
15  release coated cores through Enar Reposograph to make the cone. Then, height of the cone
    (h) thus formed and the radius (r) of the base of the cone were measured. Angle of repose
    (0) was calculated as follows:
    0 = tan-1 (h/r)
    Hausner ratio (HR) - Hausner ratio was determined by dividing the tapped density (piap)
20  by the bulk density (Pbulk).
    Carr's Compressibility Index (CI) - Carr's Compressibility Index was determined from
    the Hausner ratio (HR) as C1 = 100 x [1-(1/HR)]

            From the above in-vitro release data, it is evident that the extended release coated
   cores prepared according to Example 2 (step 5) provide substantially similar in-vitro
   metformin release after six months of storage at 40'C/75% RH. Thus, the extended release
15 coated cores prepared as per the present invention are stable when stored in the second
   chamber of the drug delivery device for at least six months under accelerated conditions.
   Uniformity of Fill Weight of Extended Release Coated Cores
   Extended release coated cores prepared according to Example 2 (step 5) were filled into
20 the second chamber of drug delivery devices. A total of 960 drug delivery devices were
   filled. Target fill weight was 106.995g. Average weight was found to be 107.52g,
   minimum observed fill weight was 106.14g, maximum fill weight was 107.95g and %
   RSD was found to be 0.25. Entire batch was filled within ± 7.5% of the target weight.
   Thus, % weight variation with respect to target fill weight of extended release coated cores
25 was found to be within the range of about ± 7.5%.
