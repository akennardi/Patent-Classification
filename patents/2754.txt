  ABSTRACT
            The present invention relates to a disposable absorbent pad comprising multiple layers.
  In particular, the absorbent pad of the present invention maintains skin dryness by absorbing
  moisture while preventing leakage to the skin or the bed linens, allowing air circulation at the
5 surface of the patient's skin to prevent heat buildup, and is strong enough to allow the patient to
  be repositioned, even when the pad is wet.         In a particular embodiment the first layer is
  comprised of a fluid-permeable, porous material, the second layer is disposed under the first
  layer and is comprised of at least one super absorbent material, and a base layer disposed under
  the second layer.

   BACKGROUND
            Bed sores, also known as pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, are prevalent among people
   who are bed-ridden or otherwise immobilized. Skin ulcers can be caused by pressure exerted on
 5 the skin and soft tissues (e.g., the individual's body weight resting against a hard surface such as
   a bed or chair) and are exacerbated when the skin is also exposed to moisture (e.g., due to
   incontinence) and/or friction, heat, and shear forces, for example caused by moving or
   repositioning a bed-ridden patient.
            Elderly nursing home residents are particularly vulnerable to pressure ulcers since they
 0 are frequently bed-ridden and incontinent. Approximately one out of ten nursing home residents
   have some form of pressure ulcers.        Since pressure ulcers can be persistent and heal slowly,
   treating pressure ulcers once formed is thus expensive, so there is a significant need to minimize
   a patient's exposure to conditions which would cause such ulcers.
            For example, it would be beneficial for bed-ridden persons who are incontinent or have
 5 other moisture management issues to lay on a pad or layer which would not only absorb moisture
   but also maintain skin dryness.       It would also be useful to protect the bed and linens from
   moisture as well in order to maintain hygiene and minimize the need for hospital staff to change
   bed linens.    Additionally, in order to minimize heat build up between the bedding and the
   patient's skin, and to maintain skin health, it would be beneficial for the absorbent pad or layer to
-0 allow air circulation between the pad and the skin. Furthermore, since bed-ridden patients need
   to be lifted and repositioned, for example to change bed linens, for medical procedures, or to
   prevent the formation of pressure ulcers, it would be useful for the absorbent pad to have
   sufficient strength to allow such repositioning.
            Current products do not provide a solution to all four needs: 1) maintaining skin dryness
25 2) protecting the bed and linens, 3) allowing air circulation, and 4) allowing caregivers to
   reposition the individual. Typically a caregiver will combine up to eight disposable underpads to
   absorb moisture, as well as reusable cloth underpads or sheets to protect the bed and linens and
   to lift and reposition the patient.
            Combinations of multiple absorbent products are less than ideal for several reasons.

                                                                                    MDLN-002/OOUS
   From a strictly practical standpoint, using multiple absorbent products is more expensive, and
   requires more packaging, storage, shipping costs, waste, and the like. Reusable cloth underpads,
   or drawsheets, are also the second most expensive item for hospitals to launder and process.
   Moreover, the combination of multiple products is not very effective in preventing damage to the
 5 skin, while at the same time protecting bedding. Multiple layers of absorbent pads can increase
   the shear and friction experienced by individuals as the layers slide and shift against each other.
   Furthermore, conventional disposable pads disintegrate when wet, and reusable cloth underpads
   prevent air circulation.     Furthermore, the thickness of the multiple layers can interfere with
   'pressure management' beds and surfaces which distribute weight to minimize or prevent
 0 excessive pressure.
             There is therefore a need for an absorbent pad which maintains skin dryness by absorbing
   moisture while preventing leakage to the skin or the bed linens, allowing air circulation at the
   surface of the patient's skin to prevent heat buildup, and which is strong enough to allow the
   patient to be repositioned, even when the pad is wet.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
             In various embodiments, the present invention is directed towards an absorbent pad
20 comprising multiple layers, e.g., three or more layers, wherein the first layer is comprised of a
   fluid-permeable, porous material, the second layer is disposed under the first layer and is
   comprised of at least one super absorbent material, and a base layer disposed under the second
   layer. Additionally, the base layer has a tensile strength at break, when measured by the ASTM
   D 882 method, in the range of about 45 N/25 mm to 100 N/25 mm in the machine direction and
25 about 30 to 60 N/25 mm in the cross direction.
             In certain embodiments of the invention, the base later is comprised of a third layer
   comprised of a hydrophobic, breathable film, disposed under the second layer and a fourth layer,
   disposed under the third layer, comprised of an air-permeable material.

              In one embodiment of the invention, the first layer is a nonwoven material.             The
   nonwoven material of the first layer can be manufactured using any technique known in the art.
   Non-limiting examples of suitable types of nonwoven materials include staple nonwoven
   materials, melt-blown nonwoven materials, spunmelt nonwoven materials, spunbond nonwoven
 5 materials, SMS (spunbond meltblown spunbond) materials, spun lace materials, needle-felted
   materials, thermal-bonded nonwoven materials, trough-air-bonded nonwoven material, spunlaid
   nonwoven material, air-laid nonwoven materials or the like, or any combinations thereof.
              In certain embodiments of the invention the first layer is hydrophilic. For example, the
   first layer can be treated in order make it fluid permeable.         Such treatments can include any
 0 treatment known in the art which renders a material fluid penneable. Non-limiting examples of
   such treatments include: coating the surface of the material with a hydrophilic surfactant as
   described in WO 93/04113 entitled "Method for hydrophilizing absorbent foam materials" and in
   WO 95/25495 entitled "Fluid acquisition and distribution member for absorbent core"; surface
   treatments such as corona and plasma treatment as described in described in U.S. Pat. No.
 5 6,118,218 entitled "Steady-state glow-discharge plasma at atmospheric pressure"; applying a
   hydrophilic coating by a plasma polymerization process as described in WO 00/16913 entitled
   "Durably wettable, liquid pervious webs" and WO 00/16914 entitled "Durably wettable, liquid
   pervious webs prepared using a remote plasma polymerization process"; or contacting the fibers
   with a solution of hydrophilic monomers and radical polymerization initiators and exposing the
 0 fibers to UV radiation as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,587 entitled "Absorbent articles
   comprising hydrophilic nonwoven fabrics"; all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in
   their entirety for all purposes.
              In another embodiment of the invention, the first layer is permeable to fluids such that the
25 fluids can pass through the surface of the first layer toward the second layer (disposed beneath
   the first layer), but the fluids cannot substantially reverse direction and move back toward the
   surface of the first layer. In other words, in various embodiments the flow of fluids through the
   first layer is substantially unidirectional from the top surface of the first layer toward the second
   layer disposed beneath the first layer.
30            The first layer can comprise any suitable material known in the art. For example, the first
                                                       3

   layer can comprise a polymeric material. Non limiting examples of such polymeric materials
   include polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, viscose rayon,
   nylon, or the like or any combinations thereof. Furthermore, the polymeric material can be a
   biodegradable polymeric material. One such non-limiting example of a polymer is the starch
 5 based biodegradable material described in United States Patent Application 2009/0075346,
   which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes. In certain embodiments of the
   invention, the first layer has a weight per unit area (weight) in the range of about 15 gsm (grams
   per square meter) to about 20 gsm. For example, the first layer can have a weight of about 15
   gsm, about 16 gsm, about 17 gsm, about 18 gsm, about 19 gsm, or about 20 gsm, inclusive of all
 0 ranges and subranges therebetween.
            In certain embodiments of the invention, the first layer is fluid permeable.          In one
   embodiment of the invention the first layer has a Moisture Transfer Rate, for example as
   measured by ASTM E96M - 05 in the range of about 5 to about 200 sec/mL.
            In another embodiment of the invention, the first layer is air permeable.         In certain
 5 embodiments, the first layer has an air permeability of the range of about 10 seconds/100 mL to
   about 100 seconds/100 mL, including about 10 seconds/100 mL, about 20 seconds/100 mL,
   about 30 seconds/100 mL, about 40 seconds/100 mL, about 50 seconds/100 mL, about 60
   seconds/100 mL, about 70 seconds/100 mL, about 80 seconds/100 mL, about 90 seconds/100
   mL, or about 100 seconds/100 mL, inclusive of all ranges and subranges therebetween, for
 0 example as measured by the Gurely method using a densometer, (e.g., methods conforming the
   following standards: ASTM D737 and WSP 70.1).
            The second layer of the absorbent pad of the present invention is disposed beneath the
   first layer, as described herein. For example, the second layer can be located directly beneath the
   first layer and in direct contact with the first layer, or adhered to the first layer by means of one
25 or more intervening layers, for example an adhesive layer and/or a spacer layer.
            In certain embodiments the second layer is comprised of a formed material. The formed
   material of the second layer can be manufactured using any technique known in the art. Non
   limiting examples of suitable types of formed materials include staple nonwoven materials, melt
   blown nonwoven materials, spun-melt nonwoven materials, spun-bound nonwoven materials,

   nonwoven materials, air-laid nonwoven materials, or any combinations thereof. In a particular
   embodiment the second layer is comprised of an air-laid fiber. In one embodiment the air-laid
   fiber is thennobonded. In a particular embodiment the air-laid material is air laid paper.
 5            The second layer can comprise fibers, for example natural fibers. The natural fibers can
   be any suitable natural fibers known in the art. In one embodiment the natural fiber is cellulose.
   The cellulose can be from any suitable source known in the art.          Non-limiting examples of
   suitable sources of cellulose are wood fibers, plant fibers, field crop fibers, fluff pulp fibers,
   cotton, any other material, man-made or natural, designed to absorb fluid, or any combination
 0 thereof.      In a particular embodiment the second layer comprises wood fibers.          In another
   embodiment, the second layer comprises macerated wood pulp.
              The second layer of the pad can further comprise an absorbent polymer, for example any
   super-absorbent polymer known in the art. Non-limiting examples of suitable super-absorbent
   polymers include, for example, polymers and copolymers of acrylic acid and salts thereof
 5 (including alkali metal salts such as sodium salts, or alkaline earth salts thereof), polymers and
   copolymers of methacrylic acid and salts thereof (including alkali metal salts such as sodium
   salts, or alkaline earth salts thereof), polyacrylamide polymers and copolymers, ethylene maleic
   anhydride copolymers, cross-linked carboxy-methyl-celluloses, polyacrylate/polyacrylamide
   copolymers, polyvinyl alcohol copolymers, cross-linked polyethylene oxides, starch grafted
 0 copolymers of polyacrylonitrile, etc.        The super-absorbent polymers can be cross-linked to
   suitable degree.
              In a particular embodiment the super-absorbent polymer comprises sodium polyacrylate.
   In another embodiment, the second layer comprises an amount of super-absorbent polymer(s) in
   the range of about 15 gsm to about 35 gsm. For example, the super-absorbent polymer(s) in the
25 second layer is present in an amount of about 15 gsm, about 20 gsm, about 25 gsm, about 30
   gsm, or about 35 gsm, inclusive of all ranges and subranges therebetween.
              In another embodiment, the cellulose fibers of the second layer are present in the second

              In a particular embodiment, the second layer is a thermobonded, absorbent airlaid core
   made from cellulose fibers and super-absorbent polymers. In a particular embodiment of the
 5 invention, the second layer is comprised of an airlaid absorbent core as described in U.S. Patent
   No. 6,675,702 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. In yet another
   embodiment, the second layer is comprised of a thermobonded airlaid core made from about 100
   to about 105 gsm of cellulose fibers and 25 gsm of super absorbent polymers. In a particular
   embodiment, the cellulose fibers are macerated wood pulp.
 0            The second layer absorbs substantially all of the fluids penetrating through from the first
   layer, and has a fluid-holding capacity sufficient to retain fluids without releasing the fluid
   through the first layer or through the third and fourth layers. In certain embodiments, the second
                                                                          2

   Applicants have found that air laid materials comprising a combination of a cellulosic material
 5 and a superabsorbent polymer, as described herein do not substantially swell or separate from the
   other layers (e.g., the first and/or third layers) when wetted with fluids from the patient. By "not
   swell substantially" we mean that the absorbent second layer does not increase in thickness more
   than about 200%, for example less than about 200%, less than about 190%, less than about
    180%, less than about 170%, less than about 160%, less than about 150%, less than about 140%,
 0 less than about 130%, less than about 120%, less than about 110%, less than about 100%, less
   than about 90%, less than about 80%, less than about 70%, less than about 60%, less than about
   50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, , or less than about 10% in
   thickness, inclusive of all ranges and subranges therebetween. By "not substantially separate",
   we mean that at least about 60%, for example less than about 60%, less than about 50%, less
 5 than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, or less than about 10%, of the surface
   area of the absorbent second layer remains adhered to or in direct contact with the first and third
   layers of the absorbent pad (or remains adhered to or in direct contact with an adhesive and/or
   spacer layer disposed between the first and/or third layers and the absorbent second layer).
              The base layer prevents fluid absorbed in the second layer from going through the bottom
 0 of the absorbent pad. The base layer should also provide for air circulation within the absorbent
   pad to prevent heat and moisture vapor build up.
              In certain embodiments of the invention, the base layer is comprised of a third and fourth
   layer, wherein the third layer is disposed under the second layer and the fourth layer disposed
   under the third layer.
25            The base layer (or in certain embodiments, the third layer) prevents the fluid absorbed in
   the second layer to penetrate through the base layer of the absorbent pad (or in some
   embodiments, the fourth layer). The base layer can comprise any natural or man-made material
   capable of preventing the flow of fluids out of the second layer and through the bottom of the
   absorbent pad. In certain embodiments wherein the base layer comprises a third and fourth
                                                       7

   layer, the third layer comprises a polymeric film, for example a hydrophobic polymeric film.
   The polymeric film of the third layer can be any suitable polymer known in the art, for example
   suitable hydrophobic polymers. Non-limiting examples of such polymers include polyolefins
   such as polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(lactic acid), polyhydroxybutyrate, and tapioca starch
 5 as well as copolymers thereof. One such non-limiting example of a polymer is the starch-based
   biodegradable material described in United States Patent Application 2009/0075346, which is
   hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.
             The base layer should also provide for air circulation within the absorbent pad to prevent
   heat and moisture vapor build up. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the base layer is air
 0 permeable. Air permeability can be provided in various ways, for example by forming a base
   layer comprising a third and fourth, wherein the third layer comprises a woven or nonwoven
   hydrophobic material which prevents the movement of bulk fluid, but allows diffusion or
   movement of air through the third layer. For example, the hydrophobic material can comprise
   hydrophobic polymeric fibers (e.g., polyolefin fibers) or comprising fibers surface treated with a
 5 hydrophobic sizing or coating. In yet another embodiment the third layer comprises a perforated
   polyolefin (e.g. polyethylene and/or polypropylene polymer or copolymer) sheet. If the third
   layer comprises a perforated polyolefin sheet, the perforations should be of a size which does not
   permit the permeation or movement of liquids through the perforations, but does provide air
   permeability values within the ranges described herein.
 0           Although the base layer does not permit any appreciable amount of liquid to flow
   through, in many instances it can be advantageous to allow moisture vapor to permeate through
   the base layer. In certain embodiments of the invention, for a base layer comprising a third and
   fourth layer, the third layer has a moisture vapor transmission rate (MTVR) in the range of about
    1,000 g/m 2/day to about 10,000 gh2/day. For example, the third layer can have an MTVR of

   such that the first layer is disposed over the second, which is disposed over the base (or in some
   embodiments, third, which is disposed over the fourth), and the combined layers are then cut to
 0 the appropriate size and the edges adhered together. In another embodiment of the invention,
   sheets of a suitable size are cut from rolls of each individual layer, then combined in the
   appropriate order and the edges are adhered together.         In yet another embodiment of the
   invention, the dimension of the base layer exceeds that of the second layer in either width, length
   or both by 1 inch to 5 inches. The second layer can be disposed over the base layer such that the
 5 base layer extends about 0.5 to about 2.5 inches beyond the second layer on either opposing sides
   or all sides, and the material of the base layer which extends beyond the second layer can be
   folded over and adhered to the second layer by any known means in the art. A first layer of the
   same dimensions as the second layer can be disposed over and adhered to the second layer.

   on either opposing sides or all sides. The material of the third and fourth which extends beyond
   the second layer can be folded over and adhered to the second layer by any known means in the
25 art. A first layer of the same dimensions as the second layer can be disposed over and adhered to
   the second layer.

   about 4,400 g/m 2 or about 4,500 g/m 2.
            The rate of acquisition and rewet properties of the pad of the present invention can be
   determined by any suitable method, for example the Medi-Cal method.                   The Medi-Cal
 0 acquisition rate and rewet test protocols comprise laying the pad of the present invention (as
   described herein) on a flat surface, then rapidly adding 100 or 200 mL of a 0.09% saline solution
   onto the center of the pad (the target area). The time required for the saline solution to pass
   through the top sheet of the pad is the rate of acquisition.        Approximately 12 minutes after
   adding the saline solution to the pad, a preweighed (~10 g) stack of dry filter paper is placed on
 5 the center of the target area, and weighted with a 1.0 psi weight. After 1 minute, the filter paper
   stack is removed and weighed. The weight of moisture absorbed by the filter paper stack is the
   rewet value.
            Suitable rewet values determined by the Medi-Cal method fall within the range of about I
   g to about 3 g, e.g., about 1 g, about 1.1 g, about 1.2 g, about 1.3 g, about 1.4 g, about 1.5 g,

   g, about 2.4 g, about 2.5 g, about 2.6 g, about 2.7 g, about 2.8 g, about 2.9 g, or about 3.0 g.
            Suitable rate of acquisition values determined by the Medi-Cal method fall within the
   range of about 110 sec to about 180 sec, e.g., about 110 sec, about 115 sec, about 120 sec, about
    125 sec, about 130 sec, about 135 sec, about 140 sec, about 145 see, about 150 sec, about 155
25 sec, about 160 see, about 165 sec, about 170 see, about 175 see or about 180 see.
            The "Max Lift Weight" is the maximum weight the pad can support while being lifted at
   two or more points without tearing. The Max Lift Weight can be tested by attaching clamps to at
   least two edges or corners of the pad and placing weights on the pad. The clamps can then be
   attached to a lifting device. (Figure 2). In certain embodiments of the invention, the absorbent
