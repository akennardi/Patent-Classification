10  Summary of the Invention
            The present invention provides a high temperature lightweight thermal insulating
    cement or silica based material ("insulating material") formed from a mixture that includes
    cement or silica sand, water and a foaming agent. The foaming agent can be an aluminum
    powder or a surfactant. The insulating material has a maximum use temperature greater
15  than about 600 degrees Celsius. The maximum use temperature can be up to about 900
    degrees Celsius when Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) is used.              The maximum use
    temperature can be up to about 1000 degrees Celsius when silica sand is used.            The
    maximum use temperature can be up to about 1800 degrees Celsius when calcium
    aluminate cement (CAC) is used.
20          In addition, the present invention provides an insulating material formed from a
    mixture that includes cement or silica sand in an amount of about 25 to 90% of weight wet,
    water in an amount of about 10 to 70% of weight wet, and a foaming agent. The foaming
    agent can be an aluminum powder in an amount of about 0.5 to 3 .0% by weight of the
    cement or silica sand, or a surfactant in an amount of about 0.05 to 2.0% by weight of the
25  water.   The insulating material has a maximum use temperature greater than about 600
    degrees Celsius, a density in the range of about 0.1 to 1.0 g/cm 3, a thermal conductivity in
    the range of about 0.05 to 0.30 W/(m-K), and a compressive strength in the range of about
    30 to 3000 PSI (2.068 to 206.8 Bar).
            Moreover, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing an insulating
30  material by mixing cement or silica sand with water, foaming the mixture using a foaming
    agent, pouring the foamed mixture into a mold and allowing the foamed mixture to rise to
    form the insulating material, and removing the insulating material from the mold.

    maximum use temperature greater than about 600 degrees Celsius.
            Furthermore, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing an
    insulating material by mixing cement or silica sand in an amount of about 25 to 90% of
 5  weight wet with water in an amount of about 10 to 70% of weight wet, foaming the mixture
    using a foaming agent (an aluminum powder in an amount of about 0.5 to 3 .0% by weight
    of the cement or silica sand, or a surfactant in an amount of about 0.05 to 2.0% by weight
    of the water), pouring the foamed mixture into a mold and allowing the foamed mixture to
    rise to form the insulating material, and removing the insulating material from the mold.
10  The insulating material can be cured or heat treated.         The insulating material has a
    maximum use temperature greater than about 600 degrees Celsius, a density in the range of
    about 0.1 to 1.0 g/cm 3, a thermal conductivity in the range of about 0.05 to 0.30 W/(m-K),
    and a compressive strength in the range of about 30 to 3000 PSI (2.068 to 206.8 Bar).

    describe specific embodiments of the invention, but their usage does not delimit the
    invention, except as outlined in the claims.
             Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) or calcium aluminate cement (CAC), in its wet
    state with water added before setting, can be foamed up with reacting aluminum powder or
 5  the use of a surfactant. The more the wet material is foamed by adding higher amounts of
    aluminum or surfactant, the lighter weight it will be and as a result the more insulating the
    set and dried material will be. Following setting and drying, when based on OPC, the
    insulating material will have a maximum use temperature up to approximately 900 Celsius,
    and when based on CAC, the insulating material will have a maximum use temperature up
10  to approximately 1800 Celsius.
             Silica sand in a mixture with water and calcium oxide can be foamed with reacting
    aluminum powder or by the use of a surfactant. The more the wet material is foamed by
    adding higher amounts of aluminum or surfactant, the lighter weight it will be and as a
    result the more insulating, the set and dried material will be. Following gelation, foaming,
15  setting, autoclaving and drying, the insulating material will have a maximum use
    temperature up to approximately 1000 Celsius.
             The cement or silica sand binder can be used in combination with a multitude of
    additive materials such as sand, gypsum, silica fume, fumed silica, plaster of Paris, fly ash,
    slag, rock, fiber (e.g., glass fibers, cellulose fibers polyvinyl alcohol fibers, polypropylene
20  fibers, or a combination thereof), etc. Note that the silica sand is initially ground as a wet
    slurry in a ball mill to a fineness less than 100 microns.
             To make the foamed cement or silica water mixture, the water to solids ratio by
    weight is typically in the range of 0.2 to 2.0. When foaming mixtures with lower water to
    solids ratios in the range of 0.2 to 1.0, these mixtures can be made more fluid by adding a
25  conventional high range water reducer (HRWR) in an amount of 0.25-4.0% of the cement
    or silica sand weight.
             In one embodiment, the foamed mixture (cement-water or silica-water) is
    sometimes stabilized by the addition of a theology modifying agent. The theology
    modifying agent will typically be added in an amount of 0.1 to 5% of the cement or silica
30  sand weight.
             The    rheology-modifying      agents   fall   into  the  following    categories:  (1)
    polysaccharides and derivatives thereof, (2) proteins and derivatives thereof, and (3)
    synthetic organic materials. Polysaccharide rheology-modifying agents can be further

                                                   4
    subdivided into (a) cellulose-based materials and derivatives thereof, (b) starch based
    materials and derivatives thereof, and (c) other polysaccharides.
             Suitable   cellulose-based  rheology-modifying     agents   include,   for   example,
    methylhydroxyethylcellulose         (MHEC),        hydroxymethylethylcellulose       (HMEC),
 5  carboxymethylcellulose        (CMC),     methylcellulose     (MC),     ethylcellulose    (EC),
    hydroxyethylcellulose         (HEC),      hydroxyethylpropylcellulose         (HEPC)       and
    hydroxypropoylmethylcelluose (HPMC), etc.
             Suitable starch based materials include, for example, wheat starch, pre-gelled wheat
    starch, potato starch, pre-gelled potato starch, amylopectin, amylose, seagel, starch
10  acetates, starch hydroxyethyl ethers, ionic starches, long-chain alkylstarches, dextrins,
    amine starches, phosphate starches, and dialdehyde starches.
             The        currently       preferred        rheology-modifying         agent        is
    hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, examples of which are Methocel 240 and Methocel 240S.
             When using aluminum as a foaming agent, the aluminum is typically in a particle
15  size below 100 microns. The aluminum can be added as a dry powder, or as a paste in a
    mixture with water or diethyleneglycol and for some applications can also be used in a
    retarded version. The preferred aluminum is purchased from the company Eckart (a
    German company). Typically, the aluminum is added in an amount of 0.05-3% by weight
    of the cement or silica sand weight.
20           When foaming OPC cement based mixes, the water and cement are typically mixed
    first for 1-5 minutes where after the aluminum is added and mixed for 5 seconds to 1
    minute.    When foaming CAC cement based mixes, the water, cement and theology
    modifying agent are typically mixed first for 1-5 minutes, where after calcium oxide,
    calcium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or similar pH increasing material is added in an
25  amount of 0.5 to 10% of the water weight and mixed for 5 seconds to 1 minute, and finally
    the aluminum is added and mixed for 5 seconds to 1 minute. When foaming the silica sand
    based mixes, the water, sand and theology modifying agent (when used) are typically
    mixed first for 1-5 minutes where after the calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium
    hydroxide or similar pH increasing material is added in an amount of 0.5 to 40% of the
30  water weight and mixed for 1-5 minutes, and finally the aluminum is added and mixed for
    5 seconds to 1 minute.
             Following mixing, the mixture is poured into the mold system, which can be in the
    shape of a pipe, half-pipe or block and is allowed to rise (due to the formation of hydrogen

    bubbles as the aluminum reacts with the hydroxyl ions) and fill the mold over the next 0.5
    to 2 hours.
            When using a surfactant as the foaming agent, the surfactant is specially chosen to
    have a high degree of foam stability and to generate the right bubble size. One such air
 5  entraining agent is sold by the company Sika. The surfactant is typically added in an
    amount of 0.05 to 2.0% of the weight of water. When foaming OPC or CAC cement based
    mixtures, the water, cement, surfactant and theology modifying agent are typically mixed
    for 1 to 10 minutes to foam up the mixture. When foaming the silica sand based mixtures
    with a surfactant, the water, sand and theology modifying agent are typically mixed first
10  for 1-5 minutes, where after calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or
    similar pH increasing material is added in an amount of 0.5 to 40% of the water weight and
    mixed for 1-5 minutes, and finally the surfactant is added and mixed for 1 to 10 minutes to
    foam up the mixture.      Following mixing, the foamed mixture is poured into the mold
    system.
15          Following hardening of the cement based mixtures, the wet material will be de
    molded and can be cut to size, trimmed, sanded or routed into a specified shape (e.g., pipe,
    half-pipe, block, panel, etc.).    Following gelation and development of sufficient green
    strength of the silica based mixtures in the mold system (2 to 10 hours), the wet material is
    de-molded and can be cut to size, trimmed, sanded or routed into a specified shape (e.g.,
20  pipe, half-pipe, block, panel, etc.).
            To develop the final 28 days strength of products made from OPC cement, the
    product is either allowed to sit around for 28 days in a humid environment, or the strength
    development can be accelerated within 24-48 hours by heating either by its own internal
    heat development or by steam curing such as is conventional in the State-of-the-Art.
25          Products made from CAC cement will achieve its final strength in 24 hours and
    does not require additional curing.
            Products made from silica sand are placed in an autoclave for 15-48 hours at a
    temperature of 150-200 Celsius and a pressure of 10-20 Bars to develop final strength.
    This treatment converts the gelled silica into the cementitious reaction products
30  Tobermorite and Xonotlite that provides strength.
            After achieving the final strength development, the product is dried to generate the
    finished lightweight insulating composite material. The hardened composite material can

    the product with water or solvent based silane. Such product is typically sold by BASF.
 5          The finished lightweight cement or silica based insulating composite will have a
    density in the range of 0.1-1.0 g/cm 3, a compressive strength in the range of 30-3000 PSI
    (2.068 to 206.8 Bar) and a heat conductance in the range of 0.05-0.3 W/(m-K).
