                                          ABSTRACT
Corticosteroid microparticle formulations are provided for use for treating pain, including
pain caused by inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, and for
slowing, arresting or reversing structural damage to tissues caused by an inflammatory
disease, for example damage to articular and/or peri-articular tissues caused by osteoarthritis
or rheumatoid arthritis. Corticosteroid microparticle formulations are administered locally as
a sustained release dosage form (with or without an immediate release component) that
results in efficacy accompanied by clinically insignificant or no measurable effect on
endogenous cortisol production.

filed on 4 August 2011 and claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application
No.61/370,666, filed on 4 August 2010; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety.
                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002] This invention relates to the use of corticosteroids to treat pain, including pain caused by
inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, and to slow, arrest or
reverse structural damage to tissues caused by an inflammatory disease, for example damage to
articular and/or peri-articular tissues caused by osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. More
specifically, a corticosteroid is administered locally as a sustained release dosage form (with or
without an immediate release component) that results in efficacy accompanied by clinically
insignificant or no measurable effect on endogenous cortisol production.
                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003] Corticosteroids influence all tissues of the body and produce various cellular effects.
These steroids regulate carbohydrate, lipid, protein biosynthesis and metabolism, and water and
electrolyte balance. Corticosteroids influencing cellular biosynthesis or metabolism are
referred to as glucocorticoids while those affecting water and electrolyte balance are
mineralocorticoids. Both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are released from the cortex
of the adrenal gland.
[0004] The administration of corticosteroids, particularly for extended periods of time, can
have a number of unwanted side effects. The interdependent feedback mechanism between the
hypothalamus, which is responsible for secretion of corticotrophin-releasing factor, the pituitary
gland, which is responsible for secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone, and the adrenal
cortex, which secretes cortisol, is termed the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The
HPA axis may be suppressed by the administration of corticosteroids, leading to a variety of
unwanted side effects.
                                                  1

WO 2012/019009                                                               PCT/US2011/046601
 [0005]       Accordingly, there is a medical need to extend the local duration of action of
 corticosteroids, while reducing the systemic side effects associated with that administration.
 Thus, there is a need in the art for methods and compositions for the sustained local
 treatment of pain and inflammation, such as joint pain, with corticosteroids that results in
 clinically insignificant or no measurable HPA axis suppression. In addition, there is a
 medical need to slow, arrest, reverse or otherwise inhibit structural damage to tissues caused
 by inflammatory diseases such as damage to articular tissues resulting from osteoarthritis or
 rheumatoid arthritis.
                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 [0006]       Described herein are compositions and methods for the treatment of pain and
 inflammation using corticosteroids. The compositions and methods provided herein use one
 or more corticosteroids in a microparticle formulation. The corticosteroid microparticle
 formulations provided herein are effective at treating pain and/or inflammation with
 minimal long-term side effects of corticosteroid administration, including for example,
 prolonged suppression of the HPA axis. The corticosteroid microparticle formulations are
 suitable for administration, for example, local administration by injection into a site at or
 near the site of a patient's pain and/or inflammation. The corticosteroid microparticle
 formulations provided herein are effective in slowing, arresting, reversing or otherwise
 inhibiting structural damage to tissues associated with progressive disease with minimal
 long-term side effects of corticosteroid administration, including for example, prolonged
 suppression of the HPA axis. The corticosteroid microparticle formulations are suitable for
 administration, for example, local administration by injection into a site at or near the site of
 structural tissue damage. As used herein, "prolonged" suppression of the HPA axis refers to
 levels of cortisol suppression greater than 35% by day 14 post-administration, for example
 post-injection. The corticosteroid microparticle formulations provided herein deliver the
 corticosteroid in a dose and in a controlled or sustained release manner such that the levels
 of cortisol suppression are at or below 35% by day 14 post-administration, for example
 post-injection. In some embodiments, the corticosteroid microparticle formulations
 provided herein deliver the corticosteroid in a dose and in a controlled or sustained release
 manner such that the levels of cortisol suppression are negligible and/or undetectable by 14
 post-administration, for example post-injection. In some embodiments, the corticosteroid
                                                 2

WO 2012/019009                                                                  PCT/US2011/046601
 microparticle formulations provided herein deliver the corticosteroid in a dose and in a
 controlled or sustained release manner such that the levels of cortisol suppression are
 negligible at any time post-injection. Thus, the corticosteroid microparticle formulations in
 these embodiments are effective in the absence of any significant HPA axis suppression.
 Administration of the corticosteroid microparticle formulations provided herein can result in
 an initial "burst" of HPA axis suppression, for example, within the first few days, within the
 first two days and/or within the first 24 hours post-injection, but by day 14 post-injection,
 suppression of the HPA axis is less than 35%.
 [0007]       In certain embodiments, a sustained release form of corticosteroids is
 administered locally to treat pain and inflammation. Local administration of a
 corticosteroid microparticle formulation can occur, for example, by injection into the intra
 articular space, peri-articular space, soft tissues, lesions, epidural space, perineural space, or
 the foramenal space at or near the site of a patient's pain. In certain embodiments, the
 formulation additionally contains an immediate release component. In certain preferred
 embodiments of the invention, a sustained release form of corticosteroids is administered
 (e.g., by single injection or as sequential injections) into an intra-articular space for the
 treatment of pain, for example, due to osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gouty arthritis,
 bursitis, tenosynovitis, epicondylitis, synovitis or other joint disorder. In certain preferred
 embodiments of the invention, a sustained release form of corticosteroids is administered
 (e.g., by single injection or as sequential injections) into soft tissues or lesions for the
 treatment of inflammatory disorders, for example, the inflammatory and pruritic
 manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses such as psoriasis. In certain
 preferred embodiments of the invention, a sustained release form of corticosteroids is
 administered (e.g., by single injection or as sequential injections) into an epidural space, a
 perineural space, a foramenal space or other spinal space for the treatment of corticosteroid
 responsive degenerative musculoskeletal disorders such as Neurogenic Claudication. In
 certain preferred embodiments of the invention, a sustained release form of corticosteroids
 is administered (e.g., by single injection or as sequential injections) into an intra-articular
 space or into soft tissues to slow, arrest, reverse or otherwise inhibit structural damage to
 tissues associated with progressive disease such as, for example, the damage to cartilage
 associated with progression of osteoarthritis.
 [0008]       In certain embodiments of the invention, a combination of an immediate release
 form and a sustained release form of corticosteroids is administered (e.g., by single injection
                                                   3

WO 2012/019009                                                                  PCT/US2011/046601
 or as sequential injections) into an intra-articular space for the treatment of pain, for
 example, due to osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or other joint disorder(s). In certain
 embodiments of the invention, a combination of an immediate release form and a sustained
 release form of corticosteroids is administered (e.g., by single injection or as sequential
 injections) into an intra-articular space or into soft tissues to slow, arrest, reverse or
 otherwise inhibit structural damage to tissues associated with progressive disease such as,
 for example, the damage to cartilage associated with progression of osteoarthritis. The
 formulations and methods of embodiments of the invention can achieve immediate relief of
 the acute symptoms (e.g., pain and inflammation) of these diseases or conditions and
 additionally provide a sustained or long term therapy (e.g., slowing, arresting, reversing or
 otherwise inhibiting structural damage to tissues associated with progressive disease), while
 avoiding long term systemic side effects associated with corticosteroid administration,
 including HPA suppression.
 [0009]      In one aspect, a formulation is provided wherein a microparticle matrix (such as
 PLGA, PLA, hydrogels, hyaluronic acid, etc.) incorporates a corticosteroid, and the
 corticosteroid microparticle formulation provides at least two weeks, preferably at least
 three weeks, including up to and beyond 30 days, or 60 days, or 90 days of a sustained,
 steady state release of the corticosteroid. In one aspect, a formulation is provided wherein a
 microparticle matrix (such as PLGA, PLA, hydrogels, hyaluronic acid, etc.) incorporates a
 corticosteroid, and the corticosteroid microparticle formulation provides at least two weeks,
 preferably at least three weeks, including up to and beyond 30 days, or 60 days, or 90 days
 of a sustained, steady state release of the corticosteroid at a rate that does not adversely
 suppress the HPA axis.
 [0010]      The corticosteroid microparticle formulation retains sustained efficacy even after
 the corticosteroid is no longer resident at the site of administration, for example, in the intra
 articular space, and/or after the corticosteroid is no longer detected in the systemic
 circulation. The corticosteroid microparticle formulation retains sustained efficacy even
 after the corticosteroid microparticle formulation is no longer resident at the site of
 administration, for example, in the intra-articular space, and/or the corticosteroid
 microparticle formulation is no longer detected in the systemic circulation. The
 corticosteroid microparticle formulation retains sustained efficacy even after the
 corticosteroid microparticle formulation ceases to release therapeutically effective amounts
 of corticosteroid. For example, in some embodiments, the corticosteroid released by the
                                                  4

WO 2012/019009                                                                  PCT/US2011/046601
 microparticle formulation retains efficacy for at least one week, at least two weeks, at least
 three weeks, at least four weeks, at least five weeks, at least six weeks, at least seven weeks,
 at least eight weeks, at least nine weeks, at least twelve weeks, or more than twelve-weeks
 post-administration. In some embodiments, the corticosteroid released by the microparticle
 formulation retains efficacy for a time period that is at least twice as long, at least three
 times as long, or more than three times as long as the residency period for the corticosteroid
 and/or the corticosteroid microparticle formulation. In some embodiments, the sustained,
 steady state release of corticosteroid will not adversely suppress the HPA axis.
 [0011]       In some embodiments, a controlled or sustained-release formulation is provided
 wherein a microparticle matrix (such as PLGA, hydrogels, hyaluronic acid, etc.)
 incorporates a corticosteroid, and the formulation may or may not exhibit an initial rapid
 release, also referred to herein as an initial "burst" of the corticosteroid for a first length of
 time of between 0 and 14 days, for example, between the beginning of day 1 through the
 end of day 14, in addition to the sustained, steady state release of the corticosteroid for a
 second length of time of at least two weeks, preferably at least three weeks, including up to
 and beyond 30 days, or 60 days, or 90 days. It should be noted that when corticosteroid
 levels are measured in vitro, an occasional initial burst of corticosteroid release from the
 microparticle formulation can be seen, but this initial burst may or may not be seen in vivo.
 In another embodiment, a controlled or sustained-release formulation is provided wherein a
 microparticle matrix (such as PLGA, hydrogels, hyaluronic acid, etc.) incorporates a
 corticosteroid, and the formulation may or may not exhibit an initial rapid release, also
 referred to herein as an initial "burst" of the corticosteroid for a first length of time of
 between 0 and 14 days, e.g., between the beginning of day 1 through the end of day 14, in
 addition to the sustained, steady state release of the corticosteroid for a second length of
 time of at least two weeks, preferably at least three weeks, including up to and beyond 30
 days, or 60 days, or 90 days where the sustained, steady state release of corticosteroid is
 released at a rate that does not suppress the HPA axis at a level greater than 50% at day 14
 post-administration. In some embodiments, the sustained, steady state release of
 corticosteroid will not adversely suppress the HPA axis, for example, the level of HPA axis
 suppression at or less than 35% by day 14 post-administration. In some embodiments, the
 sustained, steady state release of corticosteroid does not significantly suppress the HPA
 axis, for example, the level of HPA axis suppression is negligible and/or undetectable by
 day 14 post-injection. In some embodiments, the sustained, steady state release of
                                                  5

 corticosteroid does not significantly suppress the HPA axis, for example, the level of HPA
 axis suppression is negligible at all times post-injection. In some embodiments, the length
 of sustained release is between 21 days and 90 days. In some embodiments, the length of
 sustained release is between 21 days and 60 days. In some embodiments, the length of
 sustained release is between 14 days and 30 days. In some embodiments, the length of
 release of the initial "burst" component is between 0 and 10 days, for example between the
 beginning of day 1 through the end of day 10. In some embodiments, the length of release
 of the initial "burst" component is between 0 and 6 days, for example between the
 beginning of day 1 through the end of day 6. In some embodiments, the length of initial
 "burst," component is between 0 and 2 days, for example between the beginning of day 1
 through the end of day 2. In some embodiments, the length of initial "burst" component is
 between 0 and 1 day, for example between the beginning of day 1 through the end of day 1.
 [0012]       The corticosteroid microparticle formulations provided herein can be used in
 combination with any of a variety of therapeutics, also referred to herein as "co-therapies."
 For example, the corticosteroid microparticle formulations can be used in combination with
 an immediate release corticosteroid solution or suspension, which provides high local
 exposures for between 1 day and 14 days following administration and which produce
 systemic exposures that may be associated with transient suppression of the HPA axis. For
 example, 40 mg of immediate release triamcinolone acetonide co-administered with the
 corticosteroid microparticle formulation in the intra-articular space would be expected to
 produce high local concentrations lasting for about 12 days. These high local
 concentrations would be associated with peak plasma concentration of triamcinolone
 acetonide of approximately 10 ng/ml on day 1, and over the course of the first 12 days of
 release of the triamcinolone acetonide from the intra-articular space would be associated
 with transient suppression of the HPA axis with a maximal effect of approximately 60%
 suppression of cortisol on day 1-2 (Derendorf et al., "Pharmacokinetics and
 pharmacodynamics of glucocorticoid suspensions after intra-articular administration." Clin
 PharmacolTher. 39(3) (1986):313-7). By day 12, the contribution of the immediate release
 component to the plasma concentration would be small, less than 0.1 ng/ml, and the
 contribution to the intra articular concentration of the immediate release component would
 also be small. However at day 12 and beyond, the corticosteroid microparticle formulation
 would continue to release corticosteroid in the intra articular space at a rate that extends the
 duration of therapeutic effect and does not suppress the HPA axis. In some embodiments,
                                                 6

WO 2012/019009                                                                 PCT/US2011/046601
 the same corticosteroid is used in both the immediate release and sustained release
 components. In some embodiments, the immediate release component contains a
 corticosteroid that is different from that of the sustained release component. In some
 embodiments, the sustained, steady state release of corticosteroid will not adversely
 suppress the HPA axis. In some embodiments, the period of sustained release is between 21
 days and 90 days. In some embodiments, the period of sustained release is between 21 days
 and 60 days. In some embodiments, the period of sustained release is between 14 days and
 30 days. In some embodiments, the high local exposure attributable to the immediate
 release component lasts for between 1 day and 14 days. In some embodiments, the high
 local exposure attributable to the immediate release component lasts for between 1 day and
  10 days. In some embodiments, the high local exposure attributable to the immediate
 release component lasts between 1 days and 8 days. In some embodiments, the high local
 exposure attributable to the immediate release component lasts between 1 days and 6 days.
 In some embodiments, the high local exposure attributable to the immediate release
 component lasts for between 1 day and 4 days.
 [0013]       Upon administration, the corticosteroid microparticle formulation may provide
 an initial release of corticosteroid at the site of administration, for example, in the intra
 articular space and/or peri-articular space. Once the initial release of corticosteroid has
 subsided, the controlled or sustained release of the corticosteroid microparticle formulations
 continues to provide therapeutic (e.g., intra-articular and/or peri-articular) concentrations of
 corticosteroid to suppress inflammation, maintain analgesia, and/or slow, arrest or reverse
 structural damage to tissues for an additional period of therapy following administration
 (Fig. 1, top tracings). However, the systemic exposure associated with the sustained release
 component does not suppress the HPA axis (Fig. 1, bottom tracings). Thus, the invention
 includes therapies and formulations that may exhibit an initial release of corticosteroid
 followed by controlled or sustained release where the therapy comprises a period of therapy
 wherein the corticosteroid is released from the sustained release component and the plasma
 levels of the corticosteroid does not adversely suppress the HPA axis.
 [0014]       In some embodiments, the length of sustained release is between 21 days and 90
 days. In some embodiments, the length of sustained release is between 21 days and 60
 days. In some embodiments, the length of sustained release is between 14 days and 30
 days. In some embodiments, the length of release of the immediate release form is In some
 embodiments, the length of release of the immediate release form is between 1 day and 14

 formulation has a sustained release microparticle formulation that may or may not release
 detectable levels of corticosteroid for a length of time following administration and that
 releases a detectable amount of corticosteroid(s) following administration, where the rate of
 corticosteroid release from the sustained release microparticle formulation does not
 adversely suppress the HPA axis. In some embodiments, corticosteroid released from the
 sustained release microparticle formulation will not measurably suppress the HPA axis.
 [0074]      According to certain embodiments of the foregoing methods, the formulation
 comprises a population of biodegradable polymer microparticles that contain the

 microparticles, preferably about 5% to 50% (w/w) of the microparticles, and more
 preferably 5% to 40% or 10% to 30% (w/w) of the microparticles. In some embodiments,
 the microparticles have a mass mean diameter of between 10 pm to 100 pm. In some
 embodiments, the microparticles are formed from a hydrogel, hyaluronic acid, PLA or
 PLGA. For example, the microparticles are formed from PLGA with a lactide to glycolide
 co-polymer ratio of about 45:55 to about 80:20. In some embodiments, the corticosteroid is

 administered intra-articularly (e.g., by one or more injections), a therapeutically effective
 amount of corticosteroid(s) is released for a period of time at a rate that does not suppress
 the HPA axis. In some embodiments, the corticosteroid(s) released will not adversely

 administered intra-articularly (e.g., by one or more injections), therapeutically effective
 amounts of corticosteroid(s) are released following administration from a first component
 for a first length of time and from a sustained release component for a second length of
 time. Furthermore, the rate of corticosteroid(s) released from the sustained release
 component does not suppress the HPA axis. In some embodiments, the corticosteroid(s)
 released from the sustained release component during the second length of time will not
 adversely suppress the HPA axis. In some embodiments, the corticosteroid(s) released from
 the sustained release component during the second length of time will not measurably
 suppress the HPA axis. In some embodiments, the first component comprises a
 corticosteroid containing solution or suspension. In some embodiments, the first
 component contains a corticosteroid that is different from that of the sustained release
 component. In other embodiments, the same corticosteroid is used in both the first and
 sustained release components.

 gouty arthritis, and synovitis. In some embodiments, the patient has acute bursitis, sub
 acute bursitis, acute nonspecific tenosynovitis, or epicondylitis.
 [0082]      The invention also provides methods to slow, arrest, reverse or otherwise inhibit
 progressive structural tissue damage associated with chronic inflammatory disease, for
 example, damage to cartilage associated with osteoarthritis. In one embodiment, the

 therapeutically effective amount of one or more corticosteroids in a formulation, wherein
 the formulation releases the corticosteroid(s) for at least 14 days at a rate that does not
 adversely suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis). The methods to
 assess the effect of corticosteroid formulations on disease progression include controlled
 clinical studies that assess clinical end points and /or employ imaging technologies such as,
 for example Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), to determine effects on the structure in
 chronically inflamed tissues, for example the effects on cartilage volume and other articular
 and peri-articular structures in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. (See e.g., Eckstein F,

 microparticle formulations. The microparticle formulations provided herein can be
 manufactured using any of a variety of suitable methods.
 [0085]      For the Class B corticosteroid microparticle formulations, in some embodiments,
 the microparticles are manufactured as described in the Examples provided below. For the
 Class B corticosteroid microparticle formulations, in some embodiments, the microparticles
 are manufactured as described in U.S. Patent No. 7,261,529 and U.S. Patent No. 7,758,778,
 the contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. For
 example, the microparticles are manufactured using a solvent evaporation process wherein
 the Class B corticosteroid is dispersed in a lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer organic
 solution and the mixture is treated to remove the solvent from the mixture, thereby
 producing microparticles.
 [0086]      In some embodiments, the solvent evaporation process utilizes a spray drying or
 fluid bed apparatus to remove the solvent and produce microparticles. In some
 embodiments, the solvent evaporation process utilizes a spinning disk. For example, the
 spinning disk is the spinning disk as described in U.S. Patent No. 7,261,529 and U.S. Patent
 No. 7,758,778.
 [0087]      For the Class B corticosteroid microparticle formulations, in some embodiments
 where the Class B corticosteroid is TCA, the microparticles are manufactured using a solid
 in oil in water emulsion process wherein TCA is dispersed in a lactic acid-glycolic acid
 copolymer organic solution and added to an aqueous solvent to produce microparticles.
 [0088]      For the Class A, C and/or D corticosteroid microparticle formulations, in some
 embodiments, the microparticles are manufactured as described in the Examples provided
                                                29

 below. For Class A, C and/or D corticosteroid formulations, in some embodiments, the
 microparticles are manufactured as described in PCT Publication No. WO 95/13799, the
 contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. For example, the
 microparticles are manufactured using a solid in oil in water emulsion process wherein the
 Class A corticosteroid, Class C corticosteroid and/or Class D corticosteroid is dispersed in a
 lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer organic solution and added to an aqueous solvent to
 produce microparticles.

 invention can be combined with one or more other embodiments of the present invention,
 even though the embodiments are described under different aspects of the present invention.

 [0090]       Figure 1 is a graph depicting the intra-articular concentrations (top solid line)
 and the systemic concentrations (bottom solid line) of the glucocorticoid administered
 according to certain embodiments of the present invention following intra-articular
 injection. The systemic glucocorticoid concentration associated with clinically significant
 suppression of the HPA axis is shown as the bottom dotted line. The top dotted line
 represents the minimal intra-articular concentration required to maintain efficacy (defined
 as relief of pain and inflammation, or slowing, arrest, or reversal of structural damage to
 tissues caused by inflammatory diseases. Sustained release of the corticosteroid provides
 sufficient intra-articular concentrations to maintain efficacy in the longer term, and has
 transient, clinically insignificant effect on the HPA axis.

                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 [00138]     The invention provides compositions and methods for the treatment of pain and
 inflammation using corticosteroids. The compositions and methods provided herein use one
 or more corticosteroids in a microparticle formulation. The corticosteroid microparticle
 formulations provided herein are effective at treating pain and/or inflammation with
 minimal prolonged suppression of the HPA axis and/or other long term side effects of
 corticosteroid administration. The corticosteroid microparticle formulations provided
 herein are effective in slowing, arresting, reversing or otherwise inhibiting structural
 damage to tissues associated with progressive disease with minimal prolonged suppression
 of the HPA axis and/or other long term side effects of corticosteroid administration. The
 corticosteroid microparticle formulations provided herein deliver the corticosteroid in a
 dose and in a sustained release manner such that the levels of cortisol suppression are at or
 below 35% by day 14 post-injection. In some embodiments, the corticosteroid
 microparticle formulations provided herein deliver the corticosteroid in a dose and in a
 controlled or sustained release manner such that the levels of cortisol suppression are
 negligible and/or undetectable by 14 post-injection. Thus, the corticosteroid microparticle
 formulations in these embodiments are effective in the absence of any significant HPA axis
 suppression. Administration of the corticosteroid microparticle formulations provided
                                                 36

 herein can result in an initial "burst" of HPA axis suppression, for example, within the first
 few days, within the first two days and/or within the first 24 hours post-injection, but by day
  14 post-injection, suppression of the HPA axis is less than 35%.
 [00139]      The use of microparticles to administer corticosteroids is known (See, e.g., U.S.
 Patent Application Publication. No. 20080317805). In addition, corticosteroids are known
 to be useful for the symptomatic treatment of inflammation and pain.
 [00140]      New data also suggest that synovitis may be associated with the structural
 damage, for example, the deterioration of cartilage and other peri-articular associated with
 the progression of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. (See e.g., Hill CL, et al.
 "Synovitis detected on magnetic resonance imaging and its relation to pain and cartilage
 loss in knee osteoarthritis." Ann Rheum Dis 66 (2007):1599-603; van den Berg WB, et al.
 "Synovial mediators of cartilage damage and repair in osteoarthritis." In: Brandt KD,
 Doherty M, Lohmander LS, eds. Osteoarthritis. Second ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press
 (2003):147-55; Ayral X, et al. "Synovitis: a potential predictive factor of structural
 progression of medial tibiofemoral knee osteoarthritis -- results of a 1 year longitudinal
 arthroscopic study in 422 patients." OsteoarthritisCartilage 13 (2005):361-7; and Kirwan
 JR, et al. "Effects of glucocorticoids on radiological progression in rheumatoid arthritis."
 CochraneDatabaseSyst Rev 2007:CD006356).
 [00141]      The administration of corticosteroids, particularly for extended periods of time,
 can have a number of unwanted side effects. The HPA axis, the interdependent feedback
 mechanism between the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland and the adrenal cortex, may be
 suppressed by the administration of corticosteroids, leading to a variety of unwanted side
 effects. The extent of HPA axis suppression, and related inhibition of endogenous cortisol
 production, has been attributed to the potency of the corticosteroid, the dose, systemic
 concentration, protein binding, rate of elimination (Meibohm et al. "Mechanism-based
 PK/PD model for the lymphocytopenia induced by endogenous and exogenous
 corticosteroids." Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 37(8) (1999):367-76) and, for one
 corticosteroid, a change in sensitivity of the HPA axis (Derendorf et al. "Clinical PK/PD
 modelling as a tool in drug development of corticosteroids." Int J Clin PharmacolTher.
 35(10) 1997: 481-8). Furthermore, intra-articular doses of corticosteroids associated with
 only limited anti-inflammatory and short-term analgesic benefit (Hepper et al. "The efficacy
 and duration of intra-articular corticosteroid injection for knee osteoarthritis: a systematic
 review of level I studies." JAm Acad Orthop Surg. 17(10) 2009: 638-46) have been

 associated with HPA axis suppression (Habib, "Systemic effects of intra-articular
 corticosteroids." Clin Rheumatol. 28(7) (2009): 749-56).
 [00142]     The changes in sensitivity to corticosteroid effects over time should alter clinical
 steroid dosing, but prior to the instant invention, this has not been understood.
 [00143]     The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the
 accompanying description below. Although any methods and materials similar or
 equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present
 invention, the methods and materials are now described. Other features, objects, and
 advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description. In the specification, the
 singular forms also include the plural unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Unless
 defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as
 commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. In
 the case of conflict, the present Specification will control.
 [00144]     Definitions
 [00145]     The terms below have the following meanings unless indicated otherwise.
 [00146]     An amount of a corticosteroid that does not "suppress the hypothalamic
 pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis)" refers to the amount of the sustained release
 corticosteroid delivered locally to relieve pain due to inflammation, which provides a
 systemic concentration that will not have a clinically significant effect or "adverse effect"
 on the HPA axis. Suppression of the HPA axis is generally manifested by a reduction in
 endogenous glucocorticoid production. It is useful to consider both basal and augmented
 production of endogenous glucocorticoids. Under ordinary, "unstressed" conditions,
 glucocorticoid production occurs at a normal, basal level. There is some natural variation of
 production during the course of the 24-hour day. Under extraordinary, "stressed"
 conditions associated with, e.g., infection or trauma and the like, augmented endogenous
 production of glucocorticoids occurs. Endogenous cortisol production may be determined
 by measuring glucocorticoid concentrations in plasma, saliva, urine or by any other means
 known in the art. It is known that systemic concentrations of corticosteroids can suppress
 the HPA axis. For example, on day 3 after an intra-articular injection of 20 mg
 triamcinolone hexacetonide plasma levels, of approximately 3-4 ng/mL have been observed.
 These resulted in a transient but highly statistically significant 75% HPA-axis suppression
 (Derendorf et al., "Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glucocorticoid suspensions
                                                 38

WO 2012/019009                                                                PCT/US2011/046601
 after intra-articular administration." Clin Pharmacol Ther. 39(3) (1986):313-7) which,
 however, does not necessarily portend complete HPA failure (Habib, "Systemic effects of
 intra-articular corticosteroids." Clin Rheumatol 28 (2009): 749-756, see p752 col. 1, para 2,
 final sentence). While such transient suppression is generally considered to be acceptable
 without clinically significant effect, more persistent suppression, i.e., weeks, would be
 deemed clinically detrimental. In embodiments of the present invention, administration of
 the formulation may result in a clinically acceptable HPA suppression, particularly during
 the initial release period of the therapy. In some embodiments of the present invention,
 administration of the formulation will not result in any significant level of HPA
 suppression, including no detectable HPA suppression, particularly during the initial release
 period of the therapy. During the subsequent or sustained release period of the therapy,
 additional corticosteroid may be released into the plasma. However, the plasma levels
 during this period will generally be less than those during the initial release period, if any
 corticosteroid release occurs, and will not be associated with HPA axis suppression.
 Further, the adverse events associated with exogenous corticosteroid administration, e.g.,
 hyperglycemia, hypertension, altered mood, etc. will generally not be observed. Preferably,
 the number of clinical adverse events during this period will not substantially exceed the
 number achieved by an immediate release formulation alone or by KENALOGTM or its
 bioequivalent and will, preferably, be fewer than during the prior, initial release period of
 the therapy, if any corticosteroid release occurs. Alternatively, one can determine the
 suppression of the formulation on HPA by measuring endogenous cortisol production.
 Thus, the formulation can be considered as avoiding clinically significant (or adverse)
 suppression of the HPA axis where the endogenous cortisol level is substantially the same
 in the steady state between a patient population receiving a therapeutically beneficial
 amount of an immediate release formulation and those receiving a therapeutically beneficial
 amount of a sustained release formulation. Such a formulation would be deemed to have no
 clinically significant effect on the HPA axis. Alternatively or additionally, a small but
 measurable reduction in steady-state glucocorticoid production can result from the
 formulation during the sustained release period of the therapy with adequate preservation of
 the augmented, stress response needed during infection or trauma can be deemed a
 clinically insignificant suppression of the HPA axis. Endogenous glucocorticoid production
 may be assessed by administering various doses of adrenocorticotropin hormone or by other
 tests known to those skilled in the art. Embodiments of the current invention provide for
                                                 39

WO 2012/019009                                                               PCT/US2011/046601
 controlling the release of corticosteroid, as may be desired, to achieve either no measurable
 effect on endogenous glucocorticoid production or a target, or a measurable effect that is,
 however, without adverse clinical consequence. In this regard, it has been found that intra
 articular doses of corticosteroids that suppress cortisol production by 20-35%, and
 sometimes more, provide very useful sustained anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity.
 These benefits are achieved without acute risks of hypoadrenalism and without excessive
 risks, after sustained intra-articular dosing, of developing an adrenal unresponsiveness in
 times of stress or of developing frank adrenal failure.
 [00147]      As shown further below, the studies presented herein have demonstrated that the
 HPA axis sensitivity appears to diminish with time, steroid, and dose. In this regard, it has
 been determined that standard doses of familiar corticosteroids, when examined from the
 viewpoint of steady-state HPA axis suppression (i.e., after desensitization has occurred),
 provide clinically useful benchmarks. For example, while oral prednisolone given at 20 mg
 QD produces a 73% cortisol suppression, even 5 mg QD (considered a "low dose") is
 associated with a 40% suppression of endogenous cortisol production. Doses at or below
 5 mg of prednisolone per day are generally considered to be well tolerated and are not
 associated with clinically meaningful HPA axis suppression (La Rochelle et al., "Recovery
 of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in patients with rheumatic diseases
 receiving low-dose prednisolone." Am. J. Med. 95 (1993): 258-264). Therefore, up to
 approximately 40% suppression will be clinically well tolerated and very unlikely to be
 associated with importantly adverse clinical events such as hypoadrenalism or soft-tissue or
 bony or metabolic changes indicative of long-term glucocorticoid excess.
 [00148]      "Patient" refers to a human diagnosed with a disease or condition that can be
 treated in accordance to the inventions described herein. In some embodiments it is
 contemplated that the formulations described herein may also be used in horses.
 [00149]      "Delivery" refers to any means used to place the drug into a patient. Such means
 may include without limitation, placing matrices into a patient that release the drug into a
 target area. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that the matrices may be delivered by
 a wide variety of methods, e.g., injection by a syringe, placement into a drill site, catheter or
 canula assembly, or forceful injection by a gun type apparatus or by placement into a
 surgical site in a patient during surgery.
 [00150]      The terms "treatment" and "treating" a patient refer to reducing, alleviating,
 stopping, blocking, or preventing the symptoms of pain and/or inflammation in a patient.

WO 2012/019009                                                                PCT/US2011/046601
 As used herein, "treatment" and "treating" includes partial alleviation of symptoms as well
 as complete alleviation of the symptoms for a time period. The time period can be hours,
 days, months, or even years.
 [00151]      By an "effective" amount or a "therapeutically effective amount" of a drug or
 pharmacologically active agent is meant a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the drug or
 agent to provide the desired effect, e.g., analgesia. An appropriate "effective" amount in
 any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine
 experimentation.
 [00152]      "Site of a patient's pain" refers to any area within a body causing pain, e.g., a
 knee joint with osteoarthritis, nerve root causing sciatic pain, nerve fibers growing into
 annular tears in discs causing back pain, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, for example
 TMJ pain associated with temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) or pain radiating from
 epidural or perineural spaces. The pain perceived by the patient may result from
 inflammatory responses, mechanical stimuli, chemical stimuli, thermal stimuli, as well as
 allodynia.
 [00153]      Additionally, the site of a patient's pain can comprise one or multiple sites in the
 spine, such as between the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar vertebrae, or can comprise one or
 multiple sites located within the immediate area of inflamed or injured joints such as the
 shoulder, hip, or otherjoints.
 [00154]      A "biocompatible" material refers to a material that is not toxic to the human
 body, it is not carcinogenic and it should induce limited or no inflammation in body tissues.
 A "biodegradable" material refers to a material that is degraded by bodily processes (e.g.,
 enzymatic) to products readily disposable by the body or absorbed into body tissue. The
 biodegraded products should also be biocompatible with the body. In the context of intra
 articular drug delivery systems for corticosteroids, such polymers may be used to fabricate,
 without limitation: microparticles, micro-spheres, matrices, microparticle matrices, micro
 sphere matrices, capsules, hydrogels, rods, wafers, pills, liposomes, fibers, pellets, or other
 appropriate pharmaceutical delivery compositions that a physician can administer into the
joint. The biodegradable polymers degrade into non-toxic residues that the body easily
 removes or break down or dissolve slowly and are cleared from the body intact. The
 polymers may be cured ex-vivo forming a solid matrix that incorporates the drug for
 controlled release to an inflammatory region. Suitable biodegradable polymers may
 include, without limitation natural or synthetic biocompatible biodegradable material.

 Natural polymers include, but are not limited to, proteins such as albumin, collagen, gelatin
 synthetic poly(aminoacids), and prolamines; glycosaminoglycans, such as hyaluronic acid
 and heparin; polysaccharides, such as alginates, chitosan, starch, and dextrans; and other
 naturally occurring or chemically modified biodegradable polymers. Synthetic

 copolymers, and PLGA-PEO-PLGA blends and copolymers thereof and any combinations
 thereof. The biocompatible biodegradable material can include a combination of
 biocompatible biodegradable materials. For example, the biocompatible biodegradable
 material can be a triblock, or other multi-block, formation where a combination of
 biocompatible biodegradable polymers are joined together. For example, the triblock can
 be PLGA-PEG-PLGA.

 Although these embodiments are exemplified with reference to treat joint pain associated
 with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and other joint disorders, it should not be inferred
 that the invention is only for these uses. Rather, it is contemplated that embodiments of the
 present invention will be useful for treating other forms of joint pain by administration into
 articular and periarticular spaces. In addition, it will be understood that for some
 embodiments injection near ajoint may be equivalent to injections in that joint. It is also
 contemplated that embodiments of the present invention may be useful for injection or
 administration into soft tissues or lesions. Any and all uses of specific words and references
 are simply to detail different embodiments of the present invention.
 [00157]     Local administration of a corticosteroid microparticle formulation can occur, for
 example, by injection into the intra-articular space, peri-articular space, soft tissues, lesions,
 epidural space, perineural space, or the foramenal space at or near the site of a patient's pain

 and/or structural tissue damage. Local injection of the formulations described herein into
 articular or periarticular spaces may be useful in the treatment of, for example, juvenile
 rheumatoid arthritis, sciatica and other forms of radicular pain (e.g., arm, neck, lumbar,
 thorax), psoriatic arthritis, acute gouty arthritis, Morton's neuroma, acute and subacute
 bursitis, acute and subacute nonspecific tenosynovitis and epicondylitis, acute rheumatic
 carditis and ankylosing spondylitis. Injection of the microparticles described herein into
 soft tissues or lesions may be useful in the treatment of, for example, alopecia areata,
 discoid lupus, erythematosus; keloids, localized hypertrophic, infiltrated inflammatory
 lesions of granuloma annulare, lichen planus, lichen simplex chronicus (neurodermatitis),
 psoriasis and psoriatic plaques; necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, and psoriatic arthritis.
 Injection of the microparticles described herein into epidural spaces may be useful in the
 treatment of, for example, neurogenic claudication. Intramuscular or other soft tissues or
 lesions injections may also be useful in providing systemic exposures that are effective in
 the control of incapacitating allergic conditions (including but not limited to asthma, atopic
 dermatitis, contact dermatitis, drug hypersensitivity reactions, seasonal or perennial allergic
 rhinitis, serum sickness, transfusion reactions), bullous dermatitis herpetiformis, exfoliative
 dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, pemphigus, severe erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson
 syndrome), Primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency in conjunction with
 mineralocorticoids where applicable; congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hypercalcemia
 associated with cancer, nonsupportive thyroiditis, exacerbations of regional enteritis and
 ulcerative colitis, acquired (autoimmune) hemolytic anemia, congenital (erythroid)
 hypoplastic anemia (Diamond blackfan anemia), pure red cell aplasia, select cases of
 secondary thrombocytopenia, trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement,
 tuberculous meningitis with subarachnoid block or impending block when used
 concurrently with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy, palliative management of
 leukemias and lymphomas, acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, cerebral edema
 associated with primary or metastatic brain tumor or craniotomy, to induce diuresis or
 remission of proteinuria in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, or to induce diuresis or remission
 of proteinuria in lupus erythematosus, berylliosis, symptomatic sarcoidosis, fulminating or
 disseminated pulmonary tuberculosis (when used concurrently with appropriate
 antituberculous chemotherapy), idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonias, symptomatic
 sarcoidosis, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, post
 operative pain and swelling.

 [00158]      In one embodiment, the corticosteroid microparticle formulations provided
 herein are useful in treating, alleviating a symptom of, ameliorating and/or delaying the
 progression of sciatica. In one embodiment, corticosteroid microparticle formulations
 provided herein are useful in treating, alleviating a symptom of, ameliorating and/or
 delaying the progression of temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD).
 [00159]      In one embodiment, the corticosteroid microparticle formulations provided
 herein are useful in treating, alleviating a symptom of, ameliorating and/or delaying the
 progression of neurogenic claudication secondary to lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). LSS
 implies spinal canal narrowing with possible subsequent neural compression (classified by
 anatomy or etiology). Neurogenic Claudication (NC) is a hallmark symptom of lumbar
 stenosis, in which the column of the spinal cord (or the canals that protect the nerve roots)
 narrows at the lower back. This narrowing can also occur in the spaces between the
 vertebrae where the nerves leave the spine to travel to other parts of the body.
 [00160]      The microparticles of the invention are used to treat, alleviate a symptom of,
 ameliorate and/or delay the progression patients suffering from NC secondary to LSS. The
 corticosteroid microparticle formulations can be administered, for example, by epidural
 steroid injection (ESI).
 [00161]      Administration of a corticosteroid microparticle formulation, e.g., a TCA
 microparticle formulation, to a patient suffering from an inflammatory disease such as
 osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, is considered successful if any of a variety of
 laboratory or clinical results is achieved. For example, administration of a corticosteroid
 microparticle formulation is considered successful if one or more of the symptoms
 associated with the disease is alleviated, reduced, inhibited or does not progress to a further,
 i.e., worse, state. Administration of a corticosteroid microparticle formulation is considered
 successful if the disease, e.g., an arthritic or other inflammatory disease, enters remission or
 does not progress to a further, i.e., worse, state.
 [00162]      Also, any and all alterations and further modifications of the invention, as would
 occur to one of ordinary skill in the art, are intended to be within the scope of the invention
 [00163]      Selection of Corticosteroids and Drug Dosage
 [00164]      Corticosteroids associated with embodiments of the present invention can be any
 naturally occurring or synthetic steroid hormone. Naturally occurring corticosteroids are
 secreted by the adrenal cortex or generally the human body.

 [00168]      Embodiments of the invention include using sustained release corticosteroids
 delivered to treat pain at dosages that do not adversely suppress the HPA axis. Such
 amounts delivered locally to relieve pain due to inflammation, will provide a systemic
 concentration that does not have a measurable adverse effect on the HPA axis (differences if
                                                46

 any are not significant because any such differences are within normal assay variability) or,
 as desired, may have a measurable but clinically insignificant effect on the HPA axis (basal
 cortisol is suppressed to some measurable extent but stress responses are adequately
 preserved). Further embodiments of the invention include doses during a second period of
 time selected to adjust for a change in sensitivity of the HPA axis to suppression following
 exposure during a first period of time to the corticosteroid (Figure 1).
 [00169]      Additional embodiments include doses during first and/or the second period of
 time selected to adjust for corticosteroid-specific (or corticosteroid- and potentially dose
 specific) changes in the rate of change of sensitivity of the HPA axis to suppression that
 begin with initial exposure. For clinically effective corticosteroids, the rate of change of the
 sensitivity of the HPA axis to exogenous corticosteroids is both non-uniform and non-linear
 (Figure 2). The rate and pattern of change in such sensitivity varies widely as a function of
 the particular corticosteroid that is selected (Figure 3).
 [00170]      Finally, it is possible to usefully characterize the change in sensitivity vs. time
 mathematically as the (non-linear, exponential) "decay" of the sensitivity from the initial to
 final value, wherein the decay parameters (Table 1) has been determined from the data
 further described herein.

 * The inhibition of endogenous cortisol synthesis can be related to the exogenous
 corticosteroid concentration by the following equations:
     1. E = (EmaxeC")/[(ECo)"+ C"] wherein E = effect, Emax = maximal effect, C =
         concentration of exogenous corticosteroid, EC50 = concentration at 12 Emax, and n =
         the Hill ("shape", or "slope") factor; and
     2.  EC5o -  final= EC 5 o -initial+ [EC5 o -final - EC 50 - initial] * [1 - e(6atime>]
 [00171]      Using this approach permits the determination of "6", the parameter describing
 the exponential decay from the initial to the final EC50 . Minimization of least-squares
 differences was utilized to obtain the best-fit 6.

 [00172]     These new findings regarding the rate and pattern of change of sensitivity to
 inhibition and the lack of predictability of such rates and patterns on the basis of, for
 example, steroid potency, have significant implications for clinically appropriate dose
 selection. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the importance of a changing sensitivity to
 HPA axis suppression and will also appreciate both the complexity and counterintuitive
 aspects of several of these new findings (Table 1).
 [00173]     As a result of these clinical findings, the dose range to achieve clinically useful
 analgesia, with minimal or controlled modulation of the HPA axis, at steady state
 concentrations of various corticosteroids has been determined (Table 2). In particular, it
 appears that the daily corticosteroid doses at steady state concentrations, are approximately
 3- to 7- times greater than are predicted by prior art (Meibohm, 1999).

 [00174]      That higher doses of corticosteroids can be administered successfully by intra
 articular injection, maximizing the likelihood of observing anti-inflammatory and analgesic
 responses while minimizing or eliminating adverse events from HPA axis suppression or
 otherwise excessive tissue exposure, is of profound clinical consequence for improving the
 treatment of patients with arthritis.
 [00175]     In addition, with these continuous daily doses of intra-articular corticosteroids, it
 is possible to determine the related systemic plasma level concentrations (Table 3) that will
 produce the target cortisol inhibition and not beyond, this while retaining clinically
 important anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity within the joint. These plasma
 concentrations were predicted on the basis of data from short term (i.e., less than 8 days)
 exposure to corticosteroids. With longer exposure to corticosteroids, the "decay" (i.e.,
 decline) of the sensitivity to corticosteroids may continue resulting in values higher than
 those listed in Table 3. The levels calculated in Table 3 were purely hypothetical
 calculations based on human data with immediate release-level doses from the literature.
 With sustained release dosages, more drug may be able to be delivered without seeing an
 increased level of cortisol inhibition after the initial burst period. A given level of plasma
 concentration may actually provide less inhibition that would have been predicted or
 calculated using the human IR levels from the literature.

 [00176]      The studies presented herein demonstrate for the first time the discovery of the
 time-course of changes in sensitivity of the HPA axis to exogenous corticosteroids. In
 addition, both the mean doses and mean plasma levels shown in Tables 2 and 3 above are
 those after steady state has been achieved, requiring approximately 4 to 24 days depending
 upon the corticosteroid in question. The companion post-dose but pre-steady-state
 transients for several corticosteroids have been described in Figures 2, 3, and 4. It is also
 important to note that the data suggest that the carefully controlled benefits from the intra
 articular, sustained release of a corticosteroid of interest will persist as long as release
 continues.
 [00177]      In one preferred embodiment, a single component sustained release formulation
 releases a dose (in mg/day) that suppresses the HPA axis by no more than between 5 - 40%
 at steady state as shown in Table 2, more preferably no more than between 10 - 35% at
 steady state as shown in Table 2. These doses are therapeutically effective without adverse
 side effects.
 [00178]      In another preferred embodiment, a single component sustained release
 formulation releases a dose (in mg/day) that does not measurably suppress the HPA axis at
 steady state. These doses are therapeutically effective without adverse side effects.

 [00181]     The manufacture of microparticles or methods of making biodegradable polymer
 microparticles are known in the art. Microparticles from any of the biodegradable polymers
 listed below can be made by, but not limited to, spray drying, solvent evaporation, phase
 separation, spray drying, fluidized bed coating or combinations thereof.
 [00182]     In certain embodiments of the invention, the microparticles are made from a
 biodegradable polymer that may include, without limitation, natural or synthetic
 biocompatible biodegradable materials. Natural polymers include, but are not limited to,
 proteins such as albumin, collagen, gelatin synthetic poly(aminoacids), and prolamines;

WO 2012/019009                                                                PCT/US2011/046601
 glycosaminoglycans, such as hyaluronic acid and heparin; polysaccharides, such as
 alginates, chitosan, starch, and dextrans; and other naturally occurring or chemically
 modified biodegradable polymers. Synthetic biocompatible biodegradable materials
 include, but are not limited to the group comprising of, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA),
 polylactide (PLA), polyglycolide (PG), polyhydroxybutyric acid, poly(trimethylene
 carbonate), polycaprolactone (PCL), polyvalerolactone, poly(alpha-hydroxy acids),
 poly(lactones), poly(amino-acids), poly(anhydrides), polyketals poly(arylates),
 poly(orthoesters), poly(orthocarbonates), poly(phosphoesters), poly(ester-co-amide),
 poly(lactide-co-urethane, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA-g
 PLGA, PEGT-PBT copolymer(polyactive), polyurethanes, polythioesters, methacrylates,
 poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), PEO-PPO-PEO (pluronics), PEO-PPO-PAA copolymers, and
 PLGA-PEO-PLGA blends and copolymers thereof, multi-block polymer configurations
 such as PLGA-PEG-PLGA, and any combinations thereof. These polymers may be used in
 making controlled release or sustained release compositions disclosed herein.
 [00183]     In a preferred embodiment, the microparticles are formed from poly(d,l-lactic
 co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), which is commercially available from a number of sources.
 Biodegradable PLGA copolymers are available in a wide range of molecular weights and
 ratios of lactic to glycolic acid. If not purchased from a supplier, then the biodegradable
 PLGA copolymers may be prepared by the procedure set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,293,539
 (Ludwig, et al.), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
 Ludwig prepares such copolymers by condensation of lactic acid and glycolic acid in the
 presence of a readily removable polymerization catalyst (e.g., a strong acid ion-exchange
 resin such as Dowex HCR-W2-H). However, any suitable method known in the art of
 making the polymer can be used.
 [00184]     In the coacervation process, a suitable biodegradable polymer is dissolved in an
 organic solvent. Suitable organic solvents for the polymeric materials include, but are not
 limited to acetone, halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform and methylene chloride,
 aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as
 chlorobenzene, and cyclic ethers such as dioxane. The organic solvent containing a suitable
 biodegradable polymer is then mixed with a non-solvent such as silicone based solvent. By
 mixing the miscible non -solvent in the organic solvent, the polymer precipitates out of
 solution in the form of liquid droplets. The liquid droplets are then mixed with another non
 solvent, such as heptane or petroleum ether, to form the hardened microparticles. The
                                                 52

WO 2012/019009                                                               PCT/US2011/046601
 microparticles are then collected and dried. Process parameters such as solvent and non
 solvent selections, polymer/solvent ratio, temperatures, stirring speed and drying cycles are
 adjusted to achieve the desired particle size, surface smoothness, and narrow particle size
 distribution.
 [00185]      In the phase separation or phase inversion procedures entrap dispersed agents in
 the polymer to prepare microparticles. Phase separation is similar to coacervation of a
 biodegradable polymer. By addition of a nonsolvent such as petroleum ether, to the organic
 solvent containing a suitable biodegradable polymer, the polymer is precipitates from the
 organic solvent to form microparticles.
 [00186]      In the salting out process, a suitable biodegradable polymer is dissolved in an
 aqueous miscible organic solvent. Suitable water miscible organic solvents for the
 polymeric materials include, but are not limited to acetone, as acetone, acetonitrile, and
 tetrahydrofuran. The water miscible organic solvent containing a suitable biodegradable
 polymer is then mixed with an aqueous solution containing salt. Suitable salts include, but
 are not limited to electrolytes such as magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, or magnesium
 acetate and non-electrolytes such as sucrose. The polymer precipitates from the organic
 solvent to form microparticles, which are collected and dried. Process parameters such as
 solvent and salt selection, polymer/solvent ratio, temperatures, stirring speed and drying
 cycles are adjusted to achieve the desired particle size, surface smoothness, and narrow
 particle size distribution.
 [00187]      Alternatively, the microparticles may be prepared by the process of Ramstack et
 al., 1995, described in published international patent application WO 95/13799, the
 disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. The Ramstack et al. process
 essentially provides for a first phase, including an active agent and a polymer, and a second
 phase, that are pumped through a static mixer into a quench liquid to form microparticles
 containing the active agent. The first and second phases can optionally be substantially
 immiscible and the second phase is preferably free from solvents for the polymer and the
 active agent and includes an aqueous solution of an emulsifier.
 [00188]      In the spray drying process, a suitable biodegradable polymer is dissolved in an
 organic solvent and then sprayed through nozzles into a drying environment provided with
 sufficient elevated temperature and/or flowing air to effectively extract the solvent. Adding
 surfactants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate can improve the surface smoothness of the
 microparticles.

WO 2012/019009                                                                PCT/US2011/046601
 [00189]      Alternatively, a suitable biodegradable polymer can be dissolved or dispersed in
 supercritical fluid, such as carbon dioxide. The polymer is either dissolved in a suitable
 organic solvent, such as methylene chloride, prior to mixing in a suitable supercritical fluid
 or directly mixed in the supercritical fluid and then sprayed through a nozzle. Process
 parameters such as spray rate, nozzle diameter, polymer/solvent ratio, and temperatures, are
 adjusted to achieve the desired particle size, surface smoothness, and narrow particle size
 distribution.
 [00190]      In a fluidized bed coating, the drug is dissolved in an organic solvent along with
 the polymer. The solution is then processed, e.g., through a Wurster air suspension coating
 apparatus to form the final microcapsule product.
 [00191]      The microparticles can be prepared in a size distribution range suitable for local
 infiltration or injection. The diameter and shape of the microparticles can be manipulated to
 modify the release characteristics. In addition, other particle shapes, such as, for example,
 cylindrical shapes, can also modify release rates of a sustained release corticosteroid by
 virtue of the increased ratio of surface area to mass inherent to such alternative geometrical
 shapes, relative to a spherical shape. The microparticles have a mass mean diameter
 ranging between about 0.5 to 500 microns. In a preferred embodiment, the microparticles
 have a mass mean diameter of between 10 to about 100 microns.
 [00192]      Biodegradable polymer microparticles that deliver sustained release
 corticosteroids may be suspended in suitable aqueous or non-aqueous carriers which may
 include, but is not limited to water, saline, pharmaceutically acceptable oils, low melting
 waxes, fats, lipids, liposomes and any other pharmaceutically acceptable substance that is
 lipophilic, substantially insoluble in water, and is biodegradable and/or eliminatable by
 natural processes of a patient's body. Oils of plants such as vegetables and seeds are
 included. Examples include oils made from corn, sesame, cannoli, soybean, castor, peanut,
 olive, arachis, maize, almond, flax, safflower, sunflower, rape, coconut, palm, babassu, and
 cottonseed oil; waxes such as carnoba wax, beeswax, and tallow; fats such as triglycerides,
 lipids such as fatty acids and esters, and liposomes such as red cell ghosts and phospholipid
 layers.
 Corticosteroid Loading of and Release from Biodegradable Polymer Microparticles
 [00193]      When an intra-articularly delivered corticosteroid is incorporated into a
 biodegradable polymer for sustained release into a joint at a dosage that does not suppress
                                                 54

WO 2012/019009                                                               PCT/US2011/046601
 the HPA axis, preferred loadings of said corticosteroid are from about 5% to about 40%
 (w/w) of the polymer, preferably about 5% to about 30%, more preferably about 5 % to
 about 28% of the polymer.
 [00194]      As the biodegradable polymers undergo gradual bio-erosion within the joint, the
 corticosteroid is released to the inflammatory site. The pharmacokinetic release profile of
 the corticosteroid by the biodegradable polymer may be first order, zero order, bi- or multi
 phasic, to provide desired treatment of inflammatory related pain. In any pharmacokinetic
 event, the bio-erosion of the polymer and subsequent release of the corticosteroid may result
 in a controlled release of a corticosteroid from the polymer matrix. The rate of release at
 dosages that do not suppress the HPA axis are described above.
 Excipients
 [00195]      The release rate of the corticosteroid from a biodegradable polymer matrix can
 be modulated or stabilized by adding a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient to the
 formulation. An excipient may include any useful ingredient added to the biodegradable
 polymer depot that is not a corticosteroid or a biodegradable polymer. Pharmaceutically
 acceptable excipients may include without limitation lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol,
 mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium
 silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, PEG, polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80,
 polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, saline, syrup, methyl cellulose, and carboxymethyl
 cellulose. An excipient for modulating the release rate of a corticosteroid from the
 biodegradable drug depot may also include without limitation pore formers, pH modifiers,
 reducing agents, antioxidants, and free radical scavengers.
 Delivery of Corticosteroid Microparticles
 [00196]      Parenteral administration of formulations of the invention can be effected by
 intra-articular injection or other injection using a needle. To inject the microparticles into a
joint, needles having a gauge of about 14-28 gauge are suitable. It will be appreciated by
 those skilled in the art that formulations of the present invention may be delivered to a
 treatment site by other conventional methods, including catheters, infusion pumps, pens
 devices, injection guns and the like.

                                           EXAMPLES
 [00198]      The present invention is further defined in the following Examples. It should be
 understood that these Examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention,
 are given by way of illustration only. From the above discussion and these Examples, one
 skilled in the art can ascertain the essential characteristics of this invention, and without
 departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and modifications of
 the invention to adapt it to various uses and conditions.
 EXAMPLE 1: Sustained-Release Betamethasone or Triamcinolone Acetonide
 Microparticles
 [00199]      In one embodiment, the microparticle formulation contains a copolymer of DL
 lactide (or L-lactide) and glycolide in a 45:55 molar ratio (up to 75:25 molar ratio) with an
 inherent viscosity ranging from 0.15 to 0.60 dL/g with either an ester or acid end group plus
 either the corticosteroid betamethasone or triamcinolone acetonide. If betamethasone is
 used, then the betamethasone is in the form of either betamethasone acetate, betamethasone
 diproprionate or a combination thereof. The total amount of betamethasone or
 triamcinolone acetonide incorporated into the microparticle ranges from 10% to 30% (w/w).
 The microparticles are formulated to mean mass range in size from 10 to 100 microns. The
 population of microparticles is formulated to be delivered through a 19 gauge or higher
 needle. Additional excipients may be added such as, but not limited to,
 carboxymethylcellulose sodium, mannitol, polysorbate-80, sodium phosphate, sodium
 chloride, polyethylene glycol to achieve isotonicity and promote syringeability. If
 betamethasone is used, then the betamethasone incorporated into the microparticle
 population provides an initial release (burst) of about 5-20 mg of drug over a period of 1 to
  12 hours, followed by a steady state release of drug at a rate of about 0.1 to 1.0 mg/day over
 a period of 14 to 90 days. If triamcinolone acetonide is used, then the drug incorporated
 into the microparticle population provides an initial release (burst) of about 10-40 mg of
 drug over a period of I to 12 hours, followed by a steady state release of drug at a rate of
 about 0.2 to 1.7 mg/day over a period of 14 to 90 days.

 EXAMPLE 2: Sustained-Release Betamethasone or Triamcinolone Acetonide
 Microparticles with an Immediate Release Form
 [00200]      In another embodiment, the microparticle formulation of Example 1 is further
 admixed with an immediate release betamethasone or triamcinolone acetonide component,
 such as a betamethasone or triamcinolone acetonide containing solution. If betamethasone
 is used, then the betamethasone in the immediate release component is in the form of either
 betamethasone acetate, betamethasone diproprionate or a combination thereof. If
 betamethasone is used, then the immediate release component provides an initial release of
 a total of about 5 to 20 mg of betamethasone over the first 1-10 days, while the sustained
 release component releases betamethasone at a rate of about 0.1 to 1.0 mg/day over the first
  14 to 90 days following administration. If triamcinolone acetonide is used, then the
 immediate release component provides an initial release of a total of 10 to 40 mg of drug
 over the first 1-10 days, while the sustained release component releases drug at a rate of
 about 0.2 to 1.7 mg/day over the first 14 to 90 days following administration.
 EXAMPLE 3: Determination of Time-Variance in HPA Axis Sensitivity
 [00201]      Adult volunteers (N = 4 to 9 per group) give appropriate informed consent.
 Each individual in each group receives a single intra-articular administration of an
 exogenous corticosteroid (triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg; triamcinolone hexacetonide 20;
 betamethasone 7 mg (disodium phosphate 4 mg / acetate 3 mg). Blood samples for
 measurement of corticosteroid concentrations and/or cortisol concentrations are drawn at 8
 AM at baseline and on days 1, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 21. The extent of suppression of
 endogenous cortisol was measured in each subject in each group. The extent of cortisol
 suppression predicted by previously published models (Meibohm, 1999) was determined
 and compared to observations (Figure 4 Column 1). The change (decrease) in HPA axis
 sensitivity vs. time is then determined on a day-by-day and final basis (Figure 4, Column 2),
 permitting determination of the correct steady-state intra-articular doses of corticosteroid to
 achieve, or limit, HPA axis suppression to the desired level.

 750 mg of PLGA (lactide: glycolide molar ratio of 75:25, inherent viscosity of 0.4 dL/g and
 molecular weight of 54 kDa) were dispersed in 14.25 grams of dichloromethane. The
 dispersion was atomized into micro-droplets by adding the dispersion to the feed well of a
 rotating disk, rotating at a speed of approximately 3300 rpm inside a temperature controlled
 chamber maintained at 38-45'C. The solvent was evaporated to produce solid
 microparticles. The microparticles were collected using a cyclone separator and,
 subsequently, sieved through a 150 pm sieve.
 [00204]     Particle size of the TCA incorporated microparticles was determined using laser
 diffraction (Malvern Mastersizer 2000) by dispersing a 250 mg aliquot in water, with the
 refractive index (RI) for water and PLGA, set at 1.33 and 1.46 respectively. Sonication was
 maintained as the sample was stirred at 2500 rpm and measurements taken every 15
 seconds, with the average of three measurements reported. 10 mg of TCA containing
 microparticles were added to 10 mL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), mixed until dissolved
 and an aliquot analyzed by HPLC to determine the microparticle drug load. Another 4 mg
 of TCA containing microparticles were suspended in 20 mL of phosphate buffered saline
 (PBS) containing 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) maintained at 37 0 C. 0.5 mL of the
 media was removed at regular intervals, replaced at each interval with an equivalent amount
 of fresh media to maintain a constant volume, and analyzed by HPLC to determine
 microparticle in vitro release. Analysis by HPLC was conducted using a C18 (Waters
 Nova-Pack C-18, 3.9 x 150 mm) and 35% acetonitrile mobile phase at 1 ml/min flow rate
 with UV detection at 240 nm. The results are shown in Table 5.

 [00205]     The in vitro cumulative release profile is graphed in Figure 5.
 [00206]     In one iteration of these data, the amount of TCA released per day was
 calculated based on a human dose, as exemplified in Table 2, that would achieve a transient
 suppression of endogenous cortisol (greater than 50%) and, within 14 days, achieve cortisol
 suppression of endogenous cortisol of less than 35% as shown in Figure 6. In a second
 iteration of these data, the amount of triamcinolone acetonide released per day was
 calculated based on a human dose, as exemplified in Table 2 that would not suppress the
 HPA axis, i.e. endogenous cortisol suppression never exceeding 35% as shown in Figure 7.
 These calculated doses equal 376 mg of microparticles containing 94 mg of TCA and 80 mg
 of microparticles containing 20 mg of TCA, respectively.
 [00207]     In a second preparation of the same formulation, analyzed and in vitro release
 plotted in the same manner, the results are equivalent as shown in Table 6, and Figures 8, 9
 and 10. The calculated human dose, as exemplified in Table 2 that would achieve a
 transient suppression of endogenous cortisol (greater than 50%) and, within 14 days,
 achieve cortisol suppression of endogenous cortisol of less than 35% equals 280 mg of
 microparticles containing 70 mg of TCA. The calculated human dose, as exemplified in
 Table 2 that would not suppress the HPA axis, i.e. endogenous cortisol suppression never
 exceeding 35% equals 68 mg of microparticles containing 17 mg of TCA.

 [00208      Influence of PEG on PLGA 75:25 Formulations: In other suitable formulations,
 polyethylene glycol was added to the PLGA 75:25 polymers while keeping the target
 amount of triamcinolone acetonide constant. PEG/PLGA blends are known to allow for
 more complete and faster release of pharmaceutical agents incorporated into microparticles
 than PLGA alone (Cleek et al. "Microparticles of poly(DL-lactic-coglycolic
 acid)/poly(ethylene glycol) blends for controlled drug delivery." J ControlRelease 48
 (1997): 259-268; Morlock, et al. "Erythropoietin loaded microspheres prepared from
 biodegradable LPLG-PEO-LPLG triblock copolymers: protein stabilization and in-vitro

 [00211]     The in vitro cumulative release profile is graphed in Figure 11 and Figure 12.
 PEG did not seem to enhance the release of the TCA in either formulation, as would be
 expected. In fact, at higher percentages of PEG, albeit a different molecular weight (higher
 percentages of PEG 1350 were unmanageable due to the agglomeration of microparticles),
 the release rate was slower.
 [00212]     In one iteration of these in vitro release data, the amount of TCA released per
 day was calculated based on a human dose, as exemplified in Table 2, that would achieve a
 temporary suppression of endogenous cortisol (greater than 50%) and, within 14 days,
 achieve cortisol suppression of endogenous cortisol of less than 35% as shown in Figure 13

 and 88 mg of microparticles containing 22 mg of TCA, respectively.
 [00213]     Other TCA containing formulations were tried with PEG and PLGA 75:25
 without success. A PLGA microparticle formulation containing 25% TCA and 25% PEG
  1450 agglomerated during manufacture and storage. Another PLGA formulation containing
 4 0%   TCA and 15% PEG 1450 gave similar results to the microparticles containing 4 0%
 TCA and no PEG.

 [00215]     The in vitro cumulative release profiles for these four other TCA containing
 PLGA 75:25 microparticle depots are graphed in Figure 17, along with the preferred
 formulation (25% TCA). The tabulated data and graph show the impact of the percent TCA
 incorporated in the PLGA microparticles on the in vitro release profile. The 10%, 15% and
 20% TCA containing PLGA microparticles exhibit a slower release profile, with a
 significant less cumulative release over 28 days, less than 20%, 30% and 55% respectively,
 than the 25% TCA PLGA depot exemplified in Example 4. The 40% TCA containing
 depot exhibits a faster release profile, with greater than 80% of the triamcinolone released
 by day 7 with a similar total cumulative release, than the 25% TCA PLGA depot
 exemplified in Example 4.
 [00216]     Influence of Molecular Weight on TCA PLGA 75:25 Microparticle
 Formulations: In another microparticle formulation, triamcinolone acetonide was
 incorporated in PLGA of the same lactide to glycolide molar ratio as cited in Example 4 but
 of a lower molecular weight. Low molecular weight PLGA is known to allow for more
 complete and faster release of pharmaceutical agents incorporated into microparticles than
 their higher molecular weight counterparts. (Anderson et al. "Biodegradation and
 biocompatibility of PLA and PLGA microspheres." Advanced DrugDelivery Reviews 28
 (1997): 5-24; Bouissou et al., "Poly(lactic-co-glycolicacid) Microspheres." Polymer in Drug
 Delivery (2006): Chapter 7).
 [00217]     250 mg of triamcinolone acetonide and 750 mg of PLGA (lactide: glycolide
 molar ratio of 75:25, inherent viscosity of 0.27 dL/g and molecular weight of 29 kDa) were
 dispersed in 14.25 grams of dichloromethane. The dispersion was atomized into micro

 approximately 3300 rpm inside a temperature controlled chamber maintained at 38-45'C.
 The solvent was evaporated to produce solid microparticles. The microparticles were
 collected using a cyclone separator and, subsequently, sieved through a 150 pm sieve.
 [00218]     Particle size of the TCA incorporated microparticles was determined using laser
 diffraction (Malvern Mastersizer 2000) by dispersing a 250 mg aliquot in water, with the
 refractive index (RI) for water and PLGA, set at 1.33 and 1.46 respectively. Sonication was
 maintained as the sample was stirred at 2500 rpm and measurements taken every 15
 seconds, with the average of three measurements reported. 10 mg of TCA containing
 microparticles were added to 10 mL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), mixed until dissolved
 and an aliquot analyzed by HPLC to determine the microparticle drug load. Another 4 mg
 of TCA containing microparticles were suspended in 20 mL of phosphate buffered saline
 (PBS) containing 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) maintained at 370 C. 0.5 mL of the
 media was removed at regular intervals, replaced at each interval with an equivalent amount
 of fresh media to maintain a constant volume, and analyzed by HPLC to determine
 microparticle in vitro release. Analysis by HPLC was conducted using a C18 (Waters
 Nova-Pack C-18, 3.9 x 150 mm) and 35% acetonitrile mobile phase at 1 ml/min flow rate
 with UV detection at 240 nm. The results are shown in Table 9.

 PLGA (29 kDa) did not improve the release of the triamcinolone acetonide from the
 microparticles as expected, in fact the rate of release decreased and the release was
 incomplete as compared to higher molecular weight PLGA (PLGA, 54 kDa).
 [00220]      In another formulation of low molecular weight PLGA 75:25(29 kDa),
 polyethylene glycol, 10% PEG 3350, was added while maintaining the same amount of
 triamcinolone acetonide. As shown with other PEG containing formulations, there was no
 impact of this additive on the cumulative percent in vitro release profile as compared to the
 formulation not containing PEG (data not shown).
 [00221]      Influence ofPLGA Lactide to Glycolide Ratio: In other triamcinolone acetonide
 microparticle formulations, PLGA of equimolar lactide to glycolide ratio were employed
 instead of PLGA (75:25). PLGA (50:50) is known to allow for faster degradation and
 release of pharmaceutical agents incorporated into microparticles than PLGA's with greater
 lactide versus glycolide content (Anderson et al. "Biodegradation and biocompatibility of
 PLA and PLGA microspheres." Advanced DrugDelivery Reviews 28 (1997): 5-24;
 Bouissou et al., "Poly(lactic-co-glycolicacid) Microspheres." Polymer in Drug Delivery
 (2006): Chapter 7). Multiple formulations using PLGA 50:50 with differing amounts of
 triamcinolone acetonide, with and without PEG, different PLGA molecular weights and
 different PLGA endcaps were exemplified.
 [00222]      Formulations were prepared with 200 mg, 250 mg, 300 mg and 350 mg of
 triamcinolone acetonide and corresponding amount of PLGA (lactide: glycolide molar ratio
 of 50:50, inherent viscosity of 0.48 dL/g and molecular weight of 66 kDa) to yield 1000 mg
 total solids were dispersed into a quantity of dichloromethane to a achieve a 5% PLGA
 solution. In another iteration, 300 mg of triamcinolone acetonide, 100 mg of polyethylene
 glycol (PEG 3350) and 650 mg of PLGA (lactide: glycolide molar ratio of 50:50, inherent
 viscosity of 0.48 dL/g and molecular weight of 66 kDa) were dispersed in 14.25 grams of
 dichloromethane. In another iteration, 300 mg of triamcinolone acetonide and 700 mg of
 PLGA (lactide: glycolide molar ratio of 50:50, inherent viscosity of 0.18 dL/g and
 molecular weight of 18 kDa) to yield 1000 mg total solids were dispersed in 14.25 grams of
 dichloromethane. The dispersions were atomized into micro-droplets by adding the
 dispersion to the feed well of a rotating disk, rotating at a speed of approximately 3300 rpm
 inside a temperature controlled chamber maintained at 38-45'C. The solvent was
 evaporated to produce solid microparticles. The microparticles were collected using a
 cyclone separator and, subsequently, sieved through a 150 pm sieve.

 [00224]     In-vitro release profiles of the various PLGA (50:50) formulations are shown in
 the Figure 19. The use of PLGA (50:50) did not improve the release kinetics of the
 triamcinolone acetonide as compared to the PLGA (75:25). Unexpectedly, 25%
 triamcinolone acetonide microparticles in PLGA (50:50) release the corticosteroid at a
 slower rate and give an incomplete release as compared to the equivalent amount of
 triamcinolone acetonide incorporated in PLGA 75:25. All the PLGA 50:50 formulation
 show a substantial lag phase, where little or any TCA is being released after 7 days, which
 continues to about day 50. As observed with TCA PLGA 75:25 formulations, increasing

 the amount of TCA increases the rate of release and allows for more TCA to be released
 before entering the lag phase. Similarly, the addition of PEG has minimal influence on the
 release rate of TCA, while lower molecular weight PLGA 50:50 decrease the release rate as
 observed with PLGA 75:25 formulations.
 [00225]     Based on the studies described herein, the Class B corticosteroid microparticle
 formulations, for example, the TCA microparticle formulations, exhibiting the desired
 release kinetics have the following characteristics: (i) the corticosteroid is between 22%
 28% of the microparticle; and (ii) the polymer is PLGA having a molecular weight in the
 range of about 40 to 70 kDa, having an inherent viscosity in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 dL/g,
 and or having a lactide:glycolide molar ratio of 80:20 to 60:40.
 EXAMPLE 5: Preparation of Triamcinolone Acetonide PLGA Microparticles by Solid
 in Oil in Water (S/O/W) Emulsion
 [00226]     A pharmaceutical depot was prepared comprised of the corticosteroid,
 triamcinolone acetonide (TCA, 9ac-Fluoro- 11 P,16a, 17a,2 1-tetrahydroxy- 1,4-pregnadiene
 3,20-dione 16,17-acetonide; 9a.-Fluoro-16a-hydroxyprednisolone 16a,1 7a-acetonide)
 incorporated into microparticles.
 [00227]     Formulations were prepared by dissolving approximately 1 gram of PLGA in
 6.67 mL of dichloromethane (DCM). To the polymer solution, 400 mg of triamcinolone
 acetonide was added and sonicated. Subsequently, the corticosteroid containing dispersion
 was poured into 200 mL of 0.3% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution while homogenizing
 with a Silverson homogenizer using a rotor fixed with a Silverson Square Hole High Shear
 ScreenTM, set to rotate at approximately 2,000 rpm to form the microparticles. After two
 minutes, the beaker was removed, and a glass magnetic stirrer) added to the beaker, which
 was then placed onto a multi-way magnetic stirrer and stirred for four hours at 300 rpm to
 evaporate the DCM. The microparticles were then washed with 2 liters of distilled water,
 sieved through a 100 micron screen. The microparticles were then lyophilized for greater
 than 96 hours and vacuum packed.
 [00228]     Particle size of the TCA incorporated microparticles was determined using laser
 diffraction (Beckman Coulter LS 230) by dispersing a 50 mg aliquot in water, with the
 refractive index (RI) for water and PLGA, set at 1.33 and 1.46 respectively. The sample
 was stirred at the particle size measurement measurements taken and the results reported.
 Drug load was determined by suspending a nominal 10 mg of microparticles in 8ml HPLC
                                               68

 grade methanol and sonicating for 2 hours. Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000g for
  15 mins before an aliquot of the supernatant was assayed via HPLC as described below.
 Corticosteroid-loaded microparticle samples, nominally 1 g were placed in 22 ml glass vials
 in 8- 20ml of 0.5% v/v Tween 20 in 100mM phosphate buffered saline and stored in a 370 C
 incubator with magnetic stirring at 130 rpm. Each test sample was prepared and analyzed in
 duplicate to monitor possible variability. At each time point in the release study,
 microparticles were allowed to settle, and an aliquot of between 4-1 6 ml of supernatant
 were taken, and replaced with an equal volume of fresh 0.5% v/v Tween 20 in 100mM
 phosphate buffered saline. Drug load and in vitro release samples were analyzed by HPLC
 using a Hypersil C18 column (100mm, i.d. 5mm, particle size 5 pm; ThermoFisher) and
 Beckman HPLC. All samples were run using a sample injection volume of 5pm, and
 column temperature of 40 'C. An isocratic mobile phase of 60% methanol and 40% water
 was used at a flow rate of 1ml/min, with detection at a wavelength of 254nm.
 [00229]       In one group of suitable thirty day formulations, the PLGA is an ester end
 capped PLGA (lactide: glycolide molar ratio of 75:25, inherent viscosity of 0.71 dL/g and
 molecular weight of 114 kDa) with 10% or 20% triblock (TB) polymer (PLGA-PEG
 PLGA). Triblock polymer was synthesized using a method described by Zentner et al 2001
 (Zentner et al. "Biodegradable block copolymers for delivery of proteins and water
 insoluble drugs." J Control Release 72 (2001): 203-15) and refined by Hou et al 2008 (Hou
 et al., "In situ gelling hydrogels incorporating microparticles as drug delivery carriers for
 regenerative medicine." J Pharm Sci 97(9) (2008): 3972-80). It is synthesized using a ring
 opening polymerization of cyclic dimmers of D,L-lactide and glycolide with PEG 1,500
 kDa in the presence of stannous octoate. In vitro release (lactide: glycolide molar ratio of
 50:50, inherent viscosity of 0.40 dL/g and molecular weight of 66 kDa). The analytical
 results for these formulations are shown in Table 11.

 [00234]     In one iteration of these in vitro release data, the amount of TCA released per
 day was calculated based on a human dose, as exemplified in Table 2, which may achieve a
 temporary suppression of endogenous cortisol (greater than 50%) and, within 14 days,
 achieve cortisol suppression of endogenous cortisol of less than 35%. This calculated dose
 equals 317 mg of microparticles containing 46 mg of TCA. In a second iteration of these
 data, the amount of TCA released per day was calculated based on a human dose, as
 exemplified in Table 2, that would not have an suppress the HPA axis, i.e. endogenous
 cortisol suppression more than 35%. This calculated dose equals 93 mg of microparticles
 containing 14 mg of TCA.
 [00235]     Several other triamcinolone acetonide PLGA depots were formulated in the
 same manner as described above with different polymers including polycaprolactone (14
 kDa), PLGA 50:50 (carboxylic acid end-capped, 0.44 dL/g, MW 56 kDa), PLGA 85:15
 (carboxylic acid end-capped, 0.43 dL/g, 56 kDa) and a mixed molecular weight formulation
 using PLGA 75:25 (carboxylic acid end capped, 0.27 dL/g, MW 29 kDa) and PLGA 75:25
 (ester end-capped, 0.57 dL/g, MW 86 kDa) in a two to one ratio. The in vitro cumulative
 percent release of triamcinolone acetonide is shown in Figure 28. None of these
 formulations were suitable for a nominal thirty day or longer duration pharmaceutical depot.
 Polycaprolactone release all the triamcinolone acetonide prior to 14 days. The PLGA 50:50
 microparticles released about 35% of its content by day 12 and then entered a lag phase
 where no drug was released up to 30 days. The PLGA 85:15 microparticles exhibited
 similar in vitro release kinetics as the PLGA 50:50,releasing about 30% of its content by
 day 12 and then entered a lag phase where no drug was released up to 30 days (See Figure
 28). A similar phenomenon is seen as shown in Example 4, where the mixed molecular
 weight PLGA 75:25 unexpectedly exhibits faster initial release of the triamcinolone
 acetonide than PLGA 50:50.
 [00236]     Based on the studies described herein, the Class B corticosteroid microparticle
 formulations, for example, the TCA microparticle formulations, exhibiting the desired

 EXAMPLE 6: Preparation of Prednisolone PLGA Microparticles by Solid in Oil in
 Water (S/0/W) Emulsion
 [00237]     A pharmaceutical depot was prepared comprised of the corticosteroid,
 prednisolone (PRED, 11 B,17,21 -trihydroxypregna- 1,4-diene-3,20- dione) incorporated into
 microparticles in PLGA 50:50.
 [00238]     Formulations were prepared by dissolving approximately 1 gram of PLGA 50:50
 (lactide: glycolide molar ratio of 50:50, inherent viscosity 0.44 dL/g, MW 56 kDa) in 6.67
 mL of dichloromethane (DCM). To the polymer solution, 400 mg of prednisolone was
 added and sonicated. Subsequently, the corticosteroid containing dispersion was poured
 into 200 mL of 0.3% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution while homogenizing with a
 Silverson homogenizer using a rotor fixed with a Silverson Square Hole High Shear
 ScreenTM, set to spin at 2,000 rpm to form the microparticles. After two minutes, the beaker
 was removed, and a glass magnetic stirrer) added to the beaker, which was then placed onto
 a multi-way magnetic stirrer and stirred for four hours at 300 rpm to evaporate the DCM.
 The microparticles were then washed with 2 liters of distilled water, sieved through a 100
 micron screen. The microparticles were then lyophilized for greater than 96 hours and
 vacuum packed.
 [00239]     Particle size of the PRED incorporated microparticles was determined using
 laser diffraction (Beckman Coulter LS 230) by dispersing a 50 mg aliquot in water, with the
 refractive index (RI) for water and PLGA, set at 1.33 and 1.46 respectively. The sample
 was stirred at the particle size measurement measurements taken and the results reported.
 Drug load was determined by suspending a nominal 10 mg of microparticles in 8ml HPLC
 grade methanol and sonicating for 2 hours. Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000g for
  15 mins before an aliquot of the supernatant was assayed via HPLC as described below.
 Corticosteroid-loaded microparticle samples, nominally 1 g were placed in 22 ml glass vials
 in 8- 20ml of 0.5% v/v Tween 20 in 100mM phosphate buffered saline and stored in a 37'C
 incubator with magnetic stirring at 130 rpm. Each test sample was prepared and analyzed in
 duplicate to monitor possible variability. At each time point in the release study,
 microparticles were allowed to settle, and an aliquot of between 4-1 6 ml of supernatant
 were taken, and replaced with an equal volume of fresh 0. 5% v/v Tween 20 in 100mM

 [00246]      In vitro release profile of the betamethasone PLGA microparticles is shown in

 [00251]      Particle size of the FLUT incorporated microparticles was determined using
 laser diffraction (Beckman Coulter LS 230) by dispersing a 50 mg aliquot in water, with the
 refractive index (RI) for water and PLGA, set at 1.33 and 1.46 respectively. The sample

 [00252]     In vitro release profile of the fluticasone propionate PLGA microparticles is
 shown in Figure 35. This formulation is suitable for a 30 day formulation or greater.
 [00253]     In one iteration of the in vitro release data, the amount of fluticasone propionate
 released per day was calculated based on a human dose, as exemplified in Table 2, which
 may achieve a temporary suppression of endogenous cortisol (greater than 50%) and, within
  14 days, achieve cortisol suppression of endogenous cortisol of less than 35%. This
 calculated dose equals 178 mg of microparticles containing 15 mg of fluticasone propionate.
 In a second iteration of these data, the amount of fluticasone propionate released per day
 was calculated based on a human dose, as exemplified in Table 2 that would not suppress
 the HPA axis, i.e. endogenous cortisol suppression never exceeding 35%. This calculated
 dose equals 24 mg of microparticles containing 2 mg of fluticasone propionate. These
 doses are both graphically represented in Figures 36 and 37.

 [00254]     Other fluticasone propionate PLGA depots were formulated in the same manner
 as described above with different PLGA polymers or amounts fluticasone propionate. In
 one formulation, a PLGA polymer with a higher lactide to glycolide ratio (PLGA 75:25
 (ester end-capped PLGA 75:25, lactide: glycolide molar ratio of 75:25, 0.58 dL/g, MW 86
 kDa) was used instead of the PLGA 50:50 as previously described. Unlike the
 triamcinolone acetonide preparations described in Example 5, but typically expected as
 described in the literature, the higher lactide to glycolide ratio resulted in a slower release,
 where 30% release in 14 days, followed by a substantial lag phase where little drug is
 released for a minimum of thirty days. In another example, 400 mg of fluticasone
 propionate instead of 200 mg was used in preparation of PLGA 50:50 microparticles (target
 drug load 28.6%). Unlike triamcinolone acetonide microparticle preparations, the higher
 drug load did not result in a significantly different release of fluticasone propionate; Figure
 38 shows the in vitro release of all three fluticasone propionate formulations.
 [00255]     Based on the studies described herein, the Class D corticosteroid microparticle
 formulations, for example, the fluticasone or fluticasone propionate microparticle
 formulations, exhibiting the desired release kinetics have the following characteristics: (i)
 the corticosteroid is between 8%-20% of the microparticle, and (ii) the polymer is PLGA
 having a molecular weight in the range of about 40 to 70 kDa, having an inherent viscosity
 in the range of 0.35 to 0.5 dL/g, and or having a lactide:glycolide molar ratio of 60:40 to
 45:55.
 EXAMPLE 9: Preparation of Dexamethasone Microparticles by Solvent Dispersion in
 PLGA
 [00256]     A pharmaceutical depot was prepared comprised of the corticosteroid,
 dexamethasone (DEX, 9-Fluoro- 11p , 17,21 -trihydroxy- 16a-methylpregna- 1,4-diene- 3,20
 dione) incorporated into microparticles in PLGA 50:50.
 [00257]     A formulation was prepared by dissolving approximately 1 gram of PLGA 50:50
 (lactide: glycolide molar ratio of 50:50, inherent viscosity 0.45 dL/g, molecular weight 66
 kDa) in 6.67 mL of dichloromethane (DCM). To the polymer solution, 200 mg of
 dexamethasone was added and sonicated. Subsequently, the corticosteroid containing
 dispersion was poured into 200 mL of 0.3% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution while
 homogenizing with a Silverson homogenizer using a rotor fixed with a Silverson Square
 Hole High Shear ScreenTM, set to spin at 2,000 rpm to form the microparticles. After two

 minutes, the beaker was removed, and a glass magnetic stirrer) added to the beaker, which
 was then placed onto a multi-way magnetic stirrer and stirred for four hours at 300 rpm to
 evaporate the DCM. The microparticles were then washed with 2 liters of distilled water,
 sieved through a 100 micron screen. The microparticles were then lyophilized for greater
 than 96 hours and vacuum packed.
 [00258]      Particle size of the DEX incorporated microparticles was determined using laser
 diffraction (Beckman Coulter LS 230) by dispersing a 50 mg aliquot in water, with the
 refractive index (RI) for water and PLGA, set at 1.33 and 1.46 respectively. The sample
 was stirred at the particle size measurement measurements taken and the results reported.
 Drug load was determined by suspending a nominal 10 mg of microparticles in 8ml HPLC
 grade methanol and sonicating for 2 hours. Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000g for
  15 mins before an aliquot of the supernatant was assayed via HPLC as described below.
 Corticosteroid-loaded microparticle samples, nominally 1 g were placed in 22 ml glass vials
 in 8- 20ml of 0.5% v/v Tween 20 in 100mM phosphate buffered saline and stored in a 37'C
 incubator with magnetic stirring at 130 rpm. Each test sample was prepared and analyzed in
 duplicate to monitor possible variability. At each time point in the release study,
 microparticles were allowed to settle, and an aliquot of between 4-1 6 ml of supernatant
 were taken, and replaced with an equal volume of fresh 0.5% v/v Tween 20 in 100mM
 phosphate buffered saline. Drug load and in vitro release samples were analyzed by HPLC
 using a Hypersil C18 column (100mm, i.d. 5mm, particle size 5 pm; ThermoFisher) and
 Beckman HPLC. All samples were run using a sample injection volume of 5pm, and
 column temperature of 40 'C. An isocratic mobile phase of 60% methanol and 40% water
 was used at a flow rate of 1ml/min, with detection at a wavelength of 254nm.The analytical
 results for the dexamethasone PLGA microparticles are shown in Table 16.

 EXAMPLE 10: Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics and Exploratory Safety Study of
 Corticosteroid Formulations
 [00261]     In an exploratory safety study in rats, single intra-articular (IA )doses of TCA
 immediate release (TCA IR) (0.18 and 1.125 mg) and doses of TCA in 75:25 PLGA
 formulation microparticles (FX006) (0.28, 0.56 and 1.125 mg (i.e., the maximum feasible
 dose) of TCA) were evaluated. Blood samples were collected at various time points for
 determination of plasma concentrations. Plasma concentration-time data from this study
 and pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis thereof are shown in Figures 41-43 and Tables 17-20.
 [00262]     As seen in Figures 41A-41D, FX006 dosed at 1.125 mg resulted in a very slow
 absorption of TCA in the systemic circulation and a markedly lower Cax as compared to
 TCA IR.
 [00263]     As shown in Table 17, the mean AUC0 values of TCA following 1.125 mg
 administration of FX006 were 2.1-fold lower than those observed for TCA IR (i.e., 2856 vs.
 6065 ng.h/mL, respectively). The mean C         values of TCA following 1.125 mg
 administration of FX006 were 15-fold lower than those observed for TCA IR (i.e., 125 vs.
 8.15 ng/mL, respectively). The absorption of TCA following administration of FX006 was
 slower than that observed for TCA IR, with mean T         values observed at 3.33 and 1.00 h,
 respectively. The elimination half-life of TCA following administration of 1.125 mg
 FX006 and TCA IR were 451 and 107 h, respectively.

 [00264]      The above results suggest a slower distribution and bioavailability of TCA in the
 systemic circulation following administration of FX006 as compared to TCA IR. Without
 wishing to be bound by theory, the slower distribution FX006 into the systemic circulation
 may be related to the longer residence time of FX006 at the site of injection. This is
 supported by the lesser availability of the FX006 microparticle formulation in the early
 "burst" phase, where only 4-9 % of product is released, compared to at least 23 % of the IR
 product.
 [00265]      Bioavailability of TCA in the systemic circulation following administration of
 FX006 was 3-fold lower than that observed for TCA IR, as shown in Table 18.

 Toluidine blue stained sections of joints were evaluated for treatment-related alterations.
 Histologic changes were described, wherever possible, according to their distribution,
 severity, and morphologic character.
 [00269]     Histological analysis demonstrated the following observations. First, injected
joints from placebo (blank PLGA microspheres)-treated animals had minimal multifocal
 macrophage infiltration in associated with 20-130 pm diameter microspheres, whereas none
 of the active FX006-injected joints showed the presence of any microspheres at Day 28.
 Placebo-treated rat joints had no cartilage or joint changes save for the presence of
 spontaneous cartilage cysts in a fewjoints (1 at Day 28, 2 at Day 42) in the right (injected)
 knees. The left knees in the placebo-treated rat joints were normal. In comparison, both
 knees in the high dose TCA IR and the high and mid-dose FX006 - groups showed some
 mild bone marrow hypocellularity and growth plate atrophy (dose dependent for FX006).
 Both knees in the low dose TCA IR and FX006 animals were normal. Spontaneous
 cartilage cysts noted in placebo animals were also noted in all groups dosed with FX006
 with no increase in incidence or severity. High dose TCA IR increased cartilage cysts at
 Day 42 but not at Day 28. In general, FX006-treated animals had normal articular cartilage
 despite the presence of catabolic effects on other joint structures, which was likely more
 readily observed on account of the young age of the animals.
 [00270]     Overall, all observed effects of FX006, especially at the high dose, such as body
 weight loss and reduced organ weights were also seen with TCA IR. The time course of
 inhibition of the HPA axis (measured as corticosterone levels) is shown in Figure 42. It
 should be noted that at the lowest dose of FX006 (0.28 mg; circles) corticosterone levels
 were initially inhibited but recovered back to near baseline by Day 14 post-dose. Similarly,
 with TCA IR at the lowest dose (0.18 mg), corticosterone levels recovered by Day 7
 (squares). With the mid (0.56 mg) and high (1.125 mg) doses of FX006 and the high dose
 of TCA IR (1.125 mg), corticosterone levels were inhibited longer as shown in Figure 42.
 [00271]     A PK-PD analysis demonstrated that inhibition of corticosterone was correlated
 with systemic TCA levels and followed a classical inhibitory model as shown in Figure 43.
 The IC50 was about 1 ng/mL and the Emax was achieved at 50-80 ng/mL.

 EXAMPLE 11: Evaluation of Efficacy of Single Doses of TCA Immediate Release and
 TCA Microparticle Formulation in Animal Model of Osteoarthritis
 [00272]      The studies described herein were designed to test and evaluate the efficacy of
 the corticosteroid microparticle formulations provided herein as compared to immediate
 release corticosteroid formulations. While the studies herein use TCA, it is understood that
 other corticosteroids, including other Class B corticosteroids, Class A corticosteroids, Class
 C corticosteroids, and Class D corticosteroids, can be evaluated using these materials,
 methods and animal models.
 [00273]      Efficacy of single intra-articular (IA) doses of FX006 (TCA in 75:25 PLGA
 formulation microparticles) and TCA IR (immediate release) was evaluated in a rat model
 of osteoarthritis of the knee via sensitization and challenge by peptidoglycan polysaccharide
 (PGPS). The model involves priming the animals with an intra-articular injection of PGPS
 in the right knee. The following day, any animals with no knee discomfort were eliminated
 from the test article groups and placed into the baseline group. Two weeks later, knee
 inflammation was reactivated by a tail vein injection of PGPS, 2.5 hr following IA dosing
 with FX006 or TCA IR at the doses selected (n=10/group). Differences in weight-bearing
 and gait (as a measure of joint pain experienced by the animals), histopathology, plasma PK
 etc. were evaluated.
 [00274]      Doses of FX006 (0.28, 0.12, 0.03 mg) and TCA IR (0.06, 0.03 mg) for this study
 were selected based on data from the study described above in Example 10 and an initial
 run of the PGPS model in which only TCA IR was evaluated at two IA dose levels. The
 goals of the present study were to demonstrate the following:
              *   FX006 is efficacious at doses that do not inhibit the HPA axis
              *   The duration of efficacy is a function of dose
              *   FX006 provides more prolonged pain relief as compared to TCA IR - Since
                  only about 10% of the TCA payload is expected to be released from FX006
                  in the first 24 hr, one TCA IR dose group (0.03 mg) was chosen to match
                  10% of the TCA in FX006 at a dose of 0.28 mg
              *   Effects of matched doses of FX006 and TCA IR (0.03 mg)

WO 2012/019009                                                               PCT/US2011/046601
 [00275]     The duration of efficacy was assessed by 3 different reactivations, 2 weeks apart.
 After that point, the arthritis observed in the animals becomes more wide-spread making the
 efficacy in the index knee more difficult to assess.
 [00276]     At the first reactivation, vehicle treated animals demonstrate painful gait as
 demonstrated by high pain scores (3.5 out of a maximum of 4 possible) as shown in Figures
 44A, 44B, and 44C. FX006 at 0.28 mg (squares) showed good efficacy. In the previous
 study described in Example 10, this dose was demonstrated to inhibit the HPA axis
 immediately after dosing but a return to baseline function was demonstrated by Day 14.
 Interestingly, this dose of FX006 continued to be efficacious upon the 2     and 3rd
 reactivations on Days 14 and 28 when the HPA axis function was presumably normal. It
 should also be noted that since HPA axis function returned to baseline by Day 7 at a 0.18
 mg dose of TCA IR in the previous study described in Example 10, the effects of the doses
 of TCA IR used in the present study (0.06 and 0.03 mg) were also in the presence of normal
 HPA axis function following an initial transient inhibition. Corticosterone measurements
 from the present study (as an indicator of HPA axis function) are presented as change from
 baseline for each treatment group in Figure 46. As demonstrated from these data,
 corticosterone levels for all groups recovered by Day 14; hence the goal of prolonged
 efficacy with FX006 in the presence of normal HPA axis function was achieved.
 [00277]     Overall, a clear dose-dependence of response was noted for both FX006 and
 TCA IR. Also, if less than 10% of this dose is available by the day after dosing (Day 1), it
 should be noted in Figure 44B that the efficacy of FX006 at 0.28 mg (squares) is greater
 than TCA IR at 0.03 mg (triangles) at all evaluations. Further, the duration of efficacy of
 TCA (both FX006 and IR) appears to be a function of dose, however, the prolonged release
 of TCA from the PLGA microspheres in FX006 results in more sustained efficacy. This is
 more clearly depicted in another representation of the data in Figure 45 in which peak
 response for each dose as determined by gait/pain scores on Day 1 following each
 reactivation (Days 1, 15 and 29) are plotted. Figure 46 plots the time course of
 corticosterone recovery for all study groups. On balance, across all groups that received the
 corticosteroid, there was recovery.
 [00278]     Plasma levels of TCA were measured in samples taken from all rats at baseline
 (Day -4), Days 0 (2 hr post dosing), 1, 3, 8, 14, 17, 21, 28, and 31. Concentration-time
 curves for all treatment groups are shown in Figure 47A. Figure 47B shows only the
                                                  88

WO 2012/019009                                                                 PCT/US2011/046601
 FX006 dose groups on a larger scale since maximal plasma concentrations with FX006
 were far lower than those with TCA IR.
 [00279]      Histopathological evaluation of the knees taken from all animals at the end of the
 study (Day 32 at the end of the 3 rd reactivation of arthritis) demonstrated statistically
 significant improvement by FX006 at the high and mid-range doses (0.28 and 0.12 mg) in
 the composite histological score and each component score (inflammation, pannus, cartilage
 damage and bone resorption) as shown in Figure 48. As described above, the dose of 0.28
 mg FX006 demonstrated strong efficacy (i.e. analgesic activity) throughout all 3
 reactivations, whereas the dose of 0.12 mg was active but to a lesser degree through all 3
 reactivations. At the doses of TCA IR used, the duration of efficacy was mostly through the
 first reactivation of arthritis, with partial efficacy of the higher (0.06 mg) dose in the second
 reactivation, and this also translated into a much smaller non-significant improvement in
 histological scores. Importantly, these data demonstrate that TCA has no deleterious effect
 on cartilage and as has been described in other settings, it actually reduces cartilage damage
 in an inflammatory milieu.
 [00280]      In conclusion, the prolonged residence of TCA in the joint upon IA dosing with
 FX006 resulted in extending the duration of efficacy in the rat PGPS model of arthritis with
 a significant histological improvement in inflammation, pannus formation, cartilage damage
 and bone resorption. FX006 had these effects without inhibiting HPA axis function as
 demonstrated by the return to baseline of corticosterone levels within 14 days after dosing.
 The clinical implications for the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid
 arthritis and other inflammatory joint disorders are as follows:
      *   Intra-articular injection of sustained release corticosteroid microparticle
          formulations provides prolonged pain relief relative to intra-articular injection of
          immediate release steroids.
      *   Intra-articular injection of sustained release corticosteroid microparticle
          formulations is efficacious in reducing pain and inflammation at doses that do not
          inhibit the HPA axis.
      *   The duration of efficacy of sustained release of intra-articular corticosteroid
          microparticle formulations is a function of dose.
                                                    89

    *   Intra-articular injection of sustained release corticosteroid microparticle formulations
        slows, arrests, reverses, or otherwise inhibits structural damage to tissues caused by
        inflammation.
