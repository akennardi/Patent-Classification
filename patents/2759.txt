                              FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]   This invention is directed to therapeutic regimens and methods for treating visual
         disorders associated with an endogenous retinoid deficiency in a subject by
         administering a synthetic retinal derivative to the subject, wherein the therapeutic
         regimens and methods result in improvements in the subject's visual function.
                         BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]   Retinal deficiencies disrupt or interfere with the production, conversion and/or
         regeneration of 1 I-cis-retinal, which is a key Vitamin A derivative in the retinoid
         or visual cycle.  11-Cis-retinal is an endogenous retinoid produced in and by the
         retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from the isomerization and oxidation of the all-

WO 2011/132084                                                             PCT/IB2011/001294
                                              2
         trans-retinol (Vitamin A derived from the diet).       11-Cis-retinal functions as a
         chromophore and covalently binds to the protein opsin to form rhodopsin. Vision
         is initiated when a light photon is captured by 11 -cis-retinal, resulting in the
         isomerization to all-trans-retinal and disassociation from opsin.          Vision is
         sustained by the cycling of all-trans-retinal back into 11-cis-retinal, which occurs
         by a complex series of biochemical reactions involving multiple enzymes and
         proteins in the retinoid or visual cycle.
[0004]   Endogenous retinoid deficiencies, such as those caused by mutations in the genes
         encoding the enzymes and proteins utilized in the visual cycle or those caused by
         the aging process, impair the synthesis of 11-cis-retinal, the result of which leads
         to visual disorders due to the shortage or depletion of 11-cis-retinal.
[0005]   For example, Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a cause of inherited childhood
         blindness that affects children from birth or shortly thereafter, is associated with
         an inherited gene mutation in the RPE65 gene which encodes the protein retinal
         pigment epithelial protein 65 (RPE65) and/or an inherited gene mutation in the
         LRAT gene which encodes the enzyme lecithin:retinol acetyltransferase (LRAT).
         RPE65 and LRAT are both critical for the visual cycle. Patients with LCA lack
         the ability to generate 11 -cis-retinal in adequate quantities and therefore suffer
         from severe vision loss at birth, nystagmus, poor pupillary responses and severely
         diminished electroretinograms (ERGs).
[0006]   Mutations in the LRAT or RPE65 genes are also associated with autosomal
         recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP), which is a subset of hereditary retinitis
         pigmentosa (RP) which is characterized by degeneration of rod and cone
         photoreceptors. Patients with arRP may lose vision either in childhood or in mid
         life. The classic pattern of vision loss includes difficulties with dark adaptation

WO 2011/132084                                                            PCT/IB2011/001294
                                             3
         and night blindness in adolescence and loss of mid-peripheral visual field in
         young adulthood. arRP typically presents itself as primary rod degeneration with
         secondary degeneration of cones and is thus described as a rod-cone dystrophy,
         with rods being more affected than cones.        This sequence of the photoreceptor
         cells involvement explains why arRP patients initially exhibit night blindness, and
         only in later life become visually impaired in diurnal conditions (Hamel C.,
         Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 1:40 (2006)). arRP is the diagnosis given to
         patients with photoreceptor degeneration who have good central vision within the
         first decade of life, although arRP onset can also occur much later at either the
         beginning of mid-life or after mid-life ("late onset arRP").        As the disease
         progresses, patients lose far peripheral vision, eventually develop tunnel vision,
         and finally lose central vision by the age of 60 years.
[0007]   Retinitis Punctata Albesciens is another form of Retinitis Pigmentosa that exhibits
         a shortage of 1 I-cis-retinal in the rods. Aging also leads to the decrease in night
         vision and loss of contrast sensitivity due to a shorting of 1 l-cis retinal. Excess
         unbound opsin is believed to randomly excite the visual transduction system. This
         can create noise in the system, and thus more light and more contrast is necessary
         to see well.
[0008]   Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB) and Fundus Albipunctatus are a
         group of diseases that are manifested as night blindness, but there is not a
         progressive loss of vision as in the Retinitis Pigmentosa. Some forms of CSNB are
         due to a delay in the recycling of ll-cis -retinal. Fundus Albipunctatus until
         recently was thought to be a special case of CSNB where the retinal appearance is
         abnormal with hundreds of small white dots appearing in the retina. It has been
         shown recently that this is also a progressive disease although much slower than

WO 2011/132084                                                              PCT/IB2011/001294
                                              4
         Retinitis Pigmentosa. It is caused by a gene defect that leads to a delay in the
         cycling of 1 1-cis-retinal.
[0009]   Endogenous retinoid deficiencies can also be associated with the aging process,
         even in the absence of inherited gene mutations of the genes encoding the
         enzymes and proteins utilized in the visual cycle. Age-related visual disorders
         include, for example, loss of night vision, nyctalopia and contrast sensitivity due
         to a shortage of 11-cis-retinal. This is consistent with the finding that a dramatic
         slowing of rod-mediated dark adaptation after light exposure associated with
         human aging is related to a delayed regeneration of rhodopsin (Jackson, G.R. et
         al,. J. Vision Research 39, 3975-3982 (1999)).      In addition, excess unbound opsin
         (due to l l-cis-retinal shortage) is believed to randomly excite the visual
         transduction system. This can create noise in the system, and thus necessitates
         more light and/or more contrast in order to see well.
[0010]   The use of synthetic retinal derivatives and compositions thereof in methods of
         restoring or stabilizing photoreceptor function in a vertebrate visual system and in
         methods of treating age-related retinal dysfunction is disclosed in International

         50, No. 9, pp. 4368-4378).
[0011]   Animal models have shown that synthetic retinoids which are highly-light
         sensitive compounds are photoisomerized or "bleached" by light from the retina
         within just a few hours unless the eyes are covered. These studies were conducted

         cause changes in lipid metabolism, damage to the liver, nausea, vomiting, blurred
         vision, damage to bones, interference with bone development and several other
         serious undesirable effects.

[0013]   In the context of treating the loss or impairment of vision due to retinoid
         deficiency, which is a chronic condition requiring lifetime treatments, these toxic
         effects can be very important. These side effects are of particular concern in
         young patients, whose susceptibility to side effects related to their physical
         development is well documented.
[0014]   This combination of a need for repeated administration in response to bleaching,
         and the undesirable serious side effects of repeated administration, poses a
         problem for the use of synthetic retinoids to treat the loss of vision caused by
         retinoid deficiency. A recent study evaluated the usefulness of retinoids as a
         treatment for these disorders and concluded that retinoids and similar compounds
         are simply not good clinical candidates for the treatment of retinoid deficiency
         disorders.    See, Fan J. et al. "Light Prevents Exogenous l1 -cis Retinal from
         Maintaining Cone Photoreceptors          in Chromophore-deficient Mice", Invest.

[0015]   It has now been discovered that by use of certain dosing regimens of synthetic
         retinal derivatives, it is possible to produce meaningful improvement or recovery
         of vision that is long lasting, while chronic toxic effects can be greatly reduced or
         even eliminated.     This was completely unexpected, and indeed is completely
         contrary to the expectation of the art.
                            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0016]   The present invention is directed to therapeutic regimens and methods for treating
         or ameliorating visual disorders associated with an endogenous retinoid deficiency
         in a subject, wherein the method and therapeutic regimen comprises the following
         sequential steps:

WO 2011/132084                                                             PCT/IB2011/001294
                                               7
[0017]   a) Administering to the subject a first dose of a first therapeutically effective
         amount of a synthetic retinal derivative or a first therapeutic effective amount of a
         pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a synthetic retinal derivative
         that provides for replacement of endogenously produced 11 -cis-retinal;
[0018]   b) commencing a resting period of at least one month during which a synthetic
         retinal derivative is not administered to the subject;
[0019]   c) administering to the subject a second therapeutically effective amount of the
         synthetic retinal derivative;
[0020]   d) repeating steps a through c as needed.
[0021]   The therapeutic regimen described above is characterized in that the subject's
         visual function is meaningfully improved. This improvement is of a duration that
         is clinically useful and is not associated with toxic effects that would prevent or
         limit its long term use.
[0022]   This invention is also directed to kits comprising a therapeutic effective amount of
         a synthetic     retinal   derivative   or  a therapeutic   effective   amount  of a
         pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a synthetic retinal derivative
         and instructions for administering the synthetic retinal derivative or the
         pharmaceutically acceptable composition to a subject according to the therapeutic
         regimen disclosed herein.       Preferably, the kits are for use in the treatment or
         amelioration of a visual disorder associated with endogenous retinoid deficiency
         in a subject.
[0023]   The therapeutic regimens and methods of the invention maximize the efficacy of
         synthetic retinal     derivatives    or pharmaceutically    acceptable   compositions
         comprising synthetic retinal derivatives when administered to a subject while

                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0035]   In one aspect, the present invention is directed to therapeutic regimens for treating
         or ameliorating visual disorders in a subject, particularly loss of visual functions,
         by the administration of a synthetic retinal derivative or a pharmaceutically
         acceptable    composition comprising the synthetic        retinal derivative, which
         comprise first establishing a baseline of the subject's visual functions prior to
         administration, then administering a therapeutically effective amount of the
         synthetic retinal derivative or the pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof
         to the subject for an initial dosing period, during which the subject's visual
         function improves as compared to the subject's baseline of visual function prior to
         administration, followed by a resting period during which no synthetic retinal
         derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof is administered and
         the subject's visual functions continue to improve or the improvements in the
         subject's visual functions obtained during the first dosing period are sustained,
         followed by a subsequent administration of the synthetic retinal derivative or a
         pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof after the resting period.        The
         resting period and subsequent administration of the synthetic retinal derivative or
         the pharmaceutically acceptable composition can be repeated as needed to
         maintain the improvement in the subject's visual function achieved during the first
         dosing period or during the resting period. Optionally, a determination may be
         made during the initial resting period as to whether a subsequent therapeutic
         effective amount of the synthetic retinal derivative or the pharmaceutically

[0036]   In one embodiment, the baseline of the subject's visual function is established
         prior to the administration of the first therapeutic effective dose of the synthetic
         retinal derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof by
         evaluating one or more of the subject's visual field, visual acuity, ability to
         perform life tasks, retinal sensitivity, dynamic pupillary response, nystagmus,
         cortical visual function, color vision or dark adaptation. In a further embodiment,
         the baseline of the subject's visual function is established by evaluating the
         subject's field of vision. In another embodiment, the baseline of the subject's
         visual function is established by evaluating the subject's visual acuity. In another
         embodiment, the baseline is established by evaluating the subject's retinal

         establishing the baseline of the subject's visual field, the subject's visual acuity,
         the subject's ability to perform life tasks, and the subject's retinal sensitivity by
         established tests.
[0038]   In one embodiment, the subject's visual function rapidly improves during the first
         dosing period from the baseline of the subject's visual function established prior to
         administration of the first therapeutic effective amount of the synthetic retinal
         derivative or the pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof to the subject.

         For purposes of this invention, "rapidly" improves refers to aclinically meaningful
         improvement in a subject's visual functions as compared to the baseline of the
         subject's visual functions in a period shorter than the first dosing period.
         Preferably, in one embodiment, the subject's visual functions are significantly
         improved within three days, within two days, or within one day of the
         commencement of the first dosing period. In another embodiment, the subject's
         visual functions improve during the first dosing period as compared to baseline,
         and continue to improve after the completion of the first dosing period and intothe

[0042]   In another embodiment, the improvement in the subject's visual function in the
         first dosing period comprises an improvement in the subject's visual acuity as
         compared to the baseline.
[0043]   In another embodiment, the improvement in the subject's visual function in the
         resting period comprises an improvement in the subject's visual acuity as
         compared to the improvement in the subject's visual acuity during the first dosing
         period.
[0044]   In another embodiment, the improvement in the subject's visual function in the
         first dosing period comprises an improvement in the subject's retinal sensitivity as
         compared to the baseline.
[0045]   In another embodiment, the improvement in the subject's visual function in the
         resting period comprises an improvement in the subject's retinal sensitivity as
         compared to the improvement in the subject's retinal sensitivity during the first
         dosing period.
[0046]   In another embodiment, the improvement in the subject's visual function in the
         resting period comprises an improvement in the subject's ability to perform life
         tasks, as compared to the improvement in the subject's retinal sensitivity during
         the first dosing period.    In one embodiment, the resting period can be of any
         length of time from about one month or longer. In other embodiments of the
         invention, the resting period is from about 1 month to about 1 year. The length of
         the resting period will be dependent upon the therapeutic effective amount of
         synthetic    retinal  derivative   or   the  therapeutic   effective   amount    of a
         pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a retinal derivative to be

         administered therein. The first resting period can be for about 1 to 3 months. In
         one embodiment of this invention, the resting period is from one month to nine
         months in duration. In other embodiments, the resting period is from one to six
         months, or from three to six months.
[0047]   In other embodiments of the invention, the resting period is not a fixed period.
         Instead, good clinical judgment may indicate that it is preferable to wait until the
         visual improvement that the treatment has produced in the subject has begun to
         reverse or has reversed to a significant degree before administering another dose
         of synthetic retinoid derivative. When later doses are administered in this way,
         the clinician will evaluate the subject's vision as needed and, in the exercise of
         good clinical judgment in light of the subject's overall health and vision, will
         determine when an additional dose of synthetic retinoid derivative is warranted.
         In any event, the additional doses of synthetic retinoid derivative will not be
         administered at intervals short enough to cause chronic retinoid toxicity.
[0048]   In another embodiment, there is provided a method for the prophylaxis or
         treatment of a subject having or at risk for developing a diminished visual
         capacity. The method generally includes determining whether the subject has a
         deficient endogenous retinoid level or is at risk for development thereof, as
         compared with a standard subject, and administering an effective amount of a
         synthetic retinal derivative or a pharmaceutical composition thereof.
[0049]   A therapeutically effective amount of the synthetic retinoid derivative is typically
         in the range of from about 49 milligrams per square meter of body surface area
         (mg/m 2 ) to about 840 mg/m 2 . This amount can be administered in a single dose,
         or as a divided dose over a period as long as two weeks. The size of the dose, and
         the time over which the divided dose is administered, will be determined in the

         the degree of vision loss or impairment, age, and other factors.
[0050]   In some embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount of the synthetic
         retinoid derivative is in the range of from about 70 to 525 mg/m 2 . In other
         embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount of the synthetic retinoid
         derivative is in the range of from about 70 to 490 mg/m 2 . In other embodiments,
         the therapeutically effective amount of the synthetic retinoid derivative is in the
         range of from about 70 to 420 mg/m 2 .             Yet in other embodiments, the
         therapeutically effective amount of the synthetic retinoid derivative is in the range
         of from about 49 to 280 mg/m2.           In some embodiments, the therapeutically
         effective amount of the synthetic retinoid derivative is in the range of from about
         280 to 490 mg/m 2 . In yet other embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount
         of the synthetic retinoid derivative is in the range of from about 70 to 280 mg/m 2.
[0051]   The above therapeutically effective amount can also be administered in a divided
         dose, for example over five days to fourteen days. In some embodiments, the
         above therapeutically effective amount can be administered in a divided dose over
         seven to ten days.     The divided dose is typically administered in equal daily
         amounts over the dosing period.
[0052]   The therapeutically effective amount can be adjusted during the course of
         treatment. In some embodiments, the amount of later doses is reduced from the
         amount of the initial dose. In other embodiments, the amount of the later doses is
         the same as the amount of the initial dose, while in other embodiments, the
         amount of the later dose may be increased from the amount of the initial dose. The
         size of the later doses, and the time over which the divided dose is administered,
         will be determined in the exercise of routine good clinical judgment in light of the

         endogenous retinoid deficiency in a subject.
[0083]   These and other embodiments of the invention are disclosed in more detail herein.
[0084]   Unless defined otherwise in the specification, the following terms and phrases
         shall have the following meanings:
[0085]   As    used herein,     "visual disorders"     refers broadly    to disorders    in the
         photoreceptors, tissue or structures of the eye. Visual disorders include, but are
         not limited to, retinal degeneration, retinal dystrophy, loss of photoreceptor
         function, photoreceptor cell death and structural abnormalities. For purposes of
         this invention, the phrase "visual disorders" refers to visual disorders associated
         with an endogenous retinoid deficiency. Visual disorders of the invention are
         typically characterized by impaired or less than normal (including complete loss
         of) visual functions in the subject, which include, for example, poor visual acuity,
         low or lack of retinal sensitivity, narrow or undetectable visual fields, and the like.
[0086]   "Therapeutically effective amount" refers to that amount of a compound which,
         when administered to a subject, preferably a human, is sufficient to cause a
         clinically meaningful therapeutic effect.
[0087]   The term "therapeutic effect" as used herein refers to the improvement or
         restoration of the vision of a patient, in one or both eyes of the patient.
[0088]   The loss of vision in patients with retinoid deficiency is typically severe, but can
         be present in degree and forms that vary from patient to patient. Patients can lose
         their peripheral vision, they can lose their ability to see in low to moderate light,
         their overall acuity can decline, or other vision loss can occur. This loss can be
         progressive (especially in adult onset case(s) of retinoid deficiency, such as
         retinitis pigmentosa) eventually leading to very little vision or to complete

WO 2011/132084                                                              PCT/IB2011/001294
                                               21
         blindness.     When not progressive (such as in Congenital Stationary Night
         Blindness) loss of vision can be severe, if not nearly complete, from the outset.
[0089]   The type and extent of loss can be roughly correlated to the degree of retinoid
         deficiency, affected cell type (e.g. rods or cones), and/or localization of the
         retinoid deficiency in the retina. Where the deficiency effect is strongest at the
         periphery of the retina, peripheral vision losses can be seen earliest and most
         profoundly. When the deficiency effect is more generalized throughout the retina,
         an overall loss of acuity is more commonly observed. When the deficiency is
         great or of long standing, the vision loss (in whatever form) can be more severe
         and more difficult to successfully treat. All of these variations in the nature,
         degree, and progression of vision loss in retinoid deficiency patients are well
         known to clinicians.
[0090]   Because the nature and degree of vision loss caused by the retinoid deficiency
         disorder varies from patient to patient, the nature and degree of meaningful
         improvement or recovery of vision will also vary from patient to patient. For
         example, regaining the ability to see in moderate light can be a meaningful
         improvement that is manifested in some patients. For other patients a meaningful
         improvement will be to achieve restored peripheral vision, or a general
         improvement in acuity. Ideally, progressive loss of vision can be arrested and
         reversed by this invention.       However, in cases where diagnosis and treatment
         occur early, treatment according to this invention may simply limit or slow the
         progression of vision loss.
[0091]   Clinically meaningful improvements can be documented by any of several known
         clinical measures discussed in this application, including acuity, field of vision,
         light sensitivity, the ability to perform life tasks or a combination of some or all of

WO 2011/132084                                                            PCT/IB2011/001294
                                             22
         these. These measures and others are all well known to the clinicians and are
         routinely used in clinical practice.     Clinicians are easily able to identify and
         observe these changes as part of routine clinical evaluations of retinoid deficiency
         patients.    Consequently, clinicians are also easily able to observe the identify
         improvements in vision that are meaningful in the context of a given patient.
[0092]   The term "subject" refers to a human patient.        The term "patient" refers to a
         human having an endogenous retinal deficiency and/or a human who has been
         diagnosed as having an endogenous retinal deficiency.
[0093]   Visual disorders associated with Endogenous Retinoid Deficiency
[0094]   The therapeutic regimens and methods of the invention are for the treatment and
         amelioration of visual disorders associated with an endogenous retinoid deficiency
         in a subject, preferably loss of visual functions due to endogenous retinoid
         deficiencies.    Such deficiencies are characterized by an absent, deficient or
         depleted level of one or more endogenous retinoids, such as 1l-cis-retinal. Thus,
         "endogenous retinoid deficiency" refers to prolonged lower levels of endogenous
         retinoids as compared to the levels found in a healthy eye of a subject of the same
         species. While a healthy eye of a subject may experience transient shortage of 11
         cis-retinal, which leads to a brief period of blindness followed by vision recovery,
         a subject with endogenous retinoid deficiency is deficient in its ability to reliably
         or rapidly regenerate the endogenous level of l1l-cis-retinal, which leads to
         prolonged and/or pronounced 1 l-cis retinal deficits.
[0095]   Endogenous retinoid deficiency can be caused by one or more defects in the visual
         cycle which includes enzymatic deficiencies and impaired transport processes
         between the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE). Figure 1
         schematically shows a vertebrate, preferably the human, visual cycle (or retinoid

WO 2011/132084                                                             PCT/IB2011/001294
                                             23
         cycle), which operates between the RPE and the outer segments of photoreceptors.
          11-cis-retinal is regenerated through a series of enzymatic reactions and transport
         processes to and from the RPE after which it binds to opsin to form rhodopsin in
         the photoreceptor. Rhodopsin is then activated by light to form meta-rhodopsin
         which activates the phototransduction cascade while the bound cis-retinoid is
         isomerized to all-trans- retinal (von Lintig, J. et al., Trends Biochem Sci Feb 24
         (2010)).
[0096]   Mutations in more than a dozen genes encoding retinal proteins have been
         identified that participate in several biochemical pathways in the visual cycle. For
         example, mutations in genes that encode lecithin:retinoid acetyl transferase (the
         LRAT gene) and retinal pigment epithelium protein 65 kDa (the RPE65 gene)
         disrupt the retinoid cycle, resulting in a deficiency of 11-cis-retinal, an excess of
         free opsin, an excess of retinoid waste (e.g., degradation) products and/or
         intermediates in the recycling of all-trans-retinal, or the like.
[0097]   Endogenous retinoid levels in a subject's eyes and deficiencies of such levels may
         be determined in accordance with the methods disclosed in, for example, U.S.
         Published Patent Application No. 2005/0159662 (the disclosure of which is
         incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Other methods of determining
         endogenous retinoid levels in a vertebrate eye and a deficiency of such retinoids
         include, for example, analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of
         retinoids in a blood sample from a subject. For example, a blood sample can be
         obtained from a subject and retinoid types and levels in the sample can be
         separated and analyzed by normal phase high pressure liquid chromatography
         (HPLC) (e.g., with a HP 1100 HPLC and a Beckman, Ultrasphere-Si, 4.6 mm x
         250 mm column using 10% ethyl acetate/90% hexane at a flow rate of 1.4

WO 2011/132084                                                            PCT/IB2011/001294
                                            24
         ml/minute). The retinoids can be detected by, for example, detection at 325 nm
         using a diode-array detector and HP Chemstation A.03.03 software. A deficiency
         in retinoids can be determined, for example, by comparison of the profile of
         retinoids in the sample with a sample from a control subject (e.g., a normal
         subject).
[0098]   Various conditions can cause a subject to be predisposed to or develop
         endogenous retinoid deficiency. For example, a subject that has an RPE65 gene
         mutation or an LRAT gene mutation is genetically predisposed to endogenous
         retinoid deficiency and visual impairment that ultimately lead to complete vision
         loss and severe retinal dystrophy. In particular, RPE65 and LRAT gene mutations
         are found in both LCA and arRP patients.       Even in the absence of any genetic
         defects in the visual cycle, an aging subject may nonetheless develop endogenous
         retinoid deficiency.
[0099]   Examples of visual disorders associated with endogenous retinoid deficiency are
         discussed in detail below.
[00100]  A. Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)
[00101]  One condition associated with endogenous retinoid deficiency is Leber Congenital
         Amaurosis (LCA). LCA is an inherited childhood disease with early onset vision
         loss and retinal dystrophy.      Mutations in the RPE65 gene in patients with
         autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) or Leber congenital amaurosis
         have been reported to cause 0.5% and 6% of LCA cases, respectively (den
         Hollander, A. I. et al., Prog Ret Eye Res 27:391-419, (2008) and den Hollander,
         A.I. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 95:3088-93 (1998)).           These forms are
         characterized by a significant deficiency of 11-cis-retinal, the visual chromophore
         that binds rod and cone opsins to form the visual pigments (rhodopsin and cone-

WO 2011/132084                                                           PCT/IB2011/001294
                                           25
         pigments) (Redmond, T.M. et al., Nat Gen 20:344-51 (1998) and Batten, M.L. et
         al., J Biol Chem 279:10422-32 (2004)).        Chronic deficiency of 11-cis-retinal
         eventually results in photoreceptor degeneration (Travis, G.H. et al., Annu Rev
         Pharmacol Toxicol 47:469-512 (2007)). The interval between the loss of visual
         function and retinal degeneration creates an opportunity for vision rescue.
[00102]  In subjects having LCA due to an RPE65 gene mutation, retinyl esters build up in
         the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Thompson, D.A. et al., Nat Gen 28:123-4
         (2001) and Gu S.M. et al., Nat Gen 17:194-7 (1997)), which eventually results in
         retinal degeneration.
[00103]  Subjects having LCA due to an LRAT gene mutation are unable to make esters
         and subsequently secrete any excess retinoids, which are associated with early
         onset severe retinal dystrophy and retinal degeneration (Morimura H et al. Proc
         Natl Acad Sci U S A 95:3088-93 (1998)).
[00104]  B. Retinitis Pigmentosa and Night Blindness (Nyctalopia)
[00105]  Another condition associated with endogenous retinoid deficiency is night
         blindness caused by, for example, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or congenital
         stationary night blindness (CSNB).
[00106]  RP is a condition caused by defects in many different genes. To date, 19 known
         and 17 uncharacterized gene mutations have been identified, causing great
         heterogeneity in the disease (Phelan, J.K. et al., Mol Vis. 6:116-124 (2000)). The
         age of onset for RP, as well as the severity of the disease, is a function of the
         mode of inheritance. RP may be inherited by autosomal dominant, autosomal
         recessive, or X-linked traits. Autsomal recessive RP (arRP) can occur in 20% of
         all RP cases. In recent years, mutations in the LRAT and RPE65 genes have been
         discovered in patients with arRP. These specific mutations are linked to defects in

WO 2011/132084                                                           PCT/IB2011/001294
                                           26
         retinoid metabolism of the visual cycle and may result in photoreceptor
         degeneration (Morimura, H. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 95(6):3088-3093
         (1998)).
[00107]  As noted herein, the protein encoded by the RPE65 gene has a biochemical
         association with retinol binding protein and 1 l-cis-retinol dehydrogenase and is
         essential for 11-cis-retinal production (Gollapalli, D.R. et al., Biochemistry.
         42(19):5809-5818 (2003) and Redmond, T.M. et al., Nat Genet. 20(4):344-351
         (1998)). Preclinical and clinical information show that loss of the function of the
         RPE65 protein blocks retinoid processing after esterification of vitamin A to
         membrane lipids and results in loss of vision.
[00108]  Early stages of typical RP are characterized by night blindness and loss of mid
         peripheral visual field, reflecting primary rod impairment.         As the disease
         progresses, patients lose far peripheral and central vision, eventually leading to
         blindness. Prominent clinical findings include bone spicule-shaped pigment in the
         retina and attenuated/abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) responses.             It is
         speculated that the absence of RPE65 products would cause a massive, early
         degeneration of photoreceptors while substitution of amino acids would lead to a
         slower pace of degeneration (Marlhens, F. et al., Eur J Hum Genet. 6(5):527-531
         (1998)).
[00109]  CSNB and fundus albipunctatus are a group of diseases that are manifested as
         night blindness, but there is not a progressive loss of vision as in the RP. Some
         forms of CSNB are due to a delay in the recycling of 11-cis -retinal.         Until
         recently, fundus albipunctatus was thought to be a special case of CSNB where
         the retinal appearance is abnormal with hundreds of small white dots appearing in
         the retina. It has been recently been shown that fundus albipunctatus is also a

WO 2011/132084                                                            PCT/IB2011/001294
                                           27
         progressive disease, although much slower than RP.          Fundus albipunctatus is
         caused by a gene defect that leads to a delay in the cycling of 11-cis-retinal.
[00110]  C. Age-related Visual Disorders
[00111]  Another condition associated with endogenous retinoid deficiency is age-related
         decrease in retinal photoreceptor function.      As discussed herein, it has been
         recognized that inadequate availability and/or processing of vitamin A to the
         visual chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, can adversely affect vertebrate rhodopsin
         regeneration and visual transduction (McBee, J.K. et al., Prog Retin Eye Res 20,
         469-529 (2001); Lamb, T.D. et al., Prog Retin Eye Res 23, 307-380 (2004); and
         Travis, G.H. et al., Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol (2006)). In aging, rhodopsin
         regeneration after light exposure is more delayed in humans and mice deprived of
         vitamin A due to either dietary deficiency or inadequate intestinal absorption
         (Lamb, T.D. et al,. J. Prog Retin Eye Res 23, 307-380 (2004)).             Moreover,
         treatment with vitamin A and its derivatives may have beneficial effects in aging
         and retinal diseases such as Sorbsby's fundus dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa
         (Jacobson, S.G., et al., Nat Genet 11, 27-32 (1995); and Berson, E.L., et al., Arch
         Ophthalmol 111, 761-772 (1993)).
[00112]  Age-related visual disorders include a slowing of rod-mediated dark adaptation
         after light exposure, a decrease in night vision (nyctalopia), and/or a decrease in
         contrast sensitivity.  Age-related visual disorders may also include wet or dry
         forms of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
[00113]  AMD is one of the specific visual disorders associated with the posterior portion
         of the eyeball and is the leading cause of blindness among older people. AMD
         results in damage to the macula, a small circular area in the center of the retina.
         Because the macula is the area which enables one to discern small details and to

WO 2011/132084                                                             PCT/IB2011/001294
                                             28
         read or drive, its deterioration may bring about diminished visual acuity and even
         blindness.   People with AMD suffer deterioration of central vision but usually
         retain peripheral sight. In AMD, vision loss occurs when complications late in the
         disease either cause new blood vessels to grow under the retina or the retina
         atrophies.
[00114]  D. Subject Populations
[00115]  While any subject having a visual disorder associated with an endogenous retinoid
         deficiency (as defined herein ) may be treated by the therapeutic regimens and
         methods of the invention, there is a physiological window of opportunity wherein
         the therapeutic regimen or method is the most effective in restoring visual
         function to the subject. Preferably, the window of opportunity for the therapeutic
         regimens of the invention to be the most effective in a subject is defined as the
         interval between loss of visual function and retinal degeneration, particularly with
         respect to photoreceptor cell degeneration.     Subjects in certain age groups may
         particularly benefit from the therapeutic regimens of the invention.            More
         specifically, subjects with a lesser degree of retinal/photoreceptor degeneration
         tend to have a better or faster response to the therapeutic regimen of the invention
         and/or may have a longer resting period before a subsequent dosing period is
         needed.
[00116]  For example, in certain embodiments, younger subjects with a lost of visual
         function due to LCA or RP may retain a higher percentage of dormant
         photoreceptors.    Such dormant photoreceptors are capable of responding to the
         therapeutic regimens of the invention.      In particular, in treating lost of visual
         function in a subject arising from inherited childhood blindness such as LCA or
         early onset RP, such as arRP, younger subjects may expect a greater recovery of

WO 2011/132084                                                               PCT/IB2011/001294
                                               29
         visual functions because their retinal degeneration is less advanced. Thus, in one
         embodiment of the invention, the subject is a human juvenile, i.e., younger than
          15 years, old upon commencement of the therapeutic regimen.                  In other
         embodiments of the invention, the subject is a human newborn or a human infant
         younger than 1 year old, younger than 18 months, younger than 24 months or
         younger than 36 months old when the therapeutic regimen is commenced.                In
         other embodiments, the subject is a human of 5 years old or older when the
         therapeutic regimen is commenced. In further embodiments, the human subject is
          10 years old or older when the therapeutic regimen is commenced.
[00117]  In some instances, RP may appear in a human subject during the second decade or
         even later. The average age of diagnosis for arRP in a human is about 36 years
         old (Tsujikawa M. et al., Arch Ophthalmol 126(3) 337-340 (2008)).              Thus, in
         other embodiments, the human subject is 15 years old or older when the
         therapeutic regimen is commenced. In more specific embodiments, the human
         subject is 20 years old or older, 30 years old or older, 40 years or older, 50 years
         or older, 60 years or older or 70 years or older when the therapeutic regimen is
         commenced.
[00118]  In further embodiments, the human subject is an aging subject suffering from age
         related retinal disorders. As used herein, an aging human subject is typically at
         least 45, or at least 50, or at least 60, or at least 65 years old when the therapeutic
         regimen is commenced.
[00119]  Preferably, for any of these subjects, the therapeutic regimens and methods of the
         invention should commence as soon as a diagnosis of a visual disorder as defined
         herein is ascertained, such that any degeneration of the retina, in particular the
         photoreceptors, has not reached a point where the therapeutic regimens of the

WO 2011/132084                                                              PCT/IB2011/001294
                                              30
         invention would be ineffective in treating or ameliorating the visual disorder in
         the subject.
[00120]  Synthetic Retinal Derivatives of the invention
[00121]  The present invention provides methods of restoring or stabilizing photoreceptor
         function in a subject's visual system. Synthetic retinal derivatives can be
         administered to restore or stabilize photoreceptor function, and/or to ameliorate
         the effects of a deficiency in retinoid levels. Photoreceptor function can be
         restored or stabilized, for example, by providing a synthetic retinoid that can act
         as an 11-cis-retinoid replacement and/or an opsin agonist. The synthetic retinoid
         also can ameliorate the effects of a retinoid deficiency on a subject's visual
         system. A       synthetic   retinoid    can  be   administered    prophylactically    or
         therapeutically to a subject.
[00122]   The synthetic retinal derivatives are retinoids derived from 1 1-cis-retinal or 9-cis
         retinal. In certain embodiments, the synthetic retinal derivative is a synthetic 9- or
          11-cis retinoid. In other embodiments, the synthetic retinoid is a derivative of 11
         cis-retinal or 9-cis-retinal, with the proviso that the synthetic retinoid is not 9-cis
         retinal. In some embodiments, a synthetic retinal derivative can, for example, be a
         retinoid replacement, supplementing the levels of endogenous retinoid.
[00123]  Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, the synthetic retinal
         derivatives used in the therapeutic regimens of the invention provide replacements
         for endogenously produced 1 1-cis-retinal, thereby restoring the key biochemical
         component of the visual cycle.        A synthetic retinal derivative suitable for the
         therapeutic regimens of the invention can be a derivative of 9-cis-retinal or 11 -cis
         retinal. Like 1 1-cis-retinal, 9-cis-retinal can bind to opsin to form photoactive
         isorhodopsin which, when bleached, undergoes conformational changes via the

         same photoproducts as 11-cis-retinal regenerated rhodopsin (Yoshizawa, T. et al.,
         Nature 214, 566-571 (1967) and Filipek S. et al., Annu Rev Physiol 65:851-79
         (2003)). 9-cis-retinal and its derivatives are generally more thermodynamically
         stable than their 11-cis retinal counterparts.
[00124]  The synthetic retinal derivative can be converted directly or indirectly into a
         retinal or a synthetic retinal analog.      Thus, in some aspects, the compounds
         according to the present invention can be described as pro-drugs, which upon
         metabolic transformation are converted into 9-cis-retinal, 11-cis-retinal or a
         synthetic retinal analog thereof. Metabolic transformation can occur, for example,
         by acid hydrolysis, esterase activity, acetyltransferase activity, dehydrogenase
         activity, or the like. For example, without wishing to be bound by theory, it is
         thought that a synthetic 9-cis-retinal derivative (e.g., 9-cis-retinyl acetate), is
         converted to 9-cis-retinol in the alimentary pathway, transported to the retina
         through the bloodstream and converted to 9-cis-retinal in the RPE.
[00125]  Synthetic retinal derivatives suitable for the methods of the present disclosure can
         be those described in International Published Patent Application Nos. WO
         2004/082622 and WO 2006/002097, and Published U.S. Application Nos.
         2004/0242704 and US 2010/0035986, which applications are incorporated herein
         by reference in their entireties.
[00126]  The synthetic retinal derivative can bind to opsin and function as an opsin agonist.
         As used herein, the term "agonist" refers to a synthetic retinal derivative that binds
         to opsin and facilitates the ability of the opsin/synthetic retinal derivative complex
         to respond to light. As an opsin agonist, a synthetic retinal derivative can create a
         pharmacological bypass of a blocked retinoid cycle, thus sparing the requirement
         for endogenous retinoid (e.g., 1 1-cis-retinal).

         acetals and 11 -cis-retinyl hemiacetals, as further described herein.
[00148]  In one aspect, the synthetic retinal derivative is a retinyl ester. In some
         embodiments, the retinyl ester is a 9-cis-retinyl ester or an 1 1-cis-retinyl ester. The
         ester substituent can be, for example, a carboxylic acid, such as a mono- or
         polycarboxylic acid. As used herein, a "polycarboxylic acid" is a di-, tri- or higher
         order carboxylic acid. In some embodiments, the carboxylic acid is a C1 -C22, C2
         C22, C3-C22, CI-C1O, C2-C1O, C3-C1O, C4-C1O, C4-C8, C4-C6 or C4

[00150]  In an exemplary embodiment, the retinyl ester is a 9-cis-retinyl ester or an 1 1-cis
         retinyl ester including a C3-C1O polycarboxylic acid substituent. (In this context,
         the terms "substituent" or "group" refer to a radical covalently linked to the
         terminal oxygen in the polyene chain.). In another exemplary embodiment, the
         retinyl ester is a 9-cis-retinyl ester or an 11-cis-retinyl ester including a C2-C22 or

         retinyl tartarate. In some embodiments, the retinyl ester is not a naturally
         occurring retinyl ester normally found in the eye. In some embodiments, the
         retinyl ester is an isolated retinyl ester. As used herein, "isolated" refers to a
         molecule that exists apart from its native environment and is therefore not a
         product of nature. An isolated molecule may exist in a purified form or may exist
         in a non-native environment.

[00185]  wherein R is an alkyl group or an alkenyl group.
[00186]  In this embodiment, "alkyl" refers to a straight or branched hydrocarbon chain
         radical consisting solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms,                containing no
         unsaturation, having up to twenty two carbon atoms. In certain embodiments, an
         alkyl may comprise twelve to seventeen carbon atoms (also referred to as "C12-17
         alkyl"). In certain embodiments, an alkyl may comprise twelve to fifteen carbon
         atoms (also referred to as "C12-15 alkyl"). In certain embodiments, an alkyl may
         comprise one to eight carbon atoms (also referred to as "Cl-8 alkyl"). In other
         embodiments, an alkyl may comprise one to six carbon atoms (also referred to as
         "C1-6 alkyl"). In further embodiments, an alkyl may comprise one to four carbon
         atoms (also referred to as "Cl-4 alkyl"). The alkyl is attached to the rest of the
         molecule by a single bond, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, 1-methylethyl
         (iso-propyl),   n-butyl,   n-pentyl,    1,1-dimethylethyl   (t-butyl), 3-methylhexyl,
         2-methylhexyl, and the like.          Unless stated otherwise specifically in the
         specification, an alkyl group may be optionally substituted by one or more of the

WO 2011/132084                                                              PCT/IB2011/001294
                                             52
         following substituents: halo (including -F, -Br, -Cl and -I), cyano (-CN), nitro
         (-N02), oxo (=0), and hydroxyl (-OH).
[00187]  "Alkenyl" refers to a straight or branched hydrocarbon chain radical consisting
         solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms, containing at least one unsaturation (i.e.,
         C=C), having from two to up to twenty carbon atoms. In various embodiments, R
         is C12-17 alkenyl, Cl-8 alkenyl, C1-6 alkenyl or Cl-4 alkenyl. Unless stated
         otherwise specifically in the specification, an alkyl group may be optionally
         substituted by one or more of the following substituents: halo (including -F, -Br,
         -Cl and -I), cyano (-CN), nitro (-N02), oxo (=0), and hydroxyl (-OH).
[00188]  In certain embodiments, the 9-cis-retinyl esters are artificial retinoids that act as
         precursors (i.e., pre-drugs) of a pro-drug form of 9-cis-retinal. More specifically,
         the 9-cis-retinyl esters can be converted by the liver to a metabolic pro-drug form,
         namely fatty acid 9-cis-retinyl esters, which are stored in the liver in hepatic lipid
         droplets. Fatty acid 9-cis-retinyl esters and retinol are mobilized from the liver and
         enter the circulation where they travel to the eye and RPE.           There, they are
         converted to 9-cis-retinal which ultimately combines with photoreceptor opsins to
         form active visual pigments.
[00189]  A preferred 9-cis-retinyl ester is 9-cis-retinyl acetate (i.e., R is methyl).    Also
         referred to as "9-cis-R-Ac", 9-cis-retinyl acetate is a pharmaceutical pre-drug,
         which is metabolized by the liver to fatty acid 9-cis-retinyl esters, such as 9-cis
         retinyl palmitate. Fatty acid 9-cis-retinyl esters and retinol are then converted to
         9-cis-retinal in the eye and RPE as replacement of deficient chromophores such as
          11-cis-retinal.
[00190]  9-cis-R-Ac can be prepared by initially converting all-trans-retinyl acetate
         (Sigma-Aldrich) to a mixture of 9-cis-retinyl acetate and all-trans-retinyl acetate

WO 2011/132084                                                              PCT/IB2011/001294
                                             53
         in the presence of a palladium catalyst (e.g., palladium salts, palladium oxides).
         The mixture of 9-cis-retinyl acetate and all-trans-retinyl acetate are then
         hydrolyzed to produce a mixture of 9-cis-retinol and all-trans-retinol. The pure 9
         cis-retinol can be isolated by selective recrystallization and further esterified to
         pure 9-cis-R-Ac.      A detailed description of the processes for preparing and
         purifying 9-cis-R-Ac can be found, for example, in GB Patent No. 1452012.
[00191]  In other embodiments, the retinyl esters are pro-drugs (rather than precursors of
         pro-drugs) and can be directly converted to 9-cis-retinal in the eye and RPE. The
         pro-drug forms of the 9-cis-retinyl esters are typically fatty acid 9-cis-retinyl
         esters, in which R is a CI1-21 alkyl. As used herein, "fatty acid" refers to a
         carboxylic acid having a long aliphatic chain, which can be saturated (alkyl) or
         unsaturated (alkenyl). Typically, the aliphatic chain contains at least 11 carbons
         and can be as long as 21 carbons.           Exemplary fatty acids include, without
         limitation, lauric acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and
         linolenic acid.
[00192]  Thus, in one embodiment, R is a C15 alkyl, and the 9-cis-retinyl ester of Formula
         (XXX) is 9-cis-retinyl palmitate.
[00193]  In a further embodiment, R is a C17 alkyl, and the 9-cis-retinyl ester of Formula
         (XXX) is 9-cis-retinyl stearate.
[00194]  In other embodiment, R is a C17 alkenyl, and the 9-cis-retinyl ester of Formula
         (XXX) is 9-cis-retinyl oleate.
[00195]  The 9-cis-retinyl esters described herein can be prepared from 9-cis-retinol using
         appropriate esterifying agents in a manner similar to the preparation of 9-cis-R
         Ac, the methods of which are within the knowledge of one skilled in the art.

         acid, by reaction of a primary halide with a carboxylate salt of a retinoic acid, or
         the like. In an exemplary embodiment, retinyl esters can be formed by acid
         catalyzed esterification of a retinol with a carboxylic acid, such as, acetic acid,
         propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, caprylic acid, pelargonic
         acid, capric acid, lauric acid, oleic acid, stearatic acid, palmitic acid, myristic acid,
         linoleic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid or the like.          In another exemplary
         embodiment, retinyl esters can be formed by reaction of an acyl halide with a
         retinol (see, e.g., Van Hooser et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 97:8623-28
         (2000)). Suitable acyl halides include, for example, acetyl chloride, palmitoyl
         chloride, or the like.
[00198]  Retinyl ethers can be formed by methods known in the art, such as for example,
         reaction of a retinol with a primary alkyl halide.
[00199]  In certain embodiments, trans-retinoids can be isomerized to cis-retinoids by
         exposure to UV light. For example, all-trans-retinal, all-trans-retinol, all-trans
         retinyl ester or all-trans-retinoic acid can be isomerized to 9-cis -retinal, 9-cis
         retinol, 9-cis-retinyl ester or 9-cis -retinoic acid, respectively. trans-Retinoids can
         be isomerized to 9-cis-retinoids by, for example, exposure to a UV light having a
         wavelength of about 365 nm, and substantially free of shorter wavelengths that
         cause degradation of cis-retinoids, as further described herein.
[00200]  Retinyl acetals and hemiacetals can be prepared, for example, by treatment of 9
         cis- and 1 l-cis- retinals with alcohols in the presence of acid catalysts. Water
         formed during reaction is removed, for example by A1203 of a molecular sieve.
[00201]  Retinyl oximes can be prepared, for example, by reaction of a retinal with

[00202]  Retinyl esters can be formed by methods known in the art such as, for example, by
         acid-catalyzed esterification of a retinol with a carboxylic acid, by reaction of an
         acyl halide with a retinol, by transesterification of a retinyl ester with a carboxylic
         acid, by reaction of a primary halide with a carboxylate salt of a retinoic acid, by
         acid-catalyzed reaction of an anhydride with a retinol, or the like. In an example,
         retinyl esters can be formed by acid-catalyzed esterification of a retinol with a
         carboxylic acid, such as, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid,
         caproic acid, caprylic acid, pelargonic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, oleic acid,
         stearatic acid, palmitic acid, myristic acid, linoleic acid, succinic acid, fumaric
         acid or the like. In another example, retinyl esters can be formed by reaction of an
         acyl halide with a retinol (Van Hooser et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 97:8623
         28 (2000)). Suitable acyl halides include, for example, acetyl chloride, palmitoyl
         chloride, or the like.
[00203]  In another embodiment of the invention, the synthetic retinal derivative is a retinyl
         ester. Retinyl ethers can be formed by methods known in the art, such as for
         example, reaction of a retinol with a primary alkyl halide.
[00204]  In another embodiment of the invention, trans-retinoids can be isomerized to cis
         retinoids by exposure to UV light. For example, all-trans-retinal, all-trans-retinol,
         all-trans-retinyl ester or all-trans-retinoic acid can be isomerized to 9-cis-retinal,
         9-cis-retinol, 9-cis-retinyl ester or 9-cis-retinoic acid, respectively, by exposure to
         a UV light having a wavelength of about 365 nm, and substantially free of shorter
         wavelengths that cause degradation of cis-retinoids, as further described herein.
[00205]  In another embodiment of the invention, the synthetic retinal derivative is a retinyl
         acetal or hemiacetal, which can be prepared, for example, by treatment of 9-cis-

WO 2011/132084                                                             PCT/IB2011/001294

         and 1 l-cis- retinals with alcohols in the presence of acid catalysts. Water formed
         during reaction is removed, for example by A1203 of a molecular sieve.
[00206]  In another embodiment of the invention, the synthetic retinal derivatives is a
         retinyl oxime, which can be prepared, for example, by reaction of a retinal with
         hydroxylamine, 0-methyl- or O-ethylhydroxyl amine, or the like.
[00207]  The synthetic retinal derivative of the invention can be substantially pure in that it
         contains less than about 5% or less than about 1%, or less than about 0.1%, of
         other retinoids.    One or more synthetic retinal derivatives may be used in the
         therapeutic regimens of the invention.
PHARMACEUTICALLY ACCEPTABLE COMPOSITIONS OF THE INVENTION
[00208]  Synthetic retinal derivatives of the invention can be formulated, for example, as
         pharmaceutically acceptable compositions for local administration to the eye
         and/or   for    systemic    administration  such   as  intravenous,    intramuscular,
         subcutaneous, enteral, parenteral or oral administration.
[00209]  Synthetic retinal derivatives of the invention can be formulated for administration
         using pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles as well as techniques routinely used in
         the art. A vehicle can be selected according to the solubility of the synthetic
         retinal derivative.    Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable compositions include
         those that are administrable locally to the eye, such as by eye drops, injection or
         the like. In the case of eye drops, the formulation can also optionally include, for
         example, ophthalmologically compatible agents such as isotonizing agents such as
         sodium chloride, concentrated glycerin, and the like; buffering agents such as
         sodium phosphate,        sodium acetate,     and  the like;    surfactants   such  as
         polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate (also referred to as Polysorbate 80),

WO 2011/132084                                                             PCT/IB2011/001294
                                            58
         polyoxyl stearate 40, polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil, and the like;
         stabilization agents such as sodium citrate, sodium edentate, and the like;
         preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, parabens, butylated hydroxyanisole
         (BHA) and the like; and other ingredients. Preservatives can be employed, for
         example, at a level of from about 0.001 to about 1.0% weight/volume. The pH of
         the formulation is usually within the range acceptable to ophthalmologic
         formulations, such as within the range of about pH 4 to 8.
[00210]  Synthetic retinal derivatives used in the therapeutic regimens of the invention can
         be delivered to the eye by any suitable means, including, for example, oral,
         intravenous, intramuscular or local administration. Modes of local administration
         can include, for example, eye drops, intraocular injection or periocular injection,
         or delivery via a controlled release drug delivery formulation and/or device.
         Periocular injection typically involves injection of the synthetic retinal derivative
         into the conjunctiva or to the tenon (the fibrous tissue overlying the eye).
         Intraocular injection typically involves injection of the synthetic retinal derivative
         into the vitreous. The administration can be non-invasive, such as by eye drops or
         in oral dosage form.
[00211]  In certain embodiments, the synthetic retinal derivative is formulated into a
         formulation suitable for oral or local delivery to the eyes. Most of the synthetic
         retinal derivatives are oily substances and lipophilic and are therefore easily
         miscible with one or more lipid vehicles.
[00212]  Certain synthetic retinal derivatives of the invention (e.g., 9-cis-retinyl esters) are
         light- and oxygen-sensitive. It is therefore desirable to maintain the stability and
         maximize the efficacy and shelf-life of the formulation. A suitable lipid vehicle
         may be selected based on its ability to stabilize the 9-cis-retinyl esters suspended

WO 2011/132084                                                             PCT/IB2011/001294
                                              59
         or solubilized therein. As used herein, "lipid" or "lipid vehicle" refers to one or a
         blend of fatty acid esters. In various embodiments, the lipid vehicle comprises
         one or more triglycerides, which are formed when a single glycerol is esterified by
         three fatty acids. Triglycerides include both vegetable oils and animal fats. In
         various embodiments, the lipid vehicle comprises more than 50 w/w%
         polyunsaturated fatty acids, the polyunsaturated fatty acids including an omega-6
         fatty acid and an omega-3 fatty acid in a ratio (by weight) of less than 15.
[00213]  In a preferred embodiment, the synthetic retinal derivative is formulated into an
         oral formulation comprising a 9-cis-retinyl ester and a lipid vehicle. In a further
         embodiment, the 9-cis-retinyl ester is 9-cis-retinyl acetate, and the lipid vehicle is
         soy bean oil. The description of additional lipid vehicles can be found in, for
         example, International Patent Application No. PCT/US2009/059126 in the name
         of QLT Inc., the relevant disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.
[00214]  The present invention also provides kits that contain a synthetic retinal derivative
         of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition of the invention.
         The kit also includes instructions for the use of the synthetic retinal derivative or
         the pharmaceutically acceptable composition in the therapeutic regimens and
         methods of the invention. Preferably, a commercial package will contain one or
         more unit doses of the synthetic retinal derivative or the pharmaceutically
         acceptable composition for use in a therapeutic regimen or method of the
         invention. For example, such a unit dose may be an amount sufficient for the
         preparation of an intraocular injection. Alternatively, such a unit dose may be an
         amount sufficient to effect treatment or amelioration of a visual disorder when
         administered to a human subject. It will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the
         art that for those synthetic retinal derivatives of the invention or pharmaceutically

                                            60
         acceptable compositions of the invention which are light and/or air sensitive may
         require special packaging and/or formulation. For example, packaging may be
         used for the kit which is opaque to light, and/or sealed from contact with ambient
         air, and/or formulated with suitable coatings or excipients.
DOSAGE, DOSAGE FREQUENCY AND MODES OF ADMINISTRATION
[00215]  The synthetic retinal derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable pharmaceutical
         compositions comprising the synthetic retinal derivatives used in the therapeutic
         regimens of the invention may be in the form of an oral dose.                 In one
         embodiment, a pharmaceutically         acceptable composition of the invention
         comprising a synthetic retinal derivative and a lipid vehicle is administered orally
         to the subject in the therapeutic regimen of the invention. In another embodiment
         of the invention, the orally-administered pharmaceutically acceptable composition
         of the invention comprises a 9-cis-retinyl ester and soybean oil.         In another
         embodiment of the invention, the orally-administered pharmaceutically acceptable
         composition comprises 9-cis-retinyl acetate or 9-cis-retinyl succinate and soybean
         oil (USP grade).
[00216]  Oral administration of the synthetic retinal derivatives of the invention has several
         potential advantages, including exposure of all photoreceptors in both eyes of the
         subject undergoing the therapeutic regimen of the invention to therapy, lack of
         surgical intervention, and cessation of administration at any time. In a preferred
         embodiment, treatment may begin in subjects diagnosed with LCA just after birth
         and continue throughout the subject's life.     In other embodiments, therapeutic
         regimens of the invention may be used in combination with vector-mediated gene
         transfer therapy for replacement of one or more genes, for example, RPE65 or
         LRAT, associated with the visual cycle in a subject, for example in subjects who

WO 2011/132084                                                            PCT/IB2011/001294
                                            61
         have already received gene therapy as a method for treating or ameliorating visual
         disorders associated with endogenous retinoid deficiency in a subject.
[00217]  Additional suitable dosage forms for the synthetic retinal derivatives of the
         invention include those formulated for injection. For example, a synthetic retinal
         derivative for use in a therapeutic regimen of the invention can be provided in an
         injection grade saline solution, in the form of an injectable liposome solution, or
         other carriers or vehicles.       In certain embodiments, the synthetic retinal
         derivatives described herein can be formulated for local injection into the eyes.
         Intraocular and periocular injections are known to those skilled in the art and are
         described in numerous publications including, for example, Ophthalmic Surgery:
         Principles of Practice, Ed., G. L. Spaeth, W. B. Sanders Co., Philadelphia, Pa.,
         U.S.A.,   pages 85-87 (1990).       In other embodiments, the synthetic retinal
         derivatives can be formulated for systemic delivery via subcutaneous injection. In
         one embodiment, for subcutaneous injection, a 9-cis-retinyl ester may be
         formulated in a lipid vehicle, such as soybean oil.
[00218]  A synthetic retinal derivative can also be administered in a therapeutic regimen of
         the invention in a time release formulation and/or device, for example in a
         composition which includes a slow release polymer, or via a time-release, delayed
         release or sustained release delivery system to afford delivery of a synthetic retinal
         derivative over the course of one or more of the dosing phase time periods. Such
         systems can avoid repeated administrations of compositions described in this
         disclosure. Numerous types of drug release delivery systems are known to those
         of skill in the art, including ophthalmic drug delivery devices designed for
         positioning in or near the ocular tissues, for example, suitable for placement
         adjacent the sclera, or in the punctum, or within the vitreous, and capable of

WO 2011/132084                                                          PCT/IB2011/001294
                                            62
         delivering one or more synthetic retinoids of the present invention on a time
         released, or delayed release or sustained release fashion.    The synthetic retinal
         derivative for use in the therapeutic regimens of the invention can be prepared
         with a carrier(s) that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a
         controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery
         systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene
         vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic       acid, collagen, polyorthoesters,
         polylactic acid and polylactic, polyglycolic copolymers (PLG). Many methods for
         the preparation of such formulations are known to those skilled in the art.
[00219]  The therapeutic     regimens    of the present invention produce        meaningful
         improvement or recovery of vision that is long lasting, while reducing chronic
         toxic side effects can be greatly reduced, and thus in one embodiment, the
         therapeutic regimens of the present invention may be suitable as a long-term
         (chronic) therapeutic regimen.
[00220]  The length of the period of time between the first dosing period and the
         subsequent dosing period may optionally be based on the persistence or increase
         in one or more of the subject's visual function parameters, as defined herein.
         Dosing-dependent effects or improvement in the subject's visual functions may be
         observed and assessed on an individual basis to allow for customization of the
         subject's dosing requirements. Alternatively, commencement of any subsequent
         dosing period may be based on a decrease in one or more of the subject's visual
         function parameters relative to previous efficacy assessments during first dosing
         period and any resting period. For instance, the efficacy of the subject's dosing
         may be assessed at, for example, about 1 month, 4 months, 6 months, 8 months,
          11 months following the first dosing period. At any point of the assessment, a

WO 2011/132084                                                             PCT/IB2011/001294
                                            63
         subsequent dosing period may commenced based on regression or a return to
         baseline of one or more of the subject's visual function parameters during any
         resting period.
EVALUATION OF THERAPEUTIC EFFECT
[00221]  The effectiveness of the therapeutic regimens of the invention in treating or
         ameliorating visual disorders in a subject associated with an endogenous retinoid
         deficiency can be evaluated based on several measures of vision function,
         including those as described below.
[00222]  Improvements in the subject's visual functions in one or both eyes may be
         evaluated based on measures of visual field, visual acuity, and retinal sensitivity
         testing, as well as electroretinograms, dynamic pupillary response, nystagmus,
         cortical visual function, color vision, visual mobility testing, and patient-reported
         outcomes of quality of life/ability to perform life tasks.      Improvements in the
         subject's visual functions in one or both eyes during a therapeutic regimen of the
         invention can be demonstrated by comparing the subject's visual functions of each
         eye with a baseline measure of the subject's visual functions of each eye prior to
         the treatment by a therapeutic regimen of the invention or by comparing the
         subject's visual functions of each eye with a comparable human visual system not
         receiving the treatment.
[00223]  It was demonstrated (see Examples 2 and 3 below) that one or more of the visual
         function parameters listed below improved rapidly in three LCA patients, all of
         which had genetic mutations in the LRAT gene.                 These improvements,
         particularly in visual field and visual acuity, could be sustained for up to 11
         months following an initial dosing period of one week.            Thus, it has been
         identified that, for subjects with endogenous retinoid deficiency, a population of

WO 2011/132084                                                               PCT/IB2011/001294
                                               64
           dormant photoreceptors       are   capable    of rapidly    responding   to  external
           manipulation provided by the therapeutic regimen of the invention described
           herein, i.e., by the administration of a synthetic retinal derivative as disclosed
           herein. Efficacy is also observed in LCA subjects with mutations in the RPE65
           gene (Examples 4 and 5) as well as subjects with RP (Example 7 and 8).
        1.     Visual Field
[00224]    The visual field is an individual's entire scope of vision, including the central and
           peripheral (side) vision of each eye.        Normal human visual field extends to
           approximately 60 degrees nasally (toward the nose, or inward) in each eye, to 100
           degrees temporally (away from the nose, or outwards), and approximately 60
           degrees above and 75 below the horizontal meridian.
[00225]    Subjects having visual disorders as described herein may have various degrees of
           impairments that can span from non-detectable to significantly contracted visual
           field.
[00226]    Thus, in one embodiment of the therapeutic regimens of the invention, the
           subject's visual field improves, temporally and/or nasally, in the initial dosing
           period as compared to the baseline of the subject's visual field obtained prior to
           the initial dosing period.      In certain embodiments, the subject's visual field
           continues to improve during the resting period as compared to the improvement in
           the subject's visual field during the initial dosing period. In certain embodiments,
           the improvement in the subject's visual field observed during the initial dosing
           period is sustained during the resting period.
[00227]    In various embodiments of the present invention, for example for subjects with
           LRAT or RPE65 mutation, including without limitation, LCA or arRP patients,
           the subject's visual field expands by at least 5 degrees or at least 10 degrees

WO 2011/132084                                                             PCT/IB2011/001294
                                             65
         nasally, and at least 20 degrees, or at least 30 degrees or at least 40 degrees
         temporally during the initial dosing period.
[00228]  Commencement of the subsequent dosing period may begin upon assessment of
         the improvement of the subject's visual field during the initial dosing period and
         during the resting period.       For example, the subsequent dosing period may
         commence if the subject's visual field returns to a level prior to the initial dosing
         period or to a pre-determined level during the initial resting period.
[00229]  Visual field can be tested by art-recognized techniques and standards, such as
         Kinetic Perimetry by Goldmann Visual Field testing (GVF) or Static Perimetry by
         Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer (HFA).
[00230]  2. Visual Acuity
[00231]  Visual acuity refers to acuteness or clearness of vision, especially form vision,
         which is dependent on the sharpness of the retinal focus within the eye and the
         sensitivity of the interpretative faculty of the brain. Visual acuity is a measure of
         the spatial resolution of the visual processing system and is usually tested in a
         manner to optimize and standardize the conditions.
[00232]  Visual acuity testing is the most common method for assessing a subject's visual
         function, and the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) method
         is the gold-standard for measuring treatment effects in clinical trials. However,
         this method measures vision under high contrast and standard room lighting
         conditions.   Subjects with LCA typically have the most difficulty with vision
         under conditions of low luminance.             The Smith-Kettlewell Institute Low
         Luminance (SKILL) Chart was designed to assess vision under conditions of low
         contrast that simulates low lighting, through a test performed with standard indoor
         lighting.   The SKILL Chart has a high-contrast near-acuity chart on one side

WO 2011/132084                                                               PCT/IB2011/001294
                                                66
           (black letter on white), and a low-luminance, low-contrast chart on the other (gray
           letters on a dark background). The low reflectance of the dark side of the card
           simulates testing in a dim environment. Repeatability of acuity testing with the
           SKILL card has been shown to be as good as repeatability of Snellen acuity.
[00233]    In certain embodiments of the present invention, the degree of improvement in
           visual acuity over baseline may be dependent on the subject's baseline visual
           acuity. For patients with very low visual acuity (light perception or hand waving,
           zero letters), clinically meaningful improvement may be associated with an
           improvement of 1-5 ETDRS letters.          Patients with higher baseline VA (20-50
           letters) may have a higher potential improvement from baseline based on their
           overall retinal health and architecture.
[00234]    Thus, in one embodiment of the therapeutic regimens of the invention, the
           subject's visual acuity improves during the initial dosing period as compared to
           the subject's visual acuity level prior to the treatment during the initial dosing
           period, i.e, the subject's visual acuity baseline.      In certain embodiments, the
           subject's visual acuity continues to improve during resting period as compared to
           the improvement in the subject's visual acuity level observed at the end of the
           initial dosing period. In certain embodiments, the improvement in the subject's
           visual acuity is sustained during the resting period at about the subject's visual
           acuity level at the end of the initial dosing period.
        3.      Retinal Sensitivity
[00235]    A subject's retinal sensitivity can be measured by determining the absolute
           intensity threshold, that is, the minimum luminance of a test spot required to
           produce a visual sensation. Retinal sensitivity is related to the eye's ability to
           adjust to various levels of darkness and light and to detect contrast.

WO 2011/132084                                                              PCT/IB2011/001294
                                              67
[00236]  Full-field   stimulus   testing (FST) was      developed to measure dark-adapted
         sensitivity using commercial equipment in patients unable to fixate (Roman, A.J.
         et al., Physiol. Meas. 28(8):N51-N56 (2007)). The test uses a full-field (Ganzfeld)
         white-flash     stimulus presentation available     in a commercial        ERG dome
         (Diagnosys) and available software allows for reliable, efficient psycho-physical
         measures of absolute threshold, expressed in log luminance (log cd/m2). FST has
         previously been shown to measure rod and cone sensitivity to white, blue, and red
         stimuli in RPE65-deficient LCA patients who had limited or no ERG responses
         (Jacobson, S.G. et al., Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 50(5):2368-2375 (2009)).
         Therefore, FST is a useful test to measure visual function in subjects having visual
         disorders associated with endogenous retinoid deficiency, including LCA or RP
         patients, or subjects having LRAT or RPE65 mutation.
[00237]  Thus, in one embodiment of the therapeutic regimens of the invention, the
         subject's retinal sensitivity improves during the initial dosing period as compared
         to the subject's retinal sensitivity baseline prior to the treatment during the initial
         dosing period. In certain embodiments, the subject's retinal sensitivity continues
         to improve during the resting period as compared to the improvement in the
         subject's retinal sensitivity at the end of the initial dosing period.        In certain
         embodiments, the improvement in the subject's retinal sensitivity is sustained
         during the resting period at about the subject's retinal sensitivity level at the end of
         the initial dosing period.
[00238]  4. Electroretinograms (ERG)
[00239]  ERG testing is a well-accepted standard test and is used routinely to diagnose and
         monitor progression of most inherited retinal diseases (IRD) including LCA.

WO 2011/132084                                                               PCT/IB2011/001294
                                              68
           Physicians specializing in IRD agree that significant, repeatable improvements in
           ERG responses are indicative of improved visual function.
[00240]    The three main types of traditional global or full-field ERG that evaluate general
           retinal response are scotopic, photopic, and flicker testing. A limitation of full
           field ERG is that the recording is a massed potential from the whole retina.
           Unless 20% or more of the retina is affected with a diseased state, ERG recordings
           are usually normal (e.g., a legally blind person with macular degeneration,
           enlarged blind spot or other central scotomas may have normal global ERGs).
           Most LCA and RP subjects have virtually no measurable ERG recordings, yet
           many of these subjects can still see, some quite well. Recent gene therapy trials
           for LCA have not reported changes in full-field ERG results, which may be
           because the methods in these trials treated less than 10% of the retina, so the ERG
           results would not be expected to change.
        5.      Dynamic Pupillary Response (Pupillometry)
[00241]    Pupillary responses (constriction of the pupil in response to a bright light
           stimulus) may be abnormal in subjects having a visual disorder as described
           herein. Dynamic pupillometry is a non-invasive method to record the pupillary
           response and monitor potential changes in response to treatment.            Pupillary
           reflexes improved in LCA subjects with RPE65 deficiency after receiving gene
           therapy (Maguire, A.M. et al., New Engl J Med. 358:2240-2248 (2008)). This
           procedure may be performed with an appropriate pupillometer.
[00242]    Thus, in one embodiment of the therapeutic regimens of the invention, the
           subject's pupillary response improves during the initial dosing period as compared
           to the subject's pupillary response baseline level prior to the treatment during the
           initial dosing period.   In certain embodiments, the subject's pupillary response

WO 2011/132084                                                             PCT/IB2011/001294
                                              69
           continues to improve during the resting period as compared to the subject's
           pupillary response level at the end of the initial dosing period.         In certain
           embodiments, the improvement in the subject's pupillary response is sustained
           during the resting period at about the subject's pupillary response level at the end
           of the initial dosing period.
        6.     Nystagmus
[00243]    Nystagmus is a form of involuntary eye movement that is frequently associated
           with visual impairment, including LCA. Nystagmus amplitude and frequency is
           measured non-invasively and can be used to monitor potential changes in response
           to treatment such as by videotaping the eye movements for qualitative clinical
           analysis of the subject's oscillation and strabismus. (Maguire, A.M. et al., New
           Engl J Med. 358:2240-2248 (2008)).
[00244]    Thus, in one embodiment of the therapeutic regimens of the invention, the subject
           demonstrates a decrease in the amplitude and/or frequency of nystagmus during
           the initial dosing period.    In another embodiment, the subject demonstrates a
           continued decrease in the amplitude and/or frequency of nystagmus during the
           resting period.
        7.      Cortical Visual Function
[00245]    The therapeutic effectiveness of the therapeutic regimens of the invention may be
           monitored using effects of the subject's vision on cortical visual function as
           measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).          Functional scans
           consist of a contrast sensitivity challenge, movement stimulus challenge, and
           higher level cognitive challenges.    Data are normally displayed as percentage
           change in MRI signal from baseline.       Maps of statistical significance will be
           displayed on the reconstructed cortical surface from each individual. The pre- and

WO 2011/132084                                                               PCT/IB2011/001294
                                              70
           post- treatment scans will be directly compared in terms of the extent and
           magnitude of activation.
[00246]    Thus, in one embodiment of the therapeutic regimens of the invention, the
           subject's cortical vision function improves during the initial dosing period as
           compared to the subject's cortical vision function baseline level prior to the
           treatment during the initial dosing period. In certain embodiments, the subject's
           cortical vision function continues to improve during the resting period as
           compared to the subject's cortical vision function level at the end of the initial
           dosing period. In certain embodiments, the improvement in the subject's cortical
           vision function is sustained during the resting period at about the subject's cortical
           vision function level at the end of the initial dosing period.
        8.     Color Vision
[00247]    A color vision test checks a subject's ability to distinguish between different
           colors.   Ishihara plates are used to detect, classify and estimate the degree of
           defect in color vision. Color vision testing is also used to evaluate the function of
           the optic nerve and hereditary retinal disease.
[00248]    Color vision may be assessed by methods known in the art, including the Ishihara
           Color Test. The test consists of a number of colored plates, each of which contain
           a circle of dots appearing randomized in color and size. Within the pattern are
           dots which form a number visible to those with normal color vision.
[00249]    Thus, in one embodiment of the therapeutic regimens of the invention, the
           subject's color vision improves during the initial dosing period as compared to the
           subject's color vision baseline level prior to the treatment during the initial dosing
           period. In certain embodiments, the subject's color vision continues to improve
           during resting period as compared to the subject's color vision level at the end of

WO 2011/132084                                                               PCT/IB2011/001294
                                                71
            the initial dosing period.     In certain embodiments, the improvement in the
            subject's color vision is sustained during the resting period at about the subject's
            color vision level at the end of the initial dosing period.
        9.      Dark Adaptation
[00250]     Dark adaptation is defined as the recovery of light sensitivity by the retina in the
            dark after exposure to a bright light. Methods to measure dark adaptation are
            known in the art, including those methods defined in US 7,494,222 and US
            7,798,646, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.
        10.     Visual Mobility
[00251]     Visual mobility may be used as a measure of improved retinal function.
            Improvements in visual mobility can be determined by methods known in the art,
            including standardized obstacle courses and mazes, including those described in
            Bainbridge et al. N Engl J Med. 358:2231-9 (2008) and Maguire, A.M. et al., New
            Engl J Med. 358:2240-2248 (2008). Subjects may be assessed based on the time
            to navigate the course, or based on the number of times a subject bumps into
            obstacles or walks off course compared to the total number of obstacles present.
        11.     Visual Function Questionnaires
[00252]     There are a number of known Visual Function Questionnaires (VFQ's) which may
            be used to assess improvement in a subject's visual function.            One such
            questionnaire is the Children's Visual Function Questionnaire (CVFQ) (see, e.g.,
            Birch, E.E. et al., J. AAPOS. 11:473-9 (2007)). This is a vision-specific quality
            of-life instrument designed for use with parents of infants and young children.
[00253]     Another questionnaire is the Low Luminance Questionnaire (LLQ).           This is a
            questionnaire that has been developed specifically to assess visual performance of
            adults in low lighting conditions, such as night-time or darkened rooms (see, e.g.,
            Owsley, C. et al., Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 47:528-535               (2006). This

WO 2011/132084                                                               PCT/IB2011/001294
                                               72
            questionnaire was validated in a population of older subjects similar to the
            population eligible for the clinical study described below and correlates to rod
            mediated parameters of dark adaptation.
[00254]     The use of the VFQ's assists in identifying subjective improvements in visual
            function, particularly with     respect to activities     of daily    life following
            administration of a compound of the invention by the therapeutic regimens
            described herein.
        12.     Spectral Domain-Optical Coherence Tomography
[00255]     Optical coherence tomography (OCT)/autofluorescence (FAF) machines, such as
            the Heidelberg Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Germany), may be used to
            conduct ocular tomography scans.        The analyses of the scans may provide
            information as to the overall retinal health, including visualization of the
            photoreceptor layer, the outer segments, and measurement of retinal thickness and
            to assess presence or absence of autofluorescence.
[00256]     The following examples are provided merely as illustrative of various aspects of
            the invention and shall not be construed to limit the invention in any way.

                                              Safety Study
[00257]     A study of an orally-delivered pharmaceutically acceptable composition of the
            invention was conducted in twenty (20) healthy human volunteers to determine
            the safety of a composition comprising 9-cis-retinyl acetate ((2E, 4E, 6Z, 8E)-3,7
            dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl) nona-2,4,6,8-tetraen-1-yl acetate)
            and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) dissolved in soybean oil (USP).               The

WO 2011/132084                                                           PCT/IB2011/001294
                                            73
         concentration of 9-cis-retinyl acetate in the composition was adjusted such that the
         volume to be administered was convenient. For the dosing range of the study,
         compositions of 1.25 mg/mL, 5.0 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL 9-cis-retinyl acetate were
         prepared, containing 0.10% w/w BHA in Soybean oil (USP).             Six cohorts of
         subjects received escalating doses of the Composition orally from 1.25 mg/m2 up
         to 40 mg/m2. The composition was found to be well tolerated and there were no
         serious adverse events after 7 days of monitored therapy in a Phase I testing
         center. The most frequently reported side effects were headache (6 subjects, 12
         events), facial flushing (2 subjects, 7 events), and a facial burning sensation (2
         subjects, 6 events), which were primarily reported from the 40 mg/m2 dose group
         and collectively accounted for 25 of the 43 (58%) adverse events (AE) reported.
         In total, 41 of 43 AEs were of mild intensity. In some subjects, there was a
         modest and reversible elevation in triglycerides across all doses and a modest and
         reversible decline in high density lipoproteins (HDL) at the 10 - 40 mg/m2 doses.
                                           EXAMPLE 2
                                 Efficacy Study For LCA Subjects
[00258]  A study was designed to determine the efficacy of the composition of Example 1
         orally administered to human subjects having LCA (caused by mutations of either
         LRAT or RPE65).          Subjects received a once-daily loading dose of the
         composition orally (40 mg/m2) for 7 days. Subjects were treated on an outpatient
         basis, but they received study treatment in the research clinic under medical
         supervision for each day of treatment. During the study, subjects were required to
         limit vigorous physical activity (to avoid laboratory variability) and avoid
         excessive vitamin A intake in order to reduce the influence of such factors on the
         assessment of safety variables in this study.

WO 2011/132084                                                            PCT/IB2011/001294
                                            74
[00259]  Both eyes of each subject were evaluated separately.                Protocol-defined
         assessments of visual function included: best-corrected visual acuity testing using
         Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) testing followed by
         low/high contrast Smith-Kettlewell Institute Low Luminance (SKILL) charts;
         visual field testing using Goldmann perimetry; full-field electroretinogram (ERG);
         and full-field stimulus threshold testing (FST).      Baseline ERGs, ETDRS, and
         SKILL tests were repeated twice. During and after treatment, visual function tests
         were conducted on Day 1, 7, 9/10, and 14/15.
[00260]  It was at first believed that maximal effects of the composition would be achieved
         by limiting the amount of light reaching the retina and thus avoiding loss of the
         active chromophore, 9-cis-retinal, by bleaching. Therefore, in the first 2 subjects,
         an eye patch was worn on the eye with worse vision at all times until Day 7,
         except when undergoing the protocol-defined vision assessments.          Surprisingly
         and unexpectedly, bleaching was not observed and the improvement in visual
         function persisted or continued to improve after Day 7. Consequently, after data
         from the first 2 subjects did not reveal any difference between the patched and
         unpatched eye, the requirement of an eye patch was removed from the protocol.
[00261]  The efficacy assessments of this study for three subjects are set forth in Example 3
         to 5 below.

                                       Efficacy Assessments
[00262]  Both eyes of each subject were evaluated as described in Example 2. Protocol
         defined assessments of vision were performed from the first day of dosing on Day
         0 until Day 6. Follow-up visits were conducted until at least Day 13. If a clinical
         benefit was detected at Day 13, additional, optional follow-up visits were

WO 2011/132084                                                           PCT/IB2011/001294

         scheduled at biweekly intervals, with biweekly telephone calls between clinic
         visits, to continue assessing the status and duration of beneficial effects until a
         return to baseline was noted.
[00263]  Subject #1 was followed for over 100 days, while Subject #2 was followed for
         over 75 days.
[00264]  Early Treatment in Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) best-corrected visual
         acuities were measured for each subject at 1 meter and 4 meters.              Smith
         Kettlewell Institute Low Luminance (SKILL) acuities, Ishihara color plates,
         Goldmann visual fields (with V4e and IWe targets, GVF), ISCEV standard cone
         and rod electroretinogram (ERG) parameters, including rod, mixed rod/cone, 30
         Hz flicker and cone mediated ERGs (Diagnosys, LLC) were also measured. Full
         field stimulus testing (FST) (Diagnosys, LLC) according to a published protocol
         was performed.      Finally, in vivo retinal microscopy was performed by optical
         coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus autofluorescence was ascertained by
         Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering).      Efficacy was measured by comparing the
         results of pretreatment objective and subjective visual function testing with results
         of the same parameters obtained during and after the oral administration of the
         composition of Example 1.
          Vision Characteristicsof Subject #1 Before and After Treatment
[00265]  Subject #1 is a 10-year-old Caucasian female with LCA. At baseline, she was
         legally blind and presented with lifelong night blindness, visual loss, nystagmus,
         and severely attenuated ERGs.          Her Goldmann Visual Fields (GVFs) had
         progressively deteriorated. Her Early Treatment in Diabetic Retinopathy Study
         (ETDRS) visual acuity was 36 letters OD and 26 letters OS (approximately
         20/200 and 20/320 Snellen equivalent). There was mild horizontal nystagmus.

WO 2011/132084                                                           PCT/IB2011/001294
                                            76
         Ophthalmoscopic examinations were normal except for the "salt and pepper"
         changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the peripheral retina. Her
         GVF was constricted in both eyes to 300 with the V4e target and she was unable
         to see the I4e target (Figure 2). She had no detectable rod-mediated or rod/cone
         mediated ERGs, but some measurable cone-mediated activity (3.5 PV b-wave).
         Two baseline full-field threshold sensitivity (FST) tests revealed average
         thresholds of 0.5206 log cd/m2 (OD), whereas optical computed tomography
         (OCT) documented an essentially normal retinal structure.
[00266]  Within 12 hours after the first dose of the Composition, the subject developed a
         moderate headache and experienced         1 episode of vomiting, followed by
         photophobia. The headache resolved a few hours later and the subject and her
         family reported improved visual function, especially in a dimly lit environment.
         These subjective improvements were reported to have persisted at 4 months after
         cessation of dosing with the composition.
[00267]  During the study, there were no changes in the ophthalmoscopic exam. GVFs
         changed significantly and consistently (Figure 2A-G).      On Day 7, a new large
         temporal crescent was documented in both eyes by using the V4e target that
         remained on Day 14, when it was documented that she was also able to see the I4e
         (smaller) target (Figure 2C).      On Day 30, the visual fields had expanded
         temporally from 30' to 70' and nasally from 30' to 40' (Figure 2D).      The most
         unexpected change was found 4 months post-dosing, when her GVF size by the
         V4e target appeared close to the size expected in a normally-sighted child (Figure
         2E). FST sensitivity thresholds improved in the OD to 0.0990 log cd/m2 on Day
         2 (24 hours after the first dose) and remained at 0.1496 log cd/m2 on Days 8, 10
         and 15 (lower thresholds signify greater retinal sensitivity). ERG measurements,

          color vision and Smith-Kettlewell Institute Low Luminance (SKILL) chart
          measurements were unchanged from baseline.
[00268]   ETDRS acuities improved during treatment, and has been monitored until Month
           14 (Figure 4A). Continued assessments showed that the improvements relative to
          baseline (screening) have been maintained beyond the end of the treatment period.
Vision Characteristicsof Subject #2 Before and After Treatment
[00269]   Subject #2 is the 12-year-old brother of subject #1, who was also diagnosed with
          LCA at birth. He has had lifelong night blindness, nystagmus, and is legally
          blind. ETDRS best-corrected visual acuity was 9 letters OD and 7 letters OS
          (approximate Snellen 20/800) at baseline. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed
          arteriolar narrowing, significant peripheral pigmentary degeneration and a
          prominent maculopathy with foveal atrophy and RPE disruption. GVFs showed a
          large central defect with relatively intact peripheral fields. His ERGs were non
          detectable. Macular OCT revealed abnormalities in the retinal architecture with
          deposits between the photoreceptor and outer plexiform layers.
[00270]   Upon treatment with the Composition of Example 1, this subject did not develop a
          headache. There was no change in the ophthalmoscopic exam. Figure 4B shows
          that the ETDRS best-corrected visual acuities were significantly improved
          following treatment. This improvement has been maintained during follow-up (79
          days).   There were no changes in GVF, color vision, SKILL, ERG, or FST
          findings.
Vision Characteristicsof Subject #3 Before and After Treatment
[00271]   Subject #3 is a 38-year-old woman with LCA unrelated to the first 2 subjects. She
          had legal blindness, nystagmus, and required assistance to ambulate.     She was

WO 2011/132084                                                           PCT/IB2011/001294
                                            78
         unable to see any letters on the ETDRS chart.       She could see "hand motions"
         without the ability to count fingers at 1 m. Similarly, her color vision and SKILL
         visual acuity scores were 0. Her GVF was non-detectable (Figure 3A) and ERG
         was significantly attenuated OD (1.2 pv) and not recordable OS.           The OCT
          examination revealed an intact retinal architecture with a visible foveal OS/IS
         junction, confirming the presence of foveal photoreceptors.
[00272]  Twelve hours after the first dose of the Compostion, she developed a moderate
         headache and photophobia.       The headache resolved a few hours later and her
         photophobia decreased over the next 2 days. On Day 2 of treatment, while in the
         clinic, she reported that she was clearly able to see the outline of a computer
         monitor, the mirror in the bathroom and a white sheet of paper on a dark desk,
         none of which she had been able to see prior to the study. There were no changes
          in the ophthalmoscopic exam. On Day 9, she was able to read the ETDRS chart
          for the first time, and reached a letter score of 2 OS (approximate Snellen
         20/1000). She was also able to reliably see the V4e target centrally on the GVF
          (Figure 3B) on Days 3 and 7, but this became less reliable on Days 9 and 14.
         Retinal sensitivity improved from 1.1966 at screening to 0.9508 log cd/m2 at Day
          14 OD and from 2.2763 to 2.0688 log cd/m2 OS. Her other visual function tests
         were unchanged from baseline.
         Summary of Results with Subjects # 1, 2 and 3
[00273]  Three subjects aged 10, 12, and 38 years, all of whom have a genetic mutation in
         LRAT, were enrolled and treated. All 3 patients had the identical homozygous
         c.217_218delAT deletion in LRAT that leads to a p. Met73AspfsX47 frameshift
          and premature truncation of the LRAT protein, which likely represents a null

WO 2011/132084                                                            PCT/IB2011/001294
                                            79
          allele. After 7 days of treatment with the oral composition of Example 1, all of
          the subjects experienced clinically meaningful improvements in one or more
          visual function parameters, including best-corrected visual acuity, Goldmann
          visual field, and/or retinal sensitivity as measured by full-field sensitivity
          threshold testing. Subjects have also reported meaningful improvements in their
          visual performance related to tasks of daily living. The onset of visual changes
          was rapid and there was progressive improvement beyond the 7 days of treatment,
          with some effects persisting for more than 4 months after treatment was
          completed.     Improvements were most pronounced in the youngest subject, but
          clinically relevant changes were also noted in the one adult subject treated to date.
          The study treatment has been well-tolerated, with mild to moderate adverse events
          observed including transient headache, photophobia, and an              increase in
          triglyceride levels.
Discussion
[00274]   In the above example, 7 days of treatment with the Composition meaningfully
          restored bilateral visual function in 3 subjects with LCA and LRAT mutations,
          who had lifelong progressive visual loss due to this severe and blinding retinal
          condition. Improvement in three visual function parameters, including ETDRS
          visual acuities, GVF size and retinal sensitivity by FST, have been documented.
          Improvements became evident in as little as 12 hours following the first oral dose
          of the Composition and persisted or increased in magnitude in all follow-up visits
          to date (subject #1 over 14 months, subject #2 over 3 months, and subject #3 over
          2 weeks).

                                             80
[00275]  ETDRS visual acuity improved in all 3 subjects and the GVF improved in subjects
         #1 and #3. FST testing documented improved retinal sensitivities in subject #1
         and #3. In subject #1 the threshold improved from 0.5206 to 0.0990 and then to
         0.1496 log cd/m2. This improvement is likely significant as test-retest variability
         was measured at 0.3 log cd/m2 by Klein and Birch in similar patients with severe
         retinal dystrophies.    Klein M, et al. Doc Ophthalmol 119:217-24 (2009).          The
         improvement in retinal sensitivity in subject #3 does not reach significance.
         Subjects' improvements were not limited to clinical testing: all 3 have noted
         significant gains in their ability to read and perform activities of daily living.
         Most significantly, subject #1 reported during the study that they no longer need a
         cane to navigate, sees in dimly lit areas, can read the clock on the wall and is now
         able to perform her own self-care. Subject #3 was able during the study to read
         effectively by using vision aids and could see formed objects that she had not been
         able to see for years, including papers and mirrors.
[00276]  Following oral administration of the composition, without wishing to be bound by
         any particular theory, it is believed that the drug is incorporated into lipid droplets
         in the liver and in the RPE (called retinosomes) from which it is mobilized.
         Imanishi Y. et al. J Cell Biol 166:447-53 (2004). It is secreted by the liver bound
         to retinol binding-protein 4 (RBP4) and delivered to peripheral tissues, whereas in
         the eye it is oxidized to 9-cis-retinal which feeds back into the retinoid cycle
         (Figure 1).     Moise A.R. et al. Biochemistry 46:4449-58 (2007).             Retinols,
         regardless of their isomeric form, are also stored in adipocytes and mobilized as
         needed into the circulation.       O'Byrne S.M. et al. J Biol Chem 280:35647
         57(2005).    Thus, the long-term effects of this chromophore analog may derive
         from the fact that active drug is slowly released from adipocytes in the periphery.

[00277]  Results observed in this study suggested the existence of dormant photoreceptors
         that may rapidly respond to oral treatment such that patients at least into the fourth
         decade of life may benefit. Additionally, the findings in subject #1 suggested that
         the Composition may be able to restore visual function to large areas of previously
         unresponsive photoreceptors.has been maintained until Day 114 (Figure 4A).
         Continued assessments showed that the improvements relative to baseline
         (screening) persisted for up to and including 11 months beyond the end of the
         treatment period.

[00278]  Subject #5 was a 13-year-old Asian female with LCA due to missense mutations
         in the RPE65 gene at Leu67Arg/Tyr368Cys. At baseline, her retinal architecture
         was relatively intact (OCT) and there was a small amount of FAF in her inferior
         retina. At baseline, she presented with mild progression visual loss, nystagmus,
         non-detectable rod ERG, and severely decreased cone ERG.             Her Goldmann
         Visual Fields (GVFs) had superior defects.       Her Early Treatment in Diabetic
         Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity was 31 letters OD and 34 letters OS
         (approximately 20/250 Snellen equivalent).
[00279]  The subject was treated with 40 mg/m2 of the Composition of Example 1 for 7
         days as described in Example 2. On Day 9, her binocular visual acuity was 20/30.
         The patient was monitored for 6 months post dosing. ETDRS acuities remain
         improved, at 67 letters OD and 62 letters OS (Figure 5). GVF improvements of
         the superior field and central field as observed with IV4e and I4e targets also
         persisted. No change in ERG was observed.

         after treament. She noted the ability to see images on a small screen, see the
         colors of fireworks, and see stars in the sky. She reported improved vision and
         mobility in dim light.     The observed improvements from baseline have been
         monitored for 6 months post dosing and have persisted during this time period.

[00281]  Subject #9 was a 14-year-old Hispanic female with LCA due to missense
         mutations in the RPE65 gene at Arg91Gln/Leu341Ser.              At baseline, retinal
         degeneration was observed by retinal exam and OCT, with relatively intact foveal
         architecture (OCT) and FAF showed lipofuscin in the inferior retina. At baseline,
         she presented with mild nystagmus. Her Early Treatment in Diabetic Retinopathy
         Study (ETDRS) visual acuity was 41 letters OD and 47 letters OS (approximately
         20/200 Snellen equivalent).
[00282]  The subject was treated as outlined in Example 2, however a low dose, 10 mg/m2
         of the Composition of Example 1 for 7 days was used.              There were small
         improvements in GVF, with her VF almost doubling as observed with the I4e
         target (OD) by Day 14. ETDRS visual acuity improvements were observed, with
         the highest improvement from baseline of 10 letters (OD) at Day 14. Objective
         testing of cortical visual function before and after drug treatment was conducted
         using fMRI, and marked improvements observed, with subjective reporting of the
         ability to see the images on the fMRI projector post treatment.

                                       Efficacy Assessment
[00284]  The efficacy of the composition of Example 1 was tested in human subjects
         having RP (with LRAT or RPE65 mutation).            Subjects of a first dose group
         received a once-daily initial dose of the Composition (40 mg/m2) for 7 days.
         Subjects of a second dose group received a once-daily initial dose of the
         Composition (10 mg/m2) for 7 days. Subjects were treated on an outpatient basis,
         but received study treatment in the research clinic under medical supervision for
         each day of treatment. During the study, subjects were required to limit vigorous
         physical activity (to avoid laboratory variability) and avoid excessive vitamin A
         intake in order to reduce the influence of such factors on the assessment of safety
         variables in this study.
[00285]  Both eyes of each subject were evaluated separately.               Protocol-defined
         assessments of visual function included: best-corrected visual acuity testing using
         Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) testing followed by
         low/high contrast Smith-Kettlewell Institute Low Luminance (SKILL) charts;
         visual field testing using Goldmann perimetry; full-field electroretinogram (ERG);
         and full-field stimulus threshold testing (FST).     Baseline ERGs, ETDRS, and
         SKILL tests were repeated twice. During and after treatment, visual function tests
         were conducted on Day 1, 7, 9/10, and 14/15.
[00286]  There was no requirement that the subjects wear eye patch on one or both eyes.

[00287]  The efficacy assessments of this study were conducted according to the
         procedures as set forth in Examples 2 and 3, as well as assessments of dynamic
         pupillary response, nystagmus, cortical visual function, visual mobility, and
         patient-reported outcomes on quality of life.
[00288]  Subject #10 was a 27-year-old Indian male with RP due to homozygous mutations
         in the LRAT gene at c.525T>A; p.Ser175Arg.            His ETDRS visual acuity at
         baseline was 71 letters OD and 60 letters OS (approximately 20/40 and 20/62.5
         Snellen equivalent) unaided.
[00289]  The subject was treated with 40 mg/m2 of Composition A for 7 days, as described
         in Example 6. Small improvements in ETDRS visual acuity were observed, with
         the highest improvement from baseline of 11.5 letters (OD) at Day 9, and 14.5
         letters OS at Month 1.5.     Large improvements in GVF OD were detected, and
         supported by subjective reports of improvements in peripheral vision. Objective
         testing of cortical visual function before and after drug treatment was tested using
         fMRI, with marked improvements observed. No changes in cone or rod ERG
         were seen.
[00290]  The subject reported meaningful improvements in activities of daily living.
         Sensitivity to daylight and fluorescent lights was noted. Dark adaptation times
         were also improved. The patient was monitored for 1.5 months beyond the end of
         the treatment period, with improvements from baseline persisting.
                                     Summary of Efficacy Data
[00291]  The following summarizes the results of the efficacy data from the above
         Examples.
[00292]  A total of 11 subjects were studied, comprising two mutation types (LRAT and
         RPE65), two disease types (Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) and Retinitis

WO 2011/132084                                                           PCT/IB2011/001294
                                            85
         Pigmentosa (RP)), different age ranges (6 subjects 6-15 years and 5 subjects 21-41
         years), and a broad range of baseline visual function (Figure 6).      Four distinct
         ranges of baseline VA were established: hand motion and light perception, VA in
         the 0-20 letter range, VA in the 20-50 letter range, and VA in the 50-70 letter
         range. Largest responses in improvement in VA was observed for patients with a
         modest level of retinal function (Vas in the 20-40 letter range), all of which were
         treated with 40 mg/m2 of the Composition (Figure 7). The best responses, 3 lines
         of improvement, were seen in the younger patients (10-13 years).            Relative
         improvements in visual acuity over baseline for the 11 subjects were monitored
         for up to 14 months post dosing, demonstrating persistence of clinically
         meaningful improvements (Figure 8).
[00293]  AMA low vision grid analyses of the GVFs from Day 14 for the first 9 patients
         treated showed that 7 of 9 patients demonstrated marked improvements as
         detected with either the smaller I4e target (Figure 9A) or the larger V4e target
         (Figure 9B).
[00294]  Preliminary    data  obtained   from  use   of the   Children's   Visual   Function
         Questionnaire (CVFQ) or Low Luminance Questionnaire (LLQ) have been
         combined with subjective reports on improvements in activities of daily living,
         and support the rapid improvement in visual function and prolonged therapeutic
         benefit of treatment with the Composition.
[00295]  The study treatment was well tolerated.      Adverse events related to treatment
         included transient photophobia and headaches, vomiting, moderate elevations in
         triglyceride levels, and a trend toward a decrease in HDL levels in all subjects.
         Effects on lipid metabolism, a recognize class effect for retinoids, was found to
         peak at Day 7 of dosing (Figure 10), but returned to baseline within 4 weeks after

                                           86
         treatment was completed.      Overall, adverse events, including effects on lipid
         metabolism, were more pronounced in the 40 mg/m2 group relative to the lower
         dosed 10 mg/m2 group.
