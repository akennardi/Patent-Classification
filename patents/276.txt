              A     wire           strainer         including:             drive        means        comprising             a
mounting block with a drum mounted for rotation                                                relative         thereto
and          actuation               means      connected             to     the      drum     for       selectively
causing the rotary                       drum to rotate              relative         to the mounting block,
and a line member operatively connected to the drum in a manner
whereby              rotation          of the        drum       in    one     direction         causes        the     drum
to     pull           the       line     member        relative           to     the    mounting          block,        and
locking means for selectively locking the drum against rotation
in     the           opposite          direction;             first        gripping         means        operatively
connected                to      the   block        of    said       drive       means      and     adapted         to    be
releasably attached to a wire to be                                          strained;         said line member

                                              WIRE STRAINERS
 [0001]           This      invention              relates          to    wire       strainers             and   in
particular           wire     strainers            for     straining           fence        wires       in   rural
fencing and reference                   will      be made to such application.                           However,
the invention may have application in other fields.
 [0002]          A      number         of       different            types        of       wire        strainers
presently        exist.       One type has three gripping mechanisms suitably
adapted       to     grip    plain         wire       and     can be       used      directly           with    the
wire to be strained if it                         is a plain wire or with an auxiliary
plain      wire      where      barbed         wire      has     to     be   strained.            In    use,    the
auxiliary          wire     is      secured          to    a    strainer          post       or      some    other
suitable        straining          anchor          and    one     of     the    grippers           is    attached
to the wire to be strained                        in   a predetermined fixed position                           and
the      other     two    grippers           are      attached         to    the     auxiliary            wire   in
spaced       apart      movable         positions.             The     three      gripping            mechanisms
are connected to a lever in a manner such that movement of the
lever in one            direction moves one of the movable grippers                                          along
the auxiliary wire and movement in the other direction moves the
other movable gripper in the same direction along the auxiliary
wire      so  that      the     two      auxiliary           grippers         alternately              grip    then
release       and move as            the       lever      is    moved      back and            forth       thereby
pulling       the     wire      to    be      strained          towards        the      strainer          post   or
other anchor as the case may be.
 [0003]           In    cases      where        wire      strainers          of    this       type      are    used
directly with the wire to be strained, the movable grippers can
be attached to the wire to be strained and the fixed gripper can
be    attached        to   an     auxiliary           wire which           itself         is     fixed      to  the
strainer       post       or    other        suitable          anchor.        However,           the     grippers
often      cause      damage        to    the wire by              removing         the      galvanising         at
the point of attachment and in                          some cases by causing indentations
which      can     cause     stress        points         and breaking              of     the wire months
or even years later.

                                                       2
 [0004]          In   this       type     of wire        strainer,           the    grippers           include
two gripper jaws               connected to each other for pivoting movement
relative       about a pivot pin between an open position                                   in     which the
wire       can   be    placed         between        the       gripper         jaws      ("the         loading
position")         and a closed position in which the                               gripper jaws are
closed       about      and      grip      the     wire       ("the       gripping        position"           or
"straining          position")              The     two      grippers          are      biased         to    the
gripping position by a spring member connected thereto which is
typically a          substantially V-shaped wire or bar                               spring arranged
such that the free ends are biased outwards away from each other
to hold the grippers                in    the gripping position,                   that     is,      with the
grippers in the              closed position.               Such wire          strainers typically
have a small handle extending from one gripper jaw substantially
perpendicular in use to the wire being strained.
 [0005]         Another type of wire strainer uses an auxiliary chain
instead of an auxiliary                  plain      wire and the two auxiliary                       grippers
are arranged to engage with spaced apart links of the auxiliary
chain.       One    of    the     problems         with     that        arrangement         is      that     the
minimum movement of the wire is at least two links of the chain
because       the    chain        grippers         are    arranged         to    grip     links          in  the
same plane thereby restricting gripping to alternate                                              links and
the grippers themselves would interfere with each other even if
it    were possible to grip adjacent links.                              Consequently,             such wire
strainers         can     result       in    under      straining           or   over      straining          of
different sized or types of wires or at least variations in the
strain applied to different wires in the same fence.
 [0006]          In    both       types       of    wire      strainer,          the     fixed         gripper
typically          includes         two       jaw    members            which      engage          the      wire
therebetween          in     a   manner        such    that      the     jaw members            tighten       on
the      wire     as    the      strain         on   the       wire       increases.          While         that
mechanism is          generally satisfactory, sometimes                               it is       difficult
to open and close the jaws in the desired position on the wire.
Some      of   the    difficulty            arises       because          of    the     awkwardness           of

holding the lever mechanism in position on the auxiliary chain
or   the    auxiliary         wire   with  one    hand   while  working   the  jaw
mechanism with the other.
 [0007]         The present invention is          aimed at ameliorating to some
extent one or more of the aforementioned problems and at least
providing       a wire       strainer   which   is   reliable   and efficient   in
use.
 [0008]         With      the   foregoing   in   view,    the  invention    in one
aspect resides broadly in a wire strainer including:
        drive means comprising a mounting block with a drum mounted
for rotation relative thereto and actuation means connected to
the drum for selectively causing the drum to rotate relative to
the mounting block, and a line member operatively connected to
the    drum     in     a   manner   whereby    rotation     of the   drum   in one
direction       causes      the drum to pull       the line member    relative  to
the mounting          block,     and locking means      for selectively    locking
the    drum      against       rotation   in    the   opposite    direction,   the
actuation means and the locking means being selected to provide
a predetermined mechanical advantage;
        first gripping means operatively connected to the block of
said drive means and adapted to be releasably attached to a wire
to be strained; and
        said    line member        including   securing    means   for releasably
securing said line member to a strainer post or similar anchor.
 [0009]         In another aspect, the invention resides broadly in a
wire strainer including:
        drive means comprising a mounting block with a drum mounted
for rotation relative thereto and actuation means connected to
the drum for selectively causing the drum to rotate relative to
the mounting block, and a line member operatively connected to

direction       causes      the drum to pull       the line member    relative  to

         wherein said drive means is                  selected         such that           said locking
means may lock said drum in any selected one of a plurality of
locking positions upon rotation                       of said drum by said actuation
means      and    wherein          adjacent     ones    of    said        plurality           of    locking
positions        are      relatively        small    when      compared           to    the prior          art
strainers referred to earlier in this specification.
 [0010]          Preferably,            the    line     member          is      a    chain         and    the
securing       means        is    a  hook    attached      to    a    link        of    the     chain     and
adapted to hook                around the      chain or        to a       link in the             chain to
thereby       form       a    closed     loop    around      a    strainer            post.       However,
other line members such as a cable strap, rope                                       or the like may
be used if desired.
 [0011]          It     is    also preferred that            a second gripping means be
provided at the other end of the line member to allow the wire
strainer to be used in an in line situation where two wires are
to be strained together.

includes       an      actuating        lever    arranged        to     engage         the     drum      or  a
shaft      extending          from the      drum and       cause       it     to    rotate        or pivot
about      the    drum axis.          In   one   such    embodiment             the     drum or        shaft
has a sprocket or a gear secured thereto or formed therewith and
the actuating lever includes a pawl which is arranged to engage
a   tooth     or    cog     thereon      so   as  to   cause       the drum to              rotate       upon
movement of the               actuating lever relative to the block. In such
form, it is preferred that                     the locking means be a                      similar pawl

                                             5
arranged to engage another tooth or cog for locking the sprocket
or gear against reverse rotation thereby allowing the actuating
lever to operate the drum in a ratchet and pawl manner.
 [0013]         Advantageously, the diameter of the drum (or at least
the pitch circle of the drum, that is, the circle upon which the
line member         is    centred)    and the   length of the actuating       lever
are selected          to allow an average worker to easily operate the
wire strainer for straining normal farm fencing wire including
high     tensile        fencing    wire.    Importantly,     in  a   direct   drive
arrangement         the number of teeth         on the sprocket      determine  the
minimum      arc     which may      be   "locked"   and   therefore    the minimum
strain which may be put on the wire in any lever movement. For
example,      a sprocket with 360           teeth allows     the actuating    lever
to travel through a minimum arc of one degree before it can be
locked by the locking pawl while a sprocket with 90 teeth will
have a minimum of four degrees arc before it can be locked.
 [0014]         The inventor has found that an actuating lever length
of between about            150 mm and about 250 mm combined with a drum
having a pitch circle diameter of between 25 mm and 50 mm with
the locking mechanism arranged to allow increments of less than
30 degrees provides a wire strainer of an easily manageable size
which can be operated by an average fencer and allow the wires
to be efficiently strained without overstraining. Further, such
a wire     strainer may be           easily carried     on a quad bike,     a farm
bike or even           a horse thereby      allowing   a farmer or stockman      to
carry pliers and strainers at all times on a property and fix a
fence as he sees a problem. A small gauge chain is                  also preferred
of at least 3.0 mm, more preferably about 3.2 mm gauge.
 [0015]         While      a drum of    larger pitch     circle diameter    may be
selected,       the     actuating     lever will   need to be      longer  and  the
minimum arc will             have  to be    decreased   to achieve     the desired
benefit of inhibiting overstraining.

 [0016]         It    will be      appreciated     that care    must be     taken when
using      any    wire      strainer   with   barbed      wire,  especially        modern
barbed wire which has bigger and sharper barbs than older styles.
With that in view, it is preferred that the first gripping means
be separated from the block by a distance which puts the barbed
wire gripped thereby beyond the actuating handle or any other
actuating means where an operator's hands need to be placed from
time to time.           In    the preferred forms previously mentioned, it
is preferred that the gripping means be connected to the block
by a rigid connecting               member adapted       to hold it     away    from the
block by a predetermined distance selected by reference to the
actuating means and in the case of an actuating lever,                       the length
of the actuating lever and the possible position of the user's
hands when operating the actuating lever. It is also preferred
that the actuating lever include a handle portion and that the
actuating lever be suitably shaped to space the handle portion
laterally        from      the   drum,   that   is,    sideways   in    use    from   the
running direction              of the wire to be       strained.    It   also will be
seen that the wire strainer may be attached to the wire at the
appropriate orientation -               that is,     at a swivel angle about the
wire -      for convenience of operation.
 [0017]         In another embodiment of the invention, the actuating
means includes an electric motor instead of the actuating lever
operatively connected to the drum for causing it to rotate. In
such      form     of    the    invention    the    electric    motor     includes     an
adjustable clutch which can be used to preset the strain to be
applied       to    the     wire    to  be  strained.      Such   a    clutch     can  be
incorporated           in    the   actuating    lever     action   version       also  if
desired. Motor attachment means may be provided to effect this
embodiment          and       may    include     arrangements       for     connecting
electrically operated hand tools, such as an electric drill or
the like. The electrically operated hand tools may be cordless.

                                                           7
 [0018]             Preferably,             the     first       gripping         means        is  arranged          to
swivel        about a longitudinal axis                          extending in the direction of
the      wire       run       so    as     to    allow        the      wire      to       rotate     about         its
longitudinal axis as strain is applied.
 [0019]             It    is     also      preferred           that      the      first       gripping         means
includes          two jaw members adapted to tighten                                 onto the wire as the
strain        increases           in    much      the     same      way     as     mentioned        previously
in     relation          to    the     prior        art    strainers            but      further       including
biasing         means        for     biasing          the    jaw      members          towards     the       closed
position.            In     a   preferred            form      the      biasing           means    includes            a
torsion spring arranged to engage both jaws to bias them to the
closed position.
 [0020]             Preferably             the       wire       strainer            includes        a      tension
indicating             device       or    a   tension         gauge       by which           an  operator          can
gain       an    indication           of     the     tension        in    the wire being               strained.
In     one      form      of     the      invention,            the     tension           gauge    is      mounted
between         the drive           means       and      the    first      gripping           means.       In    such
form, the tension gauge includes a spring mounted in a housing
such that the spring is                        operatively connected at one end to the
drive        means       and     at    the     other       end      to    the     first       gripping         means
such        that       tension         on     the       spring        moves        a    visible        indicator
relative           to    the housing.             In     another        form,        a   similar      device        is
mounted in the line member in a suitable position which does not
interfere           with the line             member being mounted to a strainer                               post.
In yet another form, the tension gauge includes a clock spring
mounted in the handle with a similar visible indicator.
 [0021]             In another aspect, the invention resides broadly in a
wire strainer including:
          drive means comprising a mounting block with a drum mounted
for rotation              relative thereto and actuation means                                   connected to
the      drum       for      selectively             causing          the     rotary         drum     to     rotate
relative           to    the mounting             block,        and     a   line       member     operatively

connected to the drum in a manner whereby rotation of the drum
in  one direction causes the drum to pull the line member relative
to the mounting block,            and locking means for selectively locking
the drum against rotation in the opposite direction;

said drive means and adapted to be releasably attached to a wire
to be strained;
        said     line member      including     securing       means    for releasably
securing said line member to a strainer post or similar anchor;
       wherein said first gripping means includes two opposed jaw
members connected to each other for pivoting movement relative
to each      other between         an open position         in  which     a wire to be
strained can be placed therebetween and a closed                          (or gripping)
position       in   which    the wire     to be     strained     is   gripped between
said jaw members,           said jaw members being biased to the closed
position by spring means, said spring means having two elongate
portions with spaced apart free ends connected to said opposed
jaw    members        respectively,      said   first     gripping       means   further
including        a release      lever   extending      from one or        the other    of
said jaw members and at least a portion                      of said     release lever
extending generally in the direction of the wire being strained
whereby      a    user    may   grip   said   release      lever     and   one  of   said
elongate portions           in   one hand to squeeze           said one portion and
said release lever towards each other or together.
 [0022]         In yet another aspect, the invention resides broadly
in a wire gripping component for a wire strainer for releasably
gripping a wire to be strained, including:
        two     opposed      jaw    members    connected        to    each   other    for
pivoting        movement       relative    to   each      other     between     an  open
position        in     which    a   wire    to   be     strained       can   be   placed
therebetween          and a closed      (or gripping)        position     in  which the
wire to be strained is gripped between said jaw members;

         biasing means         for biasing        said jaw members          to the closed
position, said biasing means including two elongate portions of
resilient         material,      said    two   elongate       portions     having    spaced
apart        free     ends      connected       to      said    opposed      jaw    members
respectively          and    said    two   elongate        connecting     portions    being
connected to each             other by a biasing portion biasing the free
ends towards each other;
          a release lever extending from one or the other of said jaw
members and at least a portion of said release lever extending
generally in the direction of the wire being strained whereby a
user       may    grip     said   release     lever       and   one  of    said   elongate
portions in         one hand to squeeze said one portion and said release
lever together            so as to move said jaw members                from the closed
position to the open position against the bias of said biasing
means.
 [0023]          Preferably,       said spring means includes a substantially
U- or V-shaped spring wire or bar and said two elongate portions
are     two     legs    which    form    said     U-    or V-shape.      In   a  specially
preferred         form,     said   legs   diverge       away   from an apex       to  their
respective           free     ends    in    the      strained      position,      but    are
relatively parallel              when unstrained.           That  is  to say,     the   legs
extend from a coil formed by turning spring wire through angle
of up to about 540'.              In such form it is preferred that the legs
be substantially symmetrical about a longitudinal axis through
said apex which in              use extends        substantially      in    the direction
of     the    wire    being     strained.      It    is    also   preferred     that   said
release        lever    or at     least    a gripping portion          of    said   release
lever extend substantially in                the direction of said longitudinal
axis. When strained to the rest position in the gripper links,
the spring has a nominal                force     of about 3 to 4 kg at the free
ends. As a result, the end of the handle portion of the release
lever requires a force of about 1 kg to open the jaws, further
opening the spring.

 [0026]         The wire strainer 10 illustrated in Fig. 1 includes a
mounting      block       11   which  includes   two    outer     housing       plates        11a
and lb and a drum 12 mounted therebetween                      for rotation         relative

thereto. A driveshaft 12a extends from one end of the drum and
an     actuating            lever        or     drive        handle          13    is     mounted        on     the
driveshaft           12a     and      arranged         to      rotate        the    shaft      and    the     drum
connected          thereto          via     a    ratchet          mechanism          14    and     a   variable
clutch 15.
 [0027]           A chain 16 is connected to the drum in a manner which
allows       rotation           of    the     drum       to     effectively           pull     the     mounting
block in the direction of arrow 20                                   along the chain towards                    the
post      to    which        the      chain        is     secured.          Suitably,         the     drum      has
recesses therein to accept individual chain links and hold them
on the drum whereby the chain passes over the drum but does not
roll onto the drum.
 [0028]           A    tension         indicating            device         or   tension       indicator         17
is    connected          to     the mounting             block        and     a  wire gripping            device
or wire gripper 18 in                    turn is      connected to the tension indicating
device       and      the     wire       gripper         in     turn      grips      the    wire      19    to   be
tensioned.           In    this      case,       the      length        of    the    actuating         lever     is
300 mm and           pitch        circle        diameter           of    the     drum where          the    chain
engages is          30 mm and the ratchet                     sprocket provides for a minimum
arc of the handle 13 through 10 degrees.
 [0029]           The       wire       gripper         18       operates         effectively           under        a
parallelogram action which is                              achieved by two pairs                    of opposed
links      21 and 23 and 22 and 24 with adjacent links                                     being pivotally
connected to each other. That is                                 to    say, operator links                 21   and
22    are pivotally connected to each other at one end by a pivot
pin 26 and to a connector link                           25 which connects the wire gripper
to the tension indicator                       17.    Similarly,            the gripper links              23 and
24    which      grip      the wire          to be        strained          are pivotally            connected
to    each      other       at     one     end by          a   pivot        pin    27     and   in    turn      the
gripper        link,        or    lobe      link       24     is     pivotally          connected         to    the
operator link            21 at its          other end by a pivot pin 28 and similarly
the gripper            link 23          is   connected to               the     operator       link 22 by           a
pivot pin 29.

 [0030]         The gripper            link 24     includes     a lobe    31 adjacent      the
pivot pin 27 which                is   adapted     to engage      the wire and force        it
against the face 32 of a shoulder 33 as the tension in the wire
increases       by     virtue        of   the    parallelogram       action    of   the   four
links.     Suitably,           the     lobe    and   the    shoulder     are   so   made   and
arranged that the lobe barely engages the shoulder when no wire
is placed between the two components.
 [0031]         The wire gripper component 118 illustrated in Fig. 5
is similar to the wire gripper component 18 shown in Fig. 1 in
many respects           and accordingly            the same      reference     numbers    will
be used for corresponding components except prefaced by a "1".
Notably, the opposite ends of the operator link 121 are offset,
that    is   not      aligned        as    they    are  in    relation     to   the   gripper
previously described by virtue of a bend 141 therein.                             Similarly,
the opposite ends of the operator link 122 are offset but they
are offset        in    the opposite           direction     with the result that          the
lobe link 124           is    laterally        spaced from operator          link   122 by a
significantly greater distance thereby allowing the lobe 131 and
the shoulder 133 to be offset out of the line of the connector
link 125 with the advantage that the wire 19 is offset further
from the block 11, the handle 13 and the tension indicator 17.
This is particularly important when the wire strainer is being
used with barbed wire.
 [0032]         The wire gripper component 218 illustrated in Fig.                             6
also is similar to the wire gripper component 18 shown in Fig.
1 in    many respects             and accordingly          the same reference         numbers
will be used for corresponding components except prefaced by a
"2".    In   this      case,       lobe     link   224   is    spaced    further    from   the
connector link 225 by virtue of a spacer sleeve 251 and similarly
the other gripper link 233 is spaced from the operator link 222
in    the     same        direction          by   use    of     a   spacer     sleeve     252.
Advantageously,            it    will be       seen that the       shoulder 233 and the
lobe    231    are     significantly            further     out of    alignment     from the

connector link 225 making it more suitable for barbed wire with
big barbs because the big barbs are                                less likely to engage with
the connector link               225 or become entangled with the hanging part
of the chain.
 [0033]          The wire gripper component                          318     illustrated in Fig.            7
is     similar        to     the     gripper         illustrated                in   Fig.      6   and   the
differences          are      small     and    will       well      illustrated           so   no   further
description         is   necessary,         the main difference being the location
of one of the            operator links              333 being mounted to                    the opposite
sides       of    the       connector          link         and       gripper         link      from    that
illustrated in Fig.                 6.
 [0034]          The wire gripper component                          418     illustrated in Fig.            8
is     similar        to      the    wire      grippers            previously            described       and
accordingly            the      same      reference             numbers          will      be    used    for
corresponding            components          except           prefaced           by    a   "4"     wherever
possible. This component includes the two gripper links 423 and
424 but instead of having operator links of the type previously
described         which        operate      with         the      others         in   a   parallelogram
action,       it   has      a   single     biasing           link        461    constructed         of  6 mm
spring steel with two                  link arms 462               and 463 which diverge                from
an apex 425 towards the gripper links and are connected thereto
via two pivot pins 466 and 467.                          Advantageously,              the arms 462 and
463 are biased inwards                   towards each other with the effect that
the gripper link or lobe link 424                             is biased towards the engaged
position with gripper link 423. Thus, the gripper can be fitted
to    the    wire      and     the     biasing         link      461      holds      the     wire    in  the
gripper       while      the      operator        ties       the      chain       16   to    the   post   or
adjust the clutch or makes other manoeuvres.
 [0035]          The    still       yet    gripping           arrangement            of   the prior      art
wire      gripping       device       480   illustrated               in    Fig.     10 has      a  gripper
link      481    of    older       form    adapted           to     engage        with     a   toothed    or
serrated       wheel 482.         The toothed or serrated                       wheel has been found
to be       detrimental          to the     wire,         causing          indentations          which   can

increase      the likelihood of corrosion               of eh wire once the wire
strainer has been released. By contrast the gripping arrangement
of eh wire         strainer      according    to the present          invention        has   a
relatively smooth face.
 [0036]         The     improved wire gripper         component       518    illustrated
in Figs. 11 to 14 is similar to the wire gripper 418 previously
described       and     accordingly      the  same   reference       numbers        will   be
used     for    corresponding         components    except      prefaced         by    a  "5"
instead of a "4" wherever possible. This component includes the
two gripper links 523 and 524 which are substantially the same
as links 423 and 424 with a single biasing link 561 constructed
of spring steel           with link arms       562  and 563 which diverge                from
the apex 525 towards the gripper links and are connected thereto
via   pivot pins 566            and 567.    The  link    arms are biased             inwards
towards each other in the same manner as described in relation
to   component          418.    The   main   difference       between      the       gripper
component 518 and the gripper component 418 is that the gripper
component       518     includes     a release   lever 520 which          is     welded    to
the gripper link 524 and provides easy operation of the gripper
links to open and close the gripping jaws. As can be seen more
clearly      in    Fig.     13,   the   release    lever     520   is    more       or   less
parallel to the gripping portion 520a of the release lever and
the gripping portion is              connected to the gripper link 524 by two
connecting portions 520b and 520c which extend end-to-end at an
obtuse angle and are arranged to place the gripping portion away
from the line of the wire to be strained and to allow room for
the operator's hand without interfering with the wire.
 [0037]         Advantageously,         an   operator      is   able      to      grip    the
release     lever       520  and    link arm 562     in   one hand and move them
towards each other. Suitably, such movement causes gripper links
523 and 524 to pivot about their respective pivot pins to move
to the open or loading position so that the wire to be strained
can be fitted between the jaws. Advantageously, the arrangement

                                               16
allows     operation          of the gripper      component           from open        to closed
and vice versa while holding it in any desired position by one
hand     thereby       allowing     the    other    hand      to hold         the wire        to be
strained in position for easy fitting between the gripper jaws.
Advantageously, the gripping portion of the jaw members 523 and
524   is   offset       from the centreline           501     of the biasing link 561
which provides for reduction in overall size while maintaining
sufficient         gripping       force     which     in     turn       allows       for    easier
gripping of the release lever and link arm 562.                              It   also provides
for   reduced motion            of   the   release      lever between             the    open    and
closed jaw positions as well as an increased wire contact angle
by the jaws thereby reducing the possibility of indentation and
pinching of the wire being strained.                     In this embodiment the wire
gripper component can be held comfortably in either hand of an
operator and the position of the release lever relative to the
jaw members allows for good wire visibility and easy operation
of the jaw members by the release lever.
 [0038]         The wire        strainer     610  illustrated            in     Figs.    16   to 29
is   similar       to     the   wire   gripper      10    illustrated            in   Fig.     1  as
modified by the wire gripper                  component         illustrated          in   Figs.    8
to 15 and accordingly               the same reference              numbers will          be used
for   corresponding            components     except      prefaced          by a     "6"    or   "7"
wherever possible,             including instances where such components are
prefaced      by     a    "4"   or   "5",   the    "6"     or     "7"    being      substituted
therefor.       The wire        strainer     610 includes           a mounting block             611
which includes two outer housing plates 611a and 611b and a drum
 612   mounted         therebetween        for   rotation           relative        thereto.       A
driveshaft        612a extends         from one end of the drum and                       a drive
handle or actuating lever 613 is mounted on the driveshaft 612a
and arranged to rotate the shaft and the drum connected thereto
via    a   ratchet        mechanism      614   and    a    variable         clutch       615.    The
variable clutch is arranged to slip at a predetermined selected

point      when the          tension       in     the wire being               strained           reaches        the
desired tension.
 [0039]            A chain 16 is connected to the drum in a manner which
allows       rotation         of     the    drum      to     effectively             pull       the   mounting
block 611 along the chain towards a post,                                      (not shown),           to which
the     chain       is    secured.        Suitably,          the     drum has           recesses         therein
to    accept         individual          chain       links        and      hold       them      on   the       drum
whereby        the       chain passes         over      the      drum but          does      not    roll       onto
the drum.
 [0040]            The     gripper        component           618     includes           the     two     gripper
links      623 and 624 which are substantially                              the same as the gripper
links 523 and 524 with a single biasing link 720                                            constructed of
spring       steel        with     link     arms      662     and      663    which        diverge         from a
coiled       loop        723    towards       the      gripper          links        and     are    connected
thereto        in      a   manner       described         hereinafter.               The     link     arms       are
biased inwards towards each other in                              the same manner as described
in relation to component 518.
 [0041]            Figs. 17 to 20 show in greater detail the wire gripper
component 618 from four different                             angles.        The reference numerals
for     the parts          of   the wire          gripper        are     not     all      included         in    all
drawings         because         they     may      be   occluded           in    one      or     more     of     the
different             views        or     because            such        inclusion             would          cause
unnecessary cluttering in the drawings. It can be seen that the
opposed        links        621    and    622     are     in    effect        two      arms      721     and     722
respectively              of  a    single      biasing         link       720    that      is     constructed
from spring steel and whereby the two arms are connected to one
another by an intermediate coiled portion 723 comprising one and
a   half     turns        of   spring      steel.        The     release         lever        736 is       welded
to    the     gripper         link       624    and     provides           easy        operation          of     the
gripper        links       to   open      and     close      the     gripping          jaws.       An    adaptor
piece      616     allows easy disconnection of the tensioning unit for
replacement by a hook so that the drum and chain can be used as
a hoisting unit.

 [0042]         A tension indicating device or tension indicator 617
is   connected          to  the   mounting    block,     not  shown,    and   the wire
gripping component             618 is    connected     to the tension       indicating
device     via      a    connector     link    625.    The   tension    indicator     is
provided with a colour coded plunger to provide readily a visual
indication of tension applied to the wire. The biasing link 720
is connected to the connector link 625 via a flap 626 which when
closed secures the parts together with a strong connection. The
flap is provided by provision of a groove with a V-section in a
flat    portion,         the   flap   extending      straight,     but  being    folded
about the base of the groove to an approximate right angle.
 [0043]         The two arms 721          and 722 diverge outwardly away from
the   intermediate           coiled portion       723   and each    arm 721    and   722
includes an opposing free end portion 724 and 725 respectively
that extends           inwardly    from said respective          arm in   a direction
that is      substantially parallel             to the axis of rotation          726 of
the coiled intermediate               portion     723.   The  free end portion       724
functions as the pivot pin 628, while the free end portion 725
functions         as     the    pivot    pin    629,    as   foreshadowed       in   the
description of Fig. 16. The free end portions are secured in the
gripper      links        by   a  standard      or   grooveless      circlip,    or   by
mushrooming of the end.             Further,     the intermediate coiled portion
serves to displace the two arm members 721 and 722 laterally as
generally indicated by arrows 727.
 [0044]         Figs.      21  to 24    show   in   detail   the   gripper    link   624
which     includes         a  body   portion      730   and   an   arm   731   that   is
connected to said body portion, said arm 731 having a free end
portion     732      in    which there     is  formed     an aperture     733  that   is
adapted     to receive therein            the free     end portion 724.       The body
portion 730 includes an arcuate gripping face 734 and an aperture
735 for receiving a pivot pin or the like for pivotal connection
to    the other gripper link 623.

 [0045]         The release lever 736 has a first                        end portion 737 that
is   fixed     at     738    to     one      side  of      the    body portion          730   of   the
gripper      link      724    and      is    arranged       such    that    the     release      lever
diverges      laterally          away      from said body portion                 in   the general
direction       of     arrow      739      as   seen    more      clearly      in    Fig.    22.   The
release lever 736 includes a first bend 740 connecting a first
portion      741     to    a    second        portion       742,    and    a   second      bend    743
connecting        the second portion               742      to a third portion,              or free
end portion, 744.
 [0046]         Figs.      25    to 29        show   in     detail     the    gripper      link    623
which includes a first part or gripping member 750, and a second
part or arm member 751. The gripping member 750 includes a body
portion 752 and a lug 753 in which there is formed an aperture
754.    The body portion 752                   also includes an end portion 755 in
which there is formed a channel 756 having a substantially flat
face 757 that is          flanked on either side by opposing wall portions
758 that each include a first raised portion 759, located at one
end thereof, and a second, somewhat smaller raised portion 760
located     at     the    opposite          end thereof.           The body portion           752   is
fixed to one end 761 of the arm member 751, while the opposing
end 762      of the arm member                 751   includes        an additional          aperture
763   formed therein.               The     arm member 751           also    includes      a second
aperture      765,      shown        in    dotted    outline        in   Fig.     26 penetrating
therethrough.          The     flat       face   757    is   at an angle          631 of between
720   and    730,     preferably           72.30   to      the   axis    633.     The    face    outer
of the body portion is at an angle 632 of 173.50 to the axis and
outer    face     of the        arm member.          Thus,      it    will be       seen   that the
distance between the second aperture 765 and the flat face 757
along the axis 633 is               slightly greater that the shortest distance
between the second aperture 765 and the flat face.
 [0047]         The additional aperture 763 is                      provided for connecting
the wire strainer to other equipment, such as a pre-fabricated
fence    wire clamp          for clamping pre-fabricated                      fencing,       such as

chain     wire or        the   like,        to hold          the pre-fabricated               fence        wire
in place while tensioning the supporting wires.
 [0048]         The      gripper       link       624      is    pivotally         connected           to   the
gripper      link       623    by     the      pivot        pin     627     that     extends         through
aligned apertures 735 and 765.                         The gripper link              624 is      pivotally
connected        to    arm     721     by     the       location         of    end    portion          628   in
aperture 733.          The gripper           link      623 is      pivotally        connected to arm
722 by the location of end portion 725 in the aperture                                              629.
 [0049]         In    use,     the      free      end      30   of     the    chain     16    is    wrapped
around     a    strainer         post       or     similar          anchor,        (not     shown),         and
secured      thereto.         For      example,            there      may      be   provided          a    hook
connected to the             end 30        of the         chain and whereby               the hook may
be used to engage a portion of the chain spaced from the end 30
so as to form a loop around the post that in turn will "choke"
the strainer post. The slack in the wire may be taken up quickly
by pulling the chain through the block. Once the strain is taken
by the block, the clutch engages which allows the ratchet to be
operated.
 [0050]         The wire gripper                618 is         then secured to the wire                     619
that is to be strained or tensioned. In this regard it is to be
noted that the gripper links                         624 and 623            are, as a consequence
of    the action         of the biasing               link      720,     biased      to   a   closed,        or
gripping       position,         as     generally             shown      in    Figs.     17    to     20.    In
order to open the gripper links                           624 and 623 so as to permit the
placement of          the wire         619     therebetween, an operator may choose
to    hold   the      gripper        618     in     one      of   their       hands     such      that      the
palm,    adjacent the base of the thumb,                          bears against a mid portion
of    arm  721     while      the      fingers         press       against        the    second        and/or
third     portions         742    and     744      respectively             of    the    release         lever
736.    By   squeezing         together           the      arm     721     and    the    release         lever
736,    the arms         721 and 722 will pivot about the axis                                726 of the
intermediate           coiled       portion          723,       while       the    arm    721       and     the

gripper        member will           pivot    about        pin    628,     and gripper           link      624
will pivot relative to gripper link 623 about pivot pin 627.
 [0051]          The wire is then positioned in the channel 756 and is
retained        therein         by    the    opposing          wall      portions         758,      and     in
particular        by the opposing guides 759.                      The arcuate gripping face
734      of   the    other       gripper      link       is    formed       as   a    compound         curve
through        about      1800      and  may     include         a  flat      portion,         though       it
will be appreciated that only a relatively small portion of the
curved       face    engages         with   the wire          in   clamping        the wire          to    the
flat       face    757      of     the   other       gripper         link.      By     releasing           the
pressure        on    the     release      lever       736,      the     action      of     the    biasing
link 720        will cause the gripper links                        623 and 624           to return to
their       closed position,            such      that      the    wire      619   is    held between
the arcuate face 734 and the flat face 757, substantially midway
between opposing ends of the channel 756.                                 In this regard, it is
believed that           this      configuration of gripper links                       will     not pinch
the wire. The faces may be surface treated, but preferably, the
gripper        links       623      and   624      are      formed        from     hardened          steel,
bisalloy        80    or equivalent.            The     gripper       links      also       do   not     have
the     same    length,        the gripper          link      with     the     arcuate        face    being
shorter than the gripper link with the flat                                    face. The         flat and
arcuate faces are preferably smooth to avoid adversely affecting
the surface of the wire to be strained and thereby ameliorating
the possibility of corrosion, and provide an                                    8 mm gap when              the
jaws      are   open      to    allow    easy      engagement           of    the   wire       of   one     of
several between the faces, such wire being typically from 1.6 mm
to    4.5 mm gauge. The               flat    face may be arranged as                       a cavity of
rectangular section between the                           sides of the          channel whereby a
wire       gripped      between       the    channel         and    the     arcuate         face    may     be
bent slightly.
 [0052]          Further, it is believed that the configuration of the
handle        and    the     inclusion        of     the     coiled        intermediate            portion
connecting the             arms 721       and 722 will provide a gap of                          15 mm to

20 mm to prevent the operator jamming their fingers against the
arm 722,     particularly       when releasing       the pressure applied to the
release     lever       736. The  operator       may then   use  the drive     handle
 613    to rotate        the drum  so    as    to  shorten   the  length    of  chain
extending from the drum to the strainer post, while checking the
tension applied to the strained                wire as indicated by the tension
indicator       617.

illustrative example of the invention and any modifications and
variations       which will     be apparent to a person skilled          in   the art

THE CLAIMS DEFINING THE INVENTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1.            A wire strainer including:
              drive means comprising a mounting block with a drum mounted
for rotation                   relative thereto and actuation means                                 connected to
the         drum       for        selectively            causing          the      rotary      drum      to    rotate
relative              to     the      mounting        block,        and      a   line     member      operatively
connected to the drum in a manner whereby rotation of the drum
in     one direction                 causes the drum to pull                     the line       member relative
to the mounting block,                          and locking means for selectively                             locking
the drum against rotation in the opposite direction;
              first gripping means operatively connected to the block of
said drive means and adapted to be releasably                                               attached to a wire
