30 Background of the Invention
                                               1

   The use of payment cards, such as credit cards, debit cards, and pre-paid cards, has
   become ubiquitous. Most payment card accounts have one or more associated physical
   cards; however, the use of non-traditional payment devices, such as appropriately
 5 configured "smart" cellular telephones, is increasing.
   The process of electronic bill presentment and payment has also been popular for quite
   some time.      For example, United States Patent No. 5,699,528 to Hogan (expressly
   incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes) discloses a system and
10 method for bill delivery and payment over a communications network.              In the bill
   delivery and payment system, users are able to access a server computer on a
   communications network to obtain bill information and pay bills.
   US Patent Publication 2014-0067620 of Blinov (expressly incorporated herein by
15 reference in its entirety for all purposes) discloses techniques for purchasing by crediting
   a merchant's card, in connection with an on-line purchase of goods.
   It is generally desirable to overcome or ameliorate one or more of the above described
   difficulties, or to at least provide a useful alternative.

   Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments
   Payment Devices and Associated Payment Processing Networks
   With regard to payment card and similar payments, attention should now be given to FIG.
10 1, which depicts an exemplary embodiment of a system 100, according to an aspect of the
   invention, and including various possible components of the system. System 100 can
   include one or more different types of portable payment devices. For example, one such
   device can be a contact device such as card 102.       Card 102 can include an integrated
   circuit (IC) chip 104 having a processor portion 106 and a memory portion 108.             A
15 plurality of electrical contacts 110 can be provided for communication purposes.          In
   addition to or instead of card 102, system 100 can also be designed to work with a
   contactless device such as card 112.     Card 112 can include an IC chip 114 having a
   processor portion 116 and a memory portion 118. An antenna 120 can be provided for
   contactless   communication,    such as,    for example, using radio frequency (RF)
20 electromagnetic waves.       An oscillator or oscillators, and/or additional appropriate
   circuitry for one or more of modulation, demodulation, downconversion, and the like can
   be provided. Note that cards 102, 112 are exemplary of a variety of devices that can be
   employed. The system 100 typically functions with other types of devices in lieu of or in
   addition to "smart" or "chip" cards 102, 112; for example, a conventional card 150
25 having a magnetic stripe 152.     Furthermore, an appropriately configured mobile device
   (e.g., "smart" cellular telephone handset, tablet, personal digital assistant (PDA), and the
   like) can be used to carry out contactless payments in some instances. One non-limiting
   example of a new approach is the Apple Pay app, a mobile payment and digital wallet
   service from Apple Inc., Cupertino, California, US.
                                                10

   The ICs 104, 114 can contain processing units 106, 116 and memory units 108, 118.
   Preferably, the ICs 104, 114 can also include one or more of control logic, a timer, and
   input/output ports. Such elements are well known in the IC art and are not separately
 5 illustrated. One or both of the ICs 104, 114 can also include a co-processor, again, well
   known and not separately illustrated. The control logic can provide, in conjunction with
   processing units 106, 116, the control necessary to handle communications between
   memory unit 108, 118 and the input/output ports. The timer can provide a timing
   reference signal from processing units 106, 116 and the control logic. The co-processor
10 could provide the ability to perform complex computations in real time, such as those
   required by cryptographic algorithms.
   The memory portions or units 108, 118 may include different types of memory, such as
   volatile and non-volatile memory and read-only and programmable memory. The
15 memory units can store transaction card data such as, e.g., a user's primary account
   number ("PAN") and/or personal identification number ("PIN"). The memory portions of
   units 108, 118 can store the operating system of the cards 102, 112. The operating system
   loads and executes applications and provides file management or other basic card
   services to the applications. One operating system that can be used to implement some
20 aspects or embodiments of the present invention is the MULTOS* operating system
   licensed by MAOSCO Limited. (MAOSCO Limited, St. Andrews House, The Links,
   Kelvin Close, Birchwood, Warrington, WA3 7PB, United Kingdom)               Alternatively,
   JAVA CARD TM-based operating systems, based on JAVA CARDTM technology
   (licensed by Sun Microsystems, Inc., 4150 Network Circle, Santa Clara, CA 95054
25 USA), or proprietary operating systems available from a number of vendors, could be
   employed.     Preferably, the operating system is stored in read-only memory ("ROM")
   within memory portion 108, 118.       In an alternate embodiment, flash memory or other
   non-volatile and/or volatile types of memory may also be used in the memory units 108,
    118.
                                                11

   In addition to the basic services provided by the operating system, memory portions 108,
    118 may also include one or more applications. At present, one possible specification to
   which such applications may conform is the EMV interoperable payments specification
 5 set forth by EMVCo, LLC (901 Metro Center Boulevard, Mailstop M3-3D, Foster City,
   California, 94404, USA). It will be appreciated that applications can be configured in a
   variety of different ways.
   The skilled artisan will also be familiar with the MasterCard@ PayPass TM specifications,
10 available under license from MasterCard International Incorporated of Purchase, NY,
   USA (marks of MasterCard International Incorporated of Purchase, NY, USA).
   As noted, cards 102, 112 are examples of a variety of payment devices that can be
   employed.     The primary function of the payment devices may not be payment, for
15 example, they may be cellular phone handsets that implement appropriate techniques.
   Such devices could include cards having a conventional form factor, smaller or larger
   cards, cards of different shape, key fobs, personal digital assistants (PDAs), appropriately
   configured cell phone handsets, or indeed any device with the appropriate capabilities. In
   some cases, the cards, or other payment devices, can include body portions (e.g.,
20 laminated plastic layers of a payment card, case or cabinet of a PDA, chip packaging, and
   the like), memories 108, 118 associated with the body portions, and processors 106, 116
   associated with the body portions and coupled to the memories. The memories 108, 118
   can contain appropriate applications.      The processors 106, 116 can be operative to
   execute one or more steps. The applications can be, for example, application identifiers
25 (AIDs) linked to software code in the form of firmware plus data in a card memory such
   as an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM).
   A number of different types of terminals can be employed with system 100.              Such
   terminals can include a contact terminal 122 configured to interface with contact-type
                                                12

   device 102, a wireless terminal 124 configured to interface with wireless device 112, a
   magnetic stripe terminal 125 configured to interface with a magnetic stripe device 150, or
   a combined terminal 126.        Combined terminal 126 is designed to interface with any
   combination of devices 102, 112, 150. Some terminals can be contact terminals with
 5 plug-in contactless readers.      Combined terminal 126 can include a memory 128, a
   processor portion 130, a reader module 132, and optionally an item interface module such
   as a bar code scanner 134 and/or a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag reader 136.
   Items 128, 132, 134, 136 can be coupled to the processor 130. Note that the principles of
   construction of terminal 126 are applicable to other types of terminals and are described
10 in detail for illustrative purposes. Reader module 132 can, in general, be configured for
   contact communication with card or device 102, contactless communication with card or
   device 112, reading of magnetic stripe 152, or a combination of any two or more of the
   foregoing (different types of readers can be provided to interact with different types of
   cards e.g., contacted, magnetic stripe, or contactless). Terminals 122, 124, 125, 126 can
15 be connected to one or more processing centers 140, 142, 144 via a computer network
   138.    Network 138 could include, for example, the Internet, or a proprietary network
   (e.g., a virtual private network (VPN) such as is described with respect to FIG. 2 below).
   More than one network could be employed to connect different elements of the system.
   For example, a local area network (LAN) could connect a terminal to a local server or
20 other computer at a retail establishment or the like. A payment network could connect
   acquirers and issuers. Further details regarding one specific form of payment network
   will be provided below. Processing centers 140, 142, 144 can include, for example, a
   host computer of an issuer of a payment device.
25 Many different retail or other establishments, represented by points-of-sale 146, 148, can
   be connected to network 138. Different types of portable payment devices, terminals, or
   other elements or components can combine or "mix and match" one or more features
   depicted on the exemplary devices in FIG. 1.
                                                13

   Portable payment devices can facilitate transactions by a user with a terminal, such as
    122, 124, 125, 126, of a system such as system 100.          Such a device can include a
   processor, for example, the processing units 106, 116 discussed above. The device can
   also include a memory, such as memory portions 108, 118 discussed above, that is
 5 coupled to the processor. Further, the device can include a communications module that
   is coupled to the processor and configured to interface with a terminal such as one of the
   terminals 122, 124, 125, 126. The communications module can include, for example, the
   contacts   110 or antennas 120 together with appropriate circuitry (such as the
   aforementioned oscillator or oscillators and related circuitry) that permits interfacing with
10 the terminals via contact or wireless communication. The processor of the apparatus can
   be operable to perform one or more steps of methods and techniques. The processor can
   perform such operations via hardware techniques, and/or under the influence of program
   instructions, such as an application, stored in one of the memory units.
15 The portable device can include a body portion. For example, this could be a laminated
   plastic body (as discussed above) in the case of "smart" or "chip" cards 102, 112, or the
   handset chassis and body in the case of a cellular telephone.
   It will be appreciated that the terminals 122, 124, 125, 126 are examples of terminal
20 apparatuses for interacting with a payment device of a holder. The apparatus can include
   a processor such as processor 130, a memory such as memory 128 that is coupled to the
   processor, and a communications module such as 132 that is coupled to the processor and
   configured to interface with the portable apparatuses 102, 112, 150. The processor 130
   can be operable to communicate with portable payment devices of a user via the
25 communications module 132.         The terminal apparatuses can function via hardware
   techniques in processor 130, or by program instructions stored in memory 128.            Such
   logic could optionally be provided from a central location such as processing center 140
   over network 138. The aforementioned bar code scanner 134 and/or RFID tag reader 136
   can optionally be provided, and can be coupled to the processor, to gather attribute data,
                                                 14

   such as a product identification, from a UPC code or RFID tag on a product to be
   purchased.
   The above-described devices 102, 112 can be ISO 7816-compliant contact cards or
 5 devices or NFC (Near Field Communications) or ISO 14443-compliant proximity cards
   or devices. In operation, card 112 can be touched or tapped on the terminal 124 or 128
   (or an associated reader), which then contactlessly transmits the electronic data to the
   proximity IC chip in the card 112 or other wireless device.
10 One or more of the processing centers 140, 142, 144 can include a database such as a data
   warehouse 154.
   It should be noted that the system depicted in FIG. 1 may involve not only conventional
   transactions at "brick and mortar" merchants, but also, card-not-present transactions, such
15 as card-not-present Internet transactions or card-not-present recurring payments. In some
   instances, an Internet Protocol (IP) address may be captured during card-not-present
   Internet transactions. In exemplary card-not-present Internet transactions, an individual
   utilizes his or her home computer to communicate with a server of an e-commerce
   merchant over the Internet. The individual provides his or her PAN to the merchant's
20 server.  The merchant utilizes the PAN to initiate an authorization request, and upon
   receiving an authorization request response indicating approval, will complete the e
   commerce transaction. In exemplary card-not-present recurring payments, an individual
   provides his or her PAN and related data to a merchant (e.g., via phone or postal mail).
   The merchant utilizes the PAN to initiate an authorization request, and upon receiving an
25 authorization   request response indicating      approval, will   complete the recurring
   transaction.
   In some cases, there can be payment card accounts which do not have physical cards or
   other physical payment devices associated therewith; for example, a customer can be
                                                15

   provided with a PAN, expiration date, and security code but no physical payment device,
   and use same, for example, for card-not-present telephone or internet transactions. In this
   regard, a "cardholder" should be understood to refer to the account holder of a payment
   card account, regardless of whether the holder actually has a physical payment card or
 5 other physical payment device.
   With reference to FIG. 2, an exemplary relationship among multiple entities is depicted.
   A number of different users (e.g., consumers) 2002, U 1, U 2 ... UN, interact with a number
   of different merchants 2004, P 1, P2 ... PM. Merchants 2004 interact with a number of
10 different acquirers 2006, A1, A 2 ... A1. Acquirers 2006 interact with a number of different
   issuers 2010, I1,  12... Ij, through, for example, a single operator 2008 of a payment
   network configured to facilitate transactions between multiple issuers and multiple
   acquirers;   for example,     MasterCard    International  Incorporated,   operator   of the
   BANKNET@ network, or Visa International Service Association, operator of the
15 VISANET@ network. In general, N, M, I, and J are integers that can be equal or not
   equal. Note also that elements 2006, 2010 represent the entities that actually carry out
   processing for the acquirers and issuers respectively; in some instances, these entities
   carry out their own processing; in other entities, they utilize acquirer processors and
   issuer processors, respectively.
20
   During a conventional credit authorization process, the cardholder 2002 pays for the
   purchase and the merchant 2004 submits the transaction to the acquirer (acquiring bank)
   2006. The acquirer verifies the card number, the transaction type and the amount with
   the issuer 2010 and reserves that amount of the cardholder's credit limit for the merchant.
25 At this point, the authorization request and response have been exchanged, typically in
   real time. Authorized transactions are stored in "batches," which are sent to the acquirer
   2006. During subsequent clearing and settlement, the acquirer sends the batch
   transactions through the credit card association, which debits the issuers 2010 for
                                                 16

   payment and credits the acquirer 2006. Once the acquirer 2006 has been paid, the
   acquirer 2006 pays the merchant 2004.
   It will be appreciated that the network 2008 shown in FIG. 2 is an example of a payment
 5 network configured to facilitate transactions between multiple issuers and multiple
   acquirers, which may be thought of as an "open" system. Some embodiments of the
   invention may be employed in relation to payment card accounts using other kinds of
   payment networks, for example, proprietary or closed payments networks with only a
   single issuer and acquirer. Furthermore in this regard, FIG. 2 depicts a four party model,
10 as will be known to the skilled artisan; the four parties are the consumer 2002, merchant
   2004, acquirer 2006, and issuer 2010. However, at least some embodiments are also of
   use with three-party models, wherein the acquirer and issuer are the same entity.
   Messages within a network such as network 138 and/or network 2008, may, in at least
15 some instances, conform to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
   Standard 8583, Financialtransactioncard originatedmessages - Interchange message
   specifications, which is the ISO standard for systems that exchange electronic
   transactions made by cardholders using payment cards. It should be noted that the skilled
   artisan will be familiar with the ISO 8583 standards. Nevertheless, out of an abundance
20 of caution, the following documents are expressly incorporated herein by reference in
   their entirety for all purposes (published by ISO, Geneva, Switzerland, and available on
   the ISO web site):
       .    ISO 8583 Part 1: Messages, data elements and code values (2003)
       .    ISO 8583 Part 2: Application and registration procedures for Institution
25          Identification Codes (IIC) (1998)

       .   ISO 8583:1987 (1987)
   As used herein, a "payment card network" is a communications network that uses
   payment card account numbers, such as primary account numbers (PANs), to authorize,
   and to facilitate clearing and settlement of, payment card transactions for credit, debit,
 5 stored value and/or prepaid card accounts. The card accounts have standardized payment
   card account numbers associated with them, which allow for efficient routing and
   clearing of transactions; for example, ISO standard account numbers such as ISO/IEC
   7812-compliant account numbers.         The card accounts and/or account numbers may or
   may not have physical cards or other physical payment devices associated with them.
10 For example, in some instances, organizations have purchasing or procurement card
   accounts to which a payment card account number is assigned, used for making
   purchases for the organization, but there is no corresponding physical card.      In other
   instances, "virtual" account numbers are employed; this is also known as PAN mapping.
   The PAN mapping process involves taking the original Primary Account Number
15 (PAN)(which may or may not be associated with a physical card) and issuing a pseudo
   PAN (or virtual card number) in its place.         Commercially available PAN-mapping
   solutions include those available from Orbiscom Ltd., Block 1, Blackrock Business Park,
   Carysfort Avenue, Blackrock, Co. Dublin, Ireland (now part of MasterCard International
   Incorporated of Purchase, New York, USA); by way of example and not limitation,
20 techniques of US Patents 6,636,833 (expressly incorporated herein by reference in its
   entirety for all purposes) and 7,136,835 (expressly incorporated herein by reference in its
   entirety for all purposes) of Flitcroft et al.
   Some payment card networks connect multiple issuers with multiple acquirers; others use
25 a three party model.     Some payment card networks use ISO 8583 messaging.          Non
   limiting examples of payment card networks that connect multiple issuers with multiple
   acquirers are the BANKNET@ network and the VISANET@ network. One or more
   embodiments are applicable to many other different kinds of payment card networks as
                                                  18

   well; the AMERICAN EXPRESS             network and the DISCOVER        network are non
   limiting examples.
   While payment card networks have generally been used as described with regard to
 5 FIGS. 1 and 2, recently, MasterCard MONEYSEND (mark of MasterCard International
   Incorporated, Purchase, New York, US) money transfer services have provided a new
   dimension.     A funding transaction moves money from the sender (customer) to the
   Originating Institution (the financial institution providing the money transfer service);
   that transaction can be initiated through a MONEYSEND application program interface
10 (API). The sender can fund the transaction using a MasterCard card account or other
   branded card account that the Originating Institution accepts; from a bank account; or
   with cash. A Payment Transaction transfers funds from the Originating Institution, via
   the MasterCard Network (e.g., BANKNET), to the payment card account identified by
   the recipient at the Receiving Institution. Funds can be transferred to a MasterCard®
15 card, Debit MasterCard® card, and the like (marks of MasterCard International
   Incorporated, Purchase, New York, US). Such transactions are discussed further below
   and are an example of what are more generally referred to herein as special payment
   transactions.
20 Still referring to FIG. 2, and with reference also now to FIGS. 11 and 12, by way of
   review and provision of additional detail, a consumer 2002 effectively presents his or her
   card 150 or other payment device (e.g., presents suitably configured "smart" phone or
   uses an e-wallet) to the terminal 126 of a merchant. A mag stripe card 150 and combined
   terminal 126 are shown by way of example, but are intended to generally represent any
25 kind of payment device and any kind of terminal. The effective presentation can happen
   directly (user enters a brick and mortar location of a merchant 2004) or virtually (user
   logs on to a web site of a merchant 2004 via a browser of a personal computer or the like,
   or calls on the telephone, and provides card information, or sends a "snail" mail with
   payment card account information to a merchant). The merchant terminal 126 captures
                                                19

   the card account information (by swiping or wireless communication if directly
   presented; by manual keying or reading data if remote) and forwards same to the acquirer
   2006. Interaction between the merchant and cardholder is outside the purview of the
   payment card network per se.      The payment card network becomes involved at the
 5 connection between the acquirer 2006 and network 2008; the dotted line between points
   E and F in FIGS. 11 and 12 encompasses the network 2008. Note generally that points
   A, B, C, E, and F in FIG. 11 connect to the corresponding points in FIG. 12; the entire
   network and associated environment are not amenable to illustration on a single sheet.
10 More specifically, the acquirer 2006, in the more specific example of FIGS. 11 and 12,
   has at its premises a payment network interface processor (PNIP 2012). The MasterCard
   Interface Processor or MIP is a non-limiting example of a PNIP.         In a non-limiting
   example, the PNIP is implemented on a rack-mounted server.            PNIPs are typically
   located at the edges of the payment card network. In at least some instances, the payment
15 card network of FIG. 2 is a distributed network wherein each acquirer and issuer has at
   least one PNIP on their premises. Each acquirer 2006 will have a relationship with one
   or more merchants 2004 and will interface with the merchants' terminals 126 via terminal
   driver 2014 (an acquirer may also act as an acquirer for themselves as a merchant).
   Furthermore in this regard, the merchant locations will have terminals where the cards are
20 swiped (or where contacted or contactless devices are presented).       The acquirer will
   employ terminal driver 2014 to interface with those terminals. Terminal driver 2014 is a
   logical block representing software and/or hardware that allows the acquirer processing
   platform 2015 to communicate with the terminals of the merchants via TCP, dial up, or
   the like (TCP/IP interfaces 2016 are shown in the example in the figures). Each merchant
25 will decide what acquirer to use to accept one or more brands of payment cards, and the
   acquirer will set the merchant up with the appropriate software and/or firmware for the
   merchant's point of sale devices.
                                               20

   The acquirer 2006 will present transactions from many different merchants 2004 to the
   payment card network operator 2008 via the PNIP interface 2012.             The connection
   between the merchants 2004 and the acquirer 2006 is typically a TCP/IP interface 2016.
   The format that the transaction is in when the card is swiped at the merchant 2004 may
 5 differ from the format that the transaction is in when actually received by the payment
   card network operator. The acquirer may convert the transaction into the ISO 8583
   format or into a format that is a specific implementation of the ISO 8583 format (e.g., the
   MASTERCARD CIS (customer interface specification) format.                 The authorization
   request message can be an ISO 8583 message type identifier (MTI) 0100 message, for
10 example, sent over the communications interface 2016 between the merchant 2004 and
   the acquirer 2006.
   Once the 0100 message is received at the PNIP 2012 of the acquirer 2006, a series of
   edits can be performed on the transaction with respect to format, content, and/or context.
15 Furthermore, screening can be carried out to determine whether the message relates to
   something beyond an ordinary authorization request, referred to as an enhanced service.
   Enhanced services may be screened for on behalf of one or more issuers 2010 and/or the
   operator of network 2008 itself. A centralized member parameter system (MPS) 2018
   can be provided to house parameters used to drive processing of credit authorization
20 transactions.   In one or more embodiments, extracts from the centralized member
   parameter system 2018 are distributed to all acquirer PNIPs 2012 and issuer PNIPs 2024
   on the network 2008 on a daily basis to drive processing of credit card transactions.
   It should be noted at this point that an "ICA" and a "BIN" are employed in BANKNET
25 so that a member can perform card issuing and/or acquiring activities.          An ICA or
   Interbank Card Association is a four to six digit identification assigned by MasterCard for
   use by a member to uniquely identify activity the member is responsible for. A BIN or
   Bank Identification Number is a unique series of numbers assigned by MasterCard to a
   principal member and used as the first six digits of a cardholder account number. Other
                                                21

   payment card networks have similar types of numbers, as will be apparent to the skilled
   artisan.
   In at least some embodiments, the same member parameter extract is sent to all PNIPs
 5 and transactions are routed using same. In at least some circumstances, account numbers
   or ranges of account numbers are used in deciding how to route.              In some cases,
   transactions are routed to an issuer PNIP based on where the account range is "signed in."
   Issuers send an MTI 0800 sign in request message with either a group ID or account
   range. The Member ID is pulled from the PNIP port 2038 configuration and transactions
10 from that account range are then routed to the port from which the sign-in request is
   received. A member ID can be present on ports on multiple PNIPs at an Issuer site - see
   discussion of FIG. 15 below.
   In one or more embodiments, based on the account range, the parameters in MPS 2018
15 (or a local extract thereof) will determine how to process a given transaction; e.g.,
   product code, country code, currency code, and the like, including what enhanced
   services (if any) the issuer has signed up for on a particular account range. That is to say,
   the messages are parsed and certain fields, including the account range, are examined; the
   account range is associated with a certain issuer and based on that, the message may be
20 treated differently. Messages may be parsed, and converted into an internal data format
   so that access can be obtained to all the individual data elements.         In one or more
   embodiments, the account number is used as a key to access the MPS 2018 (or a local
   extract thereof) and retrieve all the parameters that are appropriate for processing the
   given transaction. In a non-limiting example, a suitable message parser 2020 (and other
25 programs on the PNIP 2012) can be written in an appropriate high-level language or the
   like.
   In an exemplary embodiment, the central MPS 2018 creates extracts once a day that are
   distributed out to the endpoints on the network (e.g., PNIPs 2012), as seen at 2022.
                                                 22

   These extracts include the pertinent information needed for the PNIP to process the
   message and determine if it requires any special handling. In some instances, messages
   are next routed to a central site 2009 for performance of enhanced services. On the other
   hand, if no special services are required, the message may be routed directly to the issuer
 5 PNIP 2024 as seen at 2026.
   Messages routed directly to the issuer PNIP: In this aspect, the transaction is routed
   directly to the issuer PNIP 2024 based on the MPS extract 2022, as seen at 2026. Every
   account range will have a unique         destination endpoint identified in the parameters
10 (account ranges may be grouped and all members of the account range group may have a
   common destination endpoint). The member interface refers to the connection between
   the acquirer processor 2006 and the Acquirer PNIP 2012. This term also applies to the
   interface between the Issuer PNIP 2024 and issuer processor 2010. The connections
   between and among acquirer PNIP 2012 and issuer PNIP 2024, acquirer PNIP 2012 and
15 ASPs 2050, and ASPs 2050 and issuer PNIP 2024 are referred to as a network interface
   onto the payment card network itself.        In one or more embodiments, this may be a
   TCP/IP connection (as seen at 2026) with customized routing capabilities including
   group addresses.      Normally, TCP/IP addresses refer to a single endpoint.              Group
   addresses may be directed to a group of addresses, and will target any of the computers
20 (e.g., PNIPs) in the group using a variety of protocols. Some use a round robin approach;
   others may use a first in list approach where the message is always routed to one given
   computer first and then to a second computer only if the first is not available. Group
   addressing may be useful, for example, where an acquirer or issuer has multiple PNIPS at
   the same location for redundancy/fault tolerance.        It is also possible to combine the
25 approach and institute a round robin, wherein the addresses within the round robin are
   first in list group address, or conversely, it is possible to institute a first-in-list, wherein
   the addresses within the first-in-list are round robin group addresses. These capabilities
   are useful in case of outages, maintenance, and the like.
                                                 23

   FIG. 13 shows a non-limiting example with four PNIPs 2028-1 through 2028-4. In a
   round robin approach, a first message is routed first to PNIP 2028-1,   a second message
   to PNIP 2028-2, a third message to PNIP 2028-3, a fourth message to PNIP 2028-4, a
   fifth message to PNIP 2028-1, and so on. In a first in list approach, all messages are
 5 routed to PNIP 2028-1; if it is not available for a given message, the message is routed to
   PNIP 2028-2; if PNIP 2028-2 is not available, the message is routed to PNIP 2028-3; if
   PNIP 2028-3 is not available, the message is routed to 2028-4.         Each PNIP 2028-1
   through 2028-4 in FIG. 13 could be a single machine or a group of machines addressed
   by first in list or round robin as discussed just above. In one or more embodiments, the
10 physical network 2026 between PNIPs 2012, 2024 and the physical network 2030, 2032
   between PNIPs 2012, 2024 and the central site 2009 is a private Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) TCP/IP network and is not the Internet. Once the issuer's network
   group address has been determined by the PNIP 2012 (or ASP 2050), the message is
   routed to the issuer PNIP 2024. Once the 0100 auth message arrives at the issuer PNIP
15 2024, additional edits are performed to double check and make sure that the message has
   been routed to the correct location. Furthermore, the member ID is examined, because
   some issuers may share a single PNIP and it is necessary to determine which of the
   issuers (members) sharing that PNIP the transaction in question is to be routed to. Each
   of the issuers sharing the PNIP will have its own port on the member side of the PNIP;
20 the transaction is routed to the appropriate port based on the member parameters.      See
   FIG. 13 where a generalized PNIP 2028 has a network side 2034 and a member side
   2036. Member side 2036 has N ports 2038-1 through 2038-N to members 1 to N. N is
   used herein as a generalized arbitrary integer and the value of N in FIG. 14 is not
   necessarily the same as that of N in connection with elements 2002 in FIG. 2, for
25 example.
   As seen in FIG. 15, in some instances, an issuer has multiple PNIP devices 2028 at a
   single site, with a network-side connection 2034, and with multiple PNIPs 2028 all
                                                 24

   connected to the same host system (each has port 1 2038-1 associated with the same
   member (issuer)).
   At this point, the 0100 message has been delivered to the issuer 2010. The issuer 2010
 5 then carries out issuer processing and decisioning (e.g., with issuer processing platform
   2040) based on transaction velocities, open to buy, fraud detection protocols, etc., and
   provides an appropriate authorization request response, ISO 8583 MTI 0110. There are a
   number of different possible response codes defined within ISO 8583 and its particular
   implementations. Each transaction is made up of multiple data elements; the response
10 from the issuer is included in data element 39. Once the 0110 message is received on the
   issuer PNIP 2024 from platform 2040 it is parsed and edited for format, content, and
   context, including validation of DE39 to make sure that it is a valid value.
   It is worth noting that in one or more instances, at every point where a transaction
15 touches a computer of the payment card network, whether it be an acquirer PNIP 2012,
   issuer PNIP 2024, or a special services computer or computers 2050 at the central
   location 2009 (discussed below), transaction context is preserved. That is to say, before
   the message is sent on to the next node in the network, a copy is saved in a context
   manager queue 2042, 2046, 2058, so that when the transaction response MTI 0110 comes
20 back through, the request MTI 0100 can be matched with the response, in order to know
   how to route the response back to the previous route point. One of the items saved in the
   context manager queue is the message originator's address, so that it can be used for
   route-back information. Once the issuer PNIP validation is complete, including format,
   content, and context edits, the transaction is extracted from the context manager queue
25 2046 and the route-back address is retrieved, and the 0110 message is then sent back
   where it came from; in this case, the acquirer PNIP 2012 (or ASP 2050). The acquirer
   PNIP 2012 then receives and parses the message and pulls its original request out of its
   context manager queue 2042. Note that multiple acquirers may share an acquirer PNIP
   and it is therefore necessary to know which port on the acquirer PNIP to route the
                                                25

   response back to (see discussion of FIG. 13). Checking the message against the original
   request in the context manager queue allows the message to be routed back to the correct
   port.
 5 Each PNIP 2012, 2024 typically has many different programs. These can include, for
   example, a parser/editor 2020, 2043; a parameter file manager; a transaction context
   manager; a member communications program; a network communications program; and
   the like. Please note that to reduce clutter, FIGS. 11 and 12 show "MPS extract" 2022,
   2044; this will typically include the extract itself and the associated parameter file
10 manager which manages obtaining the extracts from MPS 2018.            Similarly, to reduce
   clutter, FIGS. 11 and 12 show "context manager queue" 2042, 2046; this will typically
   include the queue itself and the associated manager which manages the contents of the
   queue. In one or more embodiments, there is also a communication program used to
   communicate between the other programs (inter-process communications) on the PNIP;
15 this is omitted from FIGS. 11 and 12 to avoid clutter.
   Messages in case of Enhanced Services: In one or more instances, a special architecture
   is used to facilitate delivery of enhanced services (the ASP 2050 in FIGS. 11 and 12 is a
   non-limiting example).        Examples of enhanced services include the MasterCard
20 "inControl" product providing spending controls and/or virtual card numbers.          Other
   examples are loyalty rewards, recurring payment cancellations, and the like. One or more
   instances do not deploy this complex logic out to the network edge. Furthermore in this
   regard, the issuer and acquirer PNIPs 2012, 2024 are referred to as being on the edge
   because they reside on the customer's premises 2006, 2010. There may be over 2000
25 PNIPs on a typical network. The special architecture used in one or more instances is a
   central site type architecture associated with location 2009.     At the central site 2009,
   certain computers are referred to as authorization services processors or ASPs 2050.
                                                26

   On the acquirer PNIP 2012, when checking the member parameter file for an account
   range, determine whether the transaction requires enhanced services.            If yes, the
   transactions is routed to the central site ASPs 2050, which have interfaces to all of the
   service provider systems - the ASPs do not necessarily provide the services themselves
 5 (although they can in some embodiments), but may mediate between the network (e.g.,
   BANKNET) and the actual service providers 2051-1 through 2051-N. An ASP will
   typically have connections 2053 to a mainframe 2052 via DB2 connect or other suitable
   connection. If a transaction is to be enriched with additional data, a database call will be
   made to the mainframe 2052 to retrieve the information from mainframe database 2054
10 so that it can be inserted into the transaction before the transaction is forwarded to the
   issuers.   Interfaces can also be provided to a risk management system, a decisioning
   management system, IN CONTROL, rewards, and the like.             Service providers 2051-1
   through 2051-N generally represent any enhanced services, non-limiting examples of
   which have been given herein.
15
   A communications layer 2056 is used to communicate with the service providers in one
   or more embodiments, a non-limiting example of a suitable implementation is the IBM
   MQ series.       The 0100 message may be sent to the service providers, optionally
   encapsulated inside a special "enhanced services" (ES) header that wraps the message
20 with any additional information required to fulfill the service. The service provider sends
   a response.    The ASP takes the response and enriches the 0100 transaction with the
   service response, and then sends the entire package on to the issuer PNIP 2024. Some
   enhanced services are processed on the request messages (0100) and others are processed
   on the response messages (0110). Once the response message is processed on the ASP,
25 the original message will be pulled from the context manager queue 2058 on the ASP to
   determine the appropriate acquirer PNIP 2012 to route the message back to. From there,
   the acquirer PNIP will behave just as in the "Messages routed directly to the issuer PNIP"
   case discussed above. Some embodiments of the special architecture use an Enterprise
                                                27

   Service Bus to mediate and facilitate some of the services 2051.      For example, the In
   CONTROL service can be accessed via an instance of an Enterprise Service Bus.
   Entry of Data into the Data Warehouse: In one or more instances, every transaction that
 5 flows through the issuer PNIP 2012, acquirer PNIP 2024, and/or ASPs 2050 is logged at
   every point by writing log records. Multiple times a day (e.g., six), a global file transfer
   system 2059 pulls the logs off each node and collects them into a support files system
   2060 on the mainframe 2052. The log files are parsed and collected into a general daily
   file. The general daily file is scrubbed and modified to create a consolidated file on the
10 mainframe which is then pulled into the data warehouse 2062, where additional data
   manipulation and scrubbing are performed before the transactions are stored. The data
   warehouse 2062 is located at an intermediate node (location 2009) connected to the
   PNIPs of the acquirers and issuers 2012, 2024. By way of clarification, in one or more
   embodiments, the node 2009 is directly connected to the PNIPs 2012, 2024 but the data
15 warehouse is not directly connected to the 2012 and 2024 devices; rather, data flows
   through GFT and SF systems 2059, 2060 and ends up in the data warehouse.               Data
   warehouse 2062 should be distinguished from a data warehouse 154 that might be
   maintained by an issuer.
20 Clearingand Settlement: One or more instances employ a clearing and settlement system
   2074. In clearing, via global file transfer 2059, acquirers submit clearing files in an
   appropriate message format (in a non-limiting example, Integrated Product Messages
   (IPM) format). The files contain, from the acquirers' perspective, what they believe they
   should be paid for. In one or more instances, the authorization does not actually move
25 any money; the authorization only validates that the cardholder is a valid cardholder
   recognized by the bank, which will honor payment to the merchant for the goods or
   services.   For example, in a typical restaurant visit, the card is swiped for the receipt
   amount but then a tip is added. The clearing message will have the actual food amount
   plus the tip. In one or more instances, the clearing does not actually move the money; it
                                               28

   merely resolves the actual amounts. The settlement system actually initiates movement
   of the money. Furthermore in this regard, the settlement system actually tells the banks
   how much money to move but does not actually move the money.                Within clearing,
   processes include dispute resolution, chargeback, and the like. During clearing, files are
 5 sent from the acquirers to the payment card network; the payment card network, using
   clearing and settlement system 2074, then takes the files and splits them and sorts them
   by issuer. Response files are then received from each issuer, and these response files are
   again split and re-sorted back to the correct acquirers. Eventually, data flows into the
   settlement system and money is moved. Thus, at a high level, the auth request and auth
10 request response are in real time, and the clearing and settlement are in a batch mode.
   By way of review and provision of additional detail, in at least some instances, in a batch
   mode, clearing is initiated via an ISO 8583 MTI 1240 message having a DE24 function
   code value of 200 for a first presentment.       Once this message is obtained from the
15 acquirer, the payment card network, using clearing and settlement system 2074, will
   undertake syntax edits, format edits, content edits, and context edits (typically applied to
   every transaction). If those edits are passed, the interchange and fees associated with the
   transaction will be calculated.    Based on the calculations, the message may also be
   enriched with additional information before being passed on to the issuer. The settlement
20 amount is then determined. Within the clearing cycle, the amounts of money due to each
   given member (e.g., issuer or acquirer) are accumulated, and these are summed up into a
   settlement file which is forwarded in due course.
   Cryptographic aspects: Consider the concepts of data at rest and data in motion. An
25 example of data at rest is the log files that actually reside on the PNIPS themselves
   configuration information containing card numbers or personally identifiable information
   (PII). In one or more embodiments, all sensitive data at rest is encrypted before being
   written to disk. Data in motion refers to data actually moving over a transmission
   medium (e.g., wires, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, RF link). All PCI-sensitive data
                                                29

   (PCI Security Standards Council, LLC, Wakefield, MA US) is encrypted, whether
   written to disk or being sent over a network. In at least some instances, internal links
   within the premises of the acquirers and issuers are not encrypted since it is assumed that
   the customer premises are a physically secure facility relying on physical security of the
 5 hardware. On the other hand, in at least some instances, external links (e.g., links 2026,
   2030 and 2032) are all encrypted for both authorization traffic and bulk file transfers.
   One or more embodiments will have interface(s) 2068 to other brands of payment card
   processing network. For example, a MASTERCARD branded payment card processing
10 network may have interfaces to networks such as AMERICAN EXPRESS, VISA, JCB,
   DISCOVER, and the like. Suitable translation layers can be provided to intermediate
   between MASTERCARD (or other) format and formats used by other networks, as
   appropriate. In one or more embodiments, interfaces 2068 to other payment networks are
   provided via a machine, located at 2009, but generally analogous to an Issuer PNIP 2024
15 with added mediation layers loaded as required by other payment network formats. Some
   merchants may only have a single interface to, e.g., the MASTERCARD network - all
   transactions from that merchant may be routed to MASTERCARD, regardless of what
   card was used - MASTERCARD will process those transactions and route them out to
   the appropriate networks.
20
   Electronic Bill Presentment and/or Payment Systems
   Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 4, electronic bill payment systems are conceptually
   different than payment card networks, and will often use electronic funds transfer from a
25 demand deposit account.       In some instances, a single entity, such as MasterCard
   International Incorporated (a non-limiting example) will operate both a payment card
   network and      an electronic   bill payment    system (optionally, with presentment
   functionality).
                                               30

   With regard to electronic bill presentment and payment systems, inventive techniques can
   be employed in a number of different environments.           In one or more embodiments,
   inventive techniques can be employed in connection with the MASTERCARD RPPS@
   electronic payment system of MasterCard International Incorporated of Purchase, New
 5 York, USA.      This example is non-limiting; for example, other types of electronic bill
   presentment and/or payment systems could be employed in other instances. Non-limiting
   examples are is described in:
       *   US Patent Publication 2011-0251952 Al of Mary L. Kelly et al (expressly
10         incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes).
       *   US Patent Publication 2012-0197788 Al of Hemal Sanghvi et al (expressly
           incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes).
       *   US Patent Publication 2013-0290177 Al of Amy Christine Milam and Stephen
           Joseph Klaus (expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all
15         purposes).
       *   US Patent Publication 2013-0311362 Al of Amy C. Milam et al. (expressly
           incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes).
   For the avoidance of doubt, references to MasterCard, unless expressly stated to be
20 limited to MasterCard, are intended to be exemplary of an operator of an electronic bill
   payment system (optionally, with presentment functionality) and/or an operator of a
   payment card network, as will be appreciated from the context, whether or not qualified
   by words such as "or other operator."
25 Furthermore, another non-limiting example of electronic bill presentment and/or payment
   systems with which one or more embodiments of the invention can be employed is the
   CHECKFREE platform available from Fiserv, Inc. of Brookfield, Wisconsin, USA.
   Other non-limiting examples are discussed below and/or will also be apparent to the
   skilled artisan, given the teachings herein.
                                                31

   FIG. 3 shows       operation   of an electronic bill payment        system, such as the
   MASTERCARD RPPS® electronic payment system, which is but one non-limiting
   example of such a system, modified in accordance with aspects of the invention. Given
 5 the teachings herein, the skilled artisan will be able to implement one or more
   embodiments of the invention using a variety of techniques; by way of example and not
   limitation, the modification or supplementing of an existing MASTERCARD RPPS®
   system or other electronic payment system as shown in FIG. 3. As shown in FIG. 3, in an
   approach 1000, during a presentment phase, a biller 1002 electronically sends billing
10 information 1012 to its biller service provider (BSP) 1004; that is, an institution that acts
   as an intermediary between the biller and the consumer for the exchange of electronic bill
   payment information.     BSP 1004 in turn sends the information to the electronic bill
   payment system 1006, as seen at 1014. As seen at 1016, the system 1006 in turn delivers
   the billing information to the customer service provider (CSP) 1008, that is, an agent of
15 the customer that provides an interface directly to customers, businesses, or others for bill
   payment and presentment. The CSP enrolls customers, enables payment and presentment,
   and provides customer care. CSP 1008 presents the bill to the consumer (customer) 1010
   at 1018.
20 In a payment phase, consumer 1010 sends bill payment instructions to CSP 1008, as seen
   at 1020. CSP 1008 in turn sends the bill payment information to the system 1006, as at
    1022. The system sends funds and data electronically to BSP 1004, as at 1024. The BSP
    1004 posts payment information to the biller 1002, as at 1026.
25 Note that in some instances, billers 1002 can connect directly to BPPS 1006 without the
   use of BSP 1004. In such cases, billers 1002 exchange presentment and payment data
   directly with BPPS 1006.
                                                32

   Database(s) 1099 include biller directory 797, customer database 1095, and/or bill
   presentment database 1094. All may be accessed, for example, by database management
   system 799.    MasterCard's RPPS Biller Directory is a non-limiting example of biller
   directory 797.   Each biller in the biller directory is identified by a unique Biller ID.
 5 Records in the biller directory 797 will also typically include the name and address
   information for the biller corresponding to the Biller ID, as well as the biller's demand
   deposit account to which payments should be routed (conventional) or payment card
   account in which a business can receive payments from customers via a special payment
   transaction over a payment card network (in one or more embodiments). Of course, other
10 embodiments could use a different database configuration than that shown and described
   herein. Customer database 1095 includes, in one or more embodiments, the customer's
   name, address, and postal code, and for each payment, time stamp for the payment, Biller
   ID, and amount. In a non-limiting example, bill presentment can be carried out via a web
   site operated by an underlying bank. The bank will typically have a Party ID and Party
15 Collection ID. The Party ID will identify unique individuals. The Party Collection ID
   will be for a household including one or more individuals. Thus, customer database 1095
   can include household IDs with associated data and individual IDs with associated data.
   It should be noted that in some cases, some data referred to as residing in customer
   database 1095 (e.g., customer's home address) may be maintained by customer service
20 provider(s) 1008 rather than electronic BPPS 1006; database 1095 may thus, in some
   cases, be implemented as a composite of several databases maintained by customer
   service provider(s) 1008 and electronic BPPS 1006. Bill presentment database 1094 may
   include "raw" presentment data. It is described for completeness, although it will be
   appreciated that one or more embodiments utilize ACH or other EFT payment data as
25 opposed to presentment data. A non-limiting example of bill presentment data such as
   would typically be available in database 1094, representing bill presentment as described
   with regard to 1012, 1014, 1016, 1018, includes Time Stamp, Payee, Minimum due,
   Total Balance, and Due Date. Of course, there would be many users of the electronic
   BPPS, and there would typically be many bill presentment records for each user.
                                               33

   Note that "BPPS" is used herein as shorthand for an electronic "bill presentment and
   payment system"; the MASTERCARD RPPS system is a non-limiting example of such a
   system. Furthermore, new functionality from a new bill presentment and payment system
 5 card payment component (BPPS-CPC) 504, according to aspects of the invention, is
   discussed below.
   FIG. 4 shows a current process 1100 for making electronic funds transfers (EFT) for bill
   payment or the like. An originating depository financial institution (ODFI) 1102, also
10 known as an originator, sends instructions (e.g., payment data and remittance data) using
   a network such as the automated clearing house (ACH) 1104, Swift, EPN, CHIPS,
   Fedwire, and the like, as seen at 1108. As shown at 1110, the ACH or similar network
    1104 relays the instructions to the receiving depository financial institution (RDFI) (e.g.,
   receiver or a lockbox), designated 1106. In some embodiments, an ACH file format can
15 be used; non-limiting examples of ACH file formats include the NACHA ACH CIE,
   NACHA ACH PPD, or NACHA ACH CCD (e.g. for corporate-to-corporate cases) file
   formats.    Other formats can also be used; for example, extensible markup language
   (XML).     It should be noted that a variety of networks can be used, both public (for
   example, ACH) and proprietary (for example, the aforementioned MASTERCARD
20 RPPS system).
   As used herein, an "electronic bill presentment system using customer service providers"
   refers to a system wherein electronic bills are distributed from billers, through an
   aggregator switch, out to financial institutions or other customer service providers such
25 that those financial institutions or other customer service providers can display the
   electronic bills, through the financial institutions' or other customer service providers'
   own on-line banking interface, to bill-paying customers of the financial institutions or
   other customer service providers. FIG. 5 of the above-referenced US Patent Publication
   2011-0251952 Al of Mary L. Kelly et al. shows an exemplary block diagram of an
                                                 34

   electronic bill presentment system, including a bill payment platform and a bill
   presentment platform; the bill payment platform may utilize techniques disclosed in the
   above-referenced US Patent Publication 2012-0197788 Al of Hemal Sanghvi et al.
 5 Some electronic bill payment systems use the NACHA ACH Standard Entry Class (SEC)
   formats, such as CIE (Customer Initiated Entries), CTX (Corporate trade exchange);
   CCD (Cash Concentration or Disbursement);             or PPD (Prearranged payment and
   deposits).   Some electronic bill payment systems use a modified form of the NACHA
   CIE (MOD-CIE) wherein a payment system operator requires specific values for certain
10 fields. Some electronic bill payment systems (e.g., MASTERCARD RPPS) provide
   translation capability and can receive input in many different formats, translate it for
   internal use, and translate it again for output in many different formats, which may be the
   same as or different from the input formats.         Some electronic bill payment systems
   provide customer service providers with the capability to specify when the electronic bill
15 payment system will look to them for payment instructions.            Some electronic bill
   payment systems provide biller service providers with the capability to specify when the
   electronic bill payment system will initiate payments. FIG. 5 of the above-referenced US
   Patent Publication 2012-0197788 Al of Hemal Sanghvi et al. shows exemplary system
   interfaces of an electronic bill payment system.
20
   As noted above, electronic bill presentment and payment systems are conceptually
   different than payment card networks, and will often use electronic funds transfer from a
   demand deposit account. Nevertheless, some electronic bill presentment and/or payment
   systems receive and send data over a network such as is shown in FIG. 2, using capability
25 such as MasterCard Global File Transfer (GFT). Furthermore, US Patent Publication
   2010-0100480 of Theresa Altman et al., hereby expressly incorporated by reference
   herein in its entirety for all purposes, describes a system wherein payment of a bill using
   a payment card account is facilitated by formatting and dispatching a message from a bill
   payment provider to an electronic bill payment system. The message is flagged with a
                                                  35

   flag indicating that the message includes a non-financial, card payment, message. The
   message includes an identification of the biller, a card number of the payment card
   account, and an expiration date of the payment card account. The message is an
   electronic funds transfer message augmented with the flag, the card number, and the
 5 expiration date.
   Some electronic bill payment systems use technology such as described in the above
   referenced US Patent Publication 2013-0290177 Al of Milam and Klaus to reduce the
   number of non-electronic payments.          Some electronic bill payment systems use
10 technology such as described in the above-referenced US Patent Publication 2013
   0311362 Al of Amy C. Milam et al. to facilitate approximately matching entered payee
   information to stored biller information.
   Settlement to a Merchant's Card Account Using an On-Line Bill Payment Platform
15
   In one or more embodiments, an electronic bill payment system, optionally with
   presentment functionality, is expanded to settle real-time with small businesses using a
   special transaction (e.g., ISO-8583 message type 0100 with transaction type twenty eight,
   or an ISO-8583 message type 0200 with transaction type twenty eight, as discussed
20 further below), such as the MasterCard MONEYSEND Payment Transaction, in place of
   existing ACH and Wire transfer payments. Additionally, one or more embodiments
   provide the capability for businesses to register for the service directly with an entity such
   as MasterCard, or through a participating partner.
25 Furthermore in this regard, one or more embodiments expedite the receipt of funds for
   business from online bill payment, by adding a new option for businesses to receive
   funds to their payment card accounts (e.g., MASTERCARD card or VISA card
   accounts). In the case of providing a debit card to receive a payment, the funds are
   transferred directly into the business' bank account via a special payment transaction over
                                                36

   a payment card network (as opposed to a prior art ACH or wire transfer). Furthermore in
   this regard, today, businesses can receive online bill payments via an electronic bill
   payment system by ACH or wire transfer.          Note that one or more embodiments are
   believed to be particularly useful for small businesses which have hitherto been unable to
 5 receive electronic payments; however, this is not a limitation.
   In an exemplary embodiment, in a first step, a small business registers with an electronic
   bill payment     system, optionally with presentment        functionality (throughout this
   discussion, unless expressly indicated that presentment functionality is required,
10 presentment functionality in a bill payment system is to be understood as optional). For
   example, the small business registers with a biller directory 797, discussed further below,
   such as     MasterCard's    RPPS    Biller Directory    and provides,    for  example,   its
   MASTERCARD          card or VISA       card account information. Upon completion of
   registration, the small business is given a Biller ID (e.g., by MasterCard, a partner of
15 MasterCard, or by MasterCard or a partner accepting a small business-generated Biller
   ID such as an e-mail address or the like). Registration can happen directly through a
   service provided by the operator of the electronic bill payment system, or through a
   partner such as an accounting package, issuer, acquirer or payment provider. In the latter
   case, these third party services use, for example, one or more APIs (collectively API 509,
20 discussed further below) provided by the operator of the electronic bill payment system,
   to register a small business and receive a Biller ID, which it provides to the small
   business.
   Furthermore with regard to Biller ID, in some instances, the (small) businesses are
25 afforded an opportunity to set up email addresses as an ID for payments. The (small)
   business provides an email address such as ""payments at abclandscaping dot com" (at
   sign omitted and "." rendered as " dot " to avoid browser-executable code in text of
   patent application).     When making an online bill payment, the consumer types in
   "payments at abclandscaping.com" (in place of a biller ID generated by the BPPS
                                                 37

   operator or third party partner such as 507). This e-mail address based ID is used as a
   unique identifier to look up the card account to initiate a special payment transaction.
   In a second step, the small business names and IDs are provided to various payment
 5 providers (e.g., MasterCard RPPS; various banking, financial services, and/or payments
   industry technology providers; and the like) and banks through an existing file transfer
   process, or via APIs providing real-time access.
   Existing API functionality, with which the skilled artisan is familiar, is to be
10 distinguished from novel API functionality 509 in accordance with one or more
   embodiments of the invention.
   In a third step, the small business includes the Biller ID on the invoices it provides to its
   customers.
15
   In a fourth step, the customer authenticates himself or herself to his or her online bill
   payment service to pay the invoice. The customer searches for the small business by, for
   example, name, name and address, or Biller ID. The customer confirms when the correct
   biller has been identified.      For example, the customer searches for "Chesterfield
20 Landscaping" and views the address and confirms the biller; or the customer searches for
   Biller ID 123456 as indicated on the invoice, and "Chesterfield Landscaping" and its
   address are displayed - the customer confirms the biller. Once the biller is identified, the
   customer optionally enters an Account # and Invoice # which are vetted against pre
   established criteria set by the small business, and then the customer enters the amount
25 and confirms payment. In another option, outstanding invoices are displayed to the
   customer based on the account number provided.
   In a fifth step, payment is routed directly to an electronic bill payment system, or to a
   third party intermediary such as a payment provider 507, who in turn routes the payment
                                                38

   to an electronic bill payment system. The electronic bill payment system looks up the
   Biller ID and determines that the small business account to which payment is to be
   received is a card account. The electronic bill payment system originates a payment
   transaction to a payment card network to deposit the funds (in at least some
 5 embodiments, in real time). The payment card network may have the same brand and be
   operated by the same entity as the electronic bill payment system (e.g., MASTERCARD
   RPPS ELECTRONIC BILL PAYMENT SYSTEM AND MASTERCARD BANKNET
   PAYMENT CARD NETWORK), or the two may be branded and operated separately. A
   payment notification may be provided directly to the small business, or to the third party
10 who registered the small business, depending on services configured for the small
   business.
   Thus, currently, online bill payments are typically settled with businesses via ACH or
   Wire Transfer, whereas one or more embodiments add the capability to settle an online
15 bill payment with the business using a special transaction (e.g., ISO-8583 message type
   0100 with transaction type twenty eight, or an ISO-8583 message type 0200 with
   transaction type twenty eight, as discussed further below), such as the MasterCard
   MONEYSEND Payment Transaction or through similar payment transactions on partner
   networks.
20
   Furthermore in this regard, one or more embodiments seek to "electronify" bill payments
   for small businesses. Currently, if someone's landscaper is a small business, he or she
   might go to an online bill payment site and have to type in the landscaper's name and
   address.   However, the bank would not have the information available to route the
25 payment electronically, so the bank would have to prepare and mail a paper check. One
   or more embodiments allow an entity such as MasterCard to aggregate a large number of
   small businesses and/or to work with partners to allow the partners to aggregate on the
   entity's behalf. For example, a provider of popular bookkeeping software may already
   have a good relationship with many small businesses), and would likely be a suitable
                                               39

   partner. One or more embodiments, during a registration process, obtain from a small
   business its name and address information, as well as its preferred form of payment. One
   or more embodiments facilitate payment to the small business by crediting the small
   business' payment card account (e.g., MasterCard or VISA debit account) and can settle
 5 in real time using a payment card network such as MasterCard's BANKNET network or
   Visa's VISANET network, an interbank (e.g., debit) network, and the like.         Current
   techniques are typically (i) not set up to permit payments to small businesses and (ii)
   limited to payment via ACH techniques.
10 Thus, one or more embodiments carry out payments to small businesses by transferring
   funds to demand deposit accounts of the small businesses via a card transaction over a
   payment card network such as the above-discussed special transaction, rather than ACH
   transfer. A debit card is a payment card that is linked to a demand deposit account. The
   special transaction as discussed above is a payment card transaction that allows funds to
15 be pushed to a cardholder's payment card account, knowing the small business' debit
   card number ("cardholder" may or may not have a physical card associated with the
   account, but has a payment card account with a payment card account number).         The
   special transaction includes the debit card number and allows real-time posting of funds
   to the merchant's debit card account.
20
   Several different non-limiting exemplary scenarios regarding special transactions such as
   the MasterCard payment transaction or MoneySend will now be presented.            In one
   scenario, a dual message model is employed.         An "auth request" is sent (ISO-8583
   message 0100 with Transaction Type (DE3sfl) = "28" (Payment Transaction)) from the
25 consumer's bank to the merchant's bank, over a payment card network (network 2008 is
   a non-limiting example). This guarantees the money transfer (reserves funds for the
   merchant). Subsequently (for example, in one day) a "First Presentment" message 1240 is
   sent in a bulk file which completes the transfer. In another scenario, a single message
   model is utilized. A Financial Transaction request is sent (ISO-8583 message 0200 with
                                               40

   Transaction Type (DE3sfl) = "28" (Payment Transaction)) from the consumer's bank to
   the merchant's bank, over a payment card network (network 2008 is a non-limiting
   example).
 5 It is worth noting at this point that ISO 8583 message type 0100 is used in a conventional
   transaction as an authorization request from the acquirer 2006 to the issuer 2010 of the
   consumer's card, to which the issuer 2010 responds with an authorization request
   response 0110. The message type 0100 is also utilized conventionally for chargebacks
   and the like.    The message type 0100 is utilized in a different way here based on a
10 different code/transaction type than in the conventional applications (Transaction Type
   (DE3sfl) = "28" (Payment Transaction)).
   Thus, while the special transaction such as the MasterCard MoneySend payment
   transaction with transaction type "28" is itself known, one or more embodiments
15 advantageously modify electronic bill payment network(s) to operate with this kind of
   special transaction in addition to the conventional ACH functionality. Furthermore, one
   or more embodiments advantageously provide a mechanism by which a large number of
   small businesses can be registered to take advantage of the new functionality.
20 One or more embodiments include a registration phase and a payment (operational)
   phase. Thus, in a sense, there are two pertinent aspects to one or more embodiments: (i)
   integrating the payment message into the electronic bill payment network (real-time
   component); and (ii) registration - currently, this happens in batch files - issuers or
   aggregators deliver files on a daily basis - one or more embodiments have real-time
25 creation of a biller in the billing system via new application program interfaces (APIs).
   FIG. 5 depicts a high-level flow of (e.g., small) business registration, according to an
   aspect of the invention. One or more businesses 502 desire to register a MasterCard or
   VISA debit card account (or even a credit or other card account and/or payment card
                                                  41

   account of a different brand) with a bill presentment and payment system card payment
   component (BPPS-CPC) 504, part of BPPS 1006, configured in accordance with one or
   more aspects of the invention.      Again, not all embodiments need necessarily have
   presentment functionality. The one or more businesses 502 register with BPPS-CPC 504,
 5 for example:
       *    Directly with BPPS 1006 with BPPS-CPC 504, as seen at 508
       *    Via one or more global aggregator partners 510 (for example, providers of
            commonly used software such as accounting and/or bookkeeping software,
10          customer relationship management (CRM) software; or other types of market
            aggregators or the like)
       e    Via other types of aggregators 506; e.g., online banking providers and/or online
           bill payment (optionally with presentment) providers other than BPPS 1006 (e.g.,
            other BPPS-es that partner with BPPS 1006)
15     e    Via issuer 512.
   In one or more embodiments, the small business 502 registers via a web site or
   application that the small business already uses (e.g., accounting and/or bookkeeping
   software) and responds to a prompt or query regarding the opportunity to eliminate
20 incoming check payments and participate in the service offered by BPPS-CPC 504, at
   which time the business voluntarily provides the payment card account number for the
   account the business would like to have credited.
   Whether registration is direct with BPPS-CPC 504 or via one or more partners, various
25 registration mechanisms can be employed; for example, via a form, web site, or use of
   on-file information (from issuer e.g.) that was already gathered as part of a registration
   process for registration of the payment card per se. New API 509, according to aspects
   of the invention, is discussed below and can be used for registration in one or more
   embodiments.
                                               42

   FIG. 6 presents a flow chart 600 of registration in accordance with an aspect of the
   invention. In optional step 602, any suitable third-party entity as discussed with regard to
   FIG. 5 (e.g., aggregator), which entity has a relationship with one or more (e.g., small)
 5 businesses, registers with MasterCard for online bill payment services as a partner, and
   receives a partner ID. This step can be omitted when third party(ies) are not employed.
   In step 604, this suitable entity offers electronic payments to one or more small
   businesses with which it has a relationship, and registers one or more of the small
   businesses with MasterCard for online bill payment services; for example, via new real
10 time application program interface (API) 509, in accordance with one or more aspects of
   the invention, or via a batch process. Note that an aggregator or other third party is not
   required in all instances, and in some cases, interaction is directly with MasterCard as
   seen at 508. The information gathered during registration includes, for example, business
   name, address, contact information (e.g., e-mail, telephone, fax, physical address, post
15 office address), and information regarding an account for receiving payments (a bank
   account as in a conventional case or a payment card account). The small business is
   assigned a unique Biller ID by the suitable entity or MasterCard (or by MasterCard or the
   suitable entity accepting a small business-generated Biller ID such as an e-mail address
   or the like).
20
   In step 606, MasterCard confirms that the small business has been registered in the Biller
   Directory 797 discussed below and provides the confirmed Biller ID to the suitable
   entity, as appropriate, using the aforementioned real-time API or batch process. It will be
   appreciated that uniqueness of the Biller ID is significant in one or more embodiments, to
25 distinguish small businesses with similar names - e.g., "Joe's Landscaping" in New York
   versus "Joe's Landscaping" in St. Louis. In step 608, the suitable entity provides the
   Biller ID to the small business, which in turn provides the Biller ID to its customers in
   order to allow them to make on-line bill payments. For example, the Biller ID can be
   included on the invoice. In step 610, which can be thought of as part of the registration
                                                43

   process, or as a separate publication process, MasterCard provides the updated Biller
   Directory, including the information for the newly-registered small business, to
   originators such as online banking providers, financial institutions, payment processors,
   non-financial retail payment providers, and the like, via a batch file or a real-time API
 5 that allows a banking provider to do a real-time lookup based on Biller ID, biller name,
   and the like.
   Referring now to FIG. 7, in step 701, (e.g., small) business 502, which registered as
   described with respect to FIGS. 5 and 6, sends an invoice (e.g., by mail or an electronic
10 invoice via e-mail or on-line banking), including its Biller ID, to its business or consumer
   customer (payor) 710. In step 702, customer (payor) 710 desires to pay the invoice and
   so accesses an on-line banking provider or the like 712, discussed further below, and
   provides the appropriate payment instructions. In step 703, these instructions are routed
   through optional intermediate payment provider 507, which is partnered with on-line
15 banking provider or the like 712 and/or operator of BPPS 1006.              In step 704, the
   instructions are routed from optional intermediate payment provider 507 to BPPS-CPC
   504. In an alternative approach, optional intermediate payment provider 507 is dispensed
   with and steps 703 and 704 are collapsed to the payment instructions being routed from
   on-line banking provider or the like 712 to BPPS-CPC 504. In any case, the transaction
20 is recognized as one requiring electronic payment via BPPS-CPC 504, and thus the
   instructions are routed to BPPS-CPC 504, which accesses the biller directory 797.       Such
   access can be, for example, by using database management system (DBMS) 799 to query
   biller directory 797 for the record(s) associated with the Biller ID included in the
   payment instructions.     The BPPS-CPC 504 retrieves the corresponding payment card
25 account to which payment is to be made, and submits a special payment card transaction
   of the kind described above to that payment card account, as seen in step 705, via a
   payment card network such as network 2008 (e.g., MasterCard BANKNET, VISANET,
   or other networks discussed herein). The issuer 512 of the payment card account of the
   small business 502 then deposits funds in that account in step 706, in real time. By way
                                                44

   of summary and provision of additional detail, in one or more embodiments, the payor
   710 simply advises the system to pay a certain amount to the payee. When the payment
   instruction is received, the BPPS 1006 access biller directory 797 via DBMS 799 and
   determines that this particular payor desires to be paid via the aforementioned special
 5 payment card transaction. BPPS 1006 is in the role of the merchant in a conventional
   payment card transaction, and initiates the special payment card transaction via
   communication with a suitable acquirer, which could be, for example, online banking
   provider 712, another bank, the combined acquirer/issuer in a three-party scenario, or the
   like. In some instances, BPPS 1006 itself acts as an acquirer processor, such that BPPS
10  1006 has the TMIP 2012 on its premises; nevertheless, an underlying acquiring bank is
   named in appropriate messaging. In one or more embodiments, card information is not
   shared with online banking provider 712.
   One or more embodiments advantageously allow payment routing to cards without
15 knowing the recipient's payment card account number, using the Biller Directory 797.
   Banking provider or the like 712 can include, for example, online banking functionality.
   Element 712 is broadly representative of some type of bill payment interface or service
   used by the payor 710; e.g., traditional on-line banking, a mobile wallet provider (e.g.,
   mobile money wallet such as Apple Pay), a third party service such as Western Union, or
20 the like. In another aspect, payment via an ordinary payment card or a procurement card
   (p-card or purchasing card) can be supported.
   Consider now flow chart 800 of FIG. 8, which depicts exemplary detailed steps in a
   payment process, in accordance with an aspect of the invention. In step 802, the payor
25 710 authenticates to the online bill payment application at his or her bank, selects the
   online bill payment functionality, and selects an option to pay a bill from a new biller (the
   payee 502). The payor 710 can search for the payee (business) 502 by, for example,
   Biller ID, biller name, and/or biller address.      In step 804, the payment originator
   searches a local database pre-populated with billers from MasterCard, or uses
                                                45

   MasterCard's real time API to return a list of billers including the Biller ID, biller name
   and address, and payment delivery time.         Regarding the payment delivery time, this
   feature informs the payor how long it will take for the payment to be delivered.
   Payments to a payment card of a merchant, in accordance with one or more
 5 embodiments, are typically implemented in real time, or at least on the same day, seven
   days a week, as opposed to ACH payments which typically require at least two business
   days. This real time or same day aspect is advantageous for payments that are overdue or
   approaching overdue status.
10 In step 806, the payor 710 selects the correct biller (payee) from the returned list of
   billers, views the earliest delivery date, and enters the payment instructions, including the
   amount to pay. In step 808, the payment originator initiates a payment with MasterCard
   via a real-time API or batch file and provides the Biller ID, amount, sender's name, and
   sender's account number and/or invoice number. In step 810, MasterCard looks up the
15 Biller ID, biller name, or other suitable identifying information in a directory (e.g., 797)
   and retrieves the receiving payment card account for business 502. In step 812, assuming
   the payee is a business such as business 502, which has registered a payment card
   account for receiving payments, MasterCard initiates a payment to the card account over
   a suitable payment card processing network, such as network 2008 (e.g., BANKNET,
20 VISANET, or the like).
   In step 814, MasterCard returns an "approve" or "decline" response back to the on-line
   banking provider or the like 712, via a batch or real time API. In step 816, MasterCard
   optionally provides a payment notification to the aggregator or other third party partner
25 via a new MasterCard API or an existing batch process.           This payment notification
   includes the sender's name, sender's account number and/or invoice number, amount,
   and timestamp (date and time). In step 818, the aggregator notifies the business 502 in
   real time (e.g., via e-mail, text messaging, or in a transaction report) that the sender 710
   has made a payment; this notification includes, for example, the time, date, and amount.
                                                 46

   As noted above, not all embodiments utilize an aggregator; in some cases interaction is
   directly with BPPS-CPC 504. See discussion of payment detail file 707 below.
   For example, suppose a small painting contractor is utilizing an electronic invoicing
 5 application; the contractor accesses the electronic invoicing application on his or her
   smart phone and bills a homeowner $500 for painting a house. The homeowner can pay
   the invoice for $500 on-line and the small painting contractor receives real-time
   notification of payment via e-mail or text.
10 In one or more embodiments, BPPS-CPC 504 provides small businesses with faster
   receipt of payments and reconciliation of payments to improve cash flow and operational
   efficiencies. It allows small businesses to:
       *   Create and send invoices on the go using BPPS-CPC 504's service or the
15         business' existing tools;
       *   Allow customers to pay the way the customers choose (no need to shift consumer
           behavior);
       *   Collect real time guaranteed payments directly to the business' Commercial Debit
           Card account instead of receiving a paper check;
20     *   Benefit from automatic reconciliation that matches the payment to the invoice;
           and/or
       *   Obtain real-time notifications for when payments are received from the small
           business' customer.
25 Furthermore, in one or more embodiments, automatic payment reminders are sent for
   unpaid invoices.
   Consider a typical customer experience with one or more embodiments.           A small
   business learns about the service provided by the BPPS-CPC 504. The small business
                                                47

   signs up for the service on a web site associated with the BPPS-CPC 504; for example,
   by entering information associated with the small business and selecting appropriate
   options.   Options include, for example, whether it is desired to receive payments via
   ACH or by crediting a payment card account; whether invoicing is to be manual,
 5 electronic (e.g., e-mail), or via online banking (e.g., presentment functionality of an
   electronic BPPS). The small business will also enter the appropriate details associated
   with its chosen method of receiving payment (e.g., card account number, or bank account
   number and routing transit number (RTN)).        The sign-up is then confirmed, the card
   account or bank account is linked to the biller directory 797, and the small business is
10 assigned its Biller ID. In some instances, the small business is identified by a QR code or
   other one- or multi-dimensional bar code which can be included on its invoices.
   The small business may then invoice one of its customers using, for example, a smart
   phone (more generally, mobile) application.      Consider that a landscaper might visit a
15 customer's home while the customer is at work; complete the weekly landscaping work;
   create an invoice on the landscaper's mobile application, and then e-mail the invoice to
   the customer.
   The consumer may then pay for the business' services using on-line banking.             For
20 example, the consumer receives the e-mail from the landscaper, reviews the invoice
   details, logs onto an online banking site, and enters the landscaper's name into the biller
   lookup function. When the correct biller is returned, the consumer confirms same, enters
   the amount, and selects "make payment."       The financial institution offering online bill
   payment to the consumer debits the consumer's account and then initiates a transaction to
25 a suitable BPPS. The landscaper receives funds in real time into his commercial payment
   card account.    Optionally, the landscaper receives an SMS message, e-mail, or other
   indication of payment.
                                                48

   The small business may then match payment to invoices and view its income.              For
   example, the small business may download a payment details file 707 from the BPPS
   CPC 504 (directly or from optional entity 507 when present).         This file can then be
   uploaded into an accounting package, allowing payments to be validated against invoices.
 5 One or more embodiments can provide multiple payment details file formats for
   compatibility with multiple popular accounting packages.
   Consider that in one or more embodiments, network partners can be used to initiate
   payments that settle to a merchant's commercial debit card account. Exemplary funding
10 sources include mobile wallets, bank accounts, and payment card accounts of the payor.
   Channels include in-person, online, and mobile. Payment initiators include acquirers,
   retail banks, and treasury banks. In one or more embodiments, such initiators access a
   suitable BPPS with a biller directory 797 which in turn provides services such as payment
   routing, transaction details, and electronic or manual invoicing.        The BPPS causes
15 payment to the merchant's payment card account via "special" Transaction Type
   (DE3sfl) = "28" functionality as described above, or similar functionality.
   Note that in step 808 of FIG. 8, the payment originator initiates a payment to a Payee
   which payment is ultimately sent to the Payee's card account; however, the skilled artisan
20 will appreciate that in one or more embodiments, the card account is secret and not
   communicated to the originator - BPPS 1006 looks up the card account in biller directory
   797 based on Biller ID or the like.
   Currently in the US, a biller directory within MasterCard RPPS is used to route bill
25 payments electronically instead of the payment being cut to check. Today, treasury banks
   aggregate large business accounts and make account information available to payment
   providers. This is the only way businesses can participate in the directory today. Treasury
   banks have not found it worthwhile to aggregate small businesses.
                                               49

   When small businesses register either directly with BPPS-CPC 504 or through their
   existing back office solution such as accounting, bookkeeping, and/or customer
   relationship management software, they can enjoy the same benefits as large billers, such
   as online banking bill presentment, faster, guaranteed payments, and payment detail
 5 reports for easy payment reconciliation. By entering into appropriate agreements with
   suitable third-party companies to offer BPPS-CPC services, an existing Biller Directory
   can be quickly augmented.
   Real-time, guaranteed payments are delivered using special transactions as described
10 above to Commercial Debit Card accounts. Payments are posted to the business' account
   on authorization which provides the real-time payments capability. Special transactions
   as described above are irrevocable and the same as cash which eliminates the headaches
   of following up on customers' bounced check payments.
15 The Payment Provider initiates a payment using a BPPS such as RPPS to the small
   business including Biller ID, account #, and invoice #. The BPPS such as RPPS uses the
   Biller ID to look up the business' account information in the Biller Directory 797 or the
   like and then routes the payment to the business' card account real-time.
20 Some embodiments offer a direct to merchant solution by partnering with an entity that
   operates a BPPS 1006 and/or a payment card network 2008 with an entity that provides
   simple electronic invoicing.
   One or more embodiments provide one or more of the following benefits:
25
       *   Ability to create and send invoices
       *   Ability to get paid faster from customers while allowing customers to pay the way
           they choose
       *   Every payment is automatically matched to the invoice
                                                50

      *   Real-time notifications are provided when payments are received from customers
      *   Auto payment reminders are sent for unpaid invoices
      *   Ability to track incoming cash-flow position in real-time.
 5 Embodiments of the invention can be used in many different contexts.      One or more
   embodiments are believed to be particularly useful for small businesses that have these
   characteristics (although this is not a limitation):
       -  Generally a service based business
10     -  Receives payments after services are delivered
       -  Invoices its customers
       -  Receives paper check payments.
          Non-limiting examples of customers include:
15
       -  Healthcare
       -  Day care
       -  Small home/business service providers - landscapers, repairmen, cleaning
          services.
20
   In addition to providing value for small businesses, one or more embodiments also
   provide value for one or more of the following parties:
       1. Payment Providers: For example, Retail Banks and Third Party Payment Services
25        that print and mail checks today because they don't have information regarding
          how to route the payments electronically, will benefit from moving to electronic
          payments to payment cards. Additionally, payment providers can offer new
          services in accordance with aspects of the invention to their customers while
          adding new businesses to the biller directory.
                                                  51

       2. Commercial Debit Issuers: Debit Issuers who serve small businesses that process
           check payments deposited by their customers can benefit from better ways to
           serve the needs of their small business customers.
 5
       3. Consumers: Consumers who make payments with a bill payment provider
           utilizing BPPS-CPC 504 can make payments faster to companies, since the
           payments are made electronically instead of waiting 5 days for a check to be
           printed and mailed. This service is made available to consumers in one or more
10         embodiments and is transparent to the consumer.
   A small business' lifeblood relies on getting paid quickly and doing so with an efficient
   process.    The business' valuable time and resources need to focus on growing the
   business, not on time consuming tasks like creating and sending invoices, chasing down
15 customers for payments and manually reconciling payments to invoices.
   BPPS-CPC 504 increases the speed of the payment collection process and accessing
   income. With a simple registration process, businesses can deliver bills electronically
   and get paid electronically in real time to accelerate cash flow, reduce operational costs,
20 create billing and payment efficiencies by providing automatic invoice reconciliation, and
   improve customer's overall payment experience.         This service requires no technology
   integration, is cost effective, is easy to use and provides flexibility that allows customers
   to pay their bills.
25 One or more embodiments provide Simple Sign-up and Set-up. For example, in one or
   more embodiments:
       -   There are two set-up options - voice tutorial with step by step instruction, or an
           easy question and answer format.
                                                  52

      -    Business can create one or more invoice templates with its own customized logo,
           add drop down lists for common used goods and services, set its own payment
           terms, and choose from a list of common invoice layouts.
      -    Determine preferences for customer payment reminder alerts, notifications when
 5         customers pay the business, customize "thank you - payment received" customer
           notifications and cash-flow summary and detail reporting notifications.
      -    Work with the business'       existing bank account with its current financial
           institution.
10 One or more embodiments feature ease of use.             For example, in one or more
   embodiments:
   -  Business can easily send an invoice immediately after the goods and services are
      delivered. Sending an invoice takes less than 30 seconds (a non-limiting exemplary
15    value).
   -  Solution easily integrates with businesses contact list to quickly find the customer
      email address.
   -  Easy access is provided to both summary and detailed information on work
      performed but not invoiced, unpaid invoices, and paid invoices.
20 -  It is easy to change the business' preferences including invoice templates, logos,
      payment terms, modifying a drop down list for common goods and services, alerts,
      and notifications.
   -  Access is available from the business' personal computer (PC), laptop, or smart
      devices (tablets or smartphones), giving the business control over invoices and
25    payments anytime, anywhere, on any device.
   -  There is compatibility with business'        current bookkeeping method - making
      integration with business' existing systems and process easy through simple import
      and export features.
                                                53

   One or more embodiments allow businesses to be paid faster. Consider:
   -  Creating an invoice that is clear and easy to understand for the customer facilitates
      faster payment.
 5 -  Sending an invoice immediately after goods and services are performed facilitates
      faster payment.
   -  Setting up automatic payment reminders to customers for unpaid invoices facilitates
      faster payment.
   -  Providing the convenience to customers to pay the way they desire, makes it easier
10    for them to make payment and facilitates faster payment.            In one or more
      embodiments, payments are automatically deposited to the business' payment card
      account and the business is automatically notified with summary or detailed
      information on each payment. Three payment methods are supported in one or more
      embodiments:
15        -   Link provided in the invoice email for debit and credit card and electronic
              check
          -   At the customer's online bank site
          -   Traditional check in the mail
20 One or more embodiments advantageously allow a small business to save time and/or
   money; for example:
   -  One or more embodiments allow businesses to instantly create and send invoices
      electronically rather than spending numerous hours creating invoices and mailing
25    them.
   -  In one or more embodiments, payment reminders are automatically sent to customers
      so the business does not have to spend time pursuing customers for payment.
                                               54

   -   In one or more embodiments, every payment is automatically matched against the
       invoices and they are marked paid. All exceptions are provided to the business in an
       email for easy and quick resolution.
   -   One or more embodiments automatically generate real-time cash-flow reports on
 5     work performed but not invoiced, unpaid invoices, and paid invoices.
   -   Consider that with traditional check payments, a check must be printed and mailed to
       the business; the check must be received, manually reconciled, and deposited. This
       might take, for example, at least 2-3 days. The check might then be in clearing for
       another 2-3 days. Funds may not be available to the business until 7-10 days total
10     have elapsed, and if the check bounces, the consumer must be pursued and the entire
       process repeated. In one or more embodiments, payments are instant, guaranteed, and
       with real-time notification.
   Electronic bill payments and purchases currently require two transactions to move funds
15 from a buyer/payer to the merchant:
       *   Transaction 1: Financial institution (FI) debits funds from the buyer/payer's
           account (card, demand deposit account (DDA) - e.g., checking, check, cash)
       *   Transaction 2: FI settles funds with the merchant (check, ACH)
20
   In one or more embodiments, BPPS-CPC 504 does not impact Transaction 1. The buyer
   can continue to pay however the buyer chooses: card, online banking, or walk-in. In one
   or more embodiments, Transaction 2 leverages the special transaction discussed above
   for the second leg of the transaction to settle funds to the business (which process
25 currently happens by check and ACH).
   Many small business services are available today that provide e-invoicing with card
   acceptance. This solves only part of the challenge businesses have in managing their
   accounts receivable. BPPS-CPC 504 advantageously helps small businesses get faster
                                                55

   payments by providing guaranteed, electronic payments instead of paper checks and
   providing payment details to make matching invoices to payments fast and easy.
   In one or more embodiments, for a direct to small business tool:
 5
   -   Self Service tools are provided for small businesses to serve themselves easily and
       effectively through online tutorial videos, guides, and quick-help links embedded in
       all tasks.
   -   Automatically generated suggestions are provided based on feature use, trends, and
10     failed tasks.
   -   A community blog platform is provided where best practices and knowledge can be
       shared and problems solved between the small business users.
   -   Periodic small business user advisor conference calls provide direct input and
       suggestions for the invoice and payment tool. Regular "ride along" programs are
15     provided so that small businesses can see the tool in action, identify difficulties, and
       identify opportunities for enhancements.
   -   24/7 phone based, e-mail, and instant chat support is provided for all questions and
       problems.
20 In one or more embodiments, access to BPPS-CPC 504 is provided via a web site or
   mobile application, and support is provided via a web portal or customer service "contact
   us" feature.
   One or more embodiments of BPPS-CPC 504 advantageously provide the ability to
25 receive electronic payments and payment detail files 707 regardless of how the customer
   pays.
   Platform Development: a non-limiting exemplary embodiment integrates and extends
   existing components:
                                               56

               a. Small businesses who sign up on the web site of an electronic invoicing
                   company can be fed into the biller directory. The system is extended to
                   send and receive small business information from the Biller Directory and
                   BPPS such as RPPS as well as allowing for checks to be scanned in and
 5                 converted to reconciliation information, as well as using a BPPS such as
                   RPPS to create ACH payments.
               b. Existing BPPS functionality is leveraged and expanded for creating
                   invoices and feeding small businesses into the Biller Directory.
               c. The Biller Directory expands from receiving billers from issuers and/or
10                 aggregators to receiving new small business billers who sign up as per
                   points (a) and (b) above and/or other Small Business solutions, as well as
                   storing receiving card accounts.
               d. A BPPS such as RPPS will continue to route payments based on the biller
                   ID from the Biller Directory to the small business and provide payment
15                 details. Payment Details will be provided routed to invoicing systems to
                   present to the small business. The platform will be extended to feed small
                   businesses into the Biller Directory.
   Thus, one or more embodiments advantageously modify existing networks (e.g.,
20 BANKNET, RPPS), platforms, and technology infrastructure to provide a novel solution
   in accordance with aspects of the invention.        In some cases, registration is offered
   through trade associations and/or through retailers that cater to small businesses.
   Given the discussion thus far, it will be appreciated that, in general terms, an exemplary
25 method, according to an aspect of the invention, includes the step 604 of obtaining
   registration information for a plurality of businesses 502. One or more embodiments are
   particularly useful for small businesses, but this is not a limitation.     The registration
   information includes, for each given one of the businesses 502, at least a name of the
   given one of the businesses and a payment card account number for a payment card
                                                 57

   account in which the given one of the businesses can receive payments from customers
   via a special payment transaction over a payment card network.
   As seen in FIG. 5, registration can be direct, as shown at 508, or via a partner, as shown
 5 at 506, 510, 512. Registration can be carried out, for example, with real time API 509
   connecting BPPS 1006 having BPPS-CPC 504 to one of the partners; via batch; or direct
   with BPPS 1006 having BPPS-CPC 504 via GUI 999 or the like. In the former case (real
   time API 509 connecting to one of the partners), the partner may implement a GUI for
   interaction with the business.
10
   Note that regardless of whether registration is direct or via intermediaries, BPPS 1006
   having BPPS-CPC 504 eventually obtains the registration information.
   Again, note that examples are given with a BPPS 1006 having BPPS-CPC 504; however,
15 not all embodiments need necessarily have presentment functionality.
   A further step 704 (optionally combined into a single step with 703 when there is no
   intermediate payment provider 507) includes obtaining an electronic bill payment system
   instruction including at least an amount and a corresponding one of a plurality of
20 previously-assigned unique biller identifiers. This instruction is obtained by BPPS 1006
   having BPPS-CPC 504 from online banking provider 712, optionally via intermediary
   507, and is based on communication from payor 710 to online banking provider 712.
   Payor 712 is a customer of one of the plurality of businesses 502 which has been assigned
   the corresponding one of the unique biller identifiers. This instruction can be obtained
25 via interface functionality 995 which BPPS uses to receive electronic bill payment system
   instructions from entities such as 712 and/or 507.
   An even further step (e.g., 810) includes accessing a biller directory 797 including the
   registration information and the unique biller identifiers, based on the corresponding one
                                                58

   of the unique biller identifiers in the electronic bill payment system instruction, to
   retrieve the payment card account number for the payment card account for the one of the
   plurality of businesses 502 which has been assigned the corresponding one of the unique
   biller identifiers. This step can be carried out, for example, by using DBMS 799 to query
 5 directory 797.
   Yet a further step (e.g., 812) includes initiating a payment to the one of the plurality of
   small businesses 502 which has been assigned the corresponding one of the unique biller
   identifiers, for the amount, via the special payment transaction over the payment card
10 network, to the payment card account for the one of the plurality of small businesses
   which has been assigned the corresponding one of the unique biller identifiers, based on
   the retrieved payment card account number. This can be carried out by using payment
   card network interface 997 to send an appropriate message into payment card network
   2008 or another payment card network (e.g., BANKNET, VISANET, PIN Debit
15 networks such as NYCE, and the like).
   It is worth repeating that while one or more embodiments make use of both an electronic
   bill payment system such as BPPS 1006 and a payment card network such as 2008, the
   skilled artisan will appreciate that the two are conceptually different things. "Payment
20 card network" has been defined above. An electronic payment bill payment system such
   as BPPS 1006 allows people to specify payments to billers, typically settled by A CH type
   transfers from a deposit account. Pertinent formats, familiar to the skilled artisan,
   include NACHA ACH CCD, CCD+, CTX, RPPS proprietary format, and Visa ePay
   proprietary format.
25
   Note that US Patent Application Publication 2010-0100480 Al of Theresa Altman et al.
   (expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes) discloses an
   innovative technique for allowing users of an electronic payment bill payment system to
   pay billers using payment card accounts of the payors not the billers, by sending a non
                                                 59

   financial message through the electronic payment bill payment system, including the card
   number of the payor's card; the biller then charges the payor's card in a conventional
   manner. In contrast, one or more embodiments make a payment to the payment card
   account of the biller by having an entity such as BPPS-CPC receive an appropriate
 5 electronic bill payment system instruction, and then initiate a special payment transaction
   as described herein into a payment card network to make a payment to the payment card
   account of the biller.
   Some embodiments further include the affirmative step of assigning to each one of the
10 plurality of businesses a unique biller identifier; by MasterCard or a suitable partner, or
   by MasterCard or a suitable partner accepting a small business-generated unique biller
   identifier such as an e-mail address or the like. The assigned unique biller identifiers are
   stored in directory 797 together with other pertinent data, for example, and are published
   to the appropriate party(ies).
15
   Thus, in one or more embodiments, an aggregator registers a small business with
   MasterCard via real time API 509 and the small business is afforded an option to receive
   payments to the small business' payment card account via a special transaction as
   described herein. The Biller ID is provided back in real time via the API, or if generated
20 by the small business, a confirmation that the ID is acceptable provided back in real time
   via the API.
   Further, in one or more embodiments, the payor can see how long payment will take;
   many payments are instantaneous or nearly so; small businesses who want to receive card
25 payments via a special transaction will be in the biller directory 797; when payment is
   dispatched, MasterCard will notify an aggregator via the new API and then the
   aggregator notifies the small business.
                                                60

   In some instances, as noted above, the step of obtaining the registration information for
   the plurality of businesses includes an electronic bill payment system operator obtaining
   the information directly.     In some cases, the electronic bill payment system operator
   generates at least a portion of the plurality of unique biller identifiers.
 5
   In some instances, as noted above, the step of obtaining the registration information for
   the plurality of businesses includes an electronic bill payment system operator obtaining
   the information indirectly from a third party partner.        In some cases, the third party
   partner generates at least a portion of the plurality of unique biller identifiers.
10
   In some embodiments,         at least some of the pluralities of businesses generate
   corresponding ones of the plurality of unique biller identifiers (e.g., e-mail addresses of
   corresponding ones of the plurality of businesses). A mix and match approach can be
   taken in some instances, wherein unique biller identifiers can be generated by the
15 electronic bill payment system operator, the third party partner(s), and/or the businesses.
   In some cases, a further step includes sharing the registration information with at least
   one payment provider associated with the electronic bill payment system to facilitate the
   plurality of businesses providing the unique biller identifiers to the customers on
20 invoices.    For example, if the ID is an email address such as "payments at
   chesterfieldlandscaping dot com," the biller's printed or electronic invoice would say "To
   pay by online banking, when prompted for company identifier, pay to payments at
   chesterfieldlandscaping dot com." Again, to avoid inclusion of browser-executable code,
   the "@" sign is rendered as " at " and ".com" is rendered as " dot com."
25
   In some instances, the payment card account for the one of the plurality of businesses
   includes a debit card account linked to a demand deposit account (of the business) at a
   financial institution.
                                                  61

   As noted, initiating the payment via the special payment transaction can include, for
   example, initiating an ISO-8583 message type 0100 transaction type DE3sfl = 28
   message over the payment card network or initiating an ISO-8583 message type 0200
   transaction type DE3sfl = 28 message over the payment card network.
 5
   In another aspect, another exemplary method includes the step 604 of obtaining
   registration information for a plurality of businesses.       The registration information
   includes, for each given one of the businesses, at least a name of the given one of the
   businesses and a specification of a payment method by which the given one of the
10 businesses desires to receive payments from customers. The payment method may be
   conventional or may be a special payment transaction over a payment card network as
   described herein. The registration information is obtained by an electronic bill payment
   system (e.g., 1006 with BPPS-CPC 504) from a third party partner (e.g., 510, 506 by way
   of a non-limiting example) via a real-time application program interface 509. A further
15 step 606 includes confirming registration of each given one of the plurality of businesses,
   from the electronic bill payment system, back to the third party partner, via the real-time
   application program interface.
   An optional further step 816 includes providing payment notification from the electronic
20 bill payment system, back to the third party partner, via the real-time application program
   interface.
   Although many online bill payments are made electronically today by ACH to larger
   businesses, many online bill payments continue to be made by check to small and
25 medium size businesses. Online bill payment providers mail checks to businesses when
   there is no bank account information available to route the bill payment electronically by
   ACH. Small and medium size businesses receiving check payments undergo a laborious
   process to process and reconcile the check payments. Due to delays in processing, some
   checks fail to clear, which requires the business to contact the customer to request
                                               62

   another payment. This invention provides an instant payment mechanism utilizing the
   card network(s) that replaces the more costly, manual check payment process. A business
   registers its card account into a directory that is used to route online bill payments
   electronically directly into the business' account. Associated services are provided for
 5 business to register their account number, for payers to validate the payment, and for
   payment routing.
   System and Article of Manufacture Details
10 Embodiments of the invention can employ hardware and/or hardware and software
   aspects. Software includes but is not limited to firmware, resident software, microcode,
   etc. FIG. 10 presents an exemplary software architecture diagram. BPPS 1006 includes
   conventional bill presentment and payment functionality, as well as BPPS-CPC 504.
   Also included are a database management system (DBMS) 799 to access biller directory
15 797; novel real-time API 509 (one or more APIs) to provide an interface with third party
   partners; a graphical user interface (GUI) 999 to provide an interface with users (other
   kinds of interfaces can also be employed); and a payment card network interface 997 to
   interface with a payment card network such as 2008 or other payment card network.
   Interface 997 could be a front end communications processor such as a MASTERCARD
20 INTERFACE PROCESSORTM               or MIPTM processor     (trademarks   of MasterCard
   International, Inc. of Purchase, New York). The user interface can be implemented, for
   example, via a user interface module. The module can include a graphical user interface
   (GUI), such as that formed by a server (e.g., system 900 discussed below) serving out
   hypertext markup language (HTML) code to a browser of a user (system 900 is also
25 representative of a computing device of a user).        Also included in one or more
   embodiments is a payment instruction interface 995 which receives electronic bill
   payment system instructions from entities 712 and/or 507.
                                               63

   Software might be employed, for example, in connection with one or more of BPPS 1006
   and its components; a terminal 122, 124, 125, 126; a reader 132; a host, server, and/or
   processing center 140, 142, 144 (optionally with data warehouse 154) of a merchant,
   issuer, acquirer, processor, other third party described herein, or operator of a network
 5 2008; and the like.    Firmware might be employed, for example, in connection with
   payment devices such as cards 102, 112, as well as reader 132.
   FIG. 9 is a block diagram of a system 900 that can implement part or all of one or more
   aspects or processes of the invention. As shown in FIG. 9, memory 930 configures the
10 processor 920 (which could correspond, e.g., to processor portions 106, 116, 130; a
   processor of a terminal or a reader 132; processors of remote hosts in centers 140, 142,
   144; processors of hosts and/or servers implementing BPPS 1006 and its components;
   processors of hosts and/or servers of other parties described herein; and the like);   to
   implement one or more aspects of the methods, steps, and functions disclosed herein
15 (collectively, shown as process 980 in FIG. 9). Different method steps can be performed
   by different processors. The memory 930 could be distributed or local and the processor
   920 could be distributed or singular.     The memory 930 could be implemented as an
   electrical, magnetic or optical memory, or any combination of these or other types of
   storage devices (including memory portions as described above with respect to cards 102,
20 112).   It should be noted that if distributed processors are employed, each distributed
   processor that makes up processor 920 generally contains its own addressable memory
   space.    It should also be noted that some or all of computer system 900 can be
   incorporated into an application-specific or general-use integrated circuit. For example,
   one or more method steps could be implemented in hardware in an ASIC (application
25 specific integrated circuit) or FPGA (field programmable gate array) rather than using
   firmware.    Display 940 is representative of a variety of possible input/output devices
   (e.g., displays, printers, keyboards, mice, touch screens, touch pads, and so on).
   Furthermore, system 900 is also generally representative of a mobile device such as a
   tablet or "smart" phone, in which case input/output will typically be via a touch screen
                                                64

   (possibly with a small keyboard) and communications to and from a network will be via
   cellular telephone or Wi-Fi connection.
   As is known in the art, part or all of one or more aspects of the methods and apparatus
 5 discussed herein may be distributed as an article of manufacture that itself comprises a
   tangible computer readable recordable storage medium having computer readable code
   means embodied thereon. The computer readable program code means is operable, in
   conjunction with a computer system, to carry out all or some of the steps to perform the
   methods or create the apparatuses discussed herein. A computer-usable medium may, in
10 general, be a recordable medium (e.g., floppy disks, hard drives, compact disks,
   EEPROMs, or memory cards) or may be a transmission medium (e.g., a network
   comprising fiber-optics, the world-wide web, cables, or a wireless channel using time
   division multiple access, code-division multiple access, or other radio-frequency
   channel). Any medium known or developed that can store information suitable for use
15 with a computer system may be used.         The computer-readable code means is any
   mechanism for allowing a computer to read instructions and data, such as magnetic
   variations on a magnetic medium or height variations on the surface of a compact disk.
   The medium can be distributed on multiple physical devices (or over multiple networks).
   For example, one device could be a physical memory media associated with a terminal
20 and another device could be a physical memory media associated with a processing
   center.   As used herein, a tangible computer-readable recordable storage medium is
   defined to encompass a recordable medium (non-transitory storage), examples of which
   are set forth above, but does not encompass a transmission medium or disembodied
   signal.
25
   The computer systems and servers described herein each contain a memory that will
   configure associated processors to implement the methods, steps, and functions disclosed
   herein. Such methods, steps, and functions can be carried out, by way of example and not
   limitation, by processing capability on one, some, or all of elements 122, 124, 125, 126,
                                               65

    140, 142, 144, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010; on a computer implementing BPPS 1006 and its
   components; on processors of hosts and/or servers of other parties described herein; and
   the like.    The memories could be distributed or local and the processors could be
   distributed or singular. The memories could be implemented as an electrical, magnetic or
 5 optical memory, or any combination of these or other types of storage devices.
   Moreover, the term "memory" should be construed broadly enough to encompass any
   information able to be read from or written to an address in the addressable space
   accessed by an associated processor. With this definition, information on a network is
   still within a memory because the associated processor can retrieve the information from
10 the network.
   Thus, elements of one or more embodiments of the invention, such as, for example, 122,
    124, 125, 126, 140, 142, 144, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010; a computer implementing BPPS
    1006 and its components; on processors of hosts and/or servers of other parties described
15 herein; and the like, can make use of computer technology with appropriate instructions
   to implement method steps described herein.      Some aspects can be implemented, for
   example, using one or more servers which include a memory and at least one processor
   coupled to the memory. The memory could load appropriate software. The processor
   can be operative to perform one or more method steps described herein or otherwise
20 facilitate their performance.
   Accordingly, it will be appreciated that one or more embodiments of the invention can
   include a computer program comprising computer program code means adapted to
   perform one or all of the steps of any methods or claims set forth herein when such
25 program is run on a computer, and that such program may be embodied on a computer
   readable medium.       Further, one or more embodiments of the present invention can
   include a computer comprising code adapted to cause the computer to carry out one or
   more steps of methods or claims set forth herein, together with one or more apparatus
   elements or features as depicted and described herein.
                                               66

   As used herein, including the claims, a "server" includes a physical data processing
   system (for example, system 900 as shown in FIG. 9) running a server program. It will
   be understood that such a physical server may or may not include a display, keyboard, or
 5 other input/output components. A "host" includes a physical data processing system (for
   example, system 900 as shown in FIG. 9) running an appropriate program.
   Furthermore, it should be noted that any of the methods described herein can include an
   additional step of providing a system comprising distinct software modules embodied on
10 one or more tangible computer readable storage media. All the modules (or any subset
   thereof) can be on the same medium, or each can be on a different medium, for example.
   The modules can include any or all of the components shown in the figures. Referring
   again to FIG. 10, in one or more embodiments, the modules include a database module
   799 accessing a biller directory 797 stored in persistent storage, a BPPS-CPC module to
15 implement BPPS-CPC 504, a GUI module to implement GUI 999; a module or modules
   with code to implement one or more APIs, and/or one or more modules implementing
   conventional BPPS functionality (omitted from FIG. 10 to avoid clutter). The database
   module can include, for example, a (relational, graphical, or other) database management
   system (DBMS) 799 which provides access to database 797 via queries and the like. A
20 MIP is a front-end communications processor that is placed on-site at a MasterCard
   customer's facility by MasterCard for the purpose of providing access to the BANKNET
   telecommunication network. A MIP is a special case of a TMIP. When interface 997 is
   implemented as a MIP, for example, it may be on a separate hardware processor from
   BPPS 1006 and may communicate therewith via a suitable network.               Appropriate
25 software modules may run on the MIP. Note that in at least some embodiments, since
   transactions are initiated to the BPPS which submits transactions on BankNet, VisaNet or
   other payment card network, a MIP at a customer is not needed. In some cases, software
   modules and/or a network interface card or the like are provided on the same machine as
   BPPS 1006 to interface with the payment card network. The method steps can, in any
                                               67

   event, be carried out using the distinct software modules of the system, as described
   above, executing on the one or more hardware processors. Further, a computer program
   product can include a tangible computer-readable recordable storage medium with code
   adapted to be executed to carry out one or more method steps described herein, including
 5 the provision of the system with the distinct software modules.
   Thus, aspects of the invention can be implemented, for example, by one or more
   appropriately programmed general purpose computers, such as, for example, servers,
   mobile devices, or personal computers, located at one or more of the entities in the
10 figures, as well as within the payment network 2008 and/or payment system 1006. Such
   computers can be interconnected, for example, by one or more of payment network 2008,
   another VPN, the Internet, a local area and/or wide area network (LAN and/or WAN), via
   an EDI layer, and so on. Note that element 2008 represents both the network and its
   operator.    The computers can be programmed, for example, in compiled, interpreted,
15 object-oriented, assembly, and/or machine languages, for example, one or more of C,
   C++, Java, Visual Basic, COBOL, Assembler, Structured Query Language (SQL), and
   the like (an exemplary and non-limiting list), and can also make use of, for example,
   Extensible Markup Language (XML), known application programs such as relational
   database applications (e.g., IBM DB2@ software available from International Business
20 Machines Corporation, Armonk, NY, US; SAS@ software available from SAS Institute,
   Inc., Cary, NC, US), spreadsheets (e.g., MICROSOFT EXCEL@ software available from
   Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, US), and the like.            The computers can be
   programmed to implement the logic and/or data flow depicted in the figures. In some
   instances, messaging and the like may be in accordance with the International
25 Organization for Standardization (ISO) Specification 8583 Financial transaction card
   originated messages -       Interchange message specifications and/or the ISO 20022 or
   UNIFI Standard for Financial Services Messaging, also incorporated herein by reference
   in its entirety for all purposes.  In one or more embodiments, some messages may be in
   accordance with NACHA Automated Clearing House (ACH) rules and regulations.
                                                68

   Although illustrative embodiments of the invention have been described herein with
   reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not
   limited to those precise embodiments, and that various other changes and modifications
 5 may be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the
   invention.
   Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context requires
   otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and "comprising",
10 will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers
   or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps.
   The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived from
   it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an
15 acknowledgment or admission or any form of suggestion that that prior publication (or
   information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general
