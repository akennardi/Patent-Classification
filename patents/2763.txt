                                             ABSTRACT
A system and method of assembling flanged duct sections, using large sheet metal screws
through opposing inserted corner plates. The large screws are threadedly inserted fully through
the corner plates of a first duct section and hold perpendicular thereto for guiding alignment with
the mating duct section. The screws hold the duct sections apart to allow aligning them without
fluid sealant or tape gasket material on one of the duct sections contacting the other. The screws
are then threadedly engaged with the corner plates of the mating duct section, bringing the duct
sections together with a leak resistant seal therebetween. Optional hanger brackets can be placed
between the corner plates before assembly, and additional screws used to deform the flanges and
corner plates about the brackets to compress the sealant or gasket thereabout.

             SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR JOINING AND HANGING DUCTS
                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001] This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, itself a
divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2014209371, the entire contents of
which are incorporated herein by reference.
[0002] This application claims the benefit of US Provisional application No. 61/757,005, filed
January 25, 2013.
[0003] This invention relates generally to a system and method for joining and hanging ducts, and
more particularly, for assembling duct sections into larger ducts using inserted corner plates, and
hanging the duct sections by connection to the corner plates.
                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0004]   U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/757,005, filed Jan. 25, 2013, is incorporated herein
by reference in its entirety.
[0005] It is well known in the HVAC (Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning) industry that
manufacturing improvements in Mechanical Contractor duct shops have been highly automated
through the use of automatic plasma cutting tables for making fittings, automatic coil processing
lines for making rectangular duct, automatic seamer machines for closing duct seams and
automatic duct flange corner plate inserter machines for inserting and crimping duct section
flange corner plates securely in duct section end flanges. Round and oval duct sections are
automated with machinery as well.
[0005a] Prior Art documents evidencing representative known inserted corner plates and related
flanges and other apparatus, are shown in Heilman et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,466,641 and Fischer et
al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,375. Representative known integral duct section

                                   -2
     flanges and inserted corner plates are shown in Goodhue
     US Pat. No.    5,321,880.  Fischer et al. U.S. Pat. Nos.
     6,460,573 and 6,810,570 teach fasteners through corner
     plates and through integral duct flanges and
 5   respectively threading screws through corner plates and
     flanges.    Fischer U.S. Pat. No.   8,172,280 discloses
     further improvements to inserted corner plates by
     providing pre-formed holes for threadedly receiving
     fasteners, which reduce required threading force.
10    [0006]     It  is also well known in the industry that
     improvements are needed for field installation of duct
     sections on the    job sites. Many Mechanical Contractors
     are preassembling duct sections in shops and shipping
     them to the    job site in multiple section assemblies
15   wherever possible in order to control costs by reducing
     labor and improving quality.     As  an illustrative
     example, for some commercial installations, such as
     sports arenas, halls, auditoriums, large factories,
     malls, etc.,    it can be advantageous to pre-assemble
20   several duct sections on the floor or ground, then lift
     or hoist them as an assembly, e.g.,     25 or more feet     in
     length, to a ceiling area that can be quite high, for
     example, 30 to 40    feet above the floor, or higher.       The
     workers will then assemble them to an existing duct
25   system already in place.     Moving such large assemblies
     at such elevations can be imprecise, and is      often
     accomplished by workers at an opposite end of the
     assembly pushing and/or pulling that end, to achieve
     precise placement and alignment of the end to be
30   assembled with existing ducts.
      [0007]     Presently, aligning flanged duct sections is
     typically done by inserting drift pins through holes in

  WO 2014/116820                                 PCT/US2014/012738
                                 -3
     the inserted corner plates when the duct is  lifted or
     placed into close proximity with duct sections already
     positioned or hanging in place.  A sticky adhesive
     gasket is typically adhered to one duct section and if
 5   the gasket is adhered to the other section while the
     sections are improperly or mis-aligned, the gasket is
     often difficult to detach and can be ruined, requiring
     removal and application of a new gasket, which is costly
     and time consuming. Disturbing the gasket causes
10   openings and creates leakage problems.  If this happens,
     more time and costs are incurred to repair the   leaks
     adding to time required and worker frustration.    A
     problem encountered when attempting to avoid premature
     adhesion is that the drift pins, while useful for
15   general aligning, because of their tapered shape and the
     presence of the gasket between the duct sections,
     typically do not facilitate final close alignment of the
     duct sections for final assembly, and provide little or
     no ability to hold the duct sections apart while not yet
20   fully aligned to allow workers to manually align the
     duct sections, such that unintentional gasket contact
     and adhesion can occur.  Application of adhesive tape
     gasket is cumbersome as the tape is more readily applied
     with the duct section placed on the floor or ground in a
25   vertical position with one flanged end down and the end
     to which the tape gasket is to be applied up.   The top
     end is then taped with the gasket round about the duct
     section flange using gravity to help hold the tape in
     place on the flange.  For a conventional duct section
30   five feet long, this requires the taping process to be
     done at eye level for most workers.  The tape gasket

  WO 2014/116820                                       PCT/US2014/012738
                                     -4
     must be bent sharply around the      inserted corner plate
     area of the flanged end of the duct section.
      [0008]        As noted above, for some applications at some
     point in the assembly process there are often several
 5   assembled duct sections on the floor or ground, that
     must be      lifted to assemble to a duct system in a ceiling
     area that can be 30-40      feet or higher above the floor or
     ground      (e.g., in a sports arena or auditorium, factory,
     etc.).       To apply the tape with the duct section
10   horizontal risks the tape falling off the flange if
     adequate adhesion isn't achieved, e.g.,       due to an
     unclean surface or during cold conditions where the
     adhesion is poor, etc.       This problem is worsened at the
     tightly bent portions of tape placed around the inserted
15   corner plate area.       The tape gasket has a certain amount
     of memory for successful gasket performance requirements
     which adds to the possibility of movement and loosening
     especially at the bent areas of the gasket.
      [0009]        Once the duct sections are positioned in end
20   to end relationship, finally aligned and brought
     together, as additional steps, clamps are typically
     applied to the flanges to hold them together in the
     aligned condition, and the drift pins are removed.            Once
     the clamps are in place and the drift pins are removed,
25   the drift pins are replaced by bolts       (typically carriage
     bolts) through the corner plates, washers are placed
     over the bolts, and nuts threadedly engaged with the
     bolts to fasten the duct sections together through the
     corner plates.       Only one fastener is typically used
30   through one hole through each inserted corner plate and
     passes through only the corner plates.        After the corner

  WO 2014/116820                                        PCT/US2014/012738
                                      -5
     plate bolts are tightened, typically clips        are securely
     installed using a tool to manipulate them over the outer
     edges of the duct section flanges in spaced relation to
     hold the duct section flanges forcibly against each
 5   other to provide a sealed connection.         Two inch pressure
     class and lower SMACNA rated duct sections are sometimes
     fastened together with Tek screws drilled through the
     mating flanges.       Higher pressure class duct sections are
     limited to spaced apart clip connections along mating
10   duct section flanges.        Observed shortcomings of this
     manner of final duct assembly include that the component
     parts are costly and must be maintained in inventory, it
     requires substantial labor,        and is time consuming.
     There is      also an attendant possibility of danger when
15   assembly is done at ceiling level, of dropping component
     parts,      so as to injure persons or equipment below.        In
     this latter regard, conventional known clips used to
     clamp the flanges are known to slide down and fall from
     the ducts.
20    [0010]        Fastening the assembled duct sections using
     Tek screws or other sheet metal        screws has the desirable
     advantage of eliminating clips.         However, presently when
     using Tek screws,      it is  still required to have the
     mating flanges clamped or otherwise forceably held
25   together.       This is because if a threaded fastener is
     threadedly engaged with two spaced apart flanges
     simultaneously and rotated, the fastener will pass
     through the two flanges at the same rate and will not
     bring them together.       To bring the flanges together,        if
30   the fastener is not threaded all of the way to the head,
     the flange closer to the head of the        screw will have to

  WO 2014/116820                                     PCT/US2014/012738
                                   -6
     reach a space between the endmost thread and the head of
     the fastener, or,    if the fastener is threaded all of the
     way to the head, the threads of the fastener or the
     flange closer to the head will have to be     sufficiently
 5   obliterated, such that threaded progression through that
     flange will halt during the rotation and the other
     flange will continue its threaded progression toward the
     closer flange to bring them together.      Shortcomings of
     fastening in this manner include that     it is  imprecise,
10   and if the space between the head of the fastener and
     the endmost thread is too small to accommodate the
     closer flange, part of the threads will still have to be
     obliterated, and if the space is greater than the
     thickness of the two flanges and any gasket or sealant
15   between them, the fastener may not bring the flanges
     close enough together to achieve the required seal.          As
     another possible shortcoming, use of battery operated
     tools is    currently popular for assembling ducts, and if
     the fastener is threadedly engaged with the flanges
20   using a battery operated driver, the energy consumed to
     provide the torque required to rotate the fastener while
     threadedly engaged with the two flanges, and to
     obliterate the metal threads, will shorten battery life,
     requiring additional batteries, more frequent charging
25   and related inconvenience and expense.
      [0011]      Addressing hanging ducts, in one
     representative manner of hanging, trapeze style hanger
     supports are positioned below the duct sections with
     standard overhead threaded rods placed through the
30   trapeze style hanger supports for larger duct sections
     by putting nuts and washers     above and below the threaded

  WO 2014/116820                                        PCT/US2014/012738
                                       -7
     hanger      support and tightening them in place.     When
     installing, the duct must be lifted, e.g.,        about an inch
     or so, above its final position so that the trapeze
     support hangers can be        fastened in place, and the duct
 5   is   lowered onto the support.       For smaller lighter ducts,
     slide lock clamps and cables are used by wrapping the
     cables around the duct and overhead supports such as
     beams or structures.        Flat metal strips are also used to
     support      and hang duct sections.    As an observed
10   shortcoming of use of hanger cables wrapped directly
     about the ducts,       it has been found that normal
     operational vibration of the duct can cause the cable to
     "saw" or      "cut" into the duct walls resulting in the
     problem of leakage.        As  a manner of reducing complexity
15   of hanging, it would be desirable to incorporate hangers
     into the duct assembly, and more particularly to attach
     hangers to the flanges of the duct sections as they are
     assembled so that the hangers will be        located over and
     directly support the assembled duct joints.          However,
20   with the current manner of duct assembly involving steps
     of aligning and bringing together with drift pins,
     clamping, removing the drift pins, then inserting bolts
     through the holes, it would be difficult to incorporate
     addition of hangers, as inserting them between clamped
25   flanges would be difficult, and they would have to be
     blindly aligned with the holes through which the bolts
     are inserted.       If  it is  attempted to place the hangers
     on the drift pins prior to assembly, there is nothing to
     hold the hangers on the smooth tapered length of the
30   drift pins, and the weight of the hangers can cause the
     drift pins to tilt down and increase the difficulty of

  WO 2014/116820                                       PCT/US2014/012738
                                     -8
     properly aligning the duct sections.        There is the
     possibility of placement of the hangers on the ends of
     the bolts after passage through the crimped flanges and
     the inserted corner plates,        but then the hangers may
 5   interfere with crimped edges of the associated flanges,
     and/or require an additional nut for securing.          The
     crimp may also be poorly done and loosen under load.
      [0012]       As another issue for consideration, smaller
     duct sections are often used at locations in duct
10   systems     farther from the larger supply duct sections and
     are typically connected to the larger duct sections by
     transitioning from flanged ducts to slip- and drive-on
     connections.      Flanged ducts are flanged top and bottom
     and on both sides.      The flanges may be integrally formed
15   or slide on style.      As many duct sections as are
     practical to lift into position safely are often pre
     connected at floor level to provide better access to and
     control of the connection process and efficiency.
     Difficult to reach flange connections are more
20   accessible with the use of magnetic socket wrenches and
     extensions that are power driven rotationally.          Job site
     conditions such as stored materials for other
     contractors often make it desirable to get the duct
     sections in place as quickly as possible for safety and
25   efficiency, and to avoid and reduce delays and
     interruptions of other job site work.        In this regard,
     scheduling duct section lifting and hanging is often
     also difficult due to other job site work, e.g.,
     presence of contractors such as plumbers, electricians
30   and others needing the same work space.
      [0013]       Thus, what is  sought is  a manner of assembling
     and hanging duct sections using inserted corner plates,
     that is more efficient      and productive, particularly in
     terms of field or job-site assembly,       simpler, and easier

                                    -9
     than known methods and systems, and overcomes one or
     more of the    shortcomings and limitations set forth
     above.
 5   Summary Of The Invention
      [0014]      What is disclosed is a system and method of
     assembling and optionally hanging duct sections using
     inserted corner plates,    that is more efficient and
     productive,    simpler, and easier than known methods and
10   systems,    and overcomes one or more of the shortcomings
     and limitations set forth above.
      [0015]      According to a preferred aspect of the
     invention, the system and method of assembling duct
     sections uses large sheet metal    screws of the invention
15   through alignable holes through opposing inserted corner
     plates of the duct sections, with as few as one large
     sheet metal    screw per corner plate.  The large   screws
     are first threadedly engaged with holes through inserted
     corner plates of a first of the duct sections to be
20   assembled.     The screws are specially configured
     according to the    invention so that when fully received
     in the holes through the corner plates of the first duct
     section, the large screws project outwardly therefrom
     and are robustly self holding in substantially
25   perpendicular relation thereto, along a predetermined
     alignment axis through the hole, so as to be usable for
     aligning the two duct sections.     The screws are also
     configured to be used to initially contact the      inserted
     corner plates of the second duct section in a manner to
30   hold the two duct sections apart    sufficiently such that
     any gasket or sealant on flanges of one of the duct
     sections is prevented from contacting and adhering to
     flanges of the other, to allow final alignment.       This
     contact can be made without threaded engagement with
35   holes through the corner plates of the second duct

  WO 2014/116820                                       PCT/US2014/012738
                                     -10
     section,      or only partial engagement of the thread with
     the holes through the      second corner plates,   so as to
     allow relative movement and realigning as required to
     achieve the desired final positioning.        Once final
 5   alignment is     achieved, the   large screws are threadedly
     engaged with the holes through the corner plates of the
     second duct section to bring together and assemble the
     duct sections.      As the flanges of the duct sections are
     brought together to close the gap therebetween, the
10   sealant     or gasket is compressed to form a sealed
     condition between the flanges.        Additional screws or
     other fasteners can then be used as required at other
     locations on the assembled        mating flanges, particularly
     for larger ducts, to strengthen and stiffen the assembly
15   and compress the     sealant or gasket in areas spaced from
     the corner plates.      As  an additional feature, a dimple
     or hole pattern can be provided in the flanges and
     fasteners used in association therewith for increasing
     strength of the assembly.       The screws  also won't slide
20   such as clips often do.
      [0016]       As an advantage, duct sections, including
     preassembled longer duct sections comprising several
     individual duct sections, can be       aligned for assembly
     without risk of being adhered together when misaligned.
25   As   another advantage, the duct sections are securely
     brought together and assembled quickly and easily, with
     just the large screws through the inserted corner
     plates, with no need for hand threading of nuts         onto
     screws or bolts, dropped nuts or washers, and other
30   related problems.
      [0017]       As another advantage, the large   size of the
     screws enable them to replace drift pins currently used
     for aligning.      The screws, because they are self holding
     in fixed relation projecting from the first duct section
35   when fully received in the holes of the corner plates

  WO 2014/116820                                      PCT/US2014/012738
                                    -11
     thereof can be used both to hold the duct sections apart
     for initial aligning, and then to guide the bringing
     together of the duct sections.       Then, the screws when
     threadedly engaged with the corner plates of the second
 5   duct section, provide a force to bring the duct sections
     together, as well as holding strength when the duct
     sections are finally assembled.
      [0018]       According to another preferred aspect of the
     invention, the corner plates and large screws are
10   configured to function together as a system.        In this
     regard, the opposing inserted corner plates have
     preformed holes of a size and shape for threadedly
     receiving the large screws, respectively, and positioned
     so as to be aligned when the associated duct sections
15   are positioned for assembly.       The corner plates   also
     have a predetermined thickness measured through the
     preformed holes.      The large screws have an elongate
     shank with an enlarged head at one end and a tip at the
     opposite end.      The shanks of the screws each have a
20   threaded portion adjacent to the tip configured for
     threaded engagement with a selected hole of a corner
     plate.      The threaded portion terminates at an endmost
     thread located a predetermined distance from the head
     about equal to the predetermined thickness      of the corner
25   plate through the hole, bounding and defining a space
     between the endmost thread and the screw head configured
     to receive the corner plate when the      screw is fully
     received in the hole.      The endmost thread is also
     preferably specially configured, along with the head of
30   the screw, to cooperate with a corner plate in which the
     screw is     fully received, such that the screw will be
     securely self-holding in a substantially perpendicular
     orientation relative to an adjacent surface of the
     corner plate, and also substantially coaxial with a
35   predetermined alignment axis through the hole, and the

  WO 2014/116820                                      PCT/US2014/012738
                                    -12
     screw can rotate within the hole.       As a functional
     example of the utility of this latter capability, the
     screw can be rotated within the corner plate of the
     first duct section as the screw is threadedly engaged
 5   with the corner plate of the second duct section to
     bring the duct sections together.
      [0019]       As an additional preferred feature and
     advantage of the     invention, the  special configuration of
     the endmost thread is also operable to prevent, or
10   obstruct or interfere with, re-engagement of the thread
     with the corner plate.      In its simplest form, this
     special     configuration includes a surface on the endmost
     thread bounding the space between the head and endmost
     thread, which is at least generally parallel to the
15   opposing surface of the head and is shaped so as to
     partially obstruct the groove between the endmost thread
     and the next     adjacent thread of the threaded portion of
     the screw to prevent re-entry of the corner plate into
     the groove.      As another non-limiting example, the
20   endmost thread can extend into the groove toward the
     next adjacent thread head at a steeper angle than the
     normal pitch angle of the thread.       As another example,
     the end of the endmost thread can have bulbous or
     similar shape that prevents re-engagement of the thread,
25   such as a teardrop or partial teardrop shape.        As a non
     limiting example, to provide the above capabilities, a
     substantial portion, e.g.,      20 to 40 percent of the
     endmost thread can be generally flat and parallel to the
     opposing surface of the head, and bounds the space so as
30   to form a bearing surface for opposing forces exerted
     between the endmost thread and an opposing surface of a
     corner plate located in the adjacent space, that
     combined with forces exerted between the opposite
     surface of the corner plate and the screw head, will be
35   sufficient to hold the screw in the desired

  WO 2014/116820                                      PCT/US2014/012738
                                    -13
     substantially perpendicular orientation relative to the
     corner plate under anticipated conditions, e.g.,        forces
     exerted thereagainst by movements of the duct sections
     for aligning them for assembly.
 5    [0020]       According to another preferred aspect of the
     invention, the pitch of the thread is      about equal to the
     thickness of the respective corner plates measured
     through the holes, and the holes of the corner plates
     are shaped, such that the screws      can be tilted at a
10   small approach angle relative to the corner plate of the
     first duct section, and also the alignment axis through
     the hole therethrough, to engage the thread with that
     corner plate such that the thread of the screw can pass
     through the hole of that corner plate without the corner
15   plate itself being pre-threaded or the screw thread
     forceably cutting a new thread or otherwise deforming a
     surface of the corner plate adjacent or about the hole.
     This is     also advantageous as it reduces or can virtually
     eliminate the torque necessary for threading the screw
20   through the plate to save energy when a battery powered
     driver     is used.  The insertion is  capable of being done
     very quickly, saving labor.       As an additional feature,
     when the endmost thread has passed or passes through the
     corner plate, the head of the screw will abut, or be
25   close to and directly face, the      surface of the corner
     plate about or adjacent to the hole, to cause the screw
     to automatically transition to and maintain the
     perpendicular orientation relative to the plate even
     under the lateral     loading conditions anticipated to be
30   encountered from relative movements of the duct sections
     being assembled, so as to be useful as a guide for
     aligning the duct sections.
      [0021]       In regard to transitioning of the screw from
     the tilted to the perpendicular orientation, the endmost
35   thread is configured to be robust so as to accomplish

  WO 2014/116820                                         PCT/US2014/012738
                                      -14
     the transition, e.g.,       with a pivotal or leveraged
     movement, without bending or breaking, and without
     application of a substantial force, and the occurrence
     of the transition can serve to signal the operator of a
 5   screw gun or other automatic or powered rotation tool or
     driver that the screw has achieved the fully engaged
     position in the corner plate of the first duct section
     along with the sensation and/or sound that the           screw is
     rotating freely within that        corner plate.   The change
10   from tilted to perpendicular may also be observed as a
     visual cue.
      [0022]        As noted above, when at least one of the large
     screws      is fully received in a corner plate of the first
     duct section, the screw or screws can be used as a tool
15   or guide for bringing the duct sections into alignment
     for assembly.        As a further aspect of the   invention,
     when the duct sections are aligned, and ready to be
     assembled, the at least one of the large screws           is
     threadedly engaged with an associated corner plate of
20   the second duct section.        This threaded engagement, and
     that of the       subsequently engaged screws, will preferably
     differ from that with the corner plate of the first duct
     section in that that the screw will deform or cut a
     thread in the material of the corner plate of the second
25   duct section in the normal manner of threaded engagement
     with sheet metal.        As a result, the screw threadedly
     engages the two corner plates in different manners.
     Regarding the second, the deformation of the second
     corner plate is advantageous as it allows the corner
30   plates to be brought together in parallel relation, at
     least as they or the sealant         or gasket between the
     flanges of the mating duct sections are brought           into
     final abutment.
      [0023]        If  it is desired to incorporate a hanger into
35   the assembly at one or more locations, this is easily

  WO 2014/116820                                      PCT/US2014/012738
                                    -15
     done by placing a narrow hanger bracket between the
     corner plates to be fastened together, such that the
     threaded shank of the associated screw extending from
     the corner plate of the first duct section extends
 5   through a hole in the hanger bracket.       The assembler can
     then simply hold the hanger bracket as the flanges of
     the duct sections are brought together, or the hole
     through the hanger bracket can be sized such that the
     bracket will be self-retained on the threaded shank          in a
10   desired orientation by engagement with the screw
     threads, and the     screw rotated in engagement with the
     corner plate of the second duct section, to clamp the
     bracket between the joined together corner plates.           Non
     limiting examples of suitable hanger brackets include
15   sheet metal brackets configured for attachment to a
     conventional threaded rod, and a radiused element to be
     partially encircled by a cable.       If desired, additional
     Tek or other sheet metal screws can then be threaded
     through the mating flanges of the duct sections in close
20   proximity to the bracket, to deform one or both of the
     flanges about the bracket to capture it and ensure a
     complete seal thereabout.      As another option, one or
     more of the corner plates can include a feature or
     element configured for attachment or connection to a
25   hanger,     such as a rod or cable, to allow hanging the
     associated duct section prior to, during or after
     assembly with the other duct section.
      [0024]       According to another preferred aspect of the
     invention, the large screws      can include a variety of
30   tips on the     shanks of the screws.   As a non-limiting
     example, a tapered or pointed, non-threaded and non
     drilling tip can be provided on the screw, configured to
     serve as a pilot received in a pre-existing hole in the
     inserted corner plate of the second duct section when in
35   aligned opposing relation to the hole in the inserted

  WO 2014/116820                                       PCT/US2014/012738
                                     -16
     corner plate of the first duct section when the duct
     sections are aligned or in mating relation.         As  another
     non-limiting example, the screw can have a more blunt
     self-drilling tip, in the manner of a hollow hole
 5   cutting drill or trepanning bit,       so as to have the
     capability of both drilling through the flanges of both
     duct sections and serving as a pilot for aligning
     purposes.      As  still another non-limiting alternative,
     the screw can have a conventional spade type or tapered
10   threaded tip typically found on commercially available
     Tek screws for sheet metal applications.        For the latter
     two examples, an existing hole through an inserted
     corner plate can be used as a drill guide, for
     controlling location of additional holes through a
15   flange or flanges, or associated corner plate to prevent
     walk-off when drilling.
      [0025]       To summarize, the invention provides a manner
     of assembling duct sections, including at elevated
     locations above a floor or the ground, using inserted
20   corner plates and large sheet metal screws       such that the
     screws can be easily rotated through the corner plates
     and an optional hanger bracket.        The duct sections will
     have flanges having openings in the corners sized for
     use with the large sheet metal screws       for allowing the
25   screws to pass through both the flanges and the inserted
     corner plates.
      [0026]       As  also explained above, the corner plate has
     an opening or openings that       allow threaded engagement
     with a threaded portion of the screw on a tilt or
30   approach angle that allows the threads to pass through
     the corner plate without the need to forcibly cut
     threads.      The corner plates   can be of various
     configurations having bends along the edges or merely be
     flat.      The openings can be of various   configurations. As
35   one non-limiting preferred embodiment, the corner plate

  WO 2014/116820                                      PCT/US2014/012738
                                   -17
     has    a diamond shaped hole with contoured corners at two
     opposing corners of the hole.       As another non-limiting
     preferred embodiment, the corner plate has      a teardrop
     shape hole with one corner.       In both of these
 5   embodiments, the hole is of a size that is      only
     marginally larger than the root diameter of the screw to
     allow the screw to threadedly engage the hole and pass
     therethrough but also allows the hole to serve to guide
     the drill point of a self-drilling hollow ended screw or
10   other type of drill end.     Other optional shapes     can
     include, but    are not limited to, rectangular, oval,
     round, eye, or a composite of the shapes.       A standard
     drill bit can also be used to drill through integral
     duct section flange ends with inserted corner plates
15   even though the flanges are not pre-punched or otherwise
     have no opening provided.
      [0027]      According to another preferred aspect of the
     invention, the large screws     can be rotated by a powered
     hand tool or driver through two corner plates of the
20   duct section so at least two screws are held in position
     and are located with the screw and pilot portion
     extending adequately for alignment contact with mating
     openings in the adjacent connecting duct section. An
     endmost thread adjacent to an unthreaded space has the
25   above-described special    configuration that   serves as a
     locking feature next to the screw head such that the
     screw is    easily inserted to the proper depth so as to
     protrude adequately for alignment, spacing apart for
     gasket protection and fastening of mating duct sections.
30   Two screws used to align the duct sections are tightened
     with a power tool quickly with the use of one hand while
     freeing the other hand to stabilize the duct sections or
     the worker as may be needed. Once the two      screws are
     tightened through the mating duct flange corner plates,

  WO 2014/116820                                    PCT/US2014/012738
                                  -18
     the remaining screws, hanger or hangers are quickly
     placed and tightened.
      [0028]     Once the large screws are tightened, Tek
     screws can be drilled through the mating flanges free
 5   handedly or by first positioning them in pre-punched
     holes or dimples provided, as needed to provide desired
     strength, rigidity, and sealing.
      [0029]     As evidenced by the above discussion, the
     present invention creates a new, faster, safer and
10   stronger method of assembling and hanging rectangular or
     other duct sections thus providing needed improvements
     for field workers who are required to assemble and hang
     duct section assemblies and sections in elevated and
     potentially dangerous areas    on jobsites.
15    [0030]     The present invention allows the use of semi
     liquid caulk gasket provided in tubes for easy
     application in any orientation thereby allowing the duct
     section to remain horizontal where it    is much easier to
     see and to apply the gasket materials. The duct section
20   can also remain oriented in the horizontal position used
     when connecting, shipping, hanging the duct sections or
     for simply moving them around on carts or skids.
      [0031]     According to another preferred aspect of the
     invention, the special   configuration of the endmost
25   thread of the screws of the invention are formable in a
     cost controlled manner by roll forming the threads such
     that a segment of the endmost thread closest to the
     screw head, e.g.,   20 to 40 percent about the
     circumference of the screw shank, is    substantially
30   parallel to the screw head so as to be capable of
     bearing against an adjacent surface of a corner plate
     located in the space between the endmost thread and the
     screw head for operation in cooperation with an opposing
     surface on the screw head, to hold the screw
35   perpendicular to an adjacent surface of the corner plate

  WO 2014/116820                                     PCT/US2014/012738
                                   -19
     under anticipated external     loading conditions,   such as
     would result from manipulating duct sections into
     position to be assembled.     Additionally the present
     invention provides a screw with more threads that are
 5   spaced for the thickness of one sheet metal section as
     opposed to two sheet metal thicknesses, providing a
     larger thread engagement area.      The substantially
     perpendicular orientation of the screw when fully
     received in the hole of the corner plate of the first
10   duct section is advantageous as it preferably orients
     the screw in perpendicular relation to a major       surface
     or surfaces of the corner that abut the flange of the
     associated duct section, so that the     screw is coaxial
     with an alignment axis that will extend through that
15   hole and also the hole through the corner plate of the
     duct section to be assembled therewith when the duct
     sections are positioned or aligned for assembly.
      [0032]     The present invention addresses these issues
     such that less hanging time is needed so that other
20   contractors will be allowed greater time for their
     needs. The current invention provides solutions to many
     job site situations along with improving quality and
     increasing the connection strength. The same solutions
     are provided for the production floor.

     Detailed Description Of Preferred Embodiments Of The
     Invention
15    [00109]      Referring to the drawings wherein like
     numerals refer to like parts, FIG. 1 illustrates a
     typical prior art duct flange connection as currently
     practiced showing a clip 18,       a gasket 17 and duct
     section end flanges 14.      FIG. 1A teaches applying the
20   clip 18 by rotating it     into position over and around the
     flanges 14 as illustrated by the arrow. FIG. 1B shows
     the clip 18     in a final holding position about the
     flanges 14.
      [00110]      FIG. 2 gives the  information needed to place
25   the gasket tape 17 properly on the duct section flanges
     14.   FIG. 3 and FIG. 3A illustrate the typical adhesive
     tape 17 used for duct joining and shows the non-stick
     paper backing 20 provided with the tape 17.         As the tape
     17   is unwound and applied the paper 20 must be crumpled
30   together or otherwise disposed of.
      [00111]      FIG. 4 shows the tape 17 applied to the end of
     a duct section flange 14 with a lap 39 where the end of
     the tape 17     starts and stops. Inserted corner plates        21
     are shown in place in the duct section end flange 14.

     FIG. 6 shows preparatory alignment of integral duct
     section flanges 14 or slide on duct section flanges 66
     through the use of drift pin 24 through aligned holes
     through the corner plates 21.         FIG. 6A shows the
 5   beginning of the     insertion process of drift pin 24 into
     the holes through corner plates        21 of the duct section
     flange with gasket 17     separate and apart from the mating
     duct flange 14.      It should be understood that if gasket
     17 were to inadvertently contact and adhere to the
10   opposing duct flange 14 while flanges 14 are misaligned,
     it would be difficult and time consuming to remove and
     correct and often requires disassembly and scraping or
     peeling of the gasket for removal and replacement with a
     new gasket and re-alignment.         FIG. 6B shows drift pin 24
15   fully aligned and engaged with corner plates 21 with
     gasket 17 clamped against the mating duct section flange
     14 by clamps 280.

     section flange 14.      Screws 35 of the   invention are shown
     in alignment with holes 281 provided in corner plates
 5   28.    Additional screws, which can include, but are not
     limited to,     self-drilling Tek screws represented by
     screw 38     are shown in spaced relationship along duct
     section flange channel 14 in centered alignment along
     each side of the duct section flange end 14 for
10   additionally fastening together duct section flange 14
     with a mating duct section flange.
      [00115]      FIGS. 10, 10A, 10-1   show duct flanges 14 of
     representative duct sections 33 and 34 in a spaced apart
     aligned state for assembly 300,       according to the
15   invention.      First and second inserted corner plates       28
     are representatively disposed and crimped in place in
     cavities of flanges 14     in the well known manner.      A
     sealant     caulking bead 22 is   in place on one of the
     flanges 14 with a representative screw 35 in coaxial
20   alignment with an alignment axis 350 through holes 351
     through inserted corner plates 28       of the flanges 14.
     FIG. 10A shows the screw 35 fully received in hole 351
     of a first of the corner plates       28, with corner plate 28
     disposed in an unthreaded space 30 between a head 29            and
25   an endmost thread 301 of a threaded portion 32 of the
     screw 35 according to the invention. Duct       section
     flanges 14 remain in spaced apart relation.
      [00116]      FIG. 10-1 shows screw 35 tilted with a center
     axis 355 thereof at a representative approach angle
30   relative to alignment axis 350 through aligned holes 351
     of inserted corner plates 28,       with screw 35 threadedly
     engaged with hole 351 of a first       inserted corner plate
     28.     It  can be observed that the pitch of threaded
     portion 32 between adjacent threads is       about equal to
35   the thickness of corner plate 28       as measured between

  WO 2014/116820                                      PCT/US2014/012738

     opposite surfaces thereof about hole 351,      which is
     desired and advantageous as noted as it enables the
     threaded engagement without requiring the forced cutting
     of threads in plate 28    or significant deformation
 5   thereof.     A preferred angle of tilt will generally
     correspond to a pitch angle or lead of the threads of
     threaded portion 32    about the major diameter of the
     screw, so that the threaded portion 32      of screw 35 can
     threadedly engage hole 351 of the first corner plate 28
10   and rotatably pass therethrough with minimum resistance
     and applied torque, which is      advantageous for conserving
     energy when screw 35 is driven by a battery operated
     device or by hand.
      [00117]     FIG. 10-2 gives a close up of the space 30
15   adjacent head 29 of screw 35 showing an extension 356 of
     the endmost thread 301 of threaded portion 32 extending
     into a groove 354 between endmost thread 301 and a next
     adjacent thread 352 of threaded portion 32,       as a
     representative configuration of endmost thread 301 for

     portion 32 of screw 35 with hole 351 of the first corner
     plate 28,    once the screw 35 is fully received in hole
     351,    as shown in FIG. 10A and subsequently in FIGS.       1OB
     10E.     As can be observed in FIGS.   10A-10E space 30
25   between endmost thread 301 and the screw head 29        is of a
     predetermined extent about equal to the thickness of
     corner plate 28 as measured between opposite surfaces
     thereof about or adjacent to hole 351,      such that when
     screw 35 is fully received in hole 351,      the head 29 and
30   endmost thread 301 will abut plate 28,      and cooperate to
     hold screw 35 in a substantially perpendicular
     orientation relative to the corner plate, which locates
     axis 355 through screw 35 substantially coaxial with
     alignment axis 350 through hole 351 through the first
35   corner plate 28,    and also hole 351 through the     second

     corner plate 28 when the corner plates are aligned for
     assembling the associated duct sections 33,      34.
      [00118]    In the substantially perpendicular orientation
     shown when screw 35 is   fully received in hole 351 of the
 5   first corner plate 28,   endmost thread 301 is configured
     to bear or exert a force against the adjacent opposing
     surface of the corner plate, such that screw 35 will
     essentially self hold or lock in this position.        This
     bearing force should be sufficiently robust to hold this
10   orientation in opposition to forces and loads
     anticipated to be exerted laterally and the like,
     resulting from manipulations and handling of the
     associated duct sections as they are brought into
     alignment, e.g.,   by manual movements.    As a result, the
15   screws 35 provide a useful alignment tool.
      [00119]    As a related note,   endmost thread 301 and head
     29   of screw 35 are configured to transition the screw
     from the tilted orientation of FIG. 10-1 to the
     substantially perpendicular alignment orientation of the
20   fully received position shown in the other Figs,       e.g.,
     by an automatic action, e.g.,     a pivoting movement about
     extension 356,   as the screw reaches the fully received
     position wherein corner plate 35 enters space 30.         At
     this time, threaded portion 32 threadedly disengages
25   from hole 351, but   endmost thread 301 is now in abutting
     contact or engagement with the opposing edge of the
     corner plate and bears thereagainst in the above
     described manner.    Further in this regard, screw 35 now
     threadedly disengaged, can rotate in hole 351 relative
30   to the corner plate without moving axially, and the
     configuration of endmost thread 301,     the perpendicular
     orientation, and lack of a cut thread or deformation of
     the corner plate for threaded engagement, combine to
     prevent threaded re-engagement of threaded portion 32

     in aligned and spaced apart relationship with each other
     with semi- liquid caulk gasket 22 protected from
     improper engagement with the mating duct section flange
     14. FIG. 10C depicts screw 35 in initial engagement with
10   the mating duct section flange 14 with one or more
     threads of threaded portion 32 threadedly engaged with
     hole 351 of the mating inserted corner plate 28 while
     maintaining axial alignment with hole 351.     As this
     occurs, corner plates 28 are held in cavities 33,      34 by
15   the crimped configuration of flanges 14.
      [00121]     FIG. 10D shows full threaded engagement of
     screw 35 with the second corner plate 28, to clamp duct
     section flanges 14 into full engagement.    As screw 35
     threadedly engages hole 351 of the second corner plate
20   28,   it will forceably cut a thread therein, or deform
     the adjacent portion or region of that corner plate as
     denoted by representative bend 82 to pass through the
     hole 351, which deformation is accommodated by the large
     adjacent clearance hole through the associated flange
25   14.    At the same time, the semi-liquid caulk gasket is
     compressed between the flanges as denoted by protrusion
     17A from the joint.
