   flat-screen TVs, toward more convenient, versatile and aesthetically pleasing. Display
   screens are necessary when using such products; and liquid crystal display (LCD) devices
10 have become mainstream. Since the LCD devices are not self-emissive devices, light
   sources such as backlight modules for illuminating the display are required.
        Various methods have been employed to uphold a LCD module together with a
   backlight module. A conventional way is to use a shell to enclose the edges of the LCD
   module as well as those of the backlight module. However, the edges are covered by the
15 shell with a large space, causing the overall thickness and the border width of the display
   device being unable to be effectively reduced. That is, in the related art, the display module
   and the backlight of the display device are assembled within two casings which are
   connected through hooks and slots. However, the hooks and slots occupy a large space,
   causing the overall thickness and the border width of the display device being unable to be
20 effectively reduced.
                                              SUMMARY

   device in FIG. 1.
                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        In the following detailed description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific
 5 details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosed
   embodiments.      It will be apparent, however, that one or more embodiments may be
   practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and
   devices are schematically shown in order to simplify the drawing.
        In a conventional display device, the display module and the backlight module is
10 enclosed by two pieces, i.e. piece A and piece B, for assembling the two modules. The two
   pieces usually take a form of hooks and slots to fasten one another. The piece B is a
   rectangle case covering a front side (i.e. a display face) of the display module, and The
   piece A is a back casing disposing on a bottom surface of the display module; such that the
   display module is sandwiched between the pieces A and B. Since the top, left and right
15 sides of the display module is covered by the piece B, the display area of the display panel
   cannot be reduced. Neither the thickness of the display device can be reduced due to the
   hooks and slots. So there is a need to provide a display device with narrow and thin frame.
        The present disclosure provides a display device having a flexible and narrow frame
   for positioning and protecting the display panel. By using the flexible frame, the display
20 panel can be positioned without the piece B. As a result, the display area of the display
   panel can be fully used so as to provide a larger display area on a small screen.
        In the following descriptions, a display screen of a notebook computer is taken as an
   example to illustrate the embodiments of the display device of the present disclosure; from
   which the advantages of the present disclosure including reduced overall size, cushion to
25 protect the display panel, and larger display area on a small screen will become apparent.
        Please refer to FIG. 1 to FIG. 5, FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a display device
                                                  4

        In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, a display device 10 is provided. The display
   device comprises a casing 100, a plurality of adhesive members 200, a display panel 300,
   and a flexible frame 400.
        As shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, the casing 100 may comprise a bottom plate 110 and
10 three lateral plates 120. The bottom plate 110 may have a plurality of sides. The lateral
   plates 120 are respectively connected to the sides of the bottom plate 110 so as to form an
   accommodating space S therewithin.
        A side of the bottom plate 110 facing the accommodating space S may have a plurality
   of protrusions 111, 112, 113 and 114 for disposing the adhesive members 200. The
15 protrusion 111 and the protrusion 112 are respectively located on the opposite sides of the
   bottom plate 110, and two protrusions 113 and the protrusion 114 are respectively located
   on the other opposite sides of the bottom plate 110. In addition, the protrusion 111 and the
   112 respectively have a groove 1I1A and a groove 112A. Two opposite ends of the groove
   1I1A are respectively close to two opposite ends of the protrusion 111, and two opposite
20 ends of the groove 112A are respectively close to two opposite ends of the protrusion 112.
        Furthermore, the bottom plate 110 may further have a plurality of punched holes 115 in
   order to reduce the weight of the bottom plate 110.
        As shown in FIG. 2, the adhesive members 200 can be, for example, foam rubbers.
   Each adhesive member 200 may have two adhesive sides. One adhesive side of the
25 adhesive member 200 is respectively attached to the protrusions 111,112,113 and 114;
   thereby the adhesive members 200 attached to the protrusions 111 and 112 respectively at
   least partially cover the grooves 1I1A and 112A.
                                                  5

        As shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, the display panel 300 may be disposed in the
   accommodating space S and is attached to the other adhesive side of the adhesive members
   200.
        As shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 5, the flexible frame 400 can be made of, for example, a
 5 mixture of plastic and silicone, and can be produced by an injection molding process. The
   flexible frame 400 may comprise three side bars 410, 420 and 430 connected end to end.
   The three side bars 410, 420 and 430 may be respectively disposed on three adjacent sides
   of the display panel 300. Since the structures of the bars 410, 420 and 430 are the same,
   only the bar 410 is illustrated in the following description for simplicity. The side bar 410
10 may comprise a support part 411, a side part 412, and a cover part 413. The side part 412 is
   located between and connected to the support part 411 and the cover part 413. A portion of
   the display panel 300 is sandwiched between the support part 411 and the cover part 413.
        In more details, in this embodiment, the cover part 413 may have a first abutment
   surface 413A, and the side part 412 may have a second abutment surface 412A. The first
15 abutment surface 413A and the second abutment surface 412A may be respectively located
   at adjacent sides of the display panel 300, and the first abutment surface 413A may have an
   acute angle 0 with respect to the second abutment surface 412A; that is, the first abutment
   surface 413A is inclined toward the display panel 300, such that the first abutment surface
   413A is able to press against the display panel 300. As a result, the display panel 300 is
20 tightly sandwiched between the cover part 413 and the support part 411 so as to secure the
   position of the display panel 300 on the flexible frame 400, thereby increasing the
   reliability of the display panel 300 during assembling.
        In addition, in this embodiment, the cover part 413 can be located on the side of the
   display panel 300 away from the bottom plate 110, and the cover part 413 may have a
25 convex cushion 413B. The convex cushion 413B is served to provide a buffer effect when
   the display device 10 is folded down over the keyboard so as to prevent them from hitting
   each other. Moreover, the convex cushion 413B and the side bar 410 can be integrated into
   a single piece, which is beneficial to simplify the overall assembly process.
                                                   6

        Furthermore, given that a portion of the cover part 413 protruding from the second
   abutment surface 412A of the side part 412 has a length LI, and a portion of the support
   part 411 protruding from the second abutment surface 412A has a length L2, then, in this
   embodiment, LI is smaller than L2, which is beneficial to enlarge the display area.
 5      In this embodiment, the display device 10 may further comprise a cover plate 500, and
   a portion of the groove 1I1A and a portion of the groove 1 12A may be stretched out an
   edge 310 of the display panel 300. The cover plate 500 can be detachably mounted on the
   casing 100 for covering the portions of the grooves 1I1A and 1 12A, thus beautifying the
   appearance of the display device 100. When it is needed to disassembly the display device
10 100, the cover plate 500 can be detached and then a solution (e.g. alcohol) can be employed
   to be poured into the grooves 1I1A and 1 12A from the portions not covered by the display
   panel 300 to eliminate the stickiness of the adhesive members 200. By doing so, the display
   panel 300 can be easily removed from the casing 100 without damaging the display panel
   300.
15      It should be noted that, in the above-mentioned embodiment, the adhesive member 200
   is foam tape; and the grooves 111A,112A are provided at the protrusions 111,112 for being
   injected with alcohol so as to clean stickness. However, the present disclosure is not limited
   to the type of the adhesive members 200. In other embodiments, the adhesive member may
   be a sticky pad that would stick to objects but could be easily to be pulled off; in such a
20 case, it is no need to provide the protrusions with grooves; for disassembly, only a portion
   of the stick pad is exposed outside the edge of the display panel 300 to be pulled off.
        Moreover, in this embodiment, the display device 10 may further comprise a
   decorative plate 600. The decorative plate 600 can be detachably mounted on the side of the
   bottom plate 110 away from the display panel 300.
25      The bottom plate 110 may further have two detaching holes 116. The detaching holes
   116 are through holes located at the outside of the outer edge 310 of the display panel 300.
   When assembling the cover plate 500 to the casing 100, the detaching holes 116 can also be
   covered to beautify the appearance of the display device 10. Accordingly, the decorative
                                                  7

   plate 600 can be detached by removing the cover plate 500 and using tools (e.g. a
   screwdriver) to penetrate through the detaching hole 116 to pry up the decorative plate 600.
        According to the embodiments of the display device discussed above, due to the
   flexible frame and the adhesive members, the display panel can be positioned in place
 5 without putting a piece B over its front side; thus the display device may have a narrow
   frame. Furthermore, the display area of the display panel can be fully used so as to provide
   a larger display area on a small screen.
        In addition, the flexible frame is relatively low in cost, and it can be disposed on the
   casing through the display panel, thus it is beneficial to reduce the manufacturing cost and
10 the difficulty in assembling of the display device.
        By using the flexible frame, the display panel can be positioned without the piece B.
   As a result, the display area of the display panel can be fully used so as to provide a larger
   display area on a small screen. The advantages include reduced overall size, providing
   buffer to the display panel, and providing larger display area on a small screen.
