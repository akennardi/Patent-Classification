     SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR COLLECTING AND TRANSMITTING ASSAY
                                              RESULTS
                        REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] This application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No.
2014216060, the contents of which are hereby incorporated in its entirety. Australian Patent
Application No. 2014216060 is a National Phase Entry of International Patent Application No.
PCT/US2014/016593, filed on 14 February 2014.
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
IOOO1a] Existing systems and methods for clinical testing suffer many drawbacks from the
perspectives of patients, health care professionals, and taxpayers or insurance companies.
Today, consumers can purchase certain specialized tests from various locations for consumer
use. For example, a consumer can purchase a pregnancy test at a pharmacy and review the
results. However, such results are to be viewed by the consumer, and are not to be relied on by
the consumer's physician in forming a screening, diagnosis or treatment plan.
[0002] Additionally, if a test result is to be conducted and to be relied on by a doctor, physical
samples are transported to a laboratory where the tests on the samples are performed. For
example, blood from a fingerstick or venous draw is typically collected from a subject at a
hospital or physician's office. The blood sample is shipped to a Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory which performs the tests and analysis
that is provided to the patient's doctor. Such techniques are cumbersome and cause significant
delay in providing the result of a test ordered by a physician, especially because the physical
specimens must be transported to a different site for analysis. Moreover, the sample collection
sites often have limited hours which further causes inconvenience to patients.
[0003] Conventional techniques are also problematic for certain diagnoses. Some tests are time
sensitive, and the results of which may take days or weeks to complete. In such a time, a disease
can progress past the point of treatment. This impairs a medical professional's ability to provide
quality care.
[0004] Traditional systems and methods also affect the integrity and quality of a clinical test due
to degradation of a sample that often occurs while transporting such sample from the site of
collection to the place where actual analysis of the sample is performed. For examples, analytes
decay at a certain rate, and the time delay for analysis can result in loss of the sample integrity.

Different laboratories also work with different qualities which can result in varying degrees of
error. Each laboratory can have its own set of references that further introduce a wide range of
variability in coefficients of variation. Additionally, preparation of samples by hand permit
upfront human error to occur from various sample collection sites. These and other drawbacks
inherent in the conventional setup make it difficult to perform longitudinal analysis with high
quality.
[0005] Furthermore, the conventional techniques are typically not very cost effective. For
example, delays in test results lead to delays in diagnoses and treatments that can have a
deleterious effect on a patient's health. For example, a disease may progress further, resulting in
the patient needing additional treatment. Payers, such as health insurance companies and
taxpayers contributing to governmental health programs, end up paying more to treat problems
that could have been averted with more accessible and faster clinical test results.
                                            SUMMARY
[0006] A need exists for improved systems and methods that allow higher quality of care, more
rapid and accurate screening, diagnosis and/or treatment. Specifically, there is a considerable
need for sample collection,

It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be
employed in practicing the invention.
           [00188] The invention provides systems and methods for collecting and transmitting data relating to a
sample, and often representative of the sample so that further analysis of the sample does not require physical
transportation of the sample. Various aspects of the invention described herein may be applied to any of the
particular applications set forth below or for any other types of diagnostic or assay systems. The invention may be
applied as a standalone system or method, or as part of an integrated system, such as in a system between
laboratories, health care professionals, and sample collection sites. It shall be understood that different aspects of
the invention can be appreciated individually, collectively, or in combination with each other.
           [00189] It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a",
"an", and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to
"a reagent" refers to a single reagent and to multiple reagents, and reference to "an assay" refers to a single assay
and to multiple assays.
           [00190] As used in the description herein and throughout the claims that follow, the meaning of "in"
includes "in" and "on" unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
           [00191] As used in the description herein and throughout the claims that follow, the meaning of "or"
includes both the conjunctive and disjunctive unless the context expressly dictates otherwise. Thus, the term "or"
includes "and/or" unless the context expressly dictates otherwise.
           [00192] As used in the description herein, the term "embodiments" and the phrase "in embodiments" and
linguistic variants thereof refer to exemplary features, elements, capabilities, and combinations thereof, of devices,
systems, and methods as disclosed herein. Disclosure of a particular feature, or element, or capability, or particular
combination of features, elements, or capabilities, is not limiting, but are illustrative of such, and may include other
combinations and other aspects of such features, elements, and capabilities.
           [00193] In this specification and in the claims that follow, reference will be made to a number of terms,
which shall be defined to have the following meanings:
           [00194] The term "analyte" and its plural and other forms, as used herein, includes without limitation
drugs, prodrugs, pharmaceutical agents, drug metabolites, biomarkers such as expressed proteins and cell markers,
antibodies, antigens, proteins, hormones, polypeptides, glycoproteins, polysaccharides, lipids, viruses, cholesterol,
polysaccharides, nucleic acids, genes, nucleic acids, and combinations thereof.
           [00195] As used herein, the term "cell count" refers to a qualitative or quantitative assessment of the
number of cells in a sample, or in a volume, or in a field of view, or on a surface. An estimate of the number of
cells in a sample, e.g., by absorbance of light passing through, or scattered or otherwise altered by cells in a sample;
by light or other radiation emitted by cells expressing fluorescent or otherwise detectable proteins, or labeled by
dyes, radionuclides, or other markers; an enumeration of the number of cells in an image (e.g., an image of a blood
or urine sample, a tissue slice, or other biological sample, acquired by a camera, a microscope, or other optical
imaging device), and a quantitative measurement of the number of cells adherent to a surface are all examples of a
cell count.
                                                           -28-

          [00196] As used herein, the term "cytometry" refers to observations, analysis, methods, and results
regarding cells of a biological sample, where the cells are substantially at rest in a fluid or on a substrate. Cells
detected and analysed by cytometry may be detected and measured by any optical, electrical or acoustic detector.
Cytometry may include preparing and analyzing images of cells in or from a biological sample (e.g., two
dimensional images). The cells may be labeled (e.g., with fluorescent, chemiluminescent, enzymatic, or other
labels) and plated (e.g., allowed to settle on a substrate) and detected. Cells may be, for example, imaged by a
camera. A microscope may be used for cell imaging in cytometry; for example, cells may be imaged by a camera
and a microscope, e.g., by a camera forming an image using a microscope. An image formed by, and used for,
cytometry typically includes more than one cell. As used herein, the term "cytometry" refers to measurements made
without substantial cell motion with respect to the device (e.g., the cells are observed and imaged while at rest with
respect to a surface of the device). In this regard, the term "cytometry" as used herein is different from, and refers to
different observations, analysis, methods, and results than are referred to by the more limited term "flow
cytometry."
          [00197] As used herein, the term "flow cytometry" refers to observations and analysis of cells, where the
cells are in motion within a device, or with respect to a surface of a device. Flow cytometry typically uses a mobile
liquid medium that sequentially carries individual cells to an optical, electrical or acoustic detector; e.g., in a typical
flow cytometer, cells are carried by a moving fluid past a stationary detector.
          [00198] As used herein, the term "microscopy" refers to the use of magnifying lenses and other optical
methods to provide an image of a target, such as a cell or a plurality of cells. Microscopy typically uses optical or
acoustic means to detect stationary cells, generally by recording at least one magnified image. An image formed by
microscopy typically provides greater resolution than is possible when viewing the target by eye alone; for example,
the image may be enlarged. Optical methods and techniques used in microscopy, in addition to the use of lenses for
refraction, include the use of mirrors, prisms, filters, polarizers, gratings, grids, light sources, scanning methods and
techniques (e.g., as used in confocal microscopy), special apertures (e.g., a pin-hole), and other methods.
          [00199] As used herein, "spectroscopy" refers to assays and measurements using light intensity, including
light intensity as a function of light wavelength to detect and assess a sample. Spectoscopy includes measurements
of the reflection or transmission of electromagnetic waves, including visible, UV, and infrared light. Spectroscopy
includes any and all assays that produce luminescence or change light (e.g., color chemistry). These may include
one or more of the following: spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, luminometry, turbidimetry, nephelometry,
refractometry, polarimetry, and measurement of agglutination.
          [00200] The term "fluorimetry" as used herein refers to measuring the light emitted by a fluorescent
molecule coupled to a subject upon exciting the fluorescent molecule with incident light.
          [00201] As used herein, "luminometry" refers to measurements and observations that use no external
illumination method, but instead detects electromagnetic radiation emitted by or from the object, chemical reaction,
or area of interest. The emitted light may be weak, and thus luminometry may require the detection of low light or
other radiation levels; such signals can be detected using an extremely sensitive sensor such as a photomultiplier
tube (PMT). Luminometry includes assays that produce chemiluminescence, such as those using luciferases or
some assays using peroxidases.
                                                            -29-

           [00202] As used herein, "turbidimetry" refers to detection, measurement, or observation of a sample or
reaction in a sample by backlighting the sample and components within the sample with white light, with the result
being sensed by an imaging sensor. The reduction of the intensity of the transmitted light is measured (the intensity
of the incident light being known) . Turbidimetry may be used, for example, to determine a concentration of cells in
solution. In some embodiments, turbimetry is measured by nephelometry.
           [00203] As used herein, the term "nephelometry" refers to measurements of light that is transmitted or
scattered after passing through a suspension, e.g., a suspension of target analytes in a solution. For example, the
amount of a substrate bound to an immunoglobin such as IgM, IgG, and IgA may be measured by nephelometry.
           [00204] As used herein, the term "polarimetry" refers to measurements of the polarization of light or other
electromagnetic radiation following reflection, refraction, or other contact with subject object or field. Polarimetry
assays include circular dichroism, which may provide structural information and light scattering assays, which may
provide information about the size and/or shape of the subject. One nonlimiting example of light scattering assays
uses dynamic light scattering (DLS).
           [00205] As used herein, the terms "colorant" and "chromogen" refer to a compound which produces or
provides a detectable change in color, absorbance, turbidity, or other optical property of a medium. Chromagens
may be used to signal the occurrence, progress, or results of a chemical reaction, which may be detected and
measured by colorimetric or other means (e.g., by luminometer, spectrophotometer, or other light detector).
           [00206] As used herein, the terms "product formation," "colored product," "colored product formation,"
and the like are used to refer to the act of, and the products that result from, addition of a colorant to a solution. For
example, addition of a colorant to a solution may result in a reaction effective to alter an optical property of the
solution. Such a reaction may result in the formation of molecules originally not present in the solution, or may
result in the aggregation of molecules or compounds previously in the solution, or may result in the degradation or
other alteration of molecules or compounds previously in the solution, effective to alter the color, absorbance,
and/or other optical properties of a solution to which a colorant is added.
           [00207] As used herein, the terms "reflex" and "reflex testing" refer to the initiation, modification or
repetition of a protocol, measurement, assay method, or analysis based on information or results obtained following
an initial measurement, assay, or analysis. A reflex test may be performed where information is obtained by an
initial measurement that can be supplemented by further testing, suggests that a more precise or specific test should
be performed, or that an additional test should be performed for an analyte or condition related to or suggested by
the initial measurement. Typically, a reflex test is performed based on the results of an initial test; the initial test is
typically less sensitive, cheaper or faster than the reflex test. For example, reflex testing may occur when, after
detecting a possible abnormality with an initial PAP smear, a more specific or precise test, such as one using nucleic
acid analysis, may be performed to more accurately assess the subject's condition. Another example of reflex
testing might include measurement of the folate level in the blood of a subject based on finding a low hematocrit
level in an initial blood test.
           [00208] As used herein, the terms "sample" and "biological sample" include the entire sample and include
a portion, or portions, of the entire sample, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. A "sample" may include,
but is not limited to, a sample selected from the group consisting of blood, serum, plasma, a nasal swab. a
nasopharyngeal wash, saliva, urine, tears, a gastric fluid, spinal fluid, stool, mucus, sweat, earwax, oil, a glandular
                                                            -30-

secretion, cerebral spinal fluid, tissue, semen, vaginal fluid, a throat swab, breath, hair, finger nails, skin, biopsy
tissue or fluid, placental fluid, amniotic fluid, cord blood, lymphatic fluids, cavity fluids (e.g, a fluid collected or
drained from a body cavity of a subject), sputum, mucus, pus, microbiota, meconium, breast milk and other
secretions and excretions.
           [00209] As used herein, "processing" a sample refers to actions taken to receive, modify, test, represent,
and characterize a sample, and may include diluting a sample, subjecting a sample to treatment (e.g., centrifugation,
filtration, or other treatment), fractionating or separating sample constituents, contacting a sample with a reagent,
staining or dying a sample, observing a sample, testing a sample, or other action, e.g., for determination of
characteristics or properties of the sample, Processing a sample may include obtaining an image or representation of
a sample or sample constituents,
           [00210] As used herein, the term "sample collection site" refers to a location at which a sample may be
obtained from a subject. A sample collection site may be, for example, a retailer location (e.g., a chain store,
pharmacy, supermarket, or department store), a provider office, a physician's office, a hospital, the subject's home,
a military site, an employer site, or other site or combination of sites. As used herein, the term "sample collection
site" may also refer to a proprietor or representative of a business, service, or institution located at, or affiliated
with, the site. Thus, for example, the phrases "an electronic bill from the designated sample collection site" and "an
electronic payment from the designated sample collection site" refer to a bill or payment from the proprietor, or the
representative of the proprietor, located at, or affiliated with, the sample collection site.
           [00211] As used herein, the terms "retailer", "retailer site, "retail site", and the like, refer to a location at
which a retail operations (sales and other commercial transactions) occur. As used herein, these terms may also
refer to a proprietor or representative of a business, service, or institution located at, or affiliated with, the retail site.
           [00212] As used herein, the phrase "no processing of the sample by the subject or by an operator" and
linguistic equivalents means that a sample, such as a blood sample, urine sample, stool sample, or other sample,
may be placed directly in a container for further processing, and that no action other than those required to effect the
placement of the sample in the container is required.
           [00213] As used herein, "numerical values", such as, e.g., numerical values representative of a physical
process or chemical reaction performed by the device, refer to output of a sensor, detector, or other component or
device for measuring a physical parameter such as light intensity, absorbance of light, temperature, pH, or other
parameter useful for the measurement of a physical process or chemical reaction. Such numerical values may be
analog values (i.e., continuous variables) or digital values (i.e., discrete variables), and may be summed, averaged,
normalized, binned, or otherwise manipulated as needed or convenient for the measurement.
           [00214] As used herein, "electronic data representative of an image" refers to electronic output of a
camera, microscope, charge-coupled device, or other sensor capable of providing data that can be used to form an
image or a representation of an image. Where configured to form or provide an image (e.g., in arrays), sensors and
components including photodiodes, photomiltiplier tubes, photoelectric cells, and other light-sensitive electronic
components may be used to provide, in whole or in part, electronic data representative of an image.
                                                            -31-

           [00215] As used herein, the term "data" includes all information, in any form, obtained from or related to
a test, measurement, or observation of a sample (including a portion of a sample) or a reaction in which a sample
participates. Data includes raw data, pre-processed data, and processed data.
           [00216] As used herein, "raw data" includes signals and direct read-outs from sensors, cameras, and other
components and instruments which detect or measure properties or characteristics of a sample. For example, raw
data includes voltage or current output from a sensor, detector, counter, camera, or other component or device; raw
data includes digital or analog numerical output from a sensor, detector, counter, camera, or other component or
device; and raw data may include digitized or filtered output from a sensor, detector, counter, camera, or other
component or device. For example, raw data includes the output of a luminometer, which may include output in
"relative light units" which are related to the number of photons detected by the luminometer. Raw data may
include a JPEG, bitmap, or other image file produced by a camera. Raw data may include cell counts; light intensity
(at a particular wavelength, or at or within a range of wavelengths); a rate of change of the output of a detector; a
difference between similar measurements made at two times; a number of events detected; the number of events
detected within a pre-set range or that meet a pre-set criterion; the minimum value measured within a time period,
or within a field of view; the maximum value measured within a time period, or within a field of view; and other
data. Where sufficient, raw data may be used without further processing or analysis; typically, raw data is further
processed or used for further analysis related to the sample, the subject, or for other purposes.
           [00217] As used herein, "pre-processed" data includes data derived from raw data that has been baseline
corrected, filtered, summed, averaged, normalized, scaled, or otherwise manipulated. Pre-processed data may
include binned data, or transformed data (e.g., time domain data transformed by Fourier Transform to frequency
domain), or may be combined with other data. The pre-processing may put the data into a desired form, and may
involve modifying the format of data; however, data pre-processing does not perform actual data analysis or
comparison with any threshold values, and does not alter the content of the data.
           [00218] As used herein, "processed data" includes data and analyses resulting from combination,
manipulation or analysis of raw data, pre-processed data, or other processed data. Processing may include
comparison (e.g., with a baseline, threshold, standard curve, historical data, or data from other sensors),
combination, mathematical manipulation or correction, curve-fitting, use of data as the basis of mathematical or
other analytical reasoning (including deductive, inductive, Bayesian, or other reasoning), and other forms of
processing known to those of skill in the art.
           [00219] As used herein, the term "immunoassay" refers to tests which utilize antibodies (including
antibody fragments) and their binding to target molecules to label, identify, quantify, or otherwise provide
information regarding the presence, amounts, and properties of target molecules and samples containing them. One
useful immunoassay that can be run on a device disclosed herein is an ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent
Assay).Immunoassays also include, for example, competitive binding assays, sandwich assays, Western blots, and
other assays utilizing antibodies and antibody fragments.
           [00220] As used herein, the term "nucleic acid" refers to molecules formed of chains of nuclecotides, such
as deoxyribonucleic acid molecules (DNA), ribonucleic acid molecules (RNA), and including locked nucleic acids,
"peptide nucleic acids" (PNA) and other nucleic acid analogs similar to, or which mimic, DNA or RNA.
                                                           -32-

          [00221] As used herein, the term "nucleic acid assay" refers to any and all assays which utilize nucleic
acids or which detect nucleic acids in a sample. Nucleic acids hybridize to complementary nucleic acids, a property
which is useful for identifying target nucleic acids, and for identifying samples, whether fluid, tissue, or other
samples, containing target nucleic acids. Nucleic acid assays use, and include, techniques for amplifying target
nucleic acids (e.g., by producing copies of target nucleic acids, or copies of nucleic acids that are complementary to
target nucleic acids). Nucleic acid assays include, for example, assays using polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
Southern blots, Northern blots, and other assays which may identify and allow detection of nucleic acids in a
sample.
          [00222] As used herein, the term "receptor-based assay" refers to an assay which utilizes, or detects, the
binding of a receptor to its ligand, or the dissociation of a ligand from its receptor. Such assays may use the binding
directly to detect or quantify the presence or amount of a receptor or ligand, may use competitive binding
techniques to detect or quantify the presence or amount of a target molecule in a sample, or may detect or quantify
the presence or amount of a target by use of other methods based on binding between a receptor and ligand or
ligands.
          [00223] As used herein, the term "enzymatic assay" refers to an assay which utilizes, or detects, the
presence or action of an enzyme. For example, an assay which provides a substrate for a target enzyme, and detects
the presence of that enzyme, or quantifies the activity of that enzyme in a sample following addition of the substrate
is an enzymatic assay. An assay which utilizes the enzymatic production of a detectable substance is another
example of an enzymatic assay; for example, colorimetric assays (e.g., in which a detectable product is produced by
an enzyme, which may be an endogenous enzyme or which may be supplied with the assay reagents) such as assays
in which horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase is used to produce a colored product as an indicator of the
progress of the reaction or presence of a target, are enzymatic assays.

           [00238] FIG. 1A shows a system comprising a laboratory 110, a designated sample collection site 120,
and a health care professional 100. A device 130 may be provided at the designated sample collection site. A
sample collection site may be a first location, and a laboratory may be provided at a second location. The first
location and the second location may be different locations. The first and second locations may be located so that
they are not proximate to one another. A health care professional may be provided at a third location, although
he/she may be affiliated with, employed by, or contracted by the laboratory. The third location may be a different
location from the first and second locations. The third location may be located so that it is not proximate to the first
or second locations. A laboratory, health care professional, and sample collection site may all be at different
                                                           -34-

locations from one another. In one example, a laboratory, health care professional, and/or sample collection site
may be at separate facilities. Alternatively, one or more of them may be at the same location.
           [00239] A laboratory can be an entity or facility or system or device capable of performing a clinical test
or analyzing collected data. A laboratory can provide controlled conditions in which scientific research,
experiments, and measurement can be performed. The laboratory can be a medical laboratory or clinical laboratory
where tests can be done on clinical specimens, or analysis can occur on data collected from clinical specimens, in
order to get information about the health of a patient as pertaining to the screening, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment,
and/or prevention of disease. A clinical specimen may be a sample collected from a subject. Preferably, a clinical
specimen may be collected from the subject at a sample collection site that is at a separate facility from the
laboratory, as described in further detail elsewhere herein. The clinical specimen may be collected from the subject
using a device, which is placed at a designated sample collection site or in or on the subject.
          In some embodiments, a laboratory may be a certified laboratory. The certified laboratory may be an
authorized analytical facility. In some embodiments, authorized analytical facilities may include contracted
analytical facilities. For example, a certified laboratory or other laboratory may send images to experts at another
laboratory (which may be a certified laboratory) for analysis.
           [00240]    Any description herein of a laboratory may apply to an authorized analytical facility and vice
versa. In some instances, the laboratory may be certified by a governmental agency or professional association. A
laboratory may receive certification or oversight by a regulatory body. In one example, the laboratory may be
certified by an entity, such as Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), College of American Pathologists,
ISO standards 15189 or 17025 or equivalents thereof. For instance, an authorized analytical facility may be a
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory in the United States or its equivalent in
a foreign jurisdiction.
           [00241] An authorized analytical facility is typically subject to oversight or regulation. For example, a
laboratory may have oversight by a board-certified entity (which may include one or more board-certified
personnel). In some embodiments, oversight can include validating one or more clinical test. Oversight may also
include assessing the performance of, correcting, calibrating, running controls, replicates, adjusting, or analyzing
one or more clinical test. Oversight can include evaluation of one or more sets of data to provide a quality control
for a clinical test. The authorized analytical facility can have one or more qualified person providing the oversight.
For example, one or more pathologist or other health care professional may review data and/or analysis that is
processed by the facility. At an authorized analytical facility, a trained pathologist or other certified health care
professional may provide oversight. In some instances, the certified health care professional providing oversight
may be one or more of the following: a doctor certified in pathology, a doctor with laboratory training or experience
in the specialty areas of service for which the health care professional is responsible, or an individual with
experience or laboratory training in the specialty.
           [00242] The oversight may further include the certified health care professional who may establish the
procedures and rules in the laboratory, deal with problems that arise, and/or train/evaluate the lab personnel.
Oversight may also include selecting test methodology, verifying test procedures and establishment of laboratory's
test performance characteristics, enrollment in participation in an HHS approved proficiency testing program,
establishing a quality control program appropriate for the testing performed, establishing the parameters for
                                                            -35-

acceptable levels of analytic performance, ensuring that those levels are maintained throughout the entire testing
process, resolving technical problems and ensuring that remedial actions are taken when test systems deviate from
the established performance specifications, ensuring patient test results are not reported until all corrective actions
have been taken, identifying training needs and assuring that each individual performing tests receives regular in
service training and education, evaluating the competency of all testing personnel and assuring that the staff
maintain their competency to perform test procedures (e.g., also procedures for evaluation of the staff: direct
observation of routine test performance, monitoring the recording/reporting of results, review of intermediate test
results, records, etc, observation of performance of instrument maintenance, assessment of test performance,
assessment of problem solving skills), and/or evaluating and documenting the performance of individuals
responsible for moderate complexity testing (e.g., semiannually during the first year; thereafter, at least annually
unless test methodology or instrumentation changes). Oversight may include reviewing and/or verifying
functionality of laboratory procedures or devices, and/or validity of data collected and/or generated. The oversight
may assure the quality of the rest and/or put the data into a condition upon which a health care professional can rely
upon it to provide a screening, diagnosis, treatment, including but not limited to prophylactic treatment. Oversight
may include reviewing a test empirically. Oversight may include one or more, two or more, or any of the number
of items described elsewhere herein.
           [00243]   In some instances, the oversight may be provided by an oversight software program rather than
the certified health care professional. In some instances, one, two or more of the types of oversight provided may
be implemented by an oversight software program. A combination of an oversight software program and health
care professional may be employed to provide oversight. In some instances, one, two or more of the types of
oversight may be implemented by a health care professional over a software program. For example, the health care
professional may determine the procedures and rules associated with the software program. In some instances, the
software program may be self-learning. The software program may access an increasing pool of data and/or
evolving rules or procedures.
           [00244] In some embodiments, the oversight software program may be provided on a device. The
oversight software program may be provided at a sample collection site, on or off the device. The software program
may be provided a laboratory, such as an authorized analytical facility. In some instances, the device may receive
updates to the oversight software program. The updates may or may not be provided by the laboratory. The
oversight software may be stored in a memory, and may include computer readable media comprising code,
instructions, or logics that may be capable of executing a step.
           [00245] In some instances, the oversight software may include one or more algorithm that may review a
qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the sample that may be performed. The oversight software program
may look for outliers, may determine whether the qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation was properly
performed, may perform one or more comparison with records or data points, may perform statistical analysis of the
evaluation, or any other oversight action as described elsewhere herein. The oversight software may be able to
perform one or more calibrations and/or diagnostics.
           [00246] A health care professional of an authorized analytical facility may receive and/or view data. A
health care professional of an authorized analytical facility may be affiliated with or associated with the authorized
analytical facility. In some instances, the health care professional may be employed by or under contract with the
                                                           -36-

authorized analytical facility. The health care professional may be located at the authorized analytical facility, may
be located remotely from the authorized analytical facility, or in another analytical facility (e.g., hospital, center of
excellence, specialized leading path/group). In some instances, the health care professional is not required to be on
site at all times while testing is performed, or when data is received at an authorized analytical facility, but may be
available on an as needed basis to provide consultation. The health care professional may be accessible to provide
on-site, telephone and/or electronic consultation.
            [00247] The health care professional providing oversight may be a different individual from or the same
individual as the health care professional that may receive a report from the authorized analytical facility for
diagnosing, treating, monitoring, or preventing a disease for the subject. For example, a pathologist of an
authorized analytical facility may be a different individual from a prescribing physician of the subject. A health
care professional of authorized analytical facility may be a reviewing health care professional or an overseeing
health care professional. The health care professional who may receive the report may be the health care
professional who has ordered the test that the subject has undertaken. A different health care professional may
provide analysis, and a different health care professional may provide oversight. Alternatively, the same health care
professional may provide both analysis and oversight.
            [00248] A designated sample collection site may be a point of service (POS) location. Any disclosure
herein of a sample collection site may also apply to a point of service location and vice versa. A point of service
location where a sample may be collected from a subject or provided by a subject may be a location remote to the
laboratory. The sample collection site may have a separate facility from a laboratory. The sample may or may not
be collected fresh from the subject at the sample collection site. Alternatively, the sample may be collected from
the subject elsewhere and brought to the sample collection site. A sample collection site at a point of service
location may be a blood collection center, or any other bodily fluid collection center. The sample collection site
may be a biological sample collection center. In some embodiments, a sample collection site may be a retailer.
Examples of retailers are provided in further detail elsewhere herein. Other examples of sample collection sites
may include hospitals, clinics, health care professionals' offices, schools, day-care centers, health centers, assisted
living residences, government offices, traveling medical care units, mobile units, emergency vehicles (e.g., air, boat,
ambulance), or the home. For example, a sample collection site may be a subject's home. A sample collection site
may be at a sample acquisition site and/or health assessment and/or treatment locations (which may include any of
the sample collection sites described elsewhere herein including but not limited to emergency rooms, doctors'
offices, urgent care, tents for screening (which may be in remote locations), a health care professional walking into
someone's house to provide home care). A sample collection site may be any location where a sample from the
subject is received by the device. Any location may be designated as a sample collection site. The designation may
be made by any party, including but not limited to the laboratory, entity associated with the laboratory,
governmental agency, or regulatory body. Any description herein relating to sample collection site or point of
service may relate to or be applied to retailers, hospitals, clinics, or any other examples provided herein and vice
versa.
            [00249] A device may be provided at the sample collection site. The device may be configured to accept a
sample. The device may be referred to as a sample collection device. The device may also be referred to as a
sample processing device. The device may also be referred to as a reader device. Any description of a reader
device may apply to any device that may be capable of receiving a sample and/or processing the sample. The
                                                            -37-

device may accept a sample collected from a subject at the sample collection site, or that the subject or subject's
proxy brings to the service location. The device may directly collect the sample from the subject, or an intermediate
device or technique may be used to collect the sample from the subject. Examples of collection techniques and
mechanisms are described in greater detail elsewhere herein.
          [00250] In some instances, the device may be placed in or on a subject. For example, a device may be
ingested by a subject (see e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0182738, U.S. Patent Publication No.
2006/0062852, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0147559, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2010/0081894, which are
hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety). The device may be a pill or have another format that may pass
through the digestive tract of a subject. The device may be implanted within the subject. For example, the device
may be subcutaneously implanted within the subject. In another example, the device may be worn by the subject.
The device may be attached to the subject via strap, adhesive, integrated into clothing, or any other technique. The
device may comprise one or more needle or microneedle that may penetrate the skin of the subject. The device may
be a patch that may be worn by the patient. The device may include an automated lancing cartridge. The cartridge
may be disposable. One or more disposable component may be used to collect a sample from a subject. The
disposable component may provide the sample to a non-disposable device. Alternatively, the disposable component
may be the sample processing device.
          [00251] The device may receive a sample from the subject at one time. Alternatively, the device may
periodically receive a sample from the subject. This may be at regularly scheduled intervals or in response to one or
more detected conditions. The device may optionally administer therapy to the subject. The device may administer
one or more therapeutic agent to the subject. The therapeutic agent may be administered at scheduled intervals or in
response to one or more detected conditions. The therapeutic agent may be administered in response to one or more
detected conditions from the sample.
          [00252] In some instances, the device may be provided to a subject at a designated sample collection site.
Alternatively, the subject may obtain or come into contact with the device at any other location.
          [00253] Examples of samples may include various fluid or solid samples. In some instances, the sample
can be a bodily fluid sample from the subject. The sample can be an aqueous or gaseous sample. In some
instances, solid or semi-solid samples can be provided. The sample can include tissues and/or cells collected from
the subject. The sample can be a biological sample. Examples of biological samples can include but are not limited

satellite, or pager networks, GPRS, or a local data transport system such as Ethernet or token ring over a LAN. In
some embodiments, the device may communicate wirelessly using infrared communication components. A device
130, personal computer, server, laptop computer, tablet, mobile phone, cell phone, satellite phone, smartphone (e.g.,
iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Palm, Symbian, Windows), personal digital assistant, Bluetooth device, pager, land
line phone, or other network device may be used in order to provide communications. Such devices may be
communication-enabled devices.
           [00263] The laboratory may communicate with a device at a sample collection site, or in or on a subject.
The device from the sample collection site may communicate with any communication-enabled device of the
laboratory. The device may provide data to a cloud computing infrastructure that may be accessed by any
communication-enabled device of the laboratory. The device may transmit data to the laboratory.
           [00264] The data provided by the device may include data relating to a sample from a subject. The data
may be information necessary and/or sufficient for a qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the sample. The
data may include information for oversight. The data may include information for analysis. The data may be an
electronic representation of a sample. An electronic representation of a sample may include an electronic
representation of the entire sample and/or any portion thereof. The data may be electronic data. In some instances,
the data may be electronic bits representative of the sample or reaction or reagents. The data may be digital and/or
analog. The data may be representative of one or more measurable parameter relating to, based on, or of the
sample.
           [00265] The data may be representative of a sample and/or any portion thereof. In some embodiments, the
data is representative of a preparation of the collected biological sample. The data may be collected prior to,
during, and/or after the preparation of the sample. The data may be collected over time. The data may comprise
information of one or more conditions under which a preparation of the collected biological sample occurs.
Examples of such conditions may comprise one or more characteristics listed from the group: amount of the
biological sample, concentration of the biological sample, quality of the biological sample, temperature, or
humidity. Such conditions may include environmental conditions. Environmental conditions may refer to
conditions of the sample, and/or the surroundings of the sample. The environmental conditions may be provided
prior to, during, and/or after the sample is received by the device, prepared by the device, and/or data is transmitted
by the device.
           [00266] The data may include amounts, concentrations, proportions, purity, or other information of
sample, reagents, diluents, wash, dyes or any other material that may be involved in the preparation of a sample,
reactions, and/or controls/calibrations on the device. Physical and/or chemical properties of a sample and/or other
materials, and/or a chemical reaction may be measured at one or more points in time, and may be aggregated as
data. In some embodiments, the data may determine whether a sample, reagent, diluents, wash, dye, or any other
material is suitable for use in the device for said sample preparation and/or to permit subsequent qualitative and/or

quantitative evaluation. For example, the data may be indicative of any error conditions that may indicate a sample
and/or any of the other materials have gone bad, or are otherwise unsuitable. In some instances, data is collected
during any processes the device is performing.
          [00267] In some embodiments, the data may be representative of a chemical reaction which may be run by
the device. The chemical reaction may include a chemical reaction with the sample, or without the sample. The
chemical reaction may include one or more reagents that may react with the sample. The chemical reaction may
include a control or calibration reaction. The data representative of the reaction may include one or more
measurement of the chemical reaction. The data may also include the rate or speed of the chemical reaction, and/or
the acceleration of the chemical reaction. The data may include how complete a chemical reaction is (e.g., whether
the chemical reaction has started, whether the chemical reaction is taking place, whether the chemical reaction is
complete, how far along the chemical reaction is -- e.g., 10%, 50%, etc.). The data may comprise information about
a control reaction and a chemical reaction involving the biological sample. These reactions may occur
simultaneously and/or sequentially. The data may pertain to one or more chemical reactions that may or may not
occur simultaneously. The data may pertain to one or more sample preparation step that may or may not occur
simultaneously. The data may also include physical processing, such as centrifugation, pulveration, or any other
actions described herein, which may be represented through bits of data. The data can be utilized for oversight
functionally performed on-board, remotely by a health care professional, and/or an external device configured to
render such oversight.
          [00268] The occurrence, progress, or results of a chemical reaction may be detected and measure by
colorimetric or other means. For example, chromogens (also termed herein, e.g., colorants, colored products, and
other terms) that may be used with systems, devices, and methods provided herein may include, for example, i)
substrates which may be oxidized (e.g. molecules that change color upon oxidization, such as by peroxidase and
hydrogen peroxide), for example: aniline derivatives [e.g. 2-amino-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid (AHBS)(forms a
yellow dye upon oxidation which may be monitored at 415 nm); N-(2-hydroxy-3-sulfopropyl)-3,5
dimethyoxyaniline (forms a dye upon oxidation that may be monitored at 610 nm)], o-dianisidine (forms a yellow
orange dye upon oxidation that may be monitored at 405 nm), 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (ADHP) (forms
a dye upon oxidation that may be monitored, for example, colorimetrically at 570 nm or fluorescently at EX/EM      =
535/587 nm), ii) substrates of kinases (e.g. molecules that change color upon phosphorylation), for example: iii)
substrates of phosphatases (e.g. molecules that change color upon dephosphorylation), for example: p-nitrophenyl
phosphate (pNPP) (forms p-nitrophenol upon dephosphorylation, which may be measured by absorbance at 405
nm); iv) substrates of hydrolases (e.g. molecules that change color upon hydrolysis), for example: ortho
nitrophenyl-beta-galactoside (ONPG) (may be hydrolyzed by beta-galactosidase to galactose and ortho-nitrophenol;
ortho-nitrophenol may be measured by absorbance at 420 nm); v) substrates which may change color upon complex
formation, for example: o-cresolphthalein (forms a complex with calcium, which may be measured by absorbance
at 575 nm).
          [00269] Hydrogen peroxide, in the presence of horseradish peroxidase and colorants such as an amino
antipyrene (e.g., 4-aminoantipyrene) and an aniline-containing compound (e.g., N-Ethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3
sulfopropyl)-3,5-dimethoxyaniline) may react to form a colored product (e.g., a Trinder (e.g., quinoneimine) dye as
indicated in the figure).
                                                          -42-

           [00270] For example, HRP may react with an aniline-containing compound such as N-Ethyl-N-(2
hydroxy-3-sflfopropyl)-3,5-dimethoxyaniline (ALPS), or with an aminoantipyrene compound such as 4
aminoantipyrene or with phenolic compounds. Thus, for example, a peroxidase (e.g., HRP, myeloperoxidase, or
other peroxidase), an aniline-containing compound, and an aminoantipyrene may all be termed "colorants" or
"chromagens." In further examples, HRP may react with a benzidine-containing compound (e.g., with
diaminobenzidine (DAB); tetramethylbenzidine(TMB); 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)
(DABS); 3-dimethylaminobenzoic acid (DMAB); hydroquinone; o-tolidine; o-phenylenediamine; o-chlorophenol;
p-hydroxy-benzenesulfonate; p-anisidine; a Trinder reagent (such as 4-aminoantipyrene,
mnethyibenzothiazoinonehydrazone (MBTH), or other compound for producing a Trinder dye); and derivatives and
related compounds) to form a colored product. HRP or other peroxidase may also react with other compounds to
form a chemiluminescent product; for example, HRP or other peroxidase may react with luminol to form a
chemiluminescent product (other molecules may be present, and may enhance such reactions; for example, HRP
mediated production of luminescent products from luminol is enhanced in the presence of 4-iodophenol).
           [00271] Further chromagens include, for example, alkaline phosphatase; resazurin (7-Hydroxy-3H
phenoxazin-3-one 10-oxide); 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red) and similar compounds (e.g.,
Amplex UltraRed (A36006 from Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA 92008); resorufin compounds (e.g., 7
ethoxyresorufin); dyes such as e.g., fluorescein, calcein, rhodamine, and ethidium dyes; N-methyl-4-hydrazino-7
nitrobenzofurazan; acridinium (acridine-9-carboxylic acid) esters and compounds which react with these
compounds to alter an optical property of a solution; phenols and phenol derivatives (e.g., p-iodophenol and p
phenylphenol); luminescent amines, including amine adducts (e.g., as may be derived from copper cyanide), and
other molecules. It will be understood that other enzymes and reactants may be used to form colored products, or to
detect an analyte in a biological sample, such as a blood sample.
           [00272] In some examples, the data may be one or more image, and/or audio data representative of the
sample. An image may be a digital image or an analog image. The audio data may be digital and/or analog. The
data may include a video representative of the sample. An image may include a video image. The data may include
electronic data representative of a digital image and/or audio data of the sample. In one example, the data may
include video imaging that may capture changes over time. For example, a video may be provided to provide
evaluation on dynamic actions, such as lysing, agglutination, mixing, movement of cells or other molecules in a
sample or matrix, or assays.
           [00273] The data may be collected at one time, or at a plurality of times. The data may be collected at
discrete points in time, or may be continuously collected over time. Data collected over time may be aggregated
and/or analyzed. In some instances, data may be aggregated and may be useful for longitudinal analysis over time
to facilitate screening, diagnosis, treatment, and/or disease prevention.
           [00274] Data may be collected from a device over time. The aggregated data from a single device for a
given sample may be useful to facilitate the qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the sample. For example, it
may be useful to determine how a sample reacts and/or changes over time in order to provide a screening, diagnosis,
treatment, and/or disease prevention.
           [00275] In some embodiments, data may be displayed in a lab report, medical record, or any other type of
display. The display may show patient health, provider's level of care, disease regression, progression, and/or onset
                                                           -43-

through longitudinal analysis of high integrity data that is may be obtainable more frequently or obtained frequently
through the described infrastructure over time.
           [00276] Data may be collected from multiple devices. The aggregated data from multiple devices may be
useful to facilitate the qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the sample. The aggregated data may include
data relating to samples collected from a single subject, received at the multiple devices. Alternatively, the
aggregated data may include data relating to samples collected from other subjects, received at the multiple devices.
The aggregated data may be collected and/or stored in a database. The database may be accessed to provide data to
perform a longitudinal analysis that takes past collected data into account. Trends, and changes over time may be
monitored. The multiple devices may be standardized and/or may provide data that is of sufficient quality,
precision, and/or accuracy in order to aggregate the data and perform a longitudinal analysis therefrom. Very little
or no variation may be provided between devices. The devices may also create standardized environments in which
the sample preparation may occur. The standardized environments may also be provided during a chemical
reaction. The devices may also provide standardized pre-analytic steps. The multiple devices may be distributed
globally. This may provide a global evaluation infrastructure, which may better permit the monitoring of disease
progression and/or regression. By standardizing a device, data may be longitudinally analyzed looking at velocity
of markers in one or more subject over time. The data may be analyzed and/or displayed in a form of lab report or
electronic medical record or decision support system for consumers, providers, and/or payers (e.g., health plans,
employers, governmental payers, etc.). Such display may include displays of data over time, which may include
trending analysis or other analysis relating to changes in values, rates of changes, or rates of rates of change.
           [00277] The data may be of a quality suitable for a longitudinal analysis over time. The suitable quality of
data may be useful for lab reports and/or electronic medical records that may incorporate data collected over time.
This may include data collected over long periods of time (e.g., multiple visits, or based off multiple samples), or
shorter periods of time (within a single visit, or based on single received sample). The data may have a sufficient
quality, precision, and/or accuracy for longitudinal analysis. For example, the sample may be collected from a
subject a plurality of times. The sample may be collected from the subject at different times. The samples may be
collected at predetermined intervals or according to a predetermined schedule. Alternatively, samples may be
collected from the subject when one or more condition or event triggers the collection. Multiple collections of
samples may permit the sample to be analyzed over a period of time, thereby permitting longitudinal analysis. In
some embodiments, in order to permit longitudinal analysis, the data may have a high degree of precision and/or
accuracy. In one example, the data may have a coefficient of variation of 20% or less, 15% or less, 10% or less, 9
% or less, 8% or less, 7% or less, 6% or less, 5% or less, 4% or less, 3% or less, 2% or less, 1%or less, 0.5% or
less, or 0.1% or less over time. In some instances, the multiple devices may provide data having a coefficient of
variation of 20% or less, 15% or less, 10% or less, 9 % or less, 8 % or less, 7% or less, 6 % or less, 5% or less, 4% or
less, 3% or less, 2% or less, 1% or less, 0.5% or less, or 0.1% or less over time.
           [00278] The data over time may be analyzed longitudinally. This may include the change in data over
time, the rate of change of data over time, the rate of change of the rate of change of data over time, or any
derivative thereof. For example, velocity and/or acceleration of data change may be collected and/or analyzed. The
increase and/or decrease in the data values and/or the various rates of change may be beneficial in determining a
screening, diagnosis, treatment, and/or disease prevention.

           [00279] The device is capable of processing a sample collected from a subject to yield data for subsequent
analysis. The device may be configured to facilitate collection of the sample from the subject. The device may be
configured to receive the sample from the subject. The device may be configured to prepare the sample for a
clinical test to detect and/or quantitate an analyte of interest. The device may comprise one or more reagents useful
for the clinical test. The preparation or the clinical test may include a chemical reaction with the reagents. The
device may include one or more detector that may be capable of detecting signals generated from processing the
sample. The device may transmit data relating to the sample. The data relating to the sample may include the raw
data from the detected signals, such signals relating to unreacted sample, a sample that has undergone a reaction,
and/or device configurations. In some instances, the device may pre-process some of the raw data to get it into a
desired format, and transmit the pre-processed data. In some instances, the device may perform one or more
analysis step, and transmit analyzed data. Alternatively, the device does not perform any pre-processing and/or
analysis. The pre-processing and/or analysis may occur at the laboratory. In some instances, pre-processing and/or
analysis may occur at both the device and the laboratory. The laboratory may also include a hospital who may be
leveraging its pathologists so data can be transmitted to centers of excellence for the analysis of different types of
specific conditions.
           [00280] In embodiments, a device may monitor its environment, including its internal and external
environment. In embodiments, a device may provide device environmental information to a laboratory. Device
environmental information includes, e.g., internal temperature, external temperature, internal humidity, external
humidity, time, status of components, error codes, images from an internal camera, images from an external camera,
air pressure (barometric pressure), and other information. In embodiments, an internal camera may be fixed at an
internal location. In embodiments, an internal camera may be fixed at an internal location and may be configured to
rotate, scan, or otherwise provide views of multiple areas or regions within the device. In embodiments, an internal
camera may be movable within the device; for example, an internal camera may be mounted on a movable element,
such as a pipette, within the device. In embodiments, an internal camera may be movable within the device and may
be configured to rotate, scan, or otherwise provide multiple views of areas within the device from multiple locations
within the device. In embodiments, an external camera may be fixed at an external location. In embodiments, an
external camera may be fixed at an external location and may be configured to rotate, scan, or otherwise provide
multiple views of areas outside the device. In embodiments, an external camera may be movable on or around the
outside of the device. In embodiments, an external camera may be movable and may be configured to rotate, scan,
or otherwise provide multiple views of areas outside the device from multiple locations on or around the outside of
the device.
           [00281] Thus, in embodiments, monitoring, and reporting the results of such monitoring, of the device
environment may be part of the oversight of the operation of the device and of the integrity of results and analysis.
Such monitoring provides information, oversight, and control of quality regarding the device and its output (of the
condition, operation, results generated, and data transmitted). Such monitoring may include: measurement and
control of air temperature; measurement and control of liquid (volume, temperature, mixing, etc.); monitoring of
sample collection; imaging of a cartridge to determine the position of a cartridge in the device; imaging of a
cartridge to correct its position, if necessary, per such imaging of the cartridge in the device; imaging of tips to
confirm proper engagement with pipette nozzles; imaging of liquid volumes in tips; imaging of bubbles in liquids, if
any; imaging of samples to assess sample volume, sample quality and presence or absence of conditions which may
                                                            -45-

interfere with proper processing or analysis (such as hemolysis, lipemic, icteric conditions of a sample); feedback
control and error detection of status and condition of motors on a pipette for control and oversight concerning
accurate aspiration and dispensing of liquids; feedback control and error detection of a centrifuge for precise
centrifugal force control, determination of position, and other information regarding status and condition of a
centrifuge; feedback control and error detection for gantry, robots and shuttle positions, including or oversight and
control of the positioning of pipettes, cartridges, and tips/cuvettes for processing and analysis of a sample; control
of reactions (between a sample and a reagent) to confirm proper device operation (e.g., using sensors, pipette,
gantry, thermal sensors and control, etc.); monitoring and control of the proper state of reagents; the running of
control reactions at the same time as the sample analysis, or beforehand or subsequently; performance of replicate
analysis of the sample to enhance precision; performing blank reads to control for possible changes in background
signals in samples and for possible small fluctuations in sensor performance and in output of light sources.
          [00282] In embodiments, monitoring, and reporting the results of such monitoring, may include
calibration. Calibration of the device, reagents, disposables, and of their manufacture and assembly may be part of
the oversight of the operation of the device and of the integrity of results and analysis. During manufacturing, each
device is calibrated to a set of controlled standards. During manufacturing, reagents and disposables (e.g., tips,
cuvettes, and other elements) is calibrated to a set of controlled standards, and identification information related to
each cartridge containing these reagents and disposables includes information about these calibrations. Such
calibration may include: each pipette nozzle of each pipette is calibrated - for example, for each pipette nozzle,
information regarding how a given displacement of the motor translates to a given amount of liquid volume is
measured and provided in the information recorded for each motor for use in protocols used with the device in
which that motor is a component; each sensor and illumination source in a device is calibrated against a set of
controlled standards, and provided in the information for each device, so that the resulting signals from all sensors
across all devices results in the same measurement; each motor control algorithm is calibrated during manufacturing
such that speeds and position of the motors can be controlled similarly across each device; each camera and each
illumination source is characterized, including a flat field correction; during manufacturing, each of lot reagents is
calibrated such that any change in potency of the reagents still results in the same analytic result. Thus, since each
sample is analyzed by processing on the device (for which such component and device specific calibration
information is known) the raw data resulting from sample processing can be calibrated and corrected according to
the information and calibrations for each reagent, and each device and its components. Such oversight and
calibration insures the integrity of the results obtained, and thus also provides for the integrity of analysis of such
results. The raw data from a device is analyzed by utilizing the device-specific calibration and the reagent lot
specific calibration to arrive at the result. Each result arrived at in this way is thus accurate, precise, and reliable,
and may be compared with analogous results obtained from other samples in the same instrument, and with other
instruments and samples, reducing variance and errors and allowing for better analysis and better confidence in
diagnoses and inferences drawn from the analysis of samples.
          [00283] Quality control runs may be performed on a device and reagents on a periodic basis, e.g., as
overseen by CLIA, to ensure that the reagents and devices are still performing within specifications. If
discrepancies are found, reagents and/or devices may be determined to need recalibration. Devices can be
recalibrated in the field by running defined protocols, which may or may not require inserting a calibration cartridge
into the device. Reagents may be recalibrated by generating a standard curve using the same lot of reagents and
                                                             -46-

deriving a calibration function. Such reagent recalibration can performed on any one of the devices and can be
applied to all devices.
          [00284] Transmission of device environmental information to a laboratory is useful for the oversight and
control of the device, including being useful for the oversight and control of the operation of the device.
Transmission of device environmental information to a laboratory is useful for maintaining the integrity of the
operation and control of the device, quality control of the operation and control of the device, and for reducing
variation or error in the data collection and sample processing performed by the device. Device environmental
information may be used, for example, by a laboratory to modify, correct, or update a protocol or other instruction
or command to a device. Device environmental information may be used, for example, by a laboratory to modify,
correct, or update an analysis of data received from a device. For example, transmission of temperature information
to a laboratory is useful for the oversight and control of the device, and is useful in the analysis by the laboratory of
data provided by the device to the laboratory.
          [00285] In embodiments, a device may be configured to control the temperature within the device, or
within a portion of the device. Such control improves the reproducibility of measurements made within the device,
may unify or provide regularity of conditions for all samples, and reduce the variability of measurements and data,
e.g., as measured by the coefficient of variance of multiple measurements or replicate measurements. Temperature
information may be useful for quality control. In embodiments, a device may monitor temperature and control its
internal temperature. Temperature control may be useful for quality control. A device that monitors and controls its
temperature may transmit temperature information to a laboratory; a laboratory may use such temperature
information in the control of the operation of the instrument, in the oversight of the instrument, and in the analysis
of data transmitted from the instrument.
          [00286] In embodiments, a device may be configured to acquire images from within the device, or within
a portion of the device. Such images may provide information about the position, condition, availability, or other
information regarding components, reagents, supplies, or samples within the device, and may provide information
used in control of the operation of the device. Such images may be useful for quality control. A device that acquires
images from within the device may transmit image information to a laboratory; a laboratory may use such image
information in the control of the operation of the instrument, in the oversight of the instrument, and in the analysis
of data transmitted from the instrument.
          [00287] In one scenario, a device may perform a sample preparation step without performing any analysis
or receiving any oversight. The data from the sample preparation step may be sent to the laboratory, which may
perform the analysis, and which may be an authorized analytical facility that includes oversight. In another
scenario, the device may perform one or more sample preparation step and may perform analysis on board. Data
from the analysis may be sent to an authorized analytical facility, which may provide oversight. Alternatively,
oversight may occur on board the device.
          [00288] In some embodiments, oversight may include a review of the data in raw form, pre-processed
form, or after analysis. Oversight may occur of a qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the sample.
Examples of a qualitative evaluation of the sample may include but are not limited to review of an image, video, or
audio file. Examples of a quantitative evaluation of the sample may include a numerical value indicating a presence
or concentration level of a signal, series of signals, or an analyte. Oversight may include one or more, or two or
                                                            -47-

more of the examples provided elsewhere herein. Oversight may be provided by a health care professional of an
authorized analytical facility. In some other instances, oversight may be provided by a software program or
automated review system. The software program and/or automated review system may or may not be under the
review or care of a qualified person, such as a health care professional (such as a laboratory director).
          [00289] The device may duplicate manual analytical procedures. In some instances, the device may
perform automatically various steps, such as pipetting, preparing filtrates, heating, and/or measuring color intensity.
The device may be used in conjunction with materials to measure one or more analytes. The device may measure
the presence or concentration of one or more analytes. The device may include reagent-containing components that
may serve as reaction units. Examples of device components and steps that may be taken by the device can be
described in greater detail elsewhere herein.
          [00290] The laboratory may communicate with a health care professional. The laboratory may generate a
report based on analyzed data. In some instances, the laboratory may analyze raw data or pre-processed data
provided from the device. Alternatively, the laboratory may receive analyzed data from the device. The laboratory
may or may not perform further analysis and/or oversight from analyzed data received from the device.
          [00291] The laboratory and/or device may generate a report that may present the analyzed data in a
meaningful or desired manner. The report may have a format that may enable a viewer of the report to rely on the
report to make a medical determination. The laboratory and/or device may transmit the report to a health care
professional (or laboratory director). In some embodiments, a pathologist, other health care professional, or other
qualified person may review the report prior to transmitting the report to the health care professional. A reviewing
health care professional may review the report or qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation useful for generating the
report prior to transmission to an ordering health care professional. Review or oversight may occur of the analyzed
data and/or report at the laboratory. Alternatively, review or oversight may occur on-board the device. The health
care professional who receives the report may or may not rely on the report for screening, diagnosis, treatment
and/or disease prevention of the subject.
          [00292] The laboratory and/or device may also provide a report to the subject. The report provided to the
subject may be the same as or different from the report provided to the health care professional. The report
provided to the health care professional may have more detail or vice versa. The formats between the reports
provided to the subject and the health care professional may or may not vary. Alternatively, the laboratory and/or
device does not provide a report to the subject. The subject may receive information based on the report from the
health care professional. A device or laboratory can directly provide a lab report automatically to a consumer upon
a test being performed and/or analysis being done, or being sent to a physician for review and/or after the
physician's review.
          [00293] Any transmission of data and/or reports may incorporate the use of a cloud computing
infrastructure. The sending party may provide the data to or have the data on a cloud computing infrastructure. The
receiving party and/or parties (e.g., health care professional or patient) may access the cloud computing
infrastructure. The cloud computing infrastructure may be provided on the sending party side and/or the receiving
party side. Alternatively, traditional fixed data storage techniques may be employed.
          [00294] FIG. 1B shows a retailer 170 having a processing device 172 in communication with a laboratory
160. The laboratory or reader device may be in communication with a health care professional 150. As previously
                                                           -48-

described, any discussion herein of retailers or other examples of sample collection sites may apply to any type of
sample collection site, and vice versa. A retailer may be provided at a first location and a health care professional
may be provided at a second location. The first location and the second location may be different locations. In
some embodiments, the first and second locations are not proximate to one another. A laboratory may be provided
at a third location. The third location may be a different location from the first and/or second location. For
example, the first, second, and third locations need not be proximate to one another. The first, second, and/or third
locations may be located in different facilities. Alternatively, the first, second, and/or third could all be the same
location (point of service).
           [00295] A retailer may be an entity that sells a product or service. In some embodiments, the product or
service may relate to health or medical care. For example, the retailer may sell medicine or health care supplies
and/or insurance. In some embodiments, a retailer may be a pharmacy (e.g., retail pharmacy, clinical pharmacy,
hospital pharmacy), drugstore, chain store, supermarket, or grocer. Examples of retailers may include but are not
limited to Walgreens, CVS Pharmacy, Duane Reade, Walmart, Target, Rite Aid, Kroger, Costco, Kaiser
Permanente, or Sears.
           [00296] A retailer may be provided at a retailer location. In some embodiments, the retailer may be at a
different geographic location than a health care professional and/or laboratory location. Alternatively, the health
care professional may be provided at the retailer location.
           [00297] A retailer 170 may have a sample processing device 172 at the retailer's location. In some
embodiments, the retailer may have one or more, two or more, three or more, four or more, five or more, six or
more, or ten or more sample processing devices at the retailer's location. The sample processing device may be a
point of service device. The sample processing devices may be capable of communication with communication
enabled devices. For example, the sample processing devices at a retailer location may communicate with one
another. Alternatively, sample processing devices may communicate with other reader devices at different
locations, such as other sample collection sites, or in or on a subject. Sample processing devices may communicate
with other types of communication-enabled devices, such as a computer at a laboratory and/or biometric devices.
Such communications may be wired or wireless.
           [00298] The sample processing device 172 may be configured to accept a sample. The sample processing
device may be configured to collect the sample directly from a subject. The sample processing device may be
configured to perform one or more sample preparation step on the subject. The sample processing device may be
configured to run an assay. In some embodiments, the sample processing device may be configured to run one or
more assay. The sample processing device may be capable of performing multiplexed assays on a single sample.
Where desired, the device is configured to perform at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 500,
1000 or more assays. The plurality of assays may be run simultaneously in parallel. One or more control assays
and/or calibrators (e.g., including a configuration with a control of a calibrator for the assay/tests) can also be
incorporated into the device to be performed in parallel if desired. In some instances, assays may be run in
sequence, or any combination of in sequence and in parallel, based on the sample. The reader device may be
effecting one, two, or more chemical reactions or other processing tests (e.g., pulverizing). The sample processing
device may be configured to detect one or more signal relating to the sample. The sample may be a sample of
bodily fluid, a biological sample, or any other example as provided elsewhere herein.
                                                            -49-

           [00299] In some embodiments, the sample processing device 172 may comprise a cartridge 174. The
cartridge may be removable from the sample processing device. In some embodiments, a sample may be provided
to the cartridge of the sample processing device. Alternatively, the sample may be provided to another portion of
the sample processing device. The cartridge and/or device may comprise a sample collection unit that may be
configured to accept a sample. The sample processing device is described in further detail elsewhere herein. The
cartridge and device may be integrated into a single device or may be separable devices. A device may include a
pill or patch that may link to a mobile device or other network device for processing.
           [00300] A subject 176 may be provided at the retailer 170. The subject may provide a sample of bodily
fluid to the sample processing device 172 and/or cartridge 174 of the device. A bodily fluid may be drawn from a
subject and provided to a device in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, fingerstick, lancing, injection,
and/or pipetting. The bodily fluid may be collected using venous, or non-venous methods. The bodily fluid may be
provided using a bodily fluid collector. A bodily fluid collector may include a lancet, microneedle, porous
membrane (e.g., for a pill), capillary, tube, pipette, syringe, venous draw, or any other collector described elsewhere
herein. In one embodiment, a lancet punctures the skin and withdraws a sample using, for example, gravity,
capillary action, aspiration, or vacuum force. The lancet may be part of the sample processing device, part of the
cartridge of the device, part of a system, or a standalone component. Where needed, the lancet may be activated by
a variety of mechanical, electrical, electromechanical, or any other known activation mechanism or any
combination of such methods. In one example, a subject's finger (or other portion of the subject's body) may be
punctured to yield a bodily fluid. The bodily fluid may be collected using a capillary tube, pipette, or any other
mechanism known in the art. The capillary tube or pipette may be separate from the device and/or cartridge, or may
be a part of a device and/or cartridge. A transfer device may require no additional processing steps, and may be
pre-coated with anti-coagulants or other pre-treatments in a single step. In another embodiment where no active
mechanism is required, a subject can simply provide a bodily fluid to the device and/or cartridge, as for example,
could occur with a saliva sample, or touching a pierced body part to a surface directly. The collected fluid can be
placed within the device. A bodily fluid collector may be attached to the device, removably attachable to the
device, or may be provided separately from the device.
           [00301] A cartridge 174 may be inserted into the sample processing device 172 or otherwise interfaced
with the sample processing device. The cartridge may be removed from the sample processing device. In one
example, a sample may be provided to a sample collection unit of the cartridge. The sample may be provided
directly to the cartridge. The sample may or may not be provided to the sample collection unit via a bodily fluid
collector. A bodily fluid collector may be attached to the cartridge, removably attachable to the cartridge, or may
be provided separately from the cartridge. The bodily fluid collector may or may not be integral to the sample
collection unit. The cartridge may then be inserted into the sample processing device. Alternatively, the sample
may be provided directly to the sample processing device, which may or may not utilize the cartridge. The
cartridge may comprise one or more reagents, which may be used in the operation of the sample processing device.
Alternatively, one or more reagents may already be provided onboard the sample processing device.
           [00302] The cartridge may or may not be disposable. Cartridges may be specially configured for one or
more types of clinical tests. For example, a first cartridge may have a first configuration to enable a first set of tests,
and a second cartridge may have a second configuration to enable a second set of tests. Alternatively, universal
                                                            -50-

cartridges that may be configured for the same selection of tests may be provided. In some instances, universal
cartridges may be dynamically programmed for certain tests through remote or on-board protocols.
           [00303] When a cartridge is inserted into the sample processing device, one or more components of the
cartridge may be brought into fluid communication with other components of the sample processing device. For
example, if a sample is collected at a cartridge, the sample may be transferred to other portions of the sample
processing device. Similarly, if one or more reagents are provided on a cartridge, the reagents may be transferred to
other portions of the sample processing device, or other components of the sample processing device may be
brought to the reagents. One or more components of the cartridge may be transferred in an automated fashion to
other portions of the sample processing device, and vice versa. In some embodiments, the reagents or components
of a cartridge may remain on-board the cartridge. In some embodiments, no fluidics are included that require
tubing or maintenance (e.g., manual or automated maintenance).
           [00304] The sample processing device may be configured to be placed in or on a subject. The sample
processing device may receive a sample from the subject through a housing of the device. For example, if the
sample processing device is ingestible or implanted within a subject, it may include a housing or a biocompatible
coating. The biocompatible coating may be permeable to the desired sample. The sample may penetrate the
coating or housing of the sample processing device, thereby being received by the sample processing device. If the
sample processing device is on the subject, the sample may be received through the housing and/or coating of the
device. Alternatively, the sample may be received using one or more needle or microneedle that may be provided
on the device (which may or may not be provided on the cartridge portion of the device).
           [00305] The sample processing device may be configured to facilitate sample collection, prepare the
sample for a clinical test, and/or may comprise one or more reagents useful for a clinical test. In some
embodiments, the sample processing device may be configured to run one or more test from the sample. A
chemical reaction or other processing step may be performed, with or without the sample. In some embodiments,
assays, such as immunoassays or nucleic acid assays may be run. Examples of steps and/or tests that may be
prepared or run by the device may include, but are not limited to immunoassay, nucleic acid assay, receptor-based
assay, cytometric assay, colorimetric assay, enzymatic assay, electrophoretic assay, electrochemical assay,
spectroscopic assay, chromatographic assay, microscopic assay, topographic assay, calorimetric assay, turbidmetric
assay, agglutination assay, radioisotope assay, viscometric assay, coagulation assay, clotting time assay, protein
synthesis assay, histological assay, culture assay, osmolarity assay, and/or other types of assays, centrifugation,
separation, filtration, dilution, enriching, purification, precipitation, pulverization, incubation, pipetting, transport,
cell lysis, or other sample preparation steps, or combinations thereof. Sample processing may include chemical
reactions and/or physical processing. Sample processing may include the assessment of histology, morphology,
kinematics, dynamics, and/or state of a sample, which may include such assessment for cells. The device may
perform one or more, two or more, three or more, or four or more of these steps/tests.
           [00306] Processing of a biological sample may include preprocessing (e.g., preparation of a sample for a
subsequent processing or measurement), processing (e.g., alteration of a sample so that it differs from its original, or
previous, state), and post-processing (e.g., fixing a sample, or disposing of all or a portion of a sample following its
measurement or use). A biological sample may be divided into portions, such as aliquots of a blood or urine sample,
or such as slicing, mincing, or dividing a tissue sample into two or more pieces. Processing of a biological sample,
                                                             -51-

such as blood sample, may include mixing, stirring, sonication, homogenization, or other processing of a sample or
of a portion of the sample. Processing of a biological sample, such as blood sample, may include centrifugation of a
sample or a portion thereof. Processing of a biological sample, such as blood sample, may include providing time
for components of the sample to separate or settle, and may include filtration (e.g., passing the sample or a portion
thereof through a filter). Processing of a biological sample, such as blood sample, may include allowing or causing
a blood sample to coagulate. Processing of a biological sample, such as blood sample, may include concentration of
the sample, or of a portion of the sample (e.g., by sedimentation or centrifugation of a blood sample, or of a solution
containing a homogenate of tissue from a tissue sample) to provide a pellet and a supernatant. Processing of a
biological sample, such as blood sample, may include dilution of a portion of the sample. Dilution may be of an
entire sample, or of a portion of a sample, including dilution of a pellet or of a supernatant from sample. A
biological sample may be diluted with water, or with a saline solution, such as a buffered saline solution. A
biological sample may be diluted with a solution which may or may not include a fixative (e.g., formaldehyde,
paraformaldehyde, or other agent which cross-links proteins). A biological sample may be diluted with a solution
effective that an osmotic gradient is produced between the surrounding solution and the interior, or an interior
compartment, of such cells, effective that the cell volume is altered. For example, where the resulting solution
concentration following dilution is less than the effective concentration of the interior of a cell, or of an interior cell
compartment, the volume of such a cell will increase (i.e., the cell will swell). A biological sample may be diluted
with a solution which may or may not include an osmoticant (such as, for example, glucose, sucrose, or other sugar;
salts such as sodium, potassium, ammonium, or other salt; or other osmotically active compound or ingredient). In
embodiments, an osmoticant may be effective to maintain the integrity of cells in the sample, by, for example,
stabilizing or reducing possible osmotic gradients between the surrounding solution and the interior, or an interior
compartment, of such cells. In embodiments, an osmoticant may be effective to provide or to increase osmotic
gradients between the surrounding solution and the interior, or an interior compartment, of such cells, effective that
the cells at least partially collapse (where the cellular interior or an interior compartment is less concentrated than
the surrounding solution), or effective that the cells swell (where the cellular interior or an interior compartment is
more concentrated than the surrounding solution).
           [00307] A biological sample may be dyed, or markers may be added to the sample, or the sample may be
otherwise prepared for detection, visualization, or quantification of the sample, a portion of a sample, a component
part of a sample, or a portion of a cell or structure within a sample. For example, a biological sample may be
contacted with a solution containing a dye. A dye may stain or otherwise make visible a cell, or a portion of a cell,
or a material or molecule associated with a cell in a sample. A dye may bind to or be altered by an element,
compound, or other component of a sample; for example a dye may change color, or otherwise alter one of more of
its properties, including its optical properties, in response to a change or differential in the pH of a solution in which
it is present; a dye may change color, or otherwise alter one of more of its properties, including its optical
properties, in response to a change or differential in the concentration of an element or compound (e.g., sodium,
calcium, C02, glucose, or other ion, element, or compound) present in a solution in which the dye is present. For
example, a biological sample may be contacted with a solution containing an antibody or an antibody fragment. For
example, a biological sample may be contacted with a solution that includes particles. Particles added to a
biological sample may serve as standards (e.g., may serve as size standards, where the size or size distribution of the
particles is known, or as concentration standards, where the number, amount, or concentration of the particles is
                                                             -52-

known), or may serve as markers (e.g., where the particles bind or adhere to particular cells or types of cells, to
particular cell markers or cellular compartments, or where the particles bind to all cells in a sample).
          [00308] The sample processing device may be configured to perform one, two or more assays on a small
sample of bodily fluid. One or more chemical reaction may take place on a sample having a volume, as described
elsewhere herein. For example one or more chemical reaction may take place in a pill having less than femtoliter
volumes. In an instance, the sample collection unit is configured to receive a volume of the bodily fluid sample
equivalent to a single drop or less of blood or interstitial fluid. The sample collection unit may be able to collect a
volume of bodily fluid sample without piercing a subject's skin. In one example, light may be shined to optically
measure a sample. In additional examples, ultrasound, MRI, or a scan may be used to perform analysis non
invasively.
          [00309] The device may be capable of performing all on-board steps in a short amount of time. For
example, from sample collection from a subject to transmitting data and/or to analysis may take about 3 hours or
less, 2 hours or less, 1 hour or less, 50 minutes or less, 45 minutes or less, 40 minutes or less, 30 minutes or less, 20
minutes or less, 15 minutes or less, 10 minutes or less, 5 minutes or less, 4 minutes or less, 3 minutes or less, 2
minutes or less, 1 minute or less, 50 seconds or less, 40 seconds or less, 30 seconds or less, 20 seconds or less, 10
seconds or less, 5 seconds or less, 3 seconds or less, 1 second or less, 500 ms or less, 200 ms or less, or 100 ms or
less. The amount of time from accepting a sample within the device to transmitting data and/or to analysis from the
device may take about 3 hours or less, 2 hours or less, 1 hour or less, 50 minutes or less, 45 minutes or less, 40
minutes or less, 30 minutes or less, 20 minutes or less, 15 minutes or less, 10 minutes or less, 5 minutes or less, 4
minutes or less, 3 minutes or less, 2 minutes or less, 1 minute or less, 50 seconds or less, 40 seconds or less, 30
seconds or less, 20 seconds or less, 10 seconds or less, 5 seconds or less, 3 seconds or less, 1 second or less, 500 ms
or less, 200 ms or less, or 100 ms or less.
          [00310] A laboratory, device, or other entity or software may perform analysis on the data in real-time.
Analysis may include qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of a sample. A laboratory, device, or other entity
may analyze the data within 48 hours or less, 36 hours or less, 24 hours or less, 12 hours or less, 8 hours or less, 6
hours or less, 4 hours or less, 3 hours or less, 2 hours or less, 1 hour or less, 45 minutes or less, 30 minutes or less,
20 minutes or less, 15 minutes or less, 10 minutes or less, 5 minutes or less, 3 minutes or less, 1 minute or less, 30
seconds or less, 15 seconds or less, 10 seconds or less, 5 seconds or less, or 1 second or less. The analysis may
include the comparison of the data with one or more threshold value. The analysis may or may not include review
by a pathologist or other qualified person. The time included for analysis may or may not include time to generate a
report based on the data. The time included for analysis may or may not include the time it takes to transmit a
report to a health care professional.
          [00311] A device 172 may be provided to a sample collection site 170 by a laboratory 160. The device
may be sold to the sample collection site, leased/rented by the sample collection site, or the sample collection site
may be used as a location at which the laboratory may conduct sample collection and/or other steps.
          [00312] Similarly, one or more cartridge 174 may be provided to the sample collection site 170 by the
laboratory 160. Alternatively, the cartridge may be provided by another source. The cartridge may be sold to the
sample collection site, leased/rented by the sample collection site, or may be utilized as part of the location where
                                                             -53-

the laboratory may collect samples and/or perform other steps. The cartridge may be from a same or different
source as the device.
           [00313] A laboratory 160 may have a processor 162 and a communication unit 164. A laboratory may be
provided within a facility. The processor and communication unit may be provided within the facility. The
laboratory may have one or a plurality of processors and one or a plurality of communication units.
           [00314] A processor 162 may be configured to generate a report for a health care professional 150. The
processor may be on a server side with a software performing the processing. The processor may generate the
report based on data received from the sample processing device 172 or may provide oversight or analysis. The
processor may perform qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the sample. In some embodiments, the
processor may compare data received from the sample processing device with a threshold value. The threshold
value may be for one or more analyte. Said comparison may include a comparison of whether a data value is
greater than, equal to, or less than a threshold value. The comparison may include whether the data value is
qualitatively and/or quantitatively the same as the threshold value. The comparison may include one or more forms
of statistical or physiological analysis of the data in relation to one or more stored values. Examples may include
best-fit analysis, and/or analysis such as curve fitting, extrapolation, interpolation, regression analysis, least squares,
mean calculations, multivariate, simulation analysis, or variation calculations. The processor may analyze the data
received from the sample processing device. The processor may be configured to perform one or more steps for
statistical analysis of the data.
           [00315] In some embodiments, a threshold value may refer to a single value. The threshold value may be
a numerical value or an alphanumeric value. The threshold value may be a string or any other form of data. The
threshold value may refer to a range of values and/or set of values. A threshold value may refer to a single value or
a plurality of values. A plurality of values may fall within one or more continuous spectrum. Alternatively, the
plurality of values may be discrete. Examples of threshold ranges may include 1-100 units, or 5-10 units, and
examples of threshold sets may include values falling within a list selected from 1 unit, 3 units, 5 units, 8 units, 13
units, 20 units, or 50 units. A unit may refer to any dimension or measureable quantity. Such values are provided
by way of example only. In some instances, the processor may compare one or more image, video, or audio file or
other data. The processor may make such comparisons against one or more reference image, video, or audio file or
other data. An algorithm may be capable of evaluating one or more feature of the files or other data. In some
instances, the processor may automatically sort the files for viewing by a health care professional.
           [00316] The processor may be able to access one or more data storage unit 166a, 166b which may contain
stored information. The stored information may include the threshold value for one or more analyte. The threshold
value may be useful for determining the presence or concentration of the one or more analyte. The threshold value
may be useful for detecting situations where an alert may be useful. The data storage unit may include any other
information relating to sample preparation or clinical tests that may be run on a sample. The data storage unit may
include records or other information that may be useful for generating a report for a health care professional. The
data storage units may also be capable of storing computer readable media which may include code, logic, or
instructions for the processor to perform one or more step.
           [00317] In some embodiments, a data storage unit 166a may be provided at the laboratory 160. The
processor may be able to access the local data storage unit. In another embodiment, the data storage unit 166b may
                                                             -54-

be provided remote to the laboratory. For example, the data storage unit may be provided at a sample collection site
170 or with a health care professional 150. The data storage unit may be provided on the device. Alternatively, the
data storage unit may be provided at any other location. Any combination of data storage unit locations may be
utilized by the processor. For example, the processor may access data storage units that may be provided at the
laboratory and external to the laboratory.
          [00318] In some embodiments, the data storage units may be electronic medical records (EMR) or EMR
databases. The data storage units may contain information associated with a subject. The information associated
with the subject may include medical records of the subject, health history of the subject, identifying information
associated with the subject, payment information associated with the subject, or any other information associated
with the subject. The data storage units may be payer databases. The data storage units may include information
associated with a payer, such as a health insurance company or governmental payer. Such information may include
treatment records, insurance records, or financial information associated with the subject.
          [00319] One or more communication unit 164 may be provided at the laboratory 160. The laboratory may
be at the same location as or different location from, or may actually be the same as the sample collection or
processing center or provider or hospital office/location. Any description herein of the laboratory may apply to any
other locations provided herein and vice versa. The communication unit may be configured to receive data from a
device 172. The communication unit may receive data relating to a sample of a subject from the device at a sample
collection site 170. The communication unit may receive information about the subject from the device and/or the
sample collection site. The communication unit may receive identifying information about the subject. The
communication unit may receive information from the device and/or any other machine (e.g., biometric devices,
mobile devices) or entity associated with the sample collection site.
          [00320] The communication unit 164 may be configured to transmit data to a device 172 and/or any other
machine or entity associated with the sample collection site 170. In some embodiments, the communication unit
may provide one or more protocol to the device. The communication may provide the protocol in addition to
receiving data. The protocol may effect the collection of a sample, prepare the sample for a clinical test, or permit a
chemical reaction with one or more reagents on the device. The protocol may effect the running of the clinical test
on the device. The protocol may effect the detection of the presence and/or concentration of an analyte at the
device. Any description of detection and/or analysis relating to the presence and/or concentration of an analyte may
include and/or be applied to assessing a disease condition. The protocol may effect the pre-processing of raw data
and/or analysis of data at the device.
          [00321] The communication unit may permit two-way communication unit between the sample collection
site and the laboratory. The communication unit may permit two-way communication between a sample processing
device at a sample collection site or in or on a subject, and a processor at the laboratory. In some embodiments, one
or more protocol may be sent to a device based on data sent by the device. The data sent by the device may include
subject identifying information, information based on signals generated and/or detected relating to the sample or
reactions, device identification information, cartridge identification information, or any other information sent from
the device. Data may be collected from the device depending on protocols provided to the device. The protocols
may govern the type of data that is collected and the actions performed by the device. In some embodiments, one,
two, or more subsequent sets of protocols may be sent to a device based on data collected from the device. The data
                                                           -55-

from the device may provide feedback which may govern further actions to be taken by the device, dictated by the
protocols.
          [00322] In alternate embodiments of the invention, the laboratory need not send protocols to the device.
The protocols may be stored locally on the device. Alternatively, the system may provide protocols to the device.
The protocols may be provided from an entity external to the device. The protocols may be on a cartridge.
          [00323] The laboratory may have an output unit which may display or transmit the report to the health
care professional. The output unit may be a video display. Alternatively, the output unit may be a communication
unit. In one example, the output unit may be a touchscreen. The touchscreen may have an intrinsic imaging
capability through built-in sensors, which may include LEDs or other light sources.
          [00324] The device may have one or more identifier. The device may be capable of transmitting the
device identifier to the laboratory. One or more components of the device may have an identifier. For example, a
cartridge may have one or more identifier. The cartridge identifier may be readable by the device. For example,
when a cartridge is provided to the device, the device may automatically read the cartridge identifier. The device
may transmit the cartridge identifier or other component identifiers to the laboratory. The device, cartridge, or other
component identifiers may provide information about the configuration and/or capabilities of the device, cartridge,
or other components respectively. For example, an identifier may indicate which reagents or device components
are available. A protocol may be transmitted to the device from the laboratory based on the identification
information received or from a device to a laboratory for review. A protocol may be run on the device based on the
identification information.
          [00325] An identifier may be a physical object formed on the device, cartridge, or other component. For
example, the identifier may be read by an optical scanner. In some embodiments, a camera may capture an image
of the identifier and the image may be analyzed to identify the device, cartridge, or other component. In one
example, the identifier may be a barcode. A barcode may be a 1D or 2D barcode. In some embodiments, the
identifier may emit one or more signal that may identify the device, cartridge, or component. For example, the
identifier may provide an infrared, ultrasonic, optical, audio, electrical, or other signal that may indicate the identity
of the device, cartridge, or component. The identifier may utilize a radiofrequency identification (RFID) tag. The
identifier may be stored on a memory of the device, cartridge, or other component. In one example, the identifier
may be a computer readable medium.
          [00326] The communication unit 164 may be configured to transmit data to a health care professional 150.
In some embodiments, the communication unit may transmit a report or theranalysis generated based on data
relating to the sample. The communication unit may be in communication with a network device used by the health
care professional. For example, the communication unit may be capable of communicating with a computer, tablet,
or mobile device of the health care professional.
          [00327] Alternatively, another entity or source may generate a report, and/or transmit a report to the health
care professional. For example, a laboratory may analyze data provided by the device at a sample collection site or
in or on a subject or by a laboratory, hospital, sample collection center, or any other location described herein. The
laboratory, device or another entity may generate a report or theranalysis based on the analyzed data. The report
may include longitudinal data over time, which may include concentration or presence of one or more analytes or
changes in disease states over time. The report and/or analysis may make use of clinical outcome assessments, such
                                                           -56-

as those described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009/0318775, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its
entirety. The laboratory, device, the other entity, or an additional entity may transmit the report to the health care
professional. Various rounds of analysis or data processing may occur by one or more entity. The various entities
may be provided at different facilities. Alternatively, some of the various entities may be provided at the same
facility.
          [00328] In some embodiments, the processor, communication unit, and data storage unit may be provided
on the same machine. Alternatively, two or more of the processor, communication unit, and data storage unit may
be provided on the same machine. The machine may be a computer, or any other network device as described
elsewhere herein. Two or more of the processor, communication unit, and data storage may be located on a
laboratory-located computer. Alternatively, the processor, communication unit, and data storage may all be located
on different machines. In some instances, multiple processors, communication units, and data storage units may be
provided that may be distributed over one or a plurality of machines.
          [00329] FIG. 2 shows a sample processing device 200 in communication over a network 202 with one or
more other devices 204a, 204b.
          [00330] A sample processing device may be described further elsewhere herein. The sample processing
device may be configured to accept one or more cartridge. The sample processing device may be configured to
accept a sample from a subject. The sample processing device may be configured to facilitate collection of the
sample, prepare the sample for a clinical test, and/or effect a chemical reaction with one or more reagents or other
chemical or physical processing. The sample processing device may be configured to detect one or more signals
relating to the sample. The sample processing device may be configured to run a test. The test may include running
one or more chemical reactions. The sample processing device may be configured to identify one or more
properties of the sample. In some embodiments, the device may not be configured to perform a qualitative and/or
quantitative evaluation of the sample on board the device. Alternatively, the device may perform such a qualitative
and/or quantitative evaluation. For instance, the sample processing device may be configured to detect the presence
or concentration of one analyte or a plurality of analytes or a disease condition in the sample (e.g., in or through a
bodily fluid, secretion, tissue, or other sample). Alternatively, the sample processing device may be configured to
detect signals that may be analyzed to detect the presence or concentration of one or more analytes (which may be
indicative of a disease condition) or a disease condition in the sample. The signals may be analyzed on board the
device, or at another location. Running a clinical test may or may not include any analysis or comparison of data
collected.
          [00331] A sample processing device 200 may be configured to communicate over a network 202. The
sample processing device may include a communication module that may interface with the network. The sample
processing device may be connected to the network via a wired connection or wirelessly. The network may be a
local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet. In some embodiments, the network
may be a personal area network. The network may include the cloud. The sample processing device may be
connected to the network without requiring an intermediary device. Any other description of networks provided
herein may be applied.
          [00332] In some embodiments, the sample processing device 200 may communicate over the network 202
with another device 204a, 204b. The other device may be a communication-enabled device. For example, the
                                                           -57-

other device may be a client computer or a mobile device comprising a video display with at least one display page
comprising data. The other device may be any type of networked device, including but not limited to a personal
computer, server computer, or laptop computer; personal digital assistants (PDAs) such as a Palm-based device or
Windows CE device; phones such as cellular phones, smartphones (e.g., iPhone, Android, Blackberry, etc.), or
location-aware portable phones (such as GPS); a roaming device, such as a network-connected roaming device; a
wireless device such as a wireless email device or other device capable of communicating wireless with a computer
network; or any other type of network device that may communicate possibly over a network and handle electronic
transactions. Any discussion of any device mentioned may also apply to other devices, including those described
elsewhere herein. The sample processing device may communicate with one or more, two or more, three or more,
or any number of other devices. Such communication may or may not be simultaneous. Such communication may
include providing data to a cloud computing infrastructure or any other type of data storage infrastructure which
may be accessed by other devices.
           [00333] The other device 204a, 204b that may communicate with the sample processing device 200 may
have a video display. Video displays may include components upon which information may be displayed in a
manner perceptible to a user, such as, for example, a computer monitor, cathode ray tube, liquid crystal display,
light emitting diode display, touchpad or touchscreen display, and/or other means known in the art for emitting a
visually perceptible output. Video displays may be electronically connected to a client computer according to
hardware and software known in the art.
           [00334] In one implementation of the invention, a display page may include a computer file residing in
memory which may be transmitted from a server over a network to a client computer or other device, which can
store it in memory. A client computer may receive tangible computer readable media, which may contain
instructions, logic, data, or code that may be stored in persistent or temporary memory of the client computer, or
may somehow affect or initiate action by a client computer. Similarly, one or more devices may communicate with
one or more client computers across a network, and may transmit computer files residing in memory. One or more
devices may communicate computer files or links that may provide access to other computer files.
           [00335] At a client computer 204a, mobile device 204b, or any other network device as described
elsewhere herein, the display page may be interpreted by software residing in memory of the client computer,
mobile device, or network device, causing the computer file to be displayed on a video display in a manner
perceivable by a user. The display pages described herein may be created using a software language known in the
art such as, for example, the hypertext mark up language ("HTML"), the dynamic hypertext mark up language
("DHTML"), the extensible hypertext mark up language ("XHTML"), the extensible mark up language ("XML"), or
another software language that may be used to create a computer file displayable on a video or other display in a
manner perceivable by a user. Any computer readable media with logic, code, data, instructions, may be used to
implement any software or steps or methodology. Where a network comprises the Internet, a display page may
comprise a webpage of a type known in the art.
           [00336] A display page according to the invention may include embedded functions comprising software
programs stored on a memory device, such as, for example, VBScript routines, JScript routines, JavaScript routines,
Java applets, ActiveX components, ASP.NET, AJAX, Flash applets, Silverlight applets, or AIR routines.
                                                           -58-

           [00337] A display page may comprise well known features of graphical user interface technology, such as,
for example, frames, windows, scroll bars, buttons, icons, and hyperlinks, and well known features such as a "point
and click" interface or a touchscreen interface. Pointing to and clicking on a graphical user interface button, icon,
menu option, or hyperlink also is known as "selecting" the button, option, or hyperlink. A display page according to
the invention also may incorporate multimedia features, multi-touch, pixel sense, IR LED based surfaces, vision
based interactions with or without cameras.
           [00338] A user interface may be displayed on a video display and/or display page. The user interface may
display a report generated based on analyzed data relating to the sample. The report may include information about
the presence or concentration of one or more analyte. The user interface may display raw or analyzed data relating
to the sample. The data may include information about the presence or concentration of one or more analyte. The
user interface may display an alert. One example of an alert may be if an error is detected on the device, or if an
analyte concentration exceeds a predetermined threshold.
           [00339] In some embodiments, one or more network devices 204a, 204b may be provided at a laboratory
facility. The network devices at the laboratory may receive or access data provided by the sample processing
device 200. In some other embodiments, one or more network devices may be provided at a health care
professional location. In some embodiments, both laboratory devices and health care professional devices may be
able to receive or access data provided by the sample processing device. In an additional example, the one or more
network devices may belong to the subject. One or more of the laboratory, health care professional, or subject may
have a network device able to receive or access data provided by the sample processing device. The one or more
laboratory health care professional and/or subject, or the network device of the laboratory, health care professional,
and/or subject may be authenticated prior to being granted access to the data. For example, the laboratory
personnel, health care professional, and/or subject may have a login ID and/or password in order to access the data.
In some embodiments, the data can be sent to the email of the laboratory personnel, health care professional, and/or
subject.
           [00340] In some embodiments, the sample processing device may provide data to a cloud computing
infrastructure. The network device (e.g., of a laboratory, health care professional, or other entity) may access the
cloud computing infrastructure. In some embodiments, on-demand provision of computational resources (data,
software) may occur via a computer network, rather than from a local computer. The network device may contain
very little software or data (perhaps a minimal operating system and web browser only), serving as a basic display
terminal connected to the Internet. Since the cloud may be the underlying delivery mechanism, cloud-based
applications and services may support any type of software application or service. Information provided by the
sample processing device and/or accessed by the network devices may be distributed over various computational
resources. Alternatively, they may be stored in one or more fixed data storage unit or database.
           [00341] FIG. 3A illustrates a high level example of a sample processing device 300. A sample processing
device may be provided at any location, including a sample collection site. The sample processing device may be in
or on a subject, or may be carried by the subject. The sample processing device may be easily mobile or
transportable. The sample processing device may travel with the subject. The sample processing device may be a
benchtop device or a handheld device. The sample processing device may be located remote to a laboratory. Any
                                                          -59-

number of sample processing devices may be distributed geographically in any manner. For example, one or more
sample collection sites may have one or more devices.
           [00342] The sample processing device 300 may be configured to accept a removable cartridge 350. The
removable cartridge and/or device may have any other characteristics or components as described elsewhere herein.
The removable cartridge may be configured to accept a sample and/or deliver the sample to the device. The
removable cartridge may have one or more reagents provided thereon. For example FIG. 3B provides an
illustration of one or more reagents provided on the removable cartridge. Alternatively, one or more reagents 370
may be provided on board the device, such as shown in FIG. 3A. The device may comprise one or more reagent
units that may contain and/or confine one or more reagents. The reagents may originally be provided on the device,
the reagents may be provided to the reagent units from or on the cartridge, or both on-board the device and within
the cartridge.
           [00343] In other embodiments, the sample processing device need not have a removable cartridge. One or
more functions as described for the cartridge may be provided by the device itself.
           [00344] The sample processing device and/or a cartridge may comprise all reagents, liquid- and solid
phase reagents, required to perform one or more of the chemical reactions and/or other processing steps, including
physical processing, as described elsewhere herein. For example, for a luminogenic ELISA assay the reagents
within the device may include a sample diluent, a detector conjugate (for example, three enzyme-labeled
antibodies), a surface labeled with antibodies binders, a wash solution, and an enzyme substrate.
           [00345] Enzyme-linked ImmunoSorbent assays ("ELISA") are assays using antibodies to bind a target
analyte in a solution or on a substrate. One useful immunoassay that can be run on a device disclosed herein is
ELISA. For example, tips having adherent antibodies or target antigens may be used in ELISAs performed by
devices and according to methods disclosed herein.
           [00346] Performing an ELISA generally involves at least one antibody capable of binding an antigen of
interest (i.e., an analyte that is indicative of influenza viral infection). A sample containing or suspected to contain
the antigen of interest is immobilized on a support (e.g., a tip or other support having a surface for immobilization)
either non-specifically (e.g., via adsorption to the surface) or specifically (e.g., via capture by another antibody
specific to the same antigen, in a "sandwich" ELISA). After the antigen is immobilized the detection antibody is
added, forming a complex with the antigen. The detection antibody can be conjugated to an enzyme, or can itself be
detected by a secondary antibody which is in turn conjugated to an enzyme. Upon addition of a substrate for the
conjugated enzyme, a detectable signal is generated which indicates the presence and/or quantity of the antigen in
the sample. The choice of substrates will depend on the enzyme conjugated. Suitable substrates include fluorogenic
and chromogenic substrates. Those of skill in the art would be understand and be able to determine which
parameters of such assays that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs
known in the art.
           [00347] In some ELISAs, a solid phase capture surface can include an attached first antibody to which a
sample (e.g., diluted blood, plasma, or biological specimen) can be added. If present, an analyte in the sample can
bind to the first antibody and become immobilized. An enzyme reagent can be added that includes, for example, an
antibody coupled or conjugated to an enzyme (e.g., alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase) that produces a
detectable product, or can be otherwise detected. If the antibody portion of the enzyme reagent can bind the analyte,
                                                              -60-

then the enzyme reagent also becomes immobilized at the capture surface. Addition of a substrate for the enzyme
can result in a product producing an effect, for example, light that can be measured and plotted as shown. In this
manner the amount of analyte present in a sample can be measured.
           [00348] Thus, for example, an exemplary ELISA which may be performed using a device, system, or
method as disclosed herein includes a solid phase capture surface (e.g., a tip) on which a first antibody is
immobilized. The first antibody is specific for a test antigen (e.g., antibody specific for a target blood analyte, such
as cholesterol, or for e.g., neuraminidase on the coat of a virus of interest, or other antigen). If the test antigen is
present in a test sample (e.g., whole blood, plasma, or serum) that is exposed to the antibody immobilized on the
surface, then the test antigen can become immobilized (captured) at the capture surface. Addition of a second,
labeled antibody that binds to the first antibody (e.g., where the first antibody has a biotin label, and the second
antibody has an avidin label and a detectable label; or where the first antibody is a sheep antibody including an Fc
portion, the second antibody may be an antibody targeting sheep Fc and labeled with alkaline phosphatase (AP)
which can be detected following addition of AP substrate) allows the detection and quantification of the amount of
antigen in the sample. The first antibody, which is bound to the substrate, is not washed out by the addition of the
second antibody. Such detection and quantification may be accomplished by providing substrate for alkaline
phosphatase, leading to the production of colored, fluorescent, luminescent (e.g., chemiluminescent), or otherwise
detectable compounds which may be detected and measured.
           [00349] Alternatively, after the blood sample is placed in contact with the surface having the immobilized
first antibody (labeled with an enzyme which catalyzes a reaction that produces a first detectable compound) that
targets a first antigen, a second antibody, targeting a second antigen and labeled with a second enzyme which can
produce a second detectable compound may be added. The first antibody, which is bound to the substrate, is not
washed out by the addition of the second antibody, and may be detected by providing the substrate and proper
reaction conditions for the production of a first detectable product by enzyme linked to the first antibody. Binding
and subsequent detection of the second, labeled antibody at the capture surface indicates the presence of both the
first and the second test antigens in the test sample. Both the first and second detectable compounds produced by
the enzymes linked to the antibodies may be detected by any means desired, including by detection of fluorescence,
luminescence, chemiluminescence, absorbance, or other means for detecting the products of the enzymatic reactions
due to the attached enzymes.
           [00350] For example, photomultipliers tubes, charge-coupled devices, photodiodes, cameras,
spectrophotometers, and other components and devices may be used to measure light emitted or affected during the
performance of an ELISA. For example, the amount of light detected (e.g., in relative light units, or other
measurements of luminosity) during the performance of an ELISA on a sample may be compared to a standard
curve (e.g., a calibration curve prepared for a particular assay, device, cartridge, or reagent) to calculate the
concentration of the target analyte in the sample. Analytes that have been detected and their levels measured in
blood samples using ELISAs performed on devices and systems as disclosed herein include: vitamin B-12, folic
acid, thyroxine, testosterone, estradiol, cotinine, vancomycin, hemoglobin A1c, prostate specific antigen, human
chorionic gonadotropin, luteinizing hormone, parathyroid hormone, alpha-fetoprotein, prealbumin, cardiac troponin
T, C-reactive protein, hepatitis B surface antigen (IHbsAg), immunoglobulin E (IgE), immunoglobulin G (IgG),
Dengue virus IgG, rheumatoid factor IgM, West Nile Virus IgM, anti-HIV 1 antibodies, anti-HIV 2 antibodies, anti
nuclear antibodies, influenza A, influenza B, and streptococcus.
                                                           -61-

           [00351]   ELISAs are also used, for example, in competitive binding experiments, in which the
concentration of an analyte in a solution may be measured by adding a known amount of labeled analyte, and
measuring the binding of the analyte. Increased concentrations of the sample analyte (which does not include the
label) interfere ("compete") with the binding of the labeled analyte, allowing calculation of the amount of analyte in
the sample.
           [00352] Additional reagents can be provided as needed. In some embodiments, reagents can be
incorporated into a device to provide for sample pretreatment. Examples of pretreatment reagents include, without
limitation, white cell lysis reagents, reagents for liberating analytes from binding factors in the sample, enzymes,
and detergents. The pretreatment reagents can also be added to a diluent contained within the device.
           [00353] Reagents according to the present invention include without limitation wash buffers, enzyme
substrates, dilution buffers, conjugates, enzyme-labeled conjugates, DNA amplifiers, sample diluents, wash
solutions, sample pre-treatment reagents including additives such as detergents, polymers, chelating agents,
albumin-binding reagents, enzyme inhibitors, enzymes, anticoagulants, red-cell agglutinating agents, antibodies, or
other materials necessary to run an assay on a device. An enzyme-labeled conjugate can be either a polyclonal
antibody or monoclonal antibody labeled with an enzyme that can yield a detectable signal upon reaction with an
appropriate substrate. Non-limiting examples of such enzymes are alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase.
In some embodiments, the reagents comprise immunoassay reagents. Reagents defining assay specificity may be
provided, which may optionally include, for example, monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, proteins,
nucleic acid probes or other polymers such as affinity matrices, carbohydrates or lipids. In general, reagents,
especially those that are relatively unstable when mixed with liquid, are confined separately in a defined region (for
example, a reagent unit) within the device and/or cartridge.
           [00354] In some embodiments, a reagent unit may contain a small volume of reagent. For example, a
reagent unit may contain approximately about 5 microliters or less to about 1 milliliter of liquid. In some
embodiments, the unit may contain about 20-200 microliters of liquid. In a further embodiment, the reagent unit
contains 100 microliters of fluid. In an embodiment, a reagent unit contains about 40 microliters of fluid. A reagent
unit may include any volume described elsewhere herein, which may include volumes of sample. The volume of
liquid in a reagent unit may vary depending on the type of assay being run or the sample of bodily fluid provided. In
an embodiment, the volumes of the reagents do not have to be predetermined, but must be more than a known
minimum. In some embodiments, the reagents are initially stored dry and dissolved upon initiation of the assay
being run on the device.
           [00355] The sample processing device may comprise a display 310. The display may be a video display
or other type of user interface. The display may function as a user interface. The display may permit a user to
operate the sample processing device. The display may be configured to accept an input from the user relating to a
subject identity, other information about the subject, information about the sample, information about one or more
clinical test, information about sample preparation steps, information about a laboratory, and/or information about a
medical care provider.
           [00356] The display may output information to an operator of the device. The display may prompt the
operator to perform one or more steps in the operation of the device. The display may display information about the
sample collected, the subject, and/or data relating to one or more preparation step performed or chemical reaction
                                                            -62-

run. The display may output information about one or more automated process that may be implemented by the
device. The display may provide one or more alert for an error detected, or when one or more parameters are met
(e.g., certain detected signals exceed a predetermined threshold). A display may display results on the device.
           [00357] The sample processing device 300 may comprise one or more components useful for collecting
the sample, preparing the sample for a clinical test, and/or running a chemical reaction, or other test or analysis.
The sample processing device may also comprise one or more components useful for detecting one or more signal
relating to the sample or components of the device. For example, the sample processing device may include, but is
not limited to, a sample collection unit, centrifuge, magnetic separator, filter, pipette or other fluid handling system,
vessels, containers, assay units, reagent units, heater, thermal block, cytometer, spectrophotometer, imaging
systems, microscopy station, light source, optical detector, photometer, temperature sensor, motion sensor, or sensor
for electrical properties. Fluid may be transferred from one component to another via a fluid handling system, such
as a pipette, channels, or pumps.
           [00358] In some embodiments, the fluid handling system may be a pipettor. The pipettor may be a multi
head pipettor. In some instances, each of the pipette heads may be of the same type or may be of different types.
For example, the pipette heads may be air displacement pipettes and/or positive displacement pipettes. In some
instances, the fluid handling system may be capable of picking up and/or removing one or more pipette tip. The
pipette tips may be individually added or removed from the pipette head. The pipette head may transfer the pipette
tip from a first location to a second location. A pipette tip may be capable of connecting to and forming a fluid
tight seal with a pipette head or screwing into it or attaching in other ways. A sample or other fluid may be
aspirated and/or dispensed by the pipette tip.
           [00359] The pipette tip may have an interior surface and an exterior surface. The pipette tip may have a
first end and an opposing second end. In some embodiments, both the first and second ends may be open. In some
embodiments, the first end may have a diameter that is greater than the diameter of the second end. The pipette tip
may or may not be coated with reagents and/or capturing binders such as antibodies. In some instances, an interior
surface of the pipette tip may be coated with a reagent and/or capturing binders. A chemical reaction may take
place within the pipette tip. The chemical reaction may take place within the pipette tip while the tip is attached to a
pipette head, or when the tip is separated from the pipette head. Alternatively, chemical reactions may take place
within one or more vessel. The pipette may deliver a sample or other fluid to, or aspirate a sample or other fluid
from, a vessel. The pipette tip may be capable of being at least partially inserted into a vessel.
           [00360] The pipettor may be utilized to transfer a sample or other fluid within the device. The pipettor
may assist with the preparation of a sample. The pipettor may assist with the running of a chemical reaction.
           [00361] The sample processing device may be capable of performing at least one sample preparation step
and/or running one or more, two or more, three or more, four or more, five or more, six or more, seven or more,
eight or more, nine or more, ten or more, twenty or more, thirty or more, or fifty or more chemical reactions. The
device may be capable of performing one or more, two or more, three or more, four or more, five or more, six or
more, seven or more, eight or more, nine or more, ten or more, twenty or more, thirty or more, or fifty or more
different types of assays. These may occur simultaneously and/or in sequence. The sample preparation and/or
chemical reactions that may occur may be governed by protocols that may be individualized to a subject's needs
and/or sent back and forth from a server and/or stored or inputted locally. The subject's needs may be based on a
                                                            -63-

prescription or instructions that the subject has received from a health care professional. The device may be
configured to accommodate a wide range of sample preparation and/or chemical reactions.
          [00362] The sample processing device 300 may include one or more detector 360 which may be capable
of detecting one or more signal relating to the sample. The detector may be able to detect all emissions from the
electromagnetic spectrum. Alternatively the detector may be able to detect a selected range of emission from the
electromagnetic spectrum. For example, an optical detector may detect an optical signal relating to a chemical
reaction that had taken place on the device. An electrical property sensor or other sensor may detect the voltage,
current, impedance, resistance, or any other electrical property of a sample. A temperature sensor may determine
the temperature of a thermal block, upon which a sample may rest. A sensor may determine the speed of a
centrifuge. A sensor may determine the position, velocity, and/or acceleration of a pipette and/or the successful
execution of a protocol.
          [00363] One or more detectable signal may be detected by a detector 360. The detectable signal can be a
luminescent signal, including but not limited to photoluminescence, electroluminescence, chemiluminescence,
fluorescence, phosphorescence or any emission from the electromagnetic spectrum. In some embodiments, one or
more label may be employed during a chemical reaction. The label may permit the generation of a detectable
signal. Methods of detecting labels are well known to those of skill in the art. Thus, for example, where the label is
a radioactive label, means for detection may include a scintillation counter or photographic film as in
autoradiography. Where the label is a fluorescent label, it may be detected by exciting the fluorochrome with the
appropriate wavelength of light and detecting the resulting fluorescence by, for example, microscopy, visual
inspection, via photographic film, by the use of electronic detectors such as digital cameras, charge coupled devices
(CCDs) or photomultipliers and phototubes, or other detection device. In some instances, cameras may utilize
CCDs, CMOS, may be lensless cameras (e.g., Frankencamera), open-source cameras, or may utilize or any other
visual detection technology known or later developed in the art. In some embodiments, imaging devices may
employ 2-d imaging, 3-d imaging, and/or 4-d imaging (incorporating changes over time). Similarly, enzymatic
labels are detected by providing appropriate substrates for the enzyme and detecting the resulting reaction product.
Finally, simple colorimetric labels are often detected simply by observing the color associated with the label. For
example, conjugated gold often appears pink, while various conjugated beads appear the color of the bead.
          [00364] In some embodiments, an imaging unit may be provided. Examples of imaging units may include
any of the detectors and/or optical detection devices as described elsewhere herein. For example, imaging units
may be cameras which may utilize CCDs, CMOS, may be lensless cameras (e.g., Frankencamera), open-source
cameras, or may utilize or any other visual detection technology known or later developed in the art. An imaging
unit may capture static images and/or may capture moving images. For example, the imaging unit may capture a
series of digital images. An imaging unit may capture video images. An imaging device may be a camera or a
sensor that detects and/or records electromagnetic radiation and associated spatial and/or temporal dimensions.
          [00365] In one example, the imaging unit may capture one or more digital image of a sample. For
example, the imaging unit may capture an image of a tissue sample. The picture of the tissue sample may be
transmitted to a pathologist or other health care professional. Analysis and/or oversight may occur for the image of
the tissue sample. Analysis and/or oversight may occur on-board or remotely, by a health care professional or a
software program. In other examples, the imaging unit may capture images of a sample, and/or any form of
                                                           -64-

preparation of the sample such as chemical reactions or physical processing steps occurring with the sample. For
example, a video may be taken of a chemical reaction. Any description herein of data may also apply to data
representative of images, and vice versa.
          [00366] Imaging may be used to, e.g., detect, examine, identify, characterize, and quantify cells in a
sample, such as in, e.g., a blood sample, a urine sample, biopsy tissue, or other sample. Such use of imaging and
other techniques may be termed "cytometry." Cytometry includes observations and measurements of cells, such as
red blood cells, platelets, white blood cells, including qualitative and quantitative observations and measurements of
cell numbers, cell types, cell surface markers, internal cellular markers, and other characteristics of cells of interest.
Where a biological sample includes or is a blood sample, the sample may be divided into portions, and may be
diluted (e.g., to provide greater volume for ease of handling, to alter the density or concentration of cellular
components in the sample to provide a desired diluted density, concentration, or cell number or range of these, etc.).
The sample may be treated with agents which affect coagulation, or may be treated or handled so as to concentrate
or precipitate sample components (e.g., ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) or heparin may be added to the
sample, or the sample may be centrifuged or cells allowed to settle). A sample may be treated by adding dyes or
other reagents which may react with and mark particular cells or particular cellular components. For example, dyes
which mark cell nuclei (e.g., hematoxylin dyes, cyanine dyes, draq dyes such as Draq5, and others); dyes which
mark cell cytoplasm (e.g., eosin dyes, including fluorescein dyes, and others) may be used separately or together to
aid in visualization, identification, and quantification of cells. More specific markers, including antibodies and
antibody fragments specific for cellular targets, such as cell surface proteins, intracellular proteins and
compartments, and other targets, are also useful in cytometry.
          [00367] Biological samples may be measured and analyzed by cytometry using optical means, including,
for example, photodiode detectors, photomultipliers, charge-coupled devices, laser diodes, spectrophotometers,
cameras, microscopes, or other devices which measure light intensity (of a single wavelength, of multiple
wavelengths, or of a range, or ranges, of wavelengths of light), form an image, or both. A field of view including a
sample may be imaged, or may be scanned, or both, using such detectors. A biological sample may be measured
and analyzed by cytometry prior to processing, dilution, separation, centrifugation, coagulation, or other alteration.
A biological sample may be measured and analyzed by cytometry during or following processing, dilution,
separation, centrifugation, coagulation, or other alteration of the sample. For example, a biological sample may be
measured and analyzed by cytometry directly following receipt of the sample. In other examples, a biological
sample may be measured and analyzed by cytometry during or after processing, dilution, separation, centrifugation,
coagulation, or other alteration of the sample.
          [00368] For example, a blood sample may be prepared for cytometry by sedimentation or centrifugation.
A sedimented or pellet portion of such a sample may be resuspended in a buffer of choice prior to cytometric
analysis (e.g., by aspiration, stirring, sonication, or other processing). A biological sample may be diluted or
resuspended with water, or with a saline solution, such as a buffered saline solution prior to cytometric analysis. A
solution used for such dilution or resuspension may or may not include a fixative (e.g., formaldehyde,
paraformaldehyde, or other agent which cross-links proteins). A solution used for such dilution or resuspension may
provide an osmotic gradient between the surrounding solution and the interior, or an interior compartment, of cells
in the sample, effective that the cell volume of some or all cells in the sample is altered. For example, where the
resulting solution concentration following dilution is less than the effective concentration of the interior of a cell, or
                                                             -65-

of an interior cell compartment, the volume of such a cell will increase (i.e., the cell will swell). A biological sample
may be diluted with a solution which may or may not include an osmoticant (such as, for example, glucose, sucrose,
or other sugar; salts such as sodium, potassium, ammonium, or other salt; or other osmotically active compound or
ingredient). In embodiments, an osmoticant may be effective to maintain the integrity of cells in the sample, by, for
example, stabilizing or reducing possible osmotic gradients between the surrounding solution and the interior, or an
interior compartment, of such cells. In embodiments, an osmoticant may be effective to provide or to increase
osmotic gradients between the surrounding solution and the interior, or an interior compartment, of such cells,
effective that the cells at least partially collapse (where the cellular interior or an interior compartment is less
concentrated than the surrounding solution), or effective that the cells swell (where the cellular interior or an
interior compartment is more concentrated than the surrounding solution).
           [00369] For example, a biological sample may be measured or analyzed following dilution of the sample
with a solution including dyes. For example, a biological sample may be measured or analyzed following dilution
of a portion of the sample with a solution including antibodies or antibody fragments. For example, a biological
sample may be measured or analyzed following dilution of the sample with a solution including particles. Particles
added to a biological sample may serve as standards (e.g., may serve as size standards, where the size or size
distribution of the particles is known, or as concentration standards, where the number, amount, or concentration of
the particles is known), or may serve as markers (e.g., where the particles bind or adhere to particular cells or types
of cells, to particular cell markers or cellular compartments, or where the particles bind to all cells in a sample).
           [00370] For example, a biological sample may be measured or analyzed following processing which may
separate one or more types of cells from another cell type or types. Such separation may be accomplished by gravity
(e.g., sedimentation); centrifugation; filtration; contact with a substrate (e.g., a surface, such as a wall or a bead,
containing antibodies, lectins, or other components which may bind or adhere to one cell type in preference to
another cell type); or other means. Separation may be aided or accomplished by alteration of a cell type or types.
For example, a solution may be added to a biological sample, such as a blood sample, which causes some or all
cells in the sample to swell. Where one type of cell swells faster than another type or types of cell, cell types may be
differentiated by observing or measuring the sample following addition of the solution. Such observations and
measurements may be made at a time, or at multiple times, selected so as to accentuate the differences in response
(e.g., size, volume, internal concentration, or other property affected by such swelling) and so to increase the
sensitivity and accuracy of the observations and measurements. In some instances, a type or types of cells may burst
in response to such swelling, allowing for improved observations and measurements of the remaining cell type or
types in the sample.
           [00371] Observation, measurement and analysis of a biological sample by cytometry may include
photometric measurements, for example, using a photodiode, a photomultiplier, a laser diode, a spectrophotometer,
a charge-coupled device, a camera, a microscope, or other means or device. Cytometry may include preparing and
analyzing images of cells in a biological sample (e.g., two-dimensional images), where the cells are labeled (e.g.,
with fluorescent, chemiluminescent, enzymatic, or other labels) and plated (e.g., allowed to settle on a substrate)
and imaged by a camera. The camera may include a lens, and may be attached to or used in conjunction with a
microscope. Cells may be identified in the two-dimensional images by their attached labels (e.g., from light emitted
by the labels).
                                                             -66-

          [00372] An image of cells prepared and analyzed by a cytometer as disclosed herein may include no cells,
one cell, or multiple cells. A cell or cell in an image of a cytometer, as disclosed herein, may be labeled, as
disclosed above. A cell or cell in an image of a cytometer, as disclosed herein, may be labeled, as disclosed above,
effective to identify the image, and the subject from whom the sample was taken.
          [00373] Cytometric measurements of cells from samples of blood have been made using devices, systems,
and methods embodying features disclosed herein. Cytometric images have been used, for example, to count the
numbers of cells (e.g., providing the number of cells per volume of blood), to determine the sizes and size
distribution of cells in the sample (including mean, standard deviation, and other size measures), and to identify cell
types based on cell surface markers. Typically, the total concentration of red blood cells and platelets is in the
range of about 1 -3 x 106 cells per microliter (e.g., about 2 x 106 cells per microliter). Cells were allowed to settle on
the floor of a channel within the cuvette, allowing an image to be taken of a single focal plane that was sufficient to
detect all the cells in the volume within the image area; thus a count of the cells in a single image provided a count
of the cells in the volume of blood represented by that image. Since the dimensions of the channel were known, the
volume of blood above the area shown in the image allowed accurate calculation of the density of cells within that
volume. Volume is also measured by inclusion of known concentrations of beads (the images of which are
distinguishable from blood cell images) as indicators; since the concentration of the beads was known, counting the
numbers of beads in a field allowed a precise calculation of the volume of sample from which an image was taken.
          [00374] Optical images included fluorescence images for detecting red, blue and green wavelengths
(useful, for example, for detecting and measuring fluorescence from dyes attached to specific cell-surface markers),
and darkfield images (useful for detecting cell shape and outlines, and for measuring cell size and volume).
Fluorescence images may be used, for example, to identify and quantitate different cell types in the sample.
Darkfield images are based on light scattered from the objects in the cuvette, and they provide information
regarding the size, shape, and number of objects in the cuvette. Forward scatter measurements were used to
quantify cell size. Side scatter measurements were used to determine, identify, and categorize cell morphology.
          [00375] Data from the images was processed by a controller associated with the sample processing device.
The following measurements may be calculated: 1) number of red blood cells in the cuvette; 2) average volume of
red blood cells in the cuvette; 3) red blood cell distribution width (RDW) of red blood cells in the cuvette; 4)
number of platelets in the cuvette; 5) average volume of platelets in the cuvette; and 6) platelet distribution width of
platelets in the cuvette.
          [00376] Microscopy methods that may be used with devices and systems disclosed herein include but are
not limited to bright field, oblique illumination, dark field, dispersion staining, phase contrast, differential
interference contrast (DIC), polarized light, epifluorescence, interference reflection, fluorescence, confocal
(including CLASS), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), structured illumination, stimulated emission
depletion, electron, scanning probe, infrared, laser, widefield, light field microscopy, lensless on-chip holographic
microscopy, digital and conventional holographic microscopy, extended depth-of-field microscopy, optical scatter
imaging microscopy, deconvolution microscopy, defocusing microscopy, quantitative phase microscopy, diffraction
phase microscopy, confocal Raman microscopy, scanning acoustic microscopy and X-ray microscopy.
Magnification levels used by microscopy may include, as nonlimiting examples, up to 2x, 5x, lOx, 20x, 40x, 60x,
100x, 100x, 1000x, or higher magnifications. Feasible magnification levels will vary with the type of microscopy
                                                            -67-

used. For example, images produced by some forms of electron microscopy may involve magnification of up to
hundreds of thousands of times. Multiple microscopy images may be recorded for the same sample to generate
time-resolved data, including videos. Individual or multiple cells may be imaged simultaneously, by parallel
imaging or by recording one image that encompasses multiple cells. A microscopic objective may be immersed in
media to change its optical properties, such as through oil immersion. A microscopic objective may be moved
relative to the sample by means of a rotating CAM to change the focus. Cytometry data may be processed
automatically or manually, and may further include analyses of cell or tissue morphology, such as by a pathologist
for diagnostic purposes.
          [00377] The microscopic objective can be finely positioned to focus the image via an actuator, such as by
a cam connected to a motor. The objective may be focused on one or more planes of the sample. Focusing may be
automated by image analysis procedures by computing the image sharpness of digital images among other methods.
          [00378] Cell counting can be performed using cytometry, e.g., imaging with or without microscopy. In
situations where the subjects may be bright-field illuminated, the preferred embodiment is to illuminate the subjects
from the front with a white light and to sense the cells with an imaging sensor. Subsequent digital processing will
count the cells. Where the cells are infrequent or are small, the preferred embodiment is to attach a specific or non
specific fluorescent marker, and then illuminate the subject field with a laser or other suitable light source. Confocal
scanning imaging may be used. In embodiments, up to 500 or 1000 cells of any given type may be counted. In
other embodiments, various numbers of cells of any given type may be counted, including but not limited to more
than or equal to about 1 cell, 5 cells, 10 cells, 30 cells, 50 cells, 100 cells, 150 cells, 200 cells, 300 cells, 500 cells,
700 cells, 1000 cells, 1500 cells, 2000 cells, 3000 cells, 5000 cells. Cells may be counted using available counting
algorithms. Cells can be recognized by their characteristic fluorescence, size and shape.
          [00379] In some microscopy embodiments, brightfield illumination may be achieved by the use of a white
light source along with a stage-condenser to create Koehler illumination. Brightfield images of cells, which may
detect properties similar to that of forward scattering in flow cytometry, can reveal cell size, phase-dense material
within the cells and colored features in the cell if the cells have been previously stained. In one example
embodiment, the Wright-Giemsa staining method can be used to stain human whole blood smear. Brightfield
imaging shows characteristic patterns of staining of human leukocytes. The characteristically shaped red cells can
also be identified in these images.
          [00380] In some microscopy embodiments, darkfield imaging may be achieved by the use of a ringlight
based illumination scheme, or other epi- or trans-darkfield illumination schemes available. Darkfield imaging may,
for example, be used to determine light scattering properties of cells, equivalent to side scatter in flow cytometry,
such as when imaging human leukocytes. The internal and external features of the cell which scatter more light
appear brighter and the features which scatter lesser amounts of light appear darker in a darkfield image. Cells such
as granulocytes have internal granules of size range (100-500nm) which can scatter significant amount of light and
generally appear brighter in darkfield images. Furthermore, the outer boundary of any cell may scatter light and
may appear as a ring of bright light. The diameter of this ring may directly give the size of the cell. Microscopy
methods may additionally be used to measure cell volume. For example, red blood cell volume may be measured.
To increase accuracy, red blood cells may be transformed into spheres through the use of anionic or zwitterionic
                                                             -68-

surfactants, and dark field imaging used to measure the size of each sphere, from which cell volumes may be
calculated.
           [00381] In some microscopy embodiments, small cells or formed elements which may be below the
diffraction-limited resolution limit of the microscope, may be labeled with fluorescent markers; the sample may be
excited with light of appropriate wavelength and an image may be captured. The diffraction pattern of the
fluorescent light emitted by the labeled cell may be quantified using computer analysis and correlated with the size
of the cell. The computer programs used for these embodiments is described elsewhere herein. To improve the
accuracy of this method, the cells may be transformed into spheres by the use of anionic and zwitterionic
surfactants.
           [00382] Cell imaging may be used to extract one or more of the following kinds of information for each
cell (but is not limited to the following): Cell size; Quantitative measure of cell granularity or light scattering (also
popularly called side scatter, based on flow cytometry parlance); Quantitative measure of fluorescence in each
spectral channel of imaging, after compensating for cross-talk between spectral channels, or intracellular
distribution pattern of fluorescent or other staining; Shape of the cell, as quantified by standard and custom shape
attributes such as aspect ratio, Feret diameters, Kurtosis, moment of inertia, circularity, solidity etc.; Color, color
distribution and shape of the cell, in cases where the cells have been stained with dyes (not attached to antibodies or
other types of receptor);Intracellular patterns of staining or scattering, color or fluorescence that are defined as
quantitative metrics of a biological feature such as morphology, for example density of granules within cells in a
darkfield image, or the number and size of nucleolar lobes in a Giemsa-Wright stained image of polymorphonuclear
neutrophils etc.; Co-localization of features of the cell revealed in images acquired in different channels;Spatial
location of individual cells, cellular structures, populations of cells, intracellular proteins, ions, carbohydrates and
lipids or secretions (such as to determine the source of secreted proteins).
           [00383] A wide range of cell-based assays can be designed to use the information gathered by cytometry.
For example, an assay for performing a 5-part leukocyte differential may be provided. The reportables in this case
may, for example, be number of cells per microliter of blood for the following types of leukocytes: monocytes,
lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils. Reportables may also be used to classify leukocyte
differentiation, or identify T and B-cell populations.
           [00384] Fluorescence microscopy generally involves labeling of cells or other samples with fluorescent
labels, described in more detail below. Microscopic imaging of fluorescently labeled samples may gather
information regarding the presence, amounts, and locations of the target that is labeled at a given moment in time or
over a period of time. Fluorescence may also be used to enhance sensitivity for detecting cells, cellular structures,
or cellular function. In fluorescence microscopy, a beam of light is used to excite the fluorescent molecules, which
then emit light of a different wavelength for detection. Sources of light for exciting fluorophores are well known in
the art, including but not limited to xenon lamps, lasers, LEDs, and photodiodes. Detectors include but are not
limited to PMTs, CCDs, and cameras.
           [00385] Spectroscopy includes any and all assays that produce luminescence or change light (e.g., color
chemistry). These may include one or more of the following: spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, luminometry,
turbidimetry, nephelometry, refractometry, polarimetry, and measurement of agglutination.
                                                            -69-

           [00386] Spectrophotometry refers to measuring a subject's reflection or transmission of electromagnetic
waves, including visible, UV, and infrared light. Spectrophotometry may, for example, be used to determine
nucleic acid concentrations in a sample, such as by measuring absorbance at a wavelength of about 260 nm, to
determine protein concentration by measuring absorbance at a wavelength of about 280 nm, and/or to determine salt
concentration by measuring absorbance at a wavelength of about 230 nm.
           [00387] Other examples of spectrophotometry may include infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Examples of
infrared spectroscopy include near-infrared spectroscopy, far-infrared spectroscopy laser-Raman spectroscopy,
Raman confocal laser spectroscopy, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy, and any other infrared spectroscopy
technique. Frequencies of less than about 650 cm-1 are typically used for far-infrared spectroscopy, frequencies
greater than about 4000 cm-1 are typically used for near-infrared spectroscopy, while frequencies between about
biomedical applications, including in screening and diagnosis of cancer, arthritis, and other diseases, determining
chemical compositions of biological fluids, determining septic state, and others. IR spectroscopy may be used on
solid samples, such as tissue biopsies, cell cultures, or Pap smears; or on liquid samples, such as blood, urine,
synovial fluid, mucus, and others. IR spectroscopy may be used to differentiate between normal and cancerous cells
as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,186,162, herein incorporated by reference. IR spectroscopy may also be used on
blood samples to detect markers for cancers of various solid organs. IR spectroscopy may also be used to determine
cellular immunity in patients, such as to diagnose immunodeficiencies, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases,
allergies, hypersensitivity, and tissue transplant compatibility.
           [00388] IR spectroscopy may be used to determine glucose levels in blood, which is of use for diabetic
patients, such as for monitoring insulin response. IR spectroscopy may further be used to measure other substances
in blood samples, such as alcohol levels, fatty acid content, cholesterol levels, hemoglobin concentration. IR
spectroscopy can also distinguish between synovial fluid from healthy and arthritic patients.
           [00389] Fluorimetry refers to measuring the light emitted by a fluorescent molecule coupled to a subject
upon exciting the fluorescent molecule with incident light. Fluorimetry may use any of the fluorescent molecules,
labels, and targets as described for cytometric assays above. In some embodiments, fluorimetry uses substrate
molecules that change in fluorescence based on an enzymatic activity, such as converting NAD+ to NADH or vice
versa or producing beta-galactosidase from a precursor molecule. Fluorimetry may be used with a polarized
excitation source to measure fluorescence polarization or anisotropy of a subject, which may provide information
about the size and/or binding state.
           [00390] Colorimetry refers to measuring the transmissive color absorption of a subject, preferably by
backlighting the subject with white light with the result sensed by an imaging sensor. Examples include some
assays that use oxidases or peroxidases combined with a dye that becomes colored in the presence of hydrogen
peroxide. One method that measures peroxidase activity in whole cell suspensions of human white blood cells is
disclosed in Menegazzi, et al., J. Leukocyte Biol 52: 619-624 (1992), which is herein incorporated by reference in
its entirety. Such assays may be used to detect analytes that include but are not limited to alcohols, cholesterols,
lactate, uric acid, glycerol, triglycerides, glutamate, glucose, choline, NADH. Some of the enzymes that may be
used include horseradish peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, microperoxidase, alcohol oxidase, cholesterol oxidase,
NADH oxidase. Other nonlimiting examples of colorimetric assays include dye-based assays to determine protein
concentration, such as Bradford, Lowry, biureat, and Nano-orange methods. The pH of a sample may also be
                                                            -70-

determined by colorimetric assays with indicator dyes, including but not limited to phenolphtalein, thymolphtalein,
alizarin Yellow R, indigo carmine, m-cresol purple, cresol red, thymol blue, xylenol blue, 2,2',2",4,4'
pentamethoxytriphenyl carbinol, benzopurpurin 4B, metanil yellow, 4-phenylazodiphenylamine, malachite green,
quinaldine red, orange IV, thymol blue, xylenol blue, and combinations thereof.
          [00391] Luminometry uses no illumination method as the subject emits its own photons. The emitted light
can be weak and can be detecting using an extremely sensitive sensor such as a photomultiplier tube (PMT).
Luminometry includes assays that produce chemiluminescence, such as those using luciferases or some assays
using peroxidases.
          [00392] For turbidimetry, the preferred embodiment for sensing is backlighting the subject with white
light with the result sensed by an imaging sensor. For turbidimetry, the reduction of the intensity of the transmitted
light is measured. Turbidimetry may be used, for example, to determine a concentration of cells in solution. In some
embodiments, turbimetry is measured by nephelometry.
          [00393] Nephelometry measures the light that is transmitted or scattered after passing through a subject in
a suspension, typically a substrate bound to an immunoglobin such as IgM, IgG, and IgA.
          [00394] Polarimetry measures the polarization of, typically, electromagnetic waves by a subject.
Polarimetry assays include circular dichroism, which may provide structural information and light scattering assays,
which may provide information about the size and/or shape of the subject. One nonlimiting example of light
scattering assays uses dynamic light scattering (DLS). Subjects for these assays do not require labeling.
          [00395] The sample processing device 300 may have a processor 330 that may provide instructions to one
or more components of the device. The processor may act as a controller that may instruct one or more component
of the device. For example, the processor may provide an instruction to a pipette to aspirate or dispense a fluid.
The processor may provide an instruction that controls the temperature of a heater (which may optionally heat
and/or cool the device). The processor may provide an instruction to an optical detector to detect one or more
signal. The processor may also receive instructions and/or collected data. For example, a processor may act in
accordance with one or more protocol. The protocol may be provided on board the device or may be provided from
a source external to the device. The processor may also receive data regarding signals detected by the device. The
processor may or may not analyze signals that have been detected by the device. The processor may or may not
compare one or more detected signal with a threshold value.
          [00396] A communication module 340 may be provided on the device 300. A communication unit may
be part of a laboratory or set-up which includes the device. The communication module may permit the device to
communicate with an external machine. For example, the communication module may receive one or more
protocol or set of instructions from an external source. In some embodiments, the external source may be a
laboratory. The communication module may also permit the device to transmit data to an external machine. Data
may be transmitted via a transmission unit. For example, the device may transmit data to a laboratory or to a health
care professional. The device may transmit data to a cloud computing infrastructure, which may be accessed by a
laboratory, health care professional, or other entity. The communication module may permit wireless and/or wired
communication.

             [00397] The sample processing device 300 may also comprise a power module 320. The power module
may connect the device to an external power source, or may be provided as an internal local power source. For
example, the power module may connect the device to a grid or utility. The device may include a plug that may be
connected to an electric socket. The device may be connected to any other external power source, which may
include an electricity generation device, such as a generator, or any renewable energy source (e.g., solar, wind,
water, geothermal), or energy storage source (e.g., battery, ultracapacitor). The power module may be a local
power source. For example, the power module may be an energy storage device, such as a battery or ultracapacitor.
Any battery chemistry known or later developed in the art may be used. Alternatively, a local power source may
include a local energy generation device, such as a device that utilizes renewable energy. The power module may
provide electricity to run the rest of the sample processing device.
             [00398] One or more component of the device may be contained within a housing. The housing may
partially or completely surround components of the device. A display may be provided on the housing so that the
display may be visible.

          [00402] FIG. 4 shows an example of a sample collection, processing, and analysis method. One or more
of the following steps may occur in such a method. The order of the steps may be modified, or one or more step
may be optional or may be substituted by another step. Steps illustrated in Fig. 4 by boxes numbered from 400 to
440 represent steps which may be considered pre-analytic steps. Pre-analytic steps include sample collection,
verification, preparation, including oversight, calibration, running of controls, acquisition of raw data, and other
steps as shown in the figure and as disclosed herein. In embodiments, oversight of pre-analytic steps may be
performed at one or more times before, during, and after sample collection and testing, or may be continuous
throughout a period or periods before, during, and after sample collection and testing. Steps illustrated in Fig. 4 by
boxes numbered from 450 to 460 represent steps which may be considered analytic steps. Analytic steps include
analysis of data received from a device at a sample collection site, as indicated in the figure and as disclosed herein.
In embodiments, oversight of analytic steps may be performed at one or more times before, during, and after
analysis, or may be continuous throughout a period or periods before, during, and after analysis. Steps illustrated in
Fig. 4 by boxes numbered from 470 to 480 represent steps which may be considered post-analytic steps. Post
analytic steps include review of the analysis of data, comparison with controls, calibrations, device and sample
identification and information, review of report generation and of the report generated for a particular test, and other
steps as indicated in the figure and as disclosed herein. In embodiments, oversight of post-analytic steps may be
performed at one or more times before, during, and after post-analysis, or may be continuous throughout a period or
periods before, during, and after post-analysis. Methods disclosed herein, and devices and systems useful in the
practice of such methods, may be, or may be used with, or may be part of, a laboratory automation system (LAS),
or a laboratory information system (LIS), or an electronic medical record system (EMR). In embodiments of the
methods, systems, and devices disclosed herein, a method, system or device as disclosed herein may be integrated
with a LAS, a LIS, or an EMR. In embodiments, an EMR may be integrated with an LAS, a LIS, and methods,
systems, or devices as disclosed herein.
          [00403] The method may include collecting a sample from a subject 400, preparing the sample for running
a chemical reaction 410, permitting a chemical reaction with one or more reagent 420, detecting a signal relating to
the sample, chemical reaction, and/or component of the device 430, pre-processing the detected signals without
performing analysis, analyzing the data 450, generating a report based on the data 460, transmitting a report 470,
providing the report to a health care professional 480, and/or displaying a report on the device and/or screen or
other display device.
          [00404] One or more of these steps may be provided by any device or entity. The demarcations illustrated
in the figures are provided by way of example only, and are in no way limiting. For example, a sample may be
collected 400 external to a device 490. Alternatively, the sample may be collected directly at the device, or may be
collected by the device. This may occur at a sample collection site. The sample prep 410, chemical reaction 420, or
signal detection steps 430, may be performed by the device 490.
          [00405] In some embodiments, a sample may be prepared for a subsequent qualitative and/or quantitative
evaluation. Such a sample preparation for evaluation step may include one or more of the sample prep 410,
chemical reaction 420, and/or signal detection 430 steps. In some embodiments, a sample may be processed by
                                                           -73-

receiving the sample 400, and/or preparing the sample for a subsequent qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation, to
yield data necessary for the subsequent qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation. Sample processing may also
include transmitting the data from the device. In some instances, the data may be transmitted to a health care
professional of an authorized analytical facility.
           [00406] One, two or all these of these steps may take place, and one, two, or all of the steps that take place
may occur at the device at a sample collection site. Alternatively, they may take place at another entity, such as a
laboratory. The point of service site near or on the body (such as the home) of the subject may be a laboratory or
sample collection site.
           [00407] Data collected by the device may be in a raw state. This may include signals detected at the
device. The data may optionally undergo pre-processing 440. Data pre-processing does not perform actual data
analysis or comparison with any threshold values. Data pre-processing may involve modifying the format of data.
In some instances, data pre-processing may occur at a device 490 at a sample collection site. Then the pre
processed data may be transmitted to a laboratory. Alternatively, data pre-processing 440 may occur at a laboratory
492. Raw data may be sent from a device to the laboratory where pre-processing may occur. Alternatively, no pre
processing occurs within the method.
           [00408] Examples of raw data include, but are not limited to, the following: light data, including light
intensity, wavelength, polarization, and other data regarding light, e.g., output from optical detectors such as
photomultiplier tubes, photodiodes, charge-coupled devices, luminometers, spectrophotometers, cameras, and other
light sensing components and devices, including absorbance data, transmittance data, turbidity data, luminosity
data, wavelength data (including intensity at one, two, or more wavelengths or across a range of wavelengths),
reflectance data, refractance data, birefringence data, polarization, and other light data. Light data may provide
information about the presence, number, or other characteristic of an analyte, cell, particle, or other subject of
interest in a sample, tissue, container, or field of view. Light data may provide information about the presence,
progress, or completion of a chemical reaction or physical process.
           [00409] Raw data includes image data, e.g., data from digital or analog cameras, including images of
tissues, including tissue slices and biopsy samples; images of cells, particles, crystals, or other elements which may
be present in a sample; images may include two-dimensional images of cells particles, or crystals, such as
fluorescently labeled or chemiluminescent cells; two-dimensional images of light scattered by cells, particles, or
crystals; two-dimensional images of cells, particles or crystals taken using phase contrast, bright-field, dark-field,
interference contrast, or other technique; two-dimensional images of cells in a tissue slice or other histological
specimen, where the cells may, or may not be stained. Images may include three-dimensional images of cells
particles, or crystals, such as fluorescently labeled or chemiluminescent cells; three-dimensional images of light
scattered by cells, particles, or crystals; three-dimensional images of cells, particles or crystals taken using phase
contrast, bright-field, dark-field, interference contrast, or other technique; three-dimensional images of cells in a
tissue slice or other histological specimen, where the cells may, or may not be stained. Raw data includes cell
counts, cell shape, numbers of stained or labeled cells, and intensity of staining or labeling.
           [00410] Raw data includes temperature measurements, duration measurements, pH measurements, ion and
other analyte measurements, particle counts, hematocrit measurements, and other measurements of chemical and
physical characteristics of a sample, or of sample constituents. Raw data includes data measuring or indicating the
                                                             -74-

progress of a chemical reaction or physical change, including color changes due to enzymatic action on the product
of a chemical reaction. Such raw data provides data from chemical assays, including measurements of light emitted
or absorbed during or following chemical reactions, binding reactions, competition reactions, and other reactions
and assays. Such raw data may provide a direct measure of the chemical reaction or assay, or further processing or
analysis based on the raw data may be required to provide a desired measurement.
          [00411] Raw data may be pre-processed by a device prior to transmission to a laboratory location. In
embodiments, raw data is transmitted from a sample collection location to a laboratory location without pre
processing.
          [00412] Data analysis may occur 450 in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Data analysis
may include a subsequent qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of a sample. The quantitative and/or qualitative
analysis may involve a determination of clinical relevance of the biological sample or lack thereof. Data analysis
may include one or more comparison of the data with a threshold value. Said comparison may be used to determine
the presence or concentration of one or more analyte, or may be useful for analytical methods and/or pathological
analysis described elsewhere herein. Data analysis may occur at a laboratory 492. In some embodiments, the
laboratory may be a certified laboratory. The data that may be analyzed may be raw data or pre-processed data. A
device may process a sample without analyzing the sample. Data analysis does not occur on the device in this
scenario. In some embodiments, processing the sample on the device does not yield a determination of the presence
or concentration level of one or more analytes, two or more analytes, three or more analytes, four or more analytes,
five or more analytes, six or more analytes, seven or more analytes, eight or more analytes, nine or more analytes,
ten or more analytes, twelve or more analytes, fifteen or more analytes, or twenty or more analytes. In some
instances, processing the sample on the device does not yield a determination of the presence or concentration of
one or more, or any number of analytes (including those described elsewhere herein), belonging to the categories of
cardiac marker, blood gas, electrolyte, lactate, hemoglobin, or coagulation factors. In some embodiments,
processing the sample on the device does not yield a determination of the presence or concentration of one or more,
two or more, three or more, or any number of analytes (including those described elsewhere herein), belonging to
the following: sodium, potassium, chloride, TCO2 , anion Gap, ionized calcium, glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine,
lactate, hematocrit, hemoglobin, pH, PCO 2 , P0 2 , HCO 3, base excess, S02, ACT Kaolin, ACT Celite, PT/INR, cTnl,
CK-MB, and BNP. In some instances, processing the sample does not include a display of the presence or
concentration of one or more, or any number of analytes (including those described elsewhere herein), belonging to
the categories of cardiac marker, blood gas, electrolyte, lactate, hemoglobin, or coagulation factors. Similarly, in
some instances, processing the sample does not include a display of the presence or concentration of one or more, or
any number of analytes (including those described elsewhere herein), belonging to the following: sodium,
potassium, chloride, TCO 2 , anion Gap, ionized calcium, glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate, hematocrit,
hemoglobin, pH, PCO 2 , P0 2 , HC0 3, base excess, s02, ACT Kaolin, ACT Celite, PT/INR, cTnl, CK-MB, and BNP.
          [00413] Data analysis may include a qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the sample. Said
qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the sample may yield a determination of the presence or concentration
of one or more, two or more, three or more, four or more, five or more, six or more, ten or more, fifteen or more, or
twenty or more analytes. In some examples, analytes may belong to categories involved in one or more of the
following types of research and/or analyses: immunoassay, nucleic acid assay, receptor-based assay, cytometric
assay, colorimetric assay, enzymatic assay, electrophoretic assay, electrochemical assay, spectroscopic assay,

MB, and/or BNP.
          [00414] The data that may be analyzed may be provided from a device 490 or may be modified at the
laboratory 492 or other entity prior to being analyzed. In another embodiment of the invention, the data analysis
450 may occur on the device without occurring at a laboratory. Alternatively, data analysis may occur on both the
device and at the laboratory or the device may be the laboratory. The analysis may occur at a point of service
location, such as a home, office, doctor's office/hospital, retailer site, or other point of service location. Any
description herein of a laboratory location or other location, may apply to any other point of service location
described elsewhere herein.
          [00415] A report may be generated 460 based on the data. A report may be based on analyzed data 450 or
may be based on data in its raw or pre-processed form. The report may be generated based on a qualitative and/or
quantitative evaluation of the sample. The report may be generated at a laboratory 492, such as an authorized
analytical facility. Alternatively, the report can be generated at the device, or by any other entity. The report may
be transmitted 470. The report may be transmitted by the same entity that generated the report. Alternatively, a
different entity can transmit the report. The report may be transmitted by a laboratory 492, such as an authorized
analytical facility, a device 490, cartridge, or any other entity.
          [00416] The report may be received by a health care professional 480. The health care professional may
be provided at a location separate from the device 490 and/or the laboratory 492. The health care professional may
be capable of relying on the report in order to diagnose, treat, and/or provide disease prevention for the subject.
          [00417] Thus, as previously described, any one or more of these steps may be optional. Any one or more
of these steps may be performed at a sample collection site or in or on a subject by a device 490 or may be
                                                            -76-

performed at a laboratory 492, or at any other entity. In some embodiments, the location where a data analysis 450
step may be performed may be certified, or may undergo review or oversight.
          [00418] A device may be configured to process a sample. Sample processing may include receiving a
sample 400 and/or preparing a sample for subsequent qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation, to yield necessary
for the subsequent qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation. Preparing the sample for subsequent qualitative and/or
quantitative evaluation may include one or more sample preparation step 410, chemical reaction step or physical
processing step 420, and/or detection step 430. Processing the sample may include adding one or more reagent or
fixatives. Sample processing may optionally also include transmitting data electronically. The data may be
transmitted to a health care professional of an authorized analytical facility and/or displayed on the screen. The data
may be transmitted and/or displayed simultaneously.
          [00419] The sample may be collected from a subject 400 in any manner described elsewhere herein. For
example, a fingerstick may collect the sample from the subject. In other examples, feces, urine, or tissue may be
collected in an operating and/or emergency room, or any other sample collection mechanism described elsewhere
herein may be utilized. The collected sample may be provided to a device 490. The sample collection may occur at
a sample collection site, or elsewhere. The sample may be provided to the device at a sample collection site.
          [00420] Optionally, the sample may be prepared for a chemical reaction and/or physical processing step
410. The sample preparation step may include one or more of the following: centrifugation, separation, filtration,
dilution, enriching, purification, precipitation, incubation, pipetting, transport, chromatography, cell lysis,
cytometry, pulverization, grinding, activation, ultrasonication, micro column processing, processing with magnetic
beads or nanoparticles, or other sample preparation steps. The sample may be transferred within a device. Sample
preparation may include one or more step to separate blood into serum and/or particulate fractions, or to separate
any other sample into various components. Sample preparation may include one or more step to dilute and/or
concentrate blood, or other biological samples. Sample preparation may include adding an anti-coagulant or other
ingredients to a sample. Sample preparation may also include purification of a sample. Sample preparation may
involve altering the density of a sample, and/or creating a density profile of a sample. In some instances, denser
portions of a sample may be separated from less dense portions of a sample. Sample preparation may include
separating solid components of a sample from aqueous components of a sample. In some examples, sample
preparation may involve centrifugation, incubation and/or cell lysis. Sample preparation may include causing the
sample to flow, such as a laminar flow. Sample preparation may include transporting a sample from one portion of
a device to another. Sample preparation may include incubating a sample. The sample preparation may include a
process to render a biological sample applicable prior to undergoing a chemical reaction and/or running an assay.
The sample preparation step may render a biological sample ready for running one or more clinical test, which may
include adding a series of reagents, running a protocol and/or running an assay.
          [00421] Optionally, the sample may undergo a chemical reaction with a reagent 420. The chemical
reaction may occur following a sample preparation step. Alternatively, the chemical reaction need not follow a
sample preparation step. Sample preparation steps may occur prior to, concurrently with, and/or after a chemical
reaction. In some embodiments, preparing a sample for qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation may include
permitting a chemical reaction. One or more type of assay, as described elsewhere herein may occur. For example,
a sample preparation step (or e.g., a chemical reaction that may occur while preparing a sample for qualitative
                                                            -77-

assay, and/or other types of assays or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, a heater and/or thermal block
may be employed. The chemical reaction may include providing the sample at a desired temperature. The
chemical reaction may also include maintaining and/or varying the temperature of the sample before, during, and/or
after the chemical reaction. Any description herein of chemical reaction may include any type of reaction that may
occur in the device. For instance, chemical reactions may include physical interactions, chemical interactions,
and/or other physical interactions or transformations. In some embodiments, a display (such as a screen) or sensors
in a device may conduct imaging externally. For example, the device may be capable of conducting MRI,
ultrasound, or other scans.
          [00422] The sample preparation and/or chemical reaction may occur in response to one or more
instructions. The instructions may be stored locally on the device or may be provided from an external source. In
some embodiments, the external source is a laboratory. In some embodiments, the sample preparation and/or
chemical reaction procedures may be self-educated. For example, they may be capable of picking up different ways
of preparing a sample and/or making it ready for analysis. In some embodiments, the sample preparation
procedures may be able to self adjust to utilize various sample preparation techniques given a set of parameters.
The sample preparation adjustment or maintenance may or may not rely on signals detected relating to a sample,
and/or to parameters and/or instructions provided by an operator. The sample preparation procedures may be self
learning. One or more controller that may provide instructions to conduct a sample preparation and/or chemical
reaction may be capable of self-learning.
          [00423] The adjustments may be made in response to new instructions that may be generated locally on
the device or that may be provided from the external source. For example, new instructions may be updated and/or
pushed down from the external source. There may be a dynamic process in which the sample preparation and/or
chemical reaction and/or physical processing steps are performed in accordance with changeable instructions. Any
description herein relating to a sample preparation and/or chemical reaction may also include any physical
processing steps.
          [00424] One or more signal may be detected 430 from the device. The signal may be detected after a
sample preparation step has been done and/or after a chemical reaction and/or physical processing step has taken
place. In some embodiments, one or more signal may be detected even if no sample preparation and/or chemical
reaction has taken place on the sample. The signals may be based on a reading of a sample that may or may not
have undergone an assay. The signals may be based on a measurement relating to the device.
          [00425] In some instances, one or more additional sample preparation steps may occur. For instance, an
additional sample preparation for qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation may occur. Such preparation may be
made based on at least one of: prior preparation of the biological sample and/or analysis of the data by the health
care professional. Reflex testing may occur based on earlier results. The reflex testing may occur in an automatic
                                                          -78-

and dynamic manner before, during, or after the test/analyses. Earlier evaluation may yield further testing, which
may be automated.
           [00426] Optionally, data may undergo pre-processing 440. Raw data of detected signals may or may not
undergo pre-processing. Pre-processing may affect the format of the raw data. For example, the pre-processing
may normalize a format of the data. The pre-processing may put the data into a desired form. Pre-processing may
occur without performing any analysis of the data. In some embodiments, the pre-processing may alter the form of
the data without altering the content of the data. In some instances, pre-processing does not compare the data with
any threshold values or perform any valuation judgments.
           [00427] The data may be analyzed 450, as described elsewhere herein. Data analysis may include a
subsequent qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of a sample. Optionally, a report may be generated based on
the raw data, pre-processed data, or the analyzed data. The report and/or the data may be transmitted to a health
care professional. A software system may perform chemical analysis and/or pathological analysis, or these could be
distributed amongst combinations of lab, clinical, and referenced/contracted specialty personnel (e.g., lab and
John's Hopkins laboratory for specialty experts of some diseases or to engage them as part of/in a certified
laboratory).
           [00428] In some embodiments, the report may be reviewed before being transmitted to the health care
professional. In some instances, the data may be reviewed before or after the report is generated. The review may
occur by one or more pathologist or other qualified person. The pathologist may be associated with a laboratory
492. The pathologist may or may not be physically located at the laboratory facility. The pathologist may be
employed by the laboratory. For an authorized analytical facility, oversight may be provided via a regulatory body.
In some embodiments, the laboratory may be a CLIA certified laboratory. A board certified entity (which may
include board-certified personnel) may review the data/reports and provide a measure of quality control and
verification. In some embodiments, the board certified entity may include one or more pathologist.
           [00429] In some embodiments, a device may be a certified device. The device may be under the oversight
of a regulatory body. A board certified entity may review the data/reports of the device and provide a measure of
quality control, performance of calibrators, of a test, and verification. A health care professional may review and/or
provide oversight of the data/reports from the device. Alternatively, a software program may be provided that may
review data generated by the device. The software program may be created by or under the review of a health care
professional. The software program may be maintained by an authorized person, such as a health care professional.

The laboratory may be capable of providing oversight 832. Oversight may be provided by a health care
professional and/or a software program. The device may communicate with the laboratory across a network 860,
including any of those described elsewhere herein. A cloud computing infrastructure may be provided. The cloud
computing infrastructure may be part of the system/infrastructure/device. The device may be provided in or on a
subject, or at a sample collection site. The laboratory may be an authorized analytical facility, such as a CLIA
certified facility.
          [00433] FIG. 8(iii) shows an example of a device 840 which may be capable of performing a sample
processing 842 step, analysis step 844, and providing oversight 846. In some embodiments, the oversight may be
provided by an oversight software program on the device. The device may communicate with a network 870,
including any of those described elsewhere herein. A cloud computing infrastructure may be provided. The device
may be provided in or on a subject, or at a sample collection site. In some embodiments, the device may be
certified by a regulatory body. In some instances, the device may be CLIA certified.
          [00434] In embodiments of the devices, systems, and methods disclosed herein, the handling of a sample
may comprise one of three stages: a first stage which may be termed a "pre-analysis" stage; a second stage which
may be termed an "analysis" stage; and a third stage which may be termed a "post-analysis" stage. In embodiments,
a pre-analysis stage may include such actions and steps as, e.g., sample collection, sample preparation, sample
testing, detection of a signal from a sample or observation or imaging of a sample; data pre-processing (if any), and
other actions and steps prior to analysis of data obtained regarding a sample. For example, a pre-analytic action may
include initiation of a test, and may include contacting a sample with a reagent, detection of the amount of light
emitted from, or the amount of light absorbed by, a sample following contact with a reagent, or other such action or
step. In embodiments, an analysis stage may include such actions and steps as, e.g., analysis of data obtained
regarding a sample, generation of a report regarding the sample and its analysis, and other actions and steps
regarding the analysis of data obtained regarding a sample. For example, an analytic action or step may include
correcting raw data based on device environmental data and/or calibrations specific for the device or reagents used
to examine the sample; calculation of a value, e.g., a concentration value, a hematocrit value, a volume of a cell, or
other value; determination of a type or types of cells, particles, or other subject in a sample; or other step or action.
In embodiments, a post-analysis stage may include such actions and steps as, e.g., transmission of a report regarding
a sample, contacting or receiving communications from a health care professional or other provider regarding such
a report, and other actions and steps subsequent to the analysis of data obtained regarding a sample. For example, a
post-analytic action or step may comprise a determination of whether or not a test is accurate, e.g., by comparing
outliers, controls, and replicates to the results of an analysis. For example, a post-analytic action or step may
comprise highlighting values or results that are outliers or may be a cause for concern (e.g., above or below a
normal or acceptable range, or indicative of an abnormal condition), or combinations of results which, together,
may indicate the presence of an abnormal condition. Such post-analytic action, communicated to a physician or
other health-care provider may better insure that the physician or other health-care provider is made aware of, and
cognizant of, possible concerns and may thus be more likely to take appropriate action.
          [00435] In embodiments of devices, systems and methods disclosed herein, a test of a sample may be
performed within a device.
                                                            -80-

          [00436]    In embodiments of devices, systems and methods disclosed herein, a test of a sample may be
initiated within a device, and raw data derived from the sample may be transmitted to a different location, e.g., a
laboratory location. Transmission of raw data may be via the cloud or other network. In embodiments where a test
of a sample may be initiated within a device, and raw data is transmitted to another location, the test may be
completed at a location other than within the device; for example, a test may be completed at a laboratory location
using raw data transmitted to the laboratory location via the cloud, or via another network. In such embodiments,
the test of the sample is started at the sample collection site (within the device) and is completed at the laboratory
location. In embodiments, a test of the sample may be started and completed within the device at the sample
collection site. In embodiments, testing of a sample may be started and completed within a device, and raw data
derived from the sample may be transmitted to a different location, e.g., a laboratory location.
          [00437] In embodiments of the devices, systems, and methods disclosed herein, the device may be placed
at a sample collection site that is physically distant from the laboratory, and processes a sample without physical
transport of the sample from the device to the laboratory. In embodiments of the devices, systems, and methods
disclosed herein, the device, although placed at a sample collection site that is physically distant from the
laboratory, operates under the control of the laboratory, and operates under the oversight of the laboratory. In
embodiments of the devices, systems, and methods disclosed herein, control and oversight of the device at a sample
collection site may be effected by a processor at the laboratory location or by an individual affiliated with the
laboratory. The laboratory may be an authorized analytical facility, and may be a CLIA-compliant laboratory,
CLIA-certified laboratory, or CLIA-waived laboratory.
          [00438] A device as disclosed herein may be, or comprise, a sample processing device. A device as
disclosed herein may be, or comprise, a sample processing unit.
          [00439] In embodiments, a device for performing a sample processing step as disclosed herein may be a
CLIA-certified device; may be a device operated in a CLIA-certified laboratory or location; may be a CLIA
compliant device; may be a device operated in a CLIA-compliant laboratory or location; may be a device operated
by a CLIA-certified operator; may be a device operated by a CLIA-compliant operator; may be a device operated in
a CLIA-compliant manner; may be a CLIA-waived device; may be a device cleared for use by a regulatory body
empowered to do so; may be a device cleared for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; may be a device
classified as exempt by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; may be a device cleared for use, e.g., under section
5 10(k) of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; may be a device with no substantial equivalent under section
510(k) of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; or the device may have no governmental certification.
          [00440] In embodiments, a device as disclosed herein may be or comprise a CLIA-waived device, and
may perform a CLIA-compliant or CLIA-certified test on or with a sample. In embodiments, a device as disclosed
herein may be or comprise a CLIA-waived device, and may perform a CLIA-waived test on or with a sample. In
embodiments, a device as disclosed herein may be or comprise a CLIA-compliant or CLIA-certified device, and
may perform a CLIA-compliant or CLIA-certified test on or with a sample. In embodiments, a device as disclosed
herein may be or comprise a CLIA-compliant or CLIA-certified device, and may perform a CLIA-waived test on or
with a sample. In embodiments, a device as disclosed herein may be in or at a CLIA-compliant or CLIA-certified
laboratory or location, and may perform a CLIA-compliant or CLIA-certified test on or with a sample. In
                                                            -81-

embodiments, a device as disclosed herein may be in or at a CLIA-compliant or CLIA-certified laboratory or
location, and may perform a CLIA-waived test on or with a sample.
           [00441] In embodiments, a device as disclosed herein may operate under the oversight or control of a
laboratory. For example, a device as disclosed herein may process a sample at a sample collection site under the
oversight of a laboratory, where the laboratory is placed at a laboratory location that is physically distant from the
sample collection site. Thus, in embodiments, the device, while physically distant from the laboratory, operates as
part of the laboratory due to its operation being controlled by the laboratory. In embodiments, the device, while
physically distant from the laboratory, operates as part of the laboratory due to its operation being under the
oversight of the laboratory. In embodiments, testing may be performed on a device located at a sample collection
site, and raw data and/or results may be transmitted to a laboratory at a laboratory location. Such raw data and/or
results may be analyzed at a laboratory at a laboratory location. The laboratory may be an authorized analytical
facility, and may be a CLIA certified laboratory. Thus, laboratory certified results may be obtained from testing
performed at a sample collection site.
           [00442] In embodiments, testing may be initiated on a device located at a sample collection site, and may
be continued and may be completed in a laboratory at a laboratory location (e.g., using raw data transmitted from
the device). In embodiments, testing may thus be completed at a laboratory location, and analysis may be
performed at a laboratory location from results obtained from testing initiated at a sample collection site and
completed in a laboratory at a laboratory location. The laboratory may be an authorized analytical facility, and may
be a CLIA certified laboratory. Thus, laboratory certified results may be obtained from testing initiated at a sample
collection site and completed in a laboratory at a laboratory location.
           [00443] In embodiments, oversight of the operation of a device may be on-going, e.g., may comprise
oversight at multiple times during the operation of a device, and may comprise continuous oversight of the
operation of a device during the operation of the device. For example, oversight may comprise oversight of the
operation of the device at multiple times during the testing of a sample, and may comprise continuous oversight of
the operation of the device during the testing of a sample. Oversight of a protocol for the operation of a device
during the testing of a sample may include updating the protocol with new process steps, corrected process steps, or
new commands regarding process steps. Oversight may be provided or performed using a processor. Oversight may
be provided or performed using a processor at a sample collection site (e.g., on a device), using a processor at a
laboratory location, using a processor that is part of the cloud, or of a network (which cloud or network may or may
not include a processor on a device or at a laboratory location). Oversight may be performed or provided by an
individual (e.g., an individual affiliated with an authorized analytical facility). Oversight may include using any one
or more of such processors in conjunction with an individual (e.g., an individual affiliated with an authorized
analytical facility).
           [00444] Protocols may receive and utilize identifying data and information identifying the device in use,
the cartridge, the sample, the patient, and other information and data. Identifying information and data may identify
a particular device, its past history, present status, present condition, environmental information regarding the
device and its environs, and other data and information. For example, in embodiments, patient identification may be
retained with each sample from beginning to end of sample collection, testing, analysis, and reporting of results. In
embodiments, patient identification may be retained with each sample from beginning to end of sample collection,
                                                             -82-

testing, analysis, reporting of results, and billing. Identifying information and data may identify a particular
cartridge, its contents (including reagents, disposables, and sample information), its past history, present status,
present condition, environmental information regarding the cartridge and its environs, and other data and
information. Identifying information and data may identify a particular patient, including a patient's identity, age,
sex, medications, medical history, test history, present status, present condition, and other data and information.
Identifying information and data may identify a particular sample, its mode of collection, patient derived from,
condition (sample volume, whether contacted with heparin, EDTA, filtered, coagulated, whether or not there is an
air bubble present, whether a blood sample may have undergone hemolysis, or is lipemic), and other data and
information. Identifying information and data may specify an analysis to be performed, or that has been performed,
on data from a sample. Identifying information and data may specify post-analytic actions to be performed, such as
regarding a report, comparison with other test data or analysis, or other action or step.
          [00445] Protocols may be updated and may be tailored to specific devices, or environmental conditions
within or around the device, e.g., taking into account the specific properties and characteristics of sensors, motors,
physical dimensions, and other properties and characteristics of an individual device; taking into account the
temperature, humidity, air pressure, position and movement of internal modules or components within the device;
condition and status of motors, sensors, or other components; taking into account calibrations of motors, sensors,
and other components; and other properties and characteristics. Protocols may be updated and may be tailored to
specific reagents and disposables, e.g., taking into account control reagents, calibrations of reagents, the specific
properties and characteristics of reagents in a cartridge, of tips in a cartridge, of the temperature of a cartridge, or
other characteristic or property. Oversight may comprise oversight during or following analysis of data, and may
provide for further testing, or re-testing of a sample or of additional samples from a patient.
          [00446] Use of protocols that include device-specific information, cartridge-specific information, or other
information and data specific for sensors, devices, reagents, and other components and elements of testing of a
sample, including calibration and control information, provides for correction and scaling of raw data to insure that
values and observations obtained from such raw data is correct, consistent, and reproducible. Such values and
observations obtained are reproducible across devices, and over time (e.g., from subsequent samples) allowing for
comparison of patient results with group and historical values for better screening, diagnosis and treatment based on
test results and analysis. Oversight as disclosed herein provides oversight of the integrity of performance of tests,
and of results of tests, including oversight of each sample, oversight of the testing of each sample, oversight of the
scaling and calibration of raw data obtained during testing, oversight of test integrity, oversight of use and analysis
of data in view of controls, calibrators, replicates, and outliers, oversight of the analysis of data in view of device
and reagent environmental and calibration information, oversight of the analysis of test results, oversight of the
reporting of test results and analysis, and oversight of post-analytic activity and communications. Device and
cartridge information may be retained in the cloud or other network; may be retained on or with each device or
cartridge; or may be retained, partially or completely, in both locations.
          [00447] Devices, systems, methods, and protocols as disclosed herein provide multifunctional capabilities,
allowing a single device at a sample collection site to perform multiple tests, including multiple types of tests, on a
sample; such test may be run rapidly, requiring only small amounts of sample (e.g., requiring only the amount of
blood available from a finger-stick), and may be run reliably and accurately, allowing for reproducibility and
reliable comparison across devices and samples. Thus, the devices disclosed herein are multifunctional; the assays
                                                             -83-

they perform are multifunctional; the controls are multifunctional; and the oversight is multifunctional.
Multifunctional includes the ability to perform multiple types of assays, including nucleic acid assays, general
chemistry assays, cytometry (e.g., cell imaging, flow cytometry) assays, ELISA assays, and others (e.g., as
disclosed in U.S. Patent Application U.S. Patent Application 13/244,947 and in U.S. Patent Application
                , entitled "Systems and Methods for Multi-Purpose Analysis," filed February 18, 2013), on a single
device and from a single sample.
          [00448] Devices, systems, methods, and protocols as disclosed herein provide rapid results from testing a
small volume sample; such testing and results can be automated, and the rapid provision of such results, e.g. by a
laboratory to a health care provider, provides rapid and reliable information for better patient care. Laboratories,
such as CLIA-compliant and CLIA-certified laboratories, may have pathologists in place, or readily available, for
review and interpretation of results, for further analysis, and for possible recommendations regarding further testing
and/or treatment. As disclosed herein, embodiments of devices, systems, methods, including protocols and
oversight as disclosed herein may include some or all of the features, elements, and capabilities disclosed, and may
include these features, elements, and capabilities in any combination of some or all of such features, elements, and
capabilities.
          [00449] In embodiments, oversight may include at least the following processes: 1) sample collection; 2)
receipt of data (e.g., test data, raw data, device data, cartridge data, sample data, patient data, etc.); 3) recognition of
a status or problem related to the data); analysis of the status or problem in view of the sample, the test being
performed, the device, reagents, etc. performing the test, etc.; and 4) sending instructions to the device, operator, or
physician (e.g., general practitioner, pathologist, or other healthcare provider) based on the data and analysis, for
further action or modification or cessation of present actions. Such oversight may be intermittent (e.g., occur once
or at a few times before, during, or after testing), or may be continuous (on-going during testing, or on-going from a
time before testing, and may continue through or beyond the period of testing). In embodiments, oversight may be
dynamic oversight, allowing updating of protocols as events occur or data is obtained, to insure proper procedures,
proper quality, proper integrity, and proper results from such testing. Such oversight and testing may be "patient
aware", i.e. may take into account the identity, characteristics (e.g., age, sex, medical history, medication, condition,
physician, insurance coverage, or other factor related to the patient for whom the test is being conducted. In this
way, the sample and sample analysis may always be linked to the patient throughout the testing process - at the pre
analytical stage, at the analytical stage, and at the post-analytical stage. As disclosed herein, all these tests and
analysis may be provided without physically transporting a sample to a laboratory location. Sample collection and
processing by the device at a sample collection site, followed by transmission of raw data to the laboratory location
allows testing, analysis, and reporting of result to be performed without physically transporting a sample to a
laboratory location. The transmission of raw data to the laboratory location provides "digital" transport of a sample
or effectively a "virtual sample" obviating a need for physically transporting a sample to a laboratory location.
Oversight and control of the operation of the device at the sample collection site by a protocol, provided by the
cloud or other network, or directly from a laboratory location, allows for the control and operation of the device by
the laboratory. Such control and operation may be by a CLIA-compliant laboratory, which may be a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
          [00450] For example, protocols used by the device in processing the sample may be provided by the
laboratory, may be updated by the laboratory, and their proper application may be overseen by the laboratory.
                                                             -84-

Protocols may include instructions and procedures directing the forms of processing and testing to apply to a
sample; the order of performing such processing and testing of a sample; the timing of such processing and testing
of a sample; the pre-processing, if any, of data obtained by the processing and testing of a sample; the compilation
of data, including raw data (and pre-processed data, if any), obtained by the processing and testing of a sample; the
transmission of data, including raw data (and pre-processed data, if any), obtained by the processing and testing of a
sample, to a laboratory; the receipt of further instructions from a laboratory in response to the data transmitted from
the device to the laboratory; further processing or testing of a sample pursuant to any further instructions from a
laboratory in response to the data transmitted from the device to the laboratory; and the disposal of sample and other
wastes following such processing and testing of a sample.
          [00451] In embodiments, oversight by the laboratory may include oversight of the operation of the device;
oversight of sensing operations within the device; oversight of the analysis of data transmitted by the device to the
laboratory; oversight of a report generated pursuant to the analysis of such data; oversight of billing for services
provided; and other oversight. In embodiments, oversight by a laboratory may include oversight of the collection of
a sample at the sample collection site, of the placement of the sample in a cartridge at the sample collection site, of
the placement of a cartridge in a device at a sample collection site, or other oversight. Such oversight may include
confirmation that proper instructions for such procedures had been provided, and that proper procedures had been
followed. In embodiments, oversight may include oversight of the confirmation of insurance coverage of a subject
prior to, concurrent with, or subsequent to the processing a sample. Control or oversight of the device may be
implemented, for example, via electronic communication such as via a cloud computing infrastructure, other
telephonic communication (which may include microwave or radio components, e.g., via cell-phone links), radio
communication, infrared linkages, and communication utilizing other forms of electromagnetic radiation. Electronic
communication between a device at a sample collection site and a laboratory at a laboratory location may include
downloading of protocols; transfer or updating of protocols; communication of device information (e.g., device
identification; device status; temperature or other environmental information; date, time or sequence information;
supply status (e.g., supply of reagents, supply of cartridges, or other materials); and other device information);
communication of patient or subject information; communication of sample information (e.g., identification
information related to a sample; data obtained from a sample; information regarding processing applied to a sample;
information regarding equipment and procedures used to obtain data from the sample; and other data regarding or
derived from a sample); communication of insurance information; communication of payment information; and
communication of other information. Such oversight may be provided or performed using a processor, e.g., a
processor at a sample collection site, at a laboratory location, that is part of the cloud, or of a network; may be
provided or performed by an individual (e.g., an individual affiliated with an authorized analytical facility); and
may include using a processor in conjunction with an individual (e.g., an individual affiliated with an authorized
analytical facility).
          [00452] In embodiments, oversight by the laboratory may include oversight of the operation of the device.

                                                            -88-

location. In embodiments, the protocol may be updated by ftirther instructions from the laboratory. A protocol may
include instructions regarding a cartridge, or cartridges, which may be used in accordance with the protocol. A
subject may wish to provide a sample for testing. In embodiments of the devices, systems, and methods disclosed
herein, the subject may provide identification information, or testing information (e.g., an order from a physician or
other health provider regarding a test or tests to be performed; identification information regarding an operator, etc.)
to the device or to an operator of the device at the sample collection site. The device may provide such
identification or testing information to the laboratory. The laboratory may use such identification or testing
information to determine the eligibility or appropriateness of the test or of the subject for the test (e.g., by
determination of insurance status and coverage, billing information, sex, age, or health status of the subject, or other
means). In view of the identification or testing information, the laboratory may provide instructions to the subject or
operator (.e.g., via a device user interface, a device audio link, telephone, or other means) regarding collection of a
sample, the proper cartridge to be used, or other information. Collection of the sample may require no processing of
the sample by the subject or by an operator. For example, sample collection may be automated, sample processing
may be automated, and other functions may be automated, providing better control and integrity of sample
collection, processing and analysis; such control may aid in compliance with CLIA or other regulatory standards,
e.g., by reducing the possibility of operator variance or error. In view of the identification or testing information,
the laboratory may provide instructions, including but not limited to, a protocol, to the device. Such instructions
may cause the device (e.g., via a user interface, audio output, or other means) to request confirmation or further
information from the subject or operator at the sample collection site. A sample may be obtained from the subject at
the sample collection site. The sample may be placed in the device, or the sample may be placed in a cartridge and
the cartridge with the sample may be placed in the device. The device may transmit status, test, or identification
information to the laboratory. In view of the cartridge, status, test, or identification information, the laboratory may
transmit instructions, including but not limited to a protocol, to the device. For example, the laboratory may
transmit instructions to the device effecting the rejection of the sample, or of the cartridge with the sample, if the
sample, cartridge, protocol, identification information, or other information do not match or are otherwise
incompatible with proper operation, processing, or testing of the sample by the device, or if the subject lacks
insurance coverage or if the test is otherwise inappropriate for the subject, the cartridge, or the device. In view of
the cartridge, status, test, or identification information, the laboratory may transmit a protocol, or update a protocol,
to the device. The laboratory may transmit instructions to the device effecting the processing and testing of the
sample. The transmission of instructions from the laboratory to the device may be via the cloud, telephone, radio,
network, LAN, other electronic or electromagnetic means, or any other communications link. Instructions effecting
the processing and testing of a sample may include instructions effecting transport of the sample, of reagents, or of
device components within or to the device; may include instructions effecting mixing of the sample and reagents;
may include instructions effecting processing and/or testing of the sample; may include instructions effecting
observation or measurement of the sample, including instructions effecting acquisition of data from the sample;
may include instructions effecting the transmission of data (which may include raw data and pre-processed data)
from the device to the laboratory; and may include instructions effecting the disposal of the sample and waste
resulting from the processing and testing of the sample. These instructions enable the device to process a sample
without physical transport of the sample from the device to the laboratory. The laboratory may analyze the data
received from the device. Laboratory analysis of data received from the device may be dynamic analysis (e.g.,
analysis may be confirmed, altered or updated in view of information or data provided with or about the sample or
                                                             -89-

test). The laboratory may provide further instructions to the device pursuant to the analysis of the data received
from the device. Such further instructions may effect further processing or testing of the sample in the device at the
sample collection site. The laboratory may prepare a report based on the data from the sample and its analysis. The
laboratory may notify a subject, a health provider, an insurance company, or a payer regarding the processing and
testing of the sample. The laboratory may send a report to a subject, a health provider, an insurance company, or a
payer regarding the processing and testing of the sample. The laboratory may prepare bill information, or may

invention. A point of service 620 may be in communication with a laboratory 630. The point of service may be a
                                                            -93-

sample collection site and any description herein of a point of service may also apply to a sample collection site and
vice versa. The point of service may also be in communication with an LBM 610 who may also be in
communication with a payer 600. The LBM and the laboratory may be in communication with a health care
professional 640. A subject 650 may provide a sample to a point of service.
           [00480] A point of service 620 may be a sample collection center that may have a device that may be
configured to facilitate collection of a biological sample from a subject 650. As previously described, the sample
may be collected from the subject at the point of service, or may be provided to the device at the point of service.
           [00481] The sample collection center may be capable of communicating with a laboratory 630. The
laboratory may be a certified laboratory. The sample collection center may communicate with the laboratory via a
sample processing device located at the sample collection center. The sample collection center may communicate
with the laboratory in additional ways. Data collected by the device may be transmitted from the point of service
620 to the laboratory. Such data may be related to the sample collected from the subject. Any type of data
described previously herein, including raw data, pre-processed data, or analyzed data may be provided to the
laboratory.
           [00482] The laboratory may provide the device to the point of service location. In one example, the
laboratory may either sell or lease/rent the device to the sample collection center. The laboratory may request a
payment from the sample collection center for the sales and/or leasing of the device to the sample collection center.
The sample collection center may provide a payment to the laboratory for the ownership or use of the device. The
device may be operated by a device operator. The operator may be affiliated with the point of service location. The
operator may be an employee or otherwise affiliated with the sample collection center. The operator may or may
not be trained in the use of the device. The sample collection center may be another entity separate from the
laboratory. The sample collection center may be affiliated with the point of service location or may be operated by
a separate entity. The sample collection center may be any of the point of service locations described elsewhere
herein, including but not limited to retailers (e.g., Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Health Net, Aetna, Cigna), hospitals,
medical facilities, and any other point of service. In one example, the device may be operated by a technician or
other individual associated with a retailer or other point of service. The laboratory may be functioning as a
wholesaler of the device. Alternatively, one or more intermediary entities may be provided that may purchase
devices from the laboratory, and in turn provide/sell devices to point of service locations.
           [00483] In an alternate example, the laboratory may pay the point of service location for providing the
device at the sample collection center, which may be located at the point of service location. The laboratory may
pay the point of service location for permitting use of the device at the point of service location and for permitting
the setup of the sample collection center at the point of service. For example, the laboratory may be permitted to
rent out space at a retailer, where the laboratory may setup a sample collection center having one or more devices.
The device may be operated by personnel who is or is not trained in the use of the device. The device operator may
be affiliated with the laboratory. The device operator may or may not be an employee of the laboratory. The device
and device operator may be using the point of service location as a sample collection site that is remote to the
laboratory.
           [00484] The laboratory may provide a cartridge to a point of service location. The cartridge may be
configured to be inserted into, or otherwise interface with the device. The cartridge may or may not be disposable.
                                                            -94-

The laboratory may or may not provide disposables to the service location for use with the device. Any description
herein of cartridges may also apply to the disposables and vice versa. In one example, the laboratory may either
sell the cartridge to the sample collection center. The sample collection center may be affiliated with the point of
service location and/or with a separate entity. The sample collection center may be run by the point of service
location and/or a separate entity. The laboratory may request a payment from the sample collection center for the
sales of the cartridge to the sample collection center. The sample collection center may provide a payment to the
laboratory for the cartridges. The operator of the device may be affiliated with the point of service location. The
laboratory may be functioning as a wholesaler of the cartridge. Alternatively, one or more intermediary entities
may be provided that may purchase cartridges from the laboratory, and in turn provide/sell cartridges to point of
service locations.
          [00485] In an alternate example, the laboratory need not request payment from the for providing the
cartridge at the sample collection center. The device may be operated by personnel who is or is not trained in the
use of the device. The device operator may be affiliated with the laboratory. The device operator may or may not
be an employee of the laboratory. The device and device operator may be using the point of service location as a
sample collection site that is remote to the laboratory. The cartridge may be used as part of the sample collection
service at the point of service location, for a device that may be operated by a laboratory-affiliated individual.
          [00486] The laboratory 630 may be capable of communicating with a health care professional 640. The
health care professional may be at a location separate from the laboratory and the point of service. The health care
professional may or may not have an existing relationship with the subject 650. The health care professional may
have issued a prescription for the subject to go to the point of service location and perform one or more test. The
health care professional may or may not have a relationship with point of service or with the laboratory. In some
embodiments, the laboratory may send a report to the health care professional. The medical report may be based on
data collected from a device at the point of service. The medical report may be based on an analysis of the data
collected from the device. In some embodiments, analysis of data may include the comparison of collected data
with one or more threshold value to determine the presence or concentration of at least one analyte. In some
embodiments, the laboratory may have a processor that may be configured to access a data storage unit that may
have information relating to the one or more threshold value. The analysis may occur at the laboratory 630 and the
report may be generated at the laboratory. Alternatively, the analysis may occur at the device and the report may be
generated by the device or at the laboratory.
          [00487] In some embodiments, a report may be provided to a subject 650. The report transmitted to the
subject may or may not be the same as the report provided to the health care professional 640. The reports may be
sent simultaneously, or the health care professional may receive the report first, or vice versa.
          [00488] An LBM 610 may be provided that may communicate with a payer 600 and a point of service
620. The LBM may or may not communicate with a health care professional 640 and/or a laboratory 630.
          [00489] The laboratory 630 and LBM 610 may be separate entities. The laboratory and LBM may be
separate corporations, companies, organizations, institutions, partnerships, one or more individuals, or any other
type of entity as described elsewhere herein. The laboratory and LBM may be incorporated as separate legal
entities. The LBM may be a laboratory benefits manager, and the laboratory may be a wholesaler. The laboratory
and LBM may be housed in separate facilities. Alternatively, they may share facilities.
                                                            -95-

           [00490] The LBM 610 may charge a payer 600 based on use of the device at the point of service 620. For
example, per use of the device, the LBM may charge the payer a fee. The size of the fee may depend on one or
more factors, such as the type of use of the device (e.g., number of analytes whose presence or concentration were
detected, the number of chemical reactions, the amount of sample preparation, the types of reactions that take place,
the number of device components that are used), the analysis conducted in relationship to the data collected from
the device (e.g., more complex analysis may result in a different fee from more straightforward analysis), the payer
relationship with the subject, the payer relationship with the point of service if any. The LBM and payer may have
an agreement in place that may determine the payment plan between the payer and the LBM.
           [00491] The LBM 610 may provide a payment to a point of service 620 based on use of the device at the
point of service. For example, per use of the device, the LBM may provide a payment to the point of service. In
another example, for the amount of time that the device is located at the point of service, the LBM may provide a
payment to the point of service. The size of the fee may depend on one or more factors, such as the type of use of
the device (e.g., number of analytes whose presence or concentration were detected, the number of chemical
reactions, the amount of sample preparation, the types of reactions that take place, the number of device
components that are used), the analysis conducted in relationship to the data collected from the device (e.g., more
complex analysis may result in a different fee from more straightforward analysis). The LBM and point of service
may have an agreement in place that may determine the payment plan between the point of service and the LBM
and the LBM. In alternate embodiments, the LBM may provide a payment to a laboratory 630. Any description
herein of providing payment to a point of service may also apply to a laboratory. The LBM may provide a payment
to the laboratory instead of providing a payment to the point of service, or in addition to providing a payment to the
point of service.
           [00492] In some embodiments, the LBM 610 may divide a payment received from the payer 600 into a
technical fee and a professional fee. In one example, the LBM may provide a payment to a health care professional
640 based on the professional fee. The LBM may provide a payment to the sample collection center 620 based on
the technical fee. In some embodiments, the sample collection center may be operated by a point of service, such as
a retailer, hospital, or any other point of service. In some embodiments, the sample collection center may be
operated by a laboratory. The payment may be provided to the entity for the point of service location, or to a
laboratory who may be operating a sample collection center at a point of service location.
           [00493] The LBM may make the determination of how to divide the payment from the payer. The
technical fee and/or professional fees may be based on agreements that the LBM may have with the health care
professional, point of service, and/or laboratory. The professional fee may also or alternatively be based on
agreements that the health care professional may have with the payer and/or laboratory.
           [00494] The LBM may further divide the payment from the payer into a transaction fee. The transaction
fee may be an amount that goes to the LBM. The LBM may be able to keep a fraction of the payment made by the
payer.
           [00495] FIG. 7 shows an example of a lab benefits manager/wholesaler model in accordance with an
embodiment of the invention. A retailer 700 (or other point of service), such as a pharmacy, may have one or more
sample processing device located at the retailer site. A retailer technician may operate the sample processing
                                                           -96-

device, and may place a cartridge into the device 710. The cartridge may or may not contain a sample from a
subject collected at the retailer site.
           [00496] A laboratory benefit manager 720 may be an LBM as described elsewhere herein. The laboratory
benefit manager may be an entity.
           [00497] A laboratory benefit manager 720 and a wholesaler 730 may be provided within the model. The
laboratory benefit manager and the wholesaler may be separate entities. The laboratory benefit manager and the
wholesaler may be separate legal entities, corporate entities, corporations, partnerships, organizations, and/or groups
of one or more individuals. The laboratory benefit manager and the wholesaler may be housed in different facilities
or in the same facility.
           [00498] A laboratory benefit manager 720 may be in communication with one or more payers 740. The
laboratory benefit manager may issue an invoice for a service to the payers. The payer may pay the laboratory
benefit manager. For example, the laboratory benefit manager may request a $a (e.g., $28 to provide a numerical
example) fee from the payer, who pays the laboratory benefit manager, the $a. The laboratory benefit manager may
retain a LBM fee. For example, a Sb (e.g., S1 to provide a numerical example) fee may be retained by the
laboratory benefit manager.
           [00499] The laboratory benefit manager 720 may reimburse the retailer 700 for the balance of the amount.
For example, the laboratory benefit manager may pay the retailer the remaining Sc, (e.g., $27). Sc may equal $a
minus Sb.
           [00500] The retailer may also have fees associated with the laboratory benefit manager and/or the
wholesaler. For example, the retailer may have an agent fee that the retailer may pay the laboratory benefit
manager. In one example, the agent fee is Sd (e.g., $8 to provide a numerical example). The retailer may also issue
a purchase order or pay for a product. For example, the retailer may pay for the purchase or use of the device at the
retailer site and/or cartridges. The retailer may pay the laboratory benefit manager. Alternatively, the retailer may
pay the wholesaler for the purchase or use of the device and/or cartridges. In one example, the payment for the
product may be Se (e.g., $9 to provide a numerical example).
           [00501] From a laboratory benefit manager perspective, there may be a financial benefit to following the
model. For example, the laboratory benefit manager may be receive an LBM fee based on the device use. For
example, the LBM fee may be Sb per transaction. The laboratory benefit manager may also receive an agent fee
from the retailer. For example, the laboratory benefit manager may receive an Sd admin fee. In some instances, the
laboratory benefit manager may also receive a product fee from the retailer. For example, the laboratory benefit
manager may receive a Se product fee.
           [00502] From a retailer perspective, there may be financial benefit to following the model. For example,
the retailer may receive a service income of Sc. The service income may be provided through the laboratory benefit
manager. The laboratory benefit manager may provide the service income based on a payment received from a
payer. The laboratory benefit manager may subtract an LBM fee from the amount received from the payer, and
may pass the rest on to the retailer as a service income. In additional embodiments, the laboratory benefit manager
may also subtract a professional fee, which may be provided to a health care professional or other entity, with the
remainder of the balance going to the retailer as a service income. Thus, as shown in FIG. 7, the total revenue may
                                                           -97-

be provided from a Sc service income. Costs to the retailer may include an administration fee (e.g., the Sd fee
shown), and/or a product fee (e.g., the Se fee shown). The costs may be about Sf (e.g., S17 to provide a numerical
example). Sf may equal Sd plus Se. The costs to the retailer may be lower than the service income. For example, a
Sg (e.g., $10 to provide a numerical example) gross margin is illustrated for the retailer. In some instances, Sg  = Sc
minus Sf.

          [00516] Any of the dollar amounts are provided by way of example only and shall not be construed as
limiting. Any numerical value may be inserted for the various dollar values.
          [00517] In some embodiments, a subject may be associated with a payer. For example, a payer, such as a
health insurance company, government payer, or any other payer as described herein, may provide coverage for the
subject. A payer may pay some or all of the subject's medical bills. In some embodiments, when a subject arrives
at a point of service, the identification of the subject may be verified. The identification of the subject may be
verified using the device, and/or verified by personnel at the point of service. For example, the personnel at the
point of service may view the subject's identification and/or insurance card. The device may or may not capture an
image of the subject and/or collect one or more biometric parameter from the subject. Verification may occur on
board the device. Alternatively, the identification of the subject may be collected at the point of service and may be
further verified at another entity or location. For example, a laboratory, health care professional, or payer may
verify the subject identity. The device, laboratory, health care professional, and/or payer may be capable of
accessing subject information, such as electronic health records. Verification may occur rapidly and/or in real-time.
For example, verification may occur within 10 minutes or less, 5 minutes or less, 3 minutes or less, 1 minute or less,
45 seconds or less, 30 seconds or less, 20 seconds or less, 15 seconds or less, 10 seconds or less, 5 seconds or less, 3
seconds or less, 1 second or less, 0.5 seconds or less, or 0.1 seconds or less. The verification may be automated
without requiring any human intervention.
          [00518] The system may verify the identity of the subject for the system's records, insurance coverage, to
prevent fraud, or any other purpose. The verification may be performed by the device. The verification may occur
at any time. In one example, the subject's identity may be verified prior to preparing the subject's sample for the
test. The subject's identity may be verified prior to providing a sample to the device and/or cartridge. The
                                                            -98-

verification of the subject's identity may be provided prior to, currently with, or after verifying the subject's
insurance coverage. The verification of the subject's identity may be provided prior to, currently with, or after
verifying the subject has received a prescription to undergo said qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation. The
verification may take place through communications with the medical care provider, laboratory, payer, laboratory
benefits manager, or any other entity. Verification may occur by accessing one or more data storage units. The
data storage units may include an electronic medical records database and/or a payer database. Verification may
occur rapidly and/or in real-time. For example, verification may occur within 10 minutes or less, 5 minutes or less,
3 minutes or less, 1 minute or less, 45 seconds or less, 30 seconds or less, 20 seconds or less, 15 seconds or less, 10
seconds or less, 5 seconds or less, 3 seconds or less, 1 second or less, 0.5 seconds or less, or 0.1 seconds or less.
The verification may be automated without requiring any human intervention.
           [00519] The verification may include information provided by the subject. For example, the verification
may include scanning an identification card and/or insurance card of the subject. The verification may include
taking a picture of the subject and/or the subject's face. For example, the verification may include taking a two
dimensional or three-dimensional snapshot of the subject. Cameras may be used which may provide a two
dimensional digital image of the subject and/or that may be capable of formulating a three-dimensional or four
dimensional image of the subject. A four-dimensional image of the subject may incorporate changes over time.
The verification may include taking a picture of the subject's face for identification. The verification may include
taking a picture of another portion of the subject's face for identification, including but not limited to the patient's
whole body, arm, hand, leg, torso, foot, or any other portion of the body. The verification may employ a video
camera and/or a microphone that may capture additional visual and/or audio information. The verification may
include comparing the subject's movements (e.g., gait), or voice.
           [00520] The verification may include entering personal information related to the subject, such as the
subject's name, insurance policy number, answers to key questions, and/or any other information. The verification
may include collecting one or more biometric read-out of the subject. For example, the verification may include a
fingerprint, handprint, footprint, retinal scan, temperature readout, weight, height, audio information, electrical
readouts, or any other information. The biometric information may be collected by the device. For example, the
device may have a touchscreen upon which the subject may put the subject's palm to be read by the device. The
touchscreen may be capable of scanning one or more body part of the subject, and/or receiving a temperature,
electrical, and/or pressure readout from the subject. Alternatively, the device may receive the biometric information
from other devices. For example, the device may receive the subject's weight from a scale that may be separate
from the device. The information may be sent directly from the other devices (e.g., over wired or wireless
connection) or may be entered manually.
           [00521] The verification may also include information based on a sample collected from the subject. For
example, the verification may include a genetic signature of the subject. When the sample is provided to the device,
the device may use at least part of the sample to determine the genetic signature of the subject. For example, the
device may perform one or more nucleic acid amplification step and may determine key genetic markers for the
subject. This may form the subject's genetic signature. The subject's genetic signature may be obtained prior to,
concurrently with, or after processing the sample on the device. The subject's genetic signature may be stored on
one or more data storage unit. For example, the subject's genetic signature may be stored in the subject's electronic
medical records. The subject's collected genetic signature may be compared with the subject's genetic signature
                                                           -99-

already stored in the records, if it exists. Any other unique identifying characteristic of the subject may be used to
verify the subject's identity.
          [00522] Methods for the amplification of nucleic acids, including DNA and/or RNA, are known in the art.
Amplification methods may involve changes in temperature, such as a heat denaturation step, or may be isothermal
processes that do not require heat denaturation. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) uses multiple cycles of
denaturation, annealing of primer pairs to opposite strands, and primer extension to exponentially increase copy
numbers of the target sequence. Denaturation of annealed nucleic acid strands may be achieved by the application
of heat, increasing local metal ion concentrations (e.g. US6277605), ultrasound radiation (e.g. WO/2000/049176),
application of voltage (e.g. US5527670, US6033850, US5939291, and US6333157), and application of an
electromagnetic field in combination with primers bound to a magnetically-responsive material (e.g. US5545540),
which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In a variation called RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase
(RT) is used to make a complementary DNA (cDNA) from RNA, and the cDNA is then amplified by PCR to
produce multiple copies of DNA (e.g. US5322770 and US5310652, which are hereby incorporated by reference in
their entirety).
          [00523] One example of an isothermal amplification method is strand displacement amplification,
commonly referred to as SDA, which uses cycles of annealing pairs of primer sequences to opposite strands of a
target sequence, primer extension in the presence of a dNTP to produce a duplex hemiphosphorothioated primer
extension product, endonuclease-mediated nicking of a hemimodified restriction endonuclease recognition site, and
polymerase-mediated primer extension from the 3' end of the nick to displace an existing strand and produce a
strand for the next round of primer annealing, nicking and strand displacement, resulting in geometric amplification
of product (e.g. US5270184 and US5455166, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety).
Thermophilic SDA (tSDA) uses thermophilic endonucleases and polymerases at higher temperatures in essentially
the same method (European Pat. No. 0 684 315, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).
          [00524] Other amplification methods include rolling circle amplification (RCA) (e.g., Lizardi, "Rolling
Circle Replication Reporter Systems," U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,033); helicase dependent amplification (HDA) (e.g.,
Kong et al., "Helicase Dependent Amplification Nucleic Acids," U.S. Pat. Appln. Pub. No. US 2004-0058378 Al);
and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (e.g., Notomi et al., "Process for Synthesizing Nucleic Acid,"
U.S. Pat. No. 6,410,278), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In some cases, isothermal
amplification utilizes transcription by an RNA polymerase from a promoter sequence, such as may be incorporated
into an oligonucleotide primer. Transcription-based amplification methods commonly used in the art include
nucleic acid sequence based amplification, also referred to as NASBA (e.g. US5130238); methods which rely on
the use of an RNA replicase to amplify the probe molecule itself, commonly referred to as       QQ replicase (e.g.,
Lizardi, P. et al. (1988) Bio Technol. 6, 1197-1202); self-sustained sequence replication (e.g., Guatelli, J. et al.
(1990) Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 1874-1878; Landgren (1993) Trends in Genetics 9, 199-202; and HELEN H.
LEE et al., NUCLEIC ACID AMPLIFICATION T ECHNOLOGIES (1997)); and methods for generating
additional transcription templates (e.g. US5480784 and US539949 1), which are hereby incorporated by reference in
their entirety. Further methods of isothermal nucleic acid amplification include the use of primers containing non

Isothermal amplification processes can be linear or exponential.
           [00525] Nucleic acid amplification for subject identification may comprise sequential, parallel, or
simultaneous amplification of a plurality of nucleic acid sequences, such as about, less than about, or more than
about 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 ,40, 50, 100, or more target sequences. In some embodiments, a subjects
entire genome or entire transcriptome is non-specifically amplified, the products of which are probed for one or
more identifying sequence characteristics. An identifying sequence characteristic includes any feature of a nucleic
acid sequence that can serve as a basis of differentiation between individuals. In some embodiments, an individual
is uniquely identified to a selected statistical significance using about, less than about, or more than about 10, 11,
12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 ,40, 50, 100, or more identifying sequences. In some embodiments, the statistical
significance is about, or smaller than about 10-2, 10-3, 10-4, 10-5, 10-6, 10-7, 10-8, 10-9, 10-10, 10-11, 10-1, 10-13, 10-"4,
10-"5, or smaller. Examples of identifying sequences include Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLP;

Polymorphisms (REMAP), Retrotransposon-Based Insertion Polymorphisms (RBIP), Short Interspersed Elements
(SINE), and Sequence Specific Amplified Polymorphism (SSAP). Additional examples of identifying sequences
are known in the art, for example in US20030170705, which is incorporated herein by reference. A genetic
signature may consist of multiple identifying sequences of a single type (e.g. SNPs), or may comprise a
combination of two or more different types of identifying sequences in any number or combination.
           [00526] Genetic signatures can be used in any process requiring the identification of one or more subjects,
such as in paternity or maternity testing, in immigration and inheritance disputes, in breeding tests in animals, in
zygosity testing in twins, in tests for inbreeding in humans and animals; in evaluation of transplant suitability such
as with bone marrow transplants; in identification of human and animal remains; in quality control of cultured cells;
in forensic testing such as forensic analysis of semen samples, blood stains, and other biological materials; in
characterization of the genetic makeup of a tumor by testing for loss of heterozygosity; and in determining the
allelic frequency of a particular identifying sequence. Samples useful in the generation of a genetics signature
include evidence from a crime scene, blood, blood stains, semen, semen stains, bone, teeth, hair, saliva, urine, feces,
fingernails, muscle or other soft tissue, cigarettes, stamps, envelopes, dandruff, fingerprints, items containing any of
these, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, two or more genetic signatures are generated and
compared. In some embodiments, one or more genetics signatures are compared to one or more known genetic
signatures, such as genetic signatures contained in a database.
           [00527] A system may also verify whether the subject has received instruction to undergo a clinical test
from a health care professional. The system may thus verify whether a subject has received an order from a health
care professional to undertake a qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of a biological sample. For example, the
                                                            -101-

system may verify whether the subject has received a prescription from the health care professional to take the test.
The system may verify whether the subject has received instructions from the health care professional to provide a
sample to the device. The system may also verify whether the subject was authorized to go to a particular point of
service to undergo the test. The verification may occur with aid of the device. The verification may occur at any
time. In one example, the subject's authorization to take the test may be verified prior to preparing the subject's
sample for the test. The subject's authorization to take the test may be verified prior to providing a sample to the
device and/or cartridge. The verification of the subject's authorization may be provided after verifying the subject's
identification. The verification of the subject's authorization may be provided before or after verifying the subject
has insurance coverage for the clinical test. The system may verify whether the subject is covered by health
insurance for a qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of a sample, within the verifying step is performed prior to,
concurrently with, or after processing a biological sample with the aid of a device, or transmitting the data from the
device. The verification may take place through communications with the medical care provider, laboratory, payer,
laboratory benefits manager, or any other entity. Verification may occur rapidly and/or in real-time. For example,
verification may occur within 10 minutes or less, 5 minutes or less, 3 minutes or less, 1 minute or less, 45 seconds
or less, 30 seconds or less, 20 seconds or less, 15 seconds or less, 10 seconds or less, 5 seconds or less, 3 seconds or
less, 1 second or less, 0.5 seconds or less, or 0.1 seconds or less. The verification may be automated without
requiring any human intervention.
          [00528] The system may also verify whether the subject has insurance coverage for the clinical test. The
system may verify whether the subject has insurance coverage to provide a sample to the device. The system may
also verify whether the subject has insurance coverage for going to the point of service and undergoing the test. The
verification may occur at any time. In one example, the subject's insurance coverage may be verified prior to
preparing the subject's sample for the test. The subject's insurance coverage may be verified prior to providing a
sample to the device and/or cartridge. The verification of the subject's insurance coverage may be provided after
verifying the subject's identification. The verification of the subject's insurance coverage may be provided before
or after verifying the subject has received a prescription to take the clinical test. The verification may take place
through communications with the medical care provider, laboratory, payer, laboratory benefits manager, or any
other entity. The verification may occur with the aid of the device. Verification may occur rapidly and/or in real
time. For example, verification may occur within 10 minutes or less, 5 minutes or less, 3 minutes or less, 1 minute
or less, 45 seconds or less, 30 seconds or less, 20 seconds or less, 15 seconds or less, 10 seconds or less, 5 seconds
or less, 3 seconds or less, 1 second or less, 0.5 seconds or less, or 0.1 seconds or less. The verification may be
automated without requiring any human intervention.
          [00529] The system may also verify whether the clinical test is appropriate for the subject. The system
may verify whether an order for a qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation is within a set of policy restrictions.
Such policy restrictions may form guidelines. Such policy restrictions may be policy restriction of a payer,
prescribing physician or other ordering health care professional, laboratory, governmental or regulatory body, or
any other entity. Such verification may depend on one or more known characteristic of the subject including but
not limited to gender, age, or past medical history. A clinical decision support system may be provided. The
system may be capable of accessing one or more medical records, or information associated with the subject. The
system may be able to access records relating to the identity of the subject, insurance coverage of the subject, past
and present medical treatments of the subject, biological features of the subject, and/or prescriptions provided to the
                                                          -102-

subject. The system may be able to access electronic health records and/or pull up patient records and history. The
system may also be able to pull up payer records, such as insurance and financial information relating to the subject.
The verification may occur with the aid of the device.
          [00530] In some embodiments, prior to providing a qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation, the system
may be capable of accessing one or more records database and/or payer database. In some instances, the system
may be capable of determining which records database and/or payer database to access prior to providing said
qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation, and/or prior to accessing said databases. The system may make such
determination based on the subject's identity, the subject's payer information, information collected about the
sample, the proposed qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation, and/or any other information.
          [00531] In one example, an inappropriate test may be a pregnancy test for a male subject or a PSA level
(prostrate-specific antigen) for a female subject. Such tests may fall outside the policy restrictions of a payer or
prescribing physician. Such ordering errors may be detectable by reviewing the test ordered and information
associated with the subject. Such information associated with the subject may include medical records for the
subject or identifying information about the subject. In one example, the appropriateness of the test is verified prior
to preparing the subject's sample for the test. The subject's test appropriateness may be verified prior to,
concurrently with, or subsequent to providing a sample to the device and/or cartridge. The verification of the
subject's test appropriateness may be provided after or prior to verifying the subject's identification and/or
insurance coverage. The verification may take place through communications with the medical care provider,
laboratory, payer, laboratory benefits manager, or any other entity. A clinical decision support system may operate
rapidly and/or in real-time. For example, verification may occur within 10 minutes or less, 5 minutes or less, 3
minutes or less, 1 minute or less, 45 seconds or less, 30 seconds or less, 20 seconds or less, 15 seconds or less, 10
seconds or less, 5 seconds or less, 3 seconds or less, 1 second or less, 0.5 seconds or less, or 0.1 seconds or less.
The clinical decision support system may be automated without requiring any human intervention.
          [00532] In some embodiments, qualified personnel may assist with collecting the subject's identity and/or
providing a sample from the subject to the device. The qualified personnel may be an authorized technician that has
been trained to use the device. The qualified personnel may be a designated operator of the device. The qualified
personnel may or may not be a health care professional. In some embodiments, the identity of the qualified
personnel may be verified. The qualified personnel's identity may be verified prior to, currently with, or after
receiving the biological sample, transmitting the data from the device electronically and/or analyzing the
transmitted data. The qualified personnel's identity may be verified prior to, currently with, or after verifying the
identity of the subject. The qualified person's identity may be verified using one or more of the techniques
described elsewhere herein.
          [00533] FIG. 9 shows further examples of a system providing sample processing, analysis, and oversight.
The numbers in the boxes in Fig. 9 have the same meanings as the corresponding numbers in Fig. 8. As shown in
Fig. 9, arrows from the oversight box indicate that oversight may be oversight of analysis, oversight of
communication over a network (such as the cloud, as exemplified by the cloud cartoon in the figure), and oversight
of processing, e.g., oversight of the operation of a device processing a sample. As discussed above, oversight of
operation of a device may be continuous oversight, e.g., during processing of a sample, and may include oversight
in view of device information (including device identification, device status, device condition, and other device
                                                          -103-

information), cartridge information, sample information, patient information, environmental information regarding
a device, cartridge, sample, or other environmental information, and other information and data about or transmitted
from a device. Such oversight may be oversight of oversight of analysis, oversight of communication, and oversight
of processing, for each example in which oversight may be located at a laboratory location, or at a sample collection
site. In embodiments, oversight may be located in the cloud or other network. In further embodiments, oversight
includes oversight of post-analytic actions or steps.
          [00534] FIG. 10A, 10B, 10C, and Fig. 10D show examples of a laboratory benefit management system
provided in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Advantages of scenarios as illustrated in Figs. 10A,
10B, 10C, and 10D, and as discussed herein, include providing a retailer with the ability to recognize revenue, e.g.,
upon receipt of payment. Such payment may be received from a customer, as shown in Figs. 1OA, 1OB, 1OC, and
1OD; may be received from a laboratory, as shown in Fig. 10A and 10B; or from a LBM, as shown in Fig. 10C and
10D. As illustrated in the figure, a laboratory benefits manager (LBM) may communicate with, or be part of, a
laboratory. (The dashed box around the boxes representing Laboratory and LBM, respectively, indicate that a
laboratory and a LBM may be the same entity, or may be separate entities.) A test may be offered at a sample
collection site, such as a retail site. The boxes labeled "Retailer" represent a sample collection site, which may be,
for example, a store, another commercial location, a pharmacy, a health care facility, or other sample collection site.
A customer, indicated by the boxes labeled "Customer", may desire a service, such as a blood test, a urine test, or
other test; the customer may pay a retailer for such a test; alternatively, a customer may pay only a portion of the
amount owed for such a test (e.g., a copay). In embodiments, a customer does not pay the retailer, and the retailer
receives payment from another party (e.g., a laboratory, a LBM, an insurance company, a health plan, a
governmental agency, or other payer). A laboratory may provide services (e.g., may perform tests of a biological
sample), may provide equipment, may provide disposables, and may do other acts for which payment may be
expected. A laboratory or a LBM may send an invoice (e.g., a bill) to a payer requesting payment, as indicated by
the arrow marked "Bill" in the figures. Dollar signs indicate payments. The head of the arrows indicates the
directionality of the indicated action; for example, the upward-pointing arrow in figure 10A, labeled "Bill",
indicates that an LBM may bill a payer; and the downward-pointing arrow near the arrow labeled "Bill" indicates
that a payer may provide a payment to the LBM. As shown, a laboratory may receive payments from a payer. A
laboratory may provide payment or other moneys to a LBM. A laboratory may share payments or other moneys
with a LBM. A LBM may receive payments from a payer. A LBM may provide payment or other moneys to a
laboratory. A laboratory may share payments or other moneys with a LBM. In embodiments, a laboratory may
provide information along with, separate from, or in addition to the payment or moneys, e.g., identification
information, test information, insurance information, or other information. A LBM may manage payer relationships
and contacts. A LBM may pay a retailer. For example, a LBM may reimburse a retailer an amount of money, e.g.,
according to a test that was performed. In embodiments, a laboratory may reimburse a retailer. A retailer may pay a
fee or provide other payment to a LBM (e.g., may pay a service fee, an agent fee, or other fee). In embodiments, a
laboratory or LBM may retain a fee from moneys paid by a retailer. In embodiments, a laboratory or LBM may
retain a fee from moneys paid by a payer; in embodiments, a LBM may pay a fee to a laboratory. A laboratory may
be an authorized laboratory, and may be a CLIA-compliant or CLIA-certified laboratory.
          [00535] As indicated by the dashed boxes, a laboratory and a LBM may be the same entity, or may be
separate entities. In addition, a laboratory may be a wholesaler, i.e., may provide equipment, supplies, etc. (e.g.,
                                                           -104-

devices, cartridges, and other materials useful for the practice of the methods disclosed herein, and for obtaining the
devices and systems as disclosed herein). In embodiments, such items may be provided by third parties that need
not be a laboratory.
           [00536] As indicated in Fig. 10A, a customer may deal directly with a retailer, and may provide payment
to a retailer. A retailer may deal with a laboratory, and pay, or pass payment to a laboratory (e.g., for services,
equipment, materials, or other payments); the laboratory may pay a retailer (e.g., a fee). A laboratory may deal with
a LBM, and payments (including fees, reimbursements, or other payments) may pass in either or both directions
between a LBM and a laboratory. A LBM may deal with a payer (e.g., a health plan, insurance company,
governmental agency, or other payer) by, for example, billing the payer for services (e.g., for the service provided
to the customer) or for other costs or billable actions. A payer may pay a LBM per such a bill. In embodiments, a
LBM and a laboratory may be the same entity, in which case the payer and the retailer deal with that entity.
           [00537] As indicated in Fig. 10B, a customer may deal directly with a retailer, and may provide payment
to a retailer. A retailer may deal with a laboratory, and pay, or pass payment to a laboratory (e.g., for services,
equipment, materials, or other payments); the laboratory may pay a retailer (e.g., a fee). A laboratory may deal with
a LBM, and payments (including fees, reimbursements, or other payments) may pass in either or both directions
between a LBM and a laboratory. A laboratory may deal with a payer (e.g., a health plan, insurance company,
governmental agency, or other payer) by, for example, billing the payer for services (e.g., for the service provided
to the customer) or for other costs or billable actions. A payer may pay a laboratory per such a bill. In the scenario
illustrated in Fig. 10B, the LBM does not deal directly with the payer, and the retailer does not deal directly with the
LBM. In embodiments, a LBM and a laboratory may be the same entity, in which case the payer and the retailer
deal with that entity.
           [00538] As indicated in Fig. 10C, a customer may deal directly with a retailer, and may provide payment
to a retailer. A retailer may deal with a LBM, and pay, or pass payment to a LBM (e.g., for services, equipment,
materials, or other payments); the LBM may pay a retailer (e.g., a fee). A laboratory may deal with a LBM, and
payments (including fees, reimbursements, or other payments) may pass in either or both directions between a LBM
and a laboratory. A laboratory may deal with a payer (e.g., a health plan, insurance company, governmental
agency, or other payer) by, for example, billing the payer for services (e.g., for the service provided to the customer)
or for other costs or billable actions. A payer may pay a laboratory per such a bill. In the scenario illustrated in Fig.
10C, the retailer deals with the LBM, and does not deal directly with the laboratory; and the payer deals with the
laboratory, and does not deal directly with the LBM. In embodiments, a LBM and a laboratory may be the same
entity, in which case the payer and the retailer deal with that entity.
           [00539] As indicated in Fig. 10D, a customer may deal directly with a retailer, and may provide payment
to a retailer. A retailer may deal with a LBM, and pay, or pass payment to a LBM (e.g., for services, equipment,
materials, or other payments); the LBM may pay a retailer (e.g., a fee). A laboratory may deal with a LBM, and
payments (including fees, reimbursements, or other payments) may pass from the laboratory to the LBM. In the
scenario illustrated in Fig. 10D, the laboratory pays the LBM, but the LBM does not pay the laboratory (the
laboratory receives payment from the payer. A laboratory may deal with a payer (e.g., a health plan, insurance
company, governmental agency, or other payer) by, for example, billing the payer for services (e.g., for the service
provided to the customer) or for other costs or billable actions. A payer may pay a laboratory per such a bill. In the
