   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller having components that enable the
10 implementation of a method of operating a gaming system
   where when at least two game rounds are awarded a
   plurality of candidate game rounds are generated for an
   initial game round. The gaming system assesses the
   candidate game rounds. In an embodiment, the candidate
15 game outcome that is assessed by the gaming system as
   being able to provide the greatest benefit in a subsequent
   game round is kept and used by the gaming system. Thus,
   advantageously, the gaming system is able to provide a
   game outcome that will be advantageous to the player. In
20 an embodiment, the player is then provided with an
   opportunity by the gaming system to select part of the
   outcome to be kept.
   General construction of gaming system
25
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a standalone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
30
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
35 game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
                                            10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                              - 8
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
 5 operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
10 envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
   the gaming system may operate in standalone gaming machine
15 mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending
   on the game being played, operating conditions, and so on.
   Other variations will be apparent to persons skilled in
   the art.
20 Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
25 the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
30 Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
35 enable a player to input game play instructions            (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
                                             10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                               - 9
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
 5 display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
10 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
15 stored in memory   and generating outputs  (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
20 integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array  (FPGA).
   A gaming system in the form of a standalone gaming machine
   10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine 10
25 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
30 game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
35 card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
                                             10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                              - 10
   value of the ticker.  A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
 5 device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
10 stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
15 pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
20 from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.  Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
25 crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.   The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
30 type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
35
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
                                             10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                               - 11
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
 5 volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
10 including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
15 own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
20 random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
25 screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
30 may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
35 instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
                                              10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                               - 12
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
 5
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
10 to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                    In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
15 module - i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
20 an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
25 some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
30
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.

   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
 5 operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
10 or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
15 The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example

   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
25 collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
30 game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.      A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
35 most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.  With this embodiment,
                                            10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                              - 14
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
 5 display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
10 client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
15 administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
20 network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
25 for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
30 plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
35 could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
                                             10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                                - 15
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Further detail of gaming system
 5
   In an embodiment of the invention, the gaming system is
   configured to provide a spinning reel game of chance where
   a feature game can be triggered. When the feature game is
   triggered, a plurality of games is awarded and candidate
10 game outcomes are generated for at least an initial game
   round as described in further detail below.
   In order to initiate a play of the gaming system, the
   player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify a
15 wager and hence the win entitlement which will be
   evaluated for this play of the game and initiates a play
   of the game. Hence, a player's win entitlement can vary
   from game to game dependent on player selections. In most
   spinning reel games, it is typical for the player's
20 entitlement to be affected by the amount they wager and
   selections they make   (i.e. the nature of the wager).                  For
   example, a player's  win entitlement may be based on how
   many lines they play in each game -   e.g. a minimum of one
   line up to the maximum number of lines allowed by the game
25  (noting that not all permutations of win lines may be
   available for selection) and how much they wager per line.
   Such win lines are typically formed by a combination of
   symbol display positions, one from each reel, the symbol
   display positions being located relative to one another
30 such that they form a line.
   In many games, the player's win entitlement is not
   strictly limited to the lines they have selected, for
   example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
35 players selection of pay lines and are an inherent part of
   the win entitlement.
                                              10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                              - 16
   In other embodiments, the player may obtain a win
   entitlement by selecting a number of reels to play and an
   amount to wager per reel. Such games are marketed under
   the trade name "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure
 5 Industries Pty Ltd. The selection of the reel means that
   each displayed symbol of the reel can be substituted for a
   symbol at one or more designated display positions. In
   other words, all symbols displayed at symbol display
   positions corresponding to a selected reel can be used to
10 form symbol combinations with symbols displayed at a
   designated, symbol display positions of the other reels.
   For example, if there are five reels and three symbol
   display positions for each reel such that the symbol
   display positions comprise three rows of five symbol
15 display positions, the symbols displayed in the centre row
   are used for non-selected reels. As a result, the total
   number of ways to win is determined by multiplying the
   number of active display positions of each reels, the
   active display positions being all display positions of
20 each selected reel and the designated display position of
   the non-selected reels. As a result for five reels and
   fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to win.
   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
25 shown implementing a number of modules based on program
   code and data stored in memory 64. In other embodiments,
   the modules could be implemented in some other way, for
   example by a dedicated circuit.
30 These modules implement functionality that enables the
   game controller to implement the game. The outcome
   generator 622 which operates in response to the player's
   operation of game play mechanism 56 to place a wager and
   initiate a play of the game and generates a game outcome
35 which is then evaluated by award evaluator 623. In an
   embodiment, a symbol selector 622A of outcome generator to
   select symbols from the base reels 641A of symbol data 641
                                            10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                              - 17
   using random number generator 621. The selected symbols
   are advised to the display controller 625 which causes
   them to be displayed on display 54 at a set of display
   positions.
 5
   One example of selecting symbols is for the symbol
   selector 622A to select symbols for display from a
   plurality of symbol sets corresponding to respective ones
   of a plurality of spinning reels. The base reel data 641A
10 specifies a sequence of symbols for each reel such that
   the symbol selector 622A can select all of the symbols by
   randomly selecting a stopping position in the sequence. In
   one example, three symbols of each of five reels may be
   displayed such that symbols are displayed at fifteen
15 display positions on display 54. In another embodiment, a
   probability table stored in memory 64 is used to vary the
   odds of a particular stop position being selected. Other
   techniques can be used to control the odds of particular
   outcomes occurring to thereby control the return to player
20 of the game.
   An outcome evaluator 623 evaluates the selected symbols
   against pay table 644 based on the wager placed by the
   player in order to determine whether to make one or more
25 awards. Any awards are made by prize awarder 624A updating
   the win meter of meters 645 and are also displayed on
   display 54 by display controller 625.   The outcome
   evaluator 624 also includes a trigger monitor 624B which
   monitors the selected symbols to determine whether a
30 trigger condition is met.   In one example, the trigger
   condition is that a defined number of scatter symbols are
   selected by the symbol selector 622A.   If there is no
   trigger, the play of the game ends  (assuming the player
   does not exercise a gamble option).
35
   If a feature game is triggered, then a number of free
   games are awarded by the outcome evaluator 624 and carried
                                             10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                              - 18
   out by the gaming system 1.   In an embodiment, the number
   of free games depends on the number of scatter symbols. In
   the embodiment, each free game comprises at least two game
   rounds. Firstly, in an initial game round, an initial game
 5 outcome is selected by and displayed on display under the
   control of the display controller 622A.   A player is then
   presented with an option to keep none, part, or all of the
   initial game outcome.  Any parts that are not kept are
   reselected by the game outcome generator 622.           Given that
10 part of the game outcome is to be kept, the game
   controller has a reel holder 622B component for processing
   the player's instructions in relation to keeping part of
   the game and storing any kept part of the game in memory
   622B.
15
   In the embodiment, for each initial game round of each
   free game, the symbol selector 622A generates a plurality
   of candidate game outcomes.   Each of the candidate game
   outcomes are selected by the symbol selector from feature
20 reels 641B.  These candidate game outcomes are stored in
   memory as candidate data 642.   The candidate outcome
   assessor 623 assesses each of these candidate outcomes
   based on assessment data 643 which enables the candidate
   outcome assessor 623 to assess the relative merits of each
25 of the candidate game outcomes from the perspective of
   which candidate should provide the greatest benefit when
   generating the subsequent game round.   In an embodiment,
   as described in further detail below, the criterion
   specified by assessment data 643 for assessing the
30 greatest benefit is conducting a determination as to which
   candidate spin has the highest optimal expected win. In
   another embodiment, the criteria may allow the candidate
   outcome assessor 623 to select a candidate which will be
   regarded as providing a greatest benefit to a player in
35 terms of interest to the player for example, the candidate
   outcome assessor may select the outcome likely to deliver
   the most wins or the highest individual win.
                                             10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                              - 19
   In the embodiment, the candidate outcome assessor 623
   calculates the result of every combination of holding
   reels for each candidate outcome, finds the hold
 5 combination that leads to the highest average return to
   player for each candidate outcome and then compares across
   candidate outcomes to find the overall best candidate
   outcome.
10 For example, assuming three candidate outcomes are
   generated. For each candidate outcome, assuming 5 reels,
   there are 32 different ways to hold the reels          (5 reels,
   held or unheld, 2^5 = 32).  For each of the 32 different
   holds, the candidate outcome assessor 623 determines the
15 expected win from that particular hold.
   The optimal hold will be the hold pattern with the highest
   expected win. The candidate outcome assessor 623 then
   compares the expected wins of the optimal hold of each
20 candidate outcome.  The candidate outcome assessor 623,
   selects the candidate game outcome which is expected to
   deliver the greatest benefit and causes the display
   controller 625 to display the selected candidate game
   outcome.
25
   The selected symbols of the plurality of reels are
   displayed by the display controller on display 54 together
   with a message instructing to the player to touch reels in
   order to select which reels should be held.         In an
30 embodiment, an indicator is provided on the display in
   order to enable the player to determine whether they have
   made an optimum selection. In an embodiment, the player
   can chose not to select any reels or choose to hold all
   reels. In an embodiment, the gaming system 1 is configured
35 to prevent the player from making invalid selections, such
   as ones that would automatically result in a loss.                  To
   make a selection of reels to hold, the player operates the
                                             10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                               - 20
    game play mechanism 56, for example by touching one of the
    reels on a touchscreen of the game play mechanism 56
    The held reels are held by the reel holder 622B of the
    game outcome generator. The symbol selector 622A then
  5 selects symbols for the remaining reels from feature reels
    641B in the same manner as described above.        These
    selected symbols are then displayed on display 54 in
    conjunction with the held symbols and evaluated by the
    outcome evaluator 624.
10
    In some embodiments, the player may then be provided with
    a further option to hold the same reels. In one example,
    where the gaming system 1 determines that the player makes
    sub-optimal decisions with respect to selecting reels to
15  hold, the player is provided with an increased chance of
    getting an extra reel.  In one example, a calculation is
    performed by the player selection monitor 626 by employing
    an optimal hold determiner 626A which determines whether
    the player has made the optimal hold.
20
    In such an embodiment, the player selection monitor 626
    upon determining that the player has made a sub-optimal
    selection, the player selection monitor 626 carries out a
    determination as to whether to award a further re-spin in
25  order to preserve an appropriate return to player. For
    example, the chances of the player selection monitor 626
    awarding a re-spin may be derived from a calculation as to
    the return to player "lost" by the player's sub-optimal
    selection. Upon determining to award a further re-spin,
30  player selection monitor 626 causes a message to be output
    to the player to make a further selection of reels and the
    game outcome generator generates a further re-spin after
    the player has a further opportunity to hold reels.
35  Each re-spun, subsequent game outcome is evaluated by the
    outcome evaluator 624 based on pay table 644 and prize
    awarder 624A determines whether to add any prizes to the
                                             10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                              - 21
   win meter of meters 645.  In the embodiment, the game then
   proceeds to the next free game which involves a further
   cycle of game rounds involving an initial game round where
   candidate game outcomes are generated by the game outcome
 5 generator 622 and assessed by the candidate outcome
   assessor 623 and then a subsequent, re-spin game round in
   which reels are re-spun based on the selection by the
   player.
10 Referring to Figure 7, the method of the invention 700
   involves operating the gaming system by conducting 705 a
   base game and determining 710 whether a trigger is met.
   Upon a trigger not being met then the gaming system is
   operated so that a further base game will be conducted
15 (assuming the player places a further wager).          The method
   involves generating 715 candidate game outcomes, assessing
   720 the game outcomes, selecting 725 and displaying a game
   outcome, and receiving 730 a hold selection from a player.
   The method 700 then involves determining whether the hold
20 is optimal 745 and, if it is not optimal, the player
   selection monitor 626 determining whether to compensate a
   player 750 for the sub-optimal selection by an addition
   re-spin.  The subsequent game outcome is generated based
   on the hold selection and is evaluated 760 to determine
25 whether to award any prizes based on pay table.             The
   process then reverts to step 715 until each of the free
   games are exhausted.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
30 above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
   executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
35 description certain steps are described as being carried
   out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
                                            10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                               - 22
   sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
 5 may need to compute several values and compare those
   values.
   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
10 ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
    (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
   a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Further different parts of the program code can
15 be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
   appreciate that program code provides a series of
   instructions executable by the processor.
20 In some embodiments, an eligibility criteria may be
   applied for the player to be eligible for the re-spin
   feature game, for example that the player has made a
   certain sized wager, made an ante bet, selected all win
   lines, played sufficient games, or the player is a member
25 of a loyalty program.
   As indicated above, the trigger may be a symbol
   combination in the game, however other triggers              could be
   used, for example, occurrence of a specific symbol in the
30 game, purchased, be caused by another connected system,
   based on turnover, based on a random evaluation, etc.
   Typically, a win will result in some form of award being
   made such as an award of credits. Such an award may never
35 actually be physically received by a player. For example,
   many gaming systems provide a player with a double or
   nothing gamble feature, where the player can double or
                                             10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                              - 23
   forfeit their credits before commencing another play of
   the game or cashing out. Further, as credits are fungible,
   once credits have been added to the credit meter it is not
   possible to distinguish between credits which exist
 5 because the player has input cash or the like and credits
   resulting from an award.
   Example
10 Figures 8 and 9 show screen shots from one example of a
   game, "Red Queen", implemented by operating a gaming
   system in accordance with an embodiment. Red Queen is a
   4x5 Reel Power game with a hold and re-spin free games
   feature. Each free game feature consists of an initial
15 spin and one or more re-spins in which the player may
   selectively hold reels.
   In the game, a "WILD" symbol substitutes for all symbols
   except scatters.
20
   All wins are evaluated from left to right only, except
   scatters which pay in any position provided the positions
   are in bought positions.  All wins multiplied by the bet
   multiplier, including scatter wins.
25
   7, 10 or 25 free games are won with any 3, 4 or 5 SCATTER
   symbol win respectively. That is, 3 or more SCATTER
   symbols trigger the feature and award different numbers of
   free games.
30
   Each free game consists of an initial spin and one or more
   re-spins. For the initial spin, all 5 reels are spun. For
   each re-spin, the player may optionally hold one or more
   reels.
35
   In an embodiment, non-optimal hold selections are
   compensated for by the gaming system providing an
                                            10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                               - 24
   increased chance of additional re-spins.       All hold
   selections are guaranteed a minimum expected return to
   player.  Game outcomes are evaluated and wins are paid
   after each re-spin. Wins are not paid for the initial
 5 spin.
   Feature reels are used during the free games.           All
   scattered SCAT are removed from all reels during the free
   games.  All reels  (Reels 1-5) are played during the
10 feature irrespective of the wager. Bet multiplier is the
   same as the game that triggered the feature.
   Each initial spin is selected by the gaming system from a
   set of candidate spins.   A number of candidate spins are
15 generated by the gaming system in the background. For each
   candidate spin, the expected win from the optimally held
   re-spin is calculated by the gaming system. The candidate
   spin with the highest expected re-spin win is selected as
   the initial spin.   The number of candidate spins is
20 determined by the gaming system from a weighting table.
   For each re-spin, the player may hold or unhold a reel by
   touching the reel on screen.
25 The player may hold none or all of the reels. On a second
   or subsequent re-spin, the player may toggle previously
   held or unheld reels. After making hold selections, the
   player presses PLAY to re-spin any unheld reels.                The
   number of re-spins for each free game is determined in
30 such a way that the expected win from the free game is
   bounded within a range.
   The gaming system is configured so that the player cannot
   hold a combination of reels if the expected win from the
35 subsequent re-spin is zero. If the player presses PLAY
   with an invalid hold selection, the gaming system outputs
   an  invalid hold selection sound. If the player presses
                                             10089835_1 (GHMatters) P99469.AU.2 20/03/18

                               - 25
   PLAY a second (or subsequent) time, the gaming system
   outputs an invalid hold selection sound and display an
   invalid hold selection banner.
 5 For each re-spin, there is a hold selection with optimal
   expected return to player.
   As reels are held or unheld, a meter displays the expected
   return to player relative to the expected return for the
10 optimally held reels.
   The feature cannot be triggered again during the feature.
   Figures 8 and 9 shows an example of an initial game
15 outcome and a subsequent game outcome after the hold and
   re-spin.
   As shown in Figure 8, five reels 831A-835A have been spun
   up with a selection of four symbols on each of the reels

   selected symbols.  Current values are shown on the credit,
   bet and win meters 851-853 respectively.      The screen 800
   also indicates that one free game remains 840.            A message
   at the top of the screen instructs the player to hold or
25 unhold reels by touching them until they make their
   selection before pressing the play button      (not shown) to
   spin the unheld reels.   An indicator 820 indicates whether
   the hold selection is optimal.    In this respect a slider
   825A is shown towards the left of the indicator 820 in
30 Figure 8 because the player is yet to make a selection and
   keeping all of the reels   (an option available to the
   player) would represent a sub-optimal selection by the
   player.  Positions further towards the right of the
   indicator 820 represent better selections.

    re-spun.  In this respect, it will be noted that the
    slider 825B is located at the far right of the indicator
    820, indicating that the hold selection made by the player
    was optimal.  A held indicator 838 is displayed above each
  5 of the held reels. It will be noted that each of the reels
    831A, 832A and 835A is identical to that which was shown
    in Figure 8.  New symbols have been selected and displayed
    for each of the reels 833B and 834B.  The displayed
    combination of symbols in Figure 9 have been evaluated by
10  the outcome evaluator and a prize has been awarded by
    incrementing the win meter by 40 credits from 355 credits
    in Figure 8 to 395 credits in Figure 9.
