                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
           The present invention relates to various prodrugs of monomethyl fumarate. In
10 particular, the present invention relates to derivatives of monomethyl fumarate which offer
   improved properties relative to dimethyl fumarate. The invention also relates to methods of
   treating various diseases.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
15         Fumaric acid esters (FAEs) are approved in Germany for the treatment of psoriasis,
   are being evaluated in the United States for the treatment of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis,
   and have been proposed for use in treating a wide range of immunological, autoimmune, and
   inflammatory diseases and conditions.
           FAEs and other fumaric acid derivatives have been proposed for use in treating a

           Fumaderm@, an enteric coated tablet containing a salt mixture of monoethyl fumarate
   and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) which is rapidly hydrolyzed to monomethyl fumarate,
   regarded as the main bioactive metabolite, was approved in Germany in 1994 for the
10 treatment of psoriasis. Fumaderm@ is dosed TID with 1-2 grams/day administered for the
   treatment of psoriasis. Fumaderm@ exhibits a high degree of interpatient variability with
   respect to drug absorption and food strongly reduces bioavailability. Absorption is thought to
   occur in the small intestine with peak levels achieved 5-6 hours after oral administration.
   Significant side effects occur in 70-90% of patients (Brewer and Rogers, Clin Expt'l
15 Dermatology 2007, 32, 246-49; and Hoefnagel et al., Br J Dermatology 2003, 149, 363-369).
   Side effects of current FAE therapy include gastrointestinal upset including nausea, vomiting,
   diarrhea and/or transient flushing of the skin.
           Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease with the autoimmune activity
   directed against central nervous system (CNS) antigens. The disease is characterized by
20 inflammation in parts of the CNS, leading to the loss of the myelin sheathing around neuronal
   axons (gradual demyelination), axonal loss, and the eventual death of neurons,
   oligodendrocytes and glial cells.
           Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is the active component of the experimental therapeutic,
   BG-12, studied for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). In a Phase Ilb RRMS
25 study, BG-12 significantly reduced gadolinium-enhancing brain lesions. In preclinical
   studies, DMF administration has been shown to inhibit CNS inflammation in murine and rat
   EAE. It has also been found that DMF can inhibit astrogliosis and microglial activations
   associated with EAE. See, e.g., US Published Application No. 2012/0165404.
           There are four major clinical types of MS: 1) relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS),
30 characterized by clearly defined relapses with full recovery or with sequelae and residual
   deficit upon recovery; periods between disease relapses characterized by a lack of disease
   progression; 2) secondary progressive MS (SPMS), characterized by initial relapsing
   remitting course followed by progression with or without occasional relapses, minor
   remissions, and plateaus; 3) primary progressive MS (PPMS), characterized by disease
                                                   2

   WO 2014/152494                                                                  PCT/US2014/027401
   progression from onset with occasional plateaus and temporary minor improvements allowed;
   and 4) progressive relapsing MS (PRMS), characterized by progressive disease onset, with
   clear acute relapses, with or without full recovery; periods between relapses characterized by
   continuing progression.
 5         Clinically, the illness most often presents as a relapsing-remitting disease and, to a
   lesser extent, as steady progression of neurological disability. Relapsing-remitting MS
   (RRMS) presents in the form of recurrent attacks of focal or multifocal neurologic
   dysfunction. Attacks may occur, remit, and recur, seemingly randomly over many years.
   Remission is often incomplete and as one attack follows another, a stepwise downward
10 progression ensues with increasing permanent neurological deficit. The usual course of
   RRMS is characterized by repeated relapses associated, for the majority of patients, with the
   eventual onset of disease progression. The subsequent course of the disease is unpredictable,
   although most patients with a relapsing-remitting disease will eventually develop secondary
   progressive disease. In the relapsing-remitting phase, relapses alternate with periods of
15 clinical inactivity and may or may not be marked by sequelae depending on the presence of
   neurological deficits between episodes. Periods between relapses during the relapsing
   remitting phase are clinically stable. On the other hand, patients with progressive MS exhibit
   a steady increase in deficits, as defined above and either from onset or after a period of
   episodes, but this designation does not preclude the further occurrence of new relapses.
20         Notwithstanding the above, dimethyl fumarate is also associated with significant
   drawbacks.
           For example, dimethyl fumarate is known to cause side effects upon oral
   administration, such as flushing and gastrointestinal events including, nausea, diarrhea,
   and/or upper abdominal pain in subjects. See, e.g., Gold et al., N. Eng. J Med., 2012,
25 367(12), 1098-1107. Dimethyl fumarate is dosed BID or TID with a total daily dose of about
   480 mg to about 1 gram or more.
   Further, in the use of a drug for long-term therapy it is desirable that the drug be formulated
   so that it is suitable for once- or twice-daily administration to aid patient compliance. A
   dosing frequency of once-daily or less is even more desirable.
30         Another problem with long-term therapy is the requirement of determining an
   optimum dose which can be tolerated by the patient. If such a dose is not determined this can
   lead to a diminution in the effectiveness of the drug being administered.
           Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide compounds and/or
   compositions which are suitable for long-term administration.
                                                     3

   WO 2014/152494                                                                  PCT/US2014/027401
           It is a further object of the present invention to provide the use of a pharmaceutical
   active agent in a manner which enables one to achieve a tolerable steady state level for the
   drug in a subject being treated therewith.
           Because of the disadvantages of dimethyl fumarate described above, there continues
 5 to be a need to decrease the dosing frequency, reduce side-effects and/or improve the
   physicochemical properties associated with DMF. There remains, therefore, a real need in
   the treatment of neurological diseases, such as MS, for a product which retains the
   pharmacological advantages of DMF but overcomes its flaws in formulation and/or adverse
   effects upon administration. The present invention addresses these needs.

           This invention is directed to the surprising and unexpected discovery of novel
   prodrugs and related methods useful in the treatment of neurological diseases. The methods
   and compositions described herein comprise one or more prodrugs (e.g., aminoalkyl
   prodrugs) of monomethyl fumarate (MMF). The methods and compositions provide for a
30 therapeutically effective amount of an active moiety in a subject for a time period of at least
   about 8 hours to at least about 24 hours.
           More specifically, the compounds of the invention can be converted in vivo, upon oral
   administration, to monomethyl fumarate. Upon conversion, the active moiety (i.e.,
   monomethyl fumarate) is effective in treating subjects suffering from a neurological disease.

            The present invention provides, in part, methods for the treatment of a neurological
   disease by administering to a subject in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of a
20 compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (II), (III), or (IV), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt,
   polymorph, hydrate, solvate or co-crystal thereof. The neurological disease can be multiple
   sclerosis. The present invention further provides the use of a compound of Formula (I), (Ia),
   (Ib), (II), (III), or (IV), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, polymorph, hydrate, solvate or
   co-crystal thereof, for the preparation of a medicament useful for the treatment of a
25 neurological disease.
            According to the present invention, a neurological disease is a disorder of the brain,
   spinal cord or nerves in a subject. In one embodiment, the neurological disease is
   characterized by demyelination, or degeneration of the myelin sheath, of the central nervous
   system. The myelin sheath facilitates the transmission of nerve impulses through a nerve
30 fiber or axon. In another embodiment, the neurological disease is selected from the group
   consisting of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury,
   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, optic
   neuritis, Devic disease, transverse myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis,

           In another embodiment, a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (II), (III), or (IV) is
   efficiently converted to the active species, i.e., monomethyl fumarate, upon oral
   administration. For example, about 50 mole percent, about 55 mole percent, about 60 mole
   percent, about 65 mole percent, about 70 mole percent, about 75 mole percent, about 80 mole
 5 percent, about 85 mole percent, about 90 mole percent, or greater than 90 mole percent of the
   total dose of a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (II), (III), or (IV) administered is
   converted to monomethyl fumarate upon oral administration. In another embodiment, a
   compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (II), (III), or (IV) is converted to the active species, i.e.,
   monomethyl fumarate, upon oral administration more efficiently than dimethyl fumarate. In
10 another embodiment, a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (II), (III), or (IV) is converted to
   the active species, i.e., monomethyl fumarate, upon oral administration more efficiently than
   one or more of the compounds described in US 8,148,414. For example, a compound of
   Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (II), (III), or (IV) is essentially completely converted to the active
   species, i.e., monomethyl fumarate, upon oral administration. US 8,148,414 is expressly
15 incorporated by reference herein.
           In another embodiment, any one of Compounds 1 - 133 is efficiently converted to the
   active species, i.e., monomethyl fumarate, upon oral administration. For example, about 50
   percent, about 55 percent, about 60 percent, about 65 percent, about 70 percent, about 75
   percent, about 80 percent, about 85 percent, about 90 percent, or greater than 90 percent of
20 the total dose of any one of Compounds 1 - 133 administered is converted to monomethyl
   fumarate upon oral administration. In another embodiment, any one of Compounds 1 - 133
   is converted to the active species, i.e., monomethyl fumarate, upon oral administration more
   efficiently than dimethyl fumarate. In another embodiment, any one of Compounds 1 - 133
   is converted to the active species, i.e., monomethyl fumarate, upon oral administration more
25 efficiently than one or more of the compounds described in US 8,148,414. For example, any
   one of Compounds 1 - 133 is completely converted to the active species, i.e., monomethyl
   fumarate, upon oral administration.
           For a drug to achieve its therapeutic effect, it is necessary to maintain the required
   level of blood or plasma concentration. Many drugs, including dimethyl fumarate, must be
30 administered multiple times a day to maintain the required concentration. Furthermore, even
   with multiple administrations of such a drug per day, the blood or plasma concentrations of
   the active ingredient may still vary with time, i.e., at certain time points between
   administrations there are higher concentrations of the active ingredient than at other times.
   Thus, at certain time points of a 24-hour period, a patient may receive therapeutically
                                                       43

   WO 2014/152494                                                                PCT/US2014/027401
   effective amounts of the active ingredient, while at other time points the concentration of the
   active ingredient in the blood may fall below therapeutic levels. Additional problems with
   such drugs include that multiple dosing a day often adversely affects patient compliance with
   the treatment. Therefore, it is desirable to have a drug dosage form wherein the active
 5 ingredient is delivered in such a controlled manner that a constant or substantially constant
   level of blood or plasma concentration of the active ingredient can be achieved by one or at
   most two dosing per day. Accordingly, the present invention provides controlled-release
   formulations as described below. In general, such formulations are known to those skilled in
   the art or are available using conventional methods.
10          As used herein, "controlled-release" means a dosage form in which the release of the
   active agent is controlled or modified over a period of time. Controlled can mean, for
   example, sustained, delayed or pulsed-release at a particular time. For example, controlled
   release can mean that the release of the active ingredient is extended for longer than it would
   be in an immediate-release dosage form, i.e., at least over several hours.
15 As used herein, "immediate-release" means a dosage form in which greater than or equal to
   about 75% of the active ingredient is released within two hours, or, more specifically, within
   one hour, of administration. Immediate-release or controlled-release may also be
   characterized by their dissolution profiles.
            Formulations may also be characterized by their pharmacokinetic parameters. As
20 used herein, "pharmacokinetic parameters" describe the in vivo characteristics of the active
   ingredient over time, including for example plasma concentration of the active ingredient. As
   used herein, "C.x" means the measured concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma
   at the point of maximum concentration. "T.x" refers to the time at which the concentration
   of the active ingredient in the plasma is the highest. "AUC" is the area under the curve of a
25 graph of the concentration of the active ingredient (typically plasma concentration) vs. time,
   measured from one time to another.
            The controlled-release formulations provided herein provide desirable properties and
   advantages. For example, the formulations can be administered once daily, which is
   particularly desirable for the subjects described herein. The formulation can provide many
30 therapeutic benefits that are not achieved with corresponding shorter acting, or immediate
   release preparations. For example, the formulation can maintain lower, more steady plasma
   peak values, for example, C,      so as to reduce the incidence and severity of possible side
   effects.

   WO 2014/152494                                                                   PCT/US2014/027401
           Sustained-release dosage forms release their active ingredient into the gastro
   intestinal tract of a patient over a sustained period of time following administration of the
   dosage form to the patient. Particular dosage forms include: (a) those in which the active
   ingredient is embedded in a matrix from which it is released by diffusion or erosion; (b) those
 5 in which the active ingredient is present in a core which is coated with a release rate
   controlling membrane; (c) those in which the active ingredient is present in a core provided
   with an outer coating impermeable to the active ingredient, the outer coating having an
   aperture (which may be drilled) for release of the active ingredient; (d) those in which the
   active ingredient is released through a semi-permeable membrane, allowing the drug to
10 diffuse across the membrane or through liquid filled pores within the membrane; and (e)
   those in which the active ingredient is present as an ion exchange complex.
           It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that some of the above means of
   achieving sustained-release may be combined, for example a matrix containing the active
   compound may be formed into a multiparticulate and/or coated with an impermeable coating
15 provided with an aperture.
           Pulsed-release formulations release the active compound after a sustained period of
   time following administration of the dosage form to the patient. The release may then be in
   the form of immediate- or sustained-release. This delay may be achieved by releasing the
   drug at particular points in the gastro -intestinal tract or by releasing drug after a pre
20 determined time. Pulsed-release formulations may be in the form of tablets or
   multiparticulates or a combination of both. Particular dosage forms include: (a) osmotic
   potential triggered release (see U.S. Pat. No. 3,952,741); (b) compression coated two layer
   tablets (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,633); (c) capsules containing an erodible plug (see U.S. Pat.
   No. 5,474,784); sigmoidal releasing pellets (referred to in U.S. Pat. No. 5,112,621); and (d)
25 formulations coated with or containing pH-dependent polymers including shellac, phthalate
   derivatives, polyacrylic acid derivatives and crotonic acid copolymers.
           Dual release formulations can combine the active ingredient in immediate release
   form with additional active ingredient in controlled-release form. For example, a bilayer
   tablet can be formed with one layer containing immediate release active ingredient and the
30 other layer containing the active ingredient embedded in a matrix from which it is released by
   diffusion or erosion. Alternatively, one or more immediate release beads can be combined
   with one or more beads which are coated with a release rate-controlling membrane in a
   capsule to give a dual release formulation. Sustained release formulations in which the active
   ingredient is present in a core provided with an outer coating impermeable to the active
                                                     45

   WO 2014/152494                                                                  PCT/US2014/027401
   ingredient, the outer coating having an aperture (which may be drilled) for release of the
   active ingredient, can be coated with drug in immediate release form to give a dual release
   formulation. Dual release formulations can also combine drug in immediate release form
   with additional drug in pulsed release form. For example, a capsule containing an erodible
 5 plug could liberate drug initially and, after a predetermined period of time, release additional
   drug in immediate- or sustained-release form.
           In some embodiments, the dosage forms to be used can be provided as controlled
   release with respect to one or more active ingredients therein using, for example,
   hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic
10 systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, or microspheres or a combination
   thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled
   release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described
   herein, can be readily selected for use with the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention.
   Thus, single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration, such as tablets, capsules,
15 gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled-release are encompassed by the present
   invention.
           Most controlled-release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of
   drug that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually
   release of additional amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic effect over an
20 extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of drug in the body, the drug
   must be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being
   metabolized and excreted from the body.
           Controlled-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various inducers, for
   example pH, temperature, enzymes, concentration, or other physiological conditions or
25 compounds.
           Powdered and granular formulations of a pharmaceutical preparation of the invention
   may be prepared using known methods. Such formulations may be administered directly to a
   subject, used, for example, to form tablets, to fill capsules, or to prepare an aqueous or oily
   suspension or solution by addition of an aqueous or oily vehicle thereto. Each of these
30 formulations may further comprise one or more of a dispersing agent, wetting agent,
   suspending agent, and a preservative. Additional excipients, such as fillers, sweeteners,
   flavoring, or coloring agents, may also be included in these formulations.
           A formulation of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention suitable for oral
   administration may be prepared or packaged in the form of a discrete solid dose unit

   including, but not limited to, a tablet, a hard or soft capsule, a cachet, a troche, or a lozenge,
   each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. In one embodiment, a
   formulation of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention suitable for oral administration
   is coated with an enteric coat.
 5          A tablet comprising the active ingredient may, for example, be made by compressing
   or molding the active ingredient, optionally with one or more additional ingredients.
   Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable device, the active
   ingredient in a free flowing form such as a powder or granular preparation, optionally mixed
   with one or more of a binder, a lubricant, an excipient, a surface-active agent, and a
10 dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding, in a suitable device, a mixture of
   the active ingredient, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and at least sufficient liquid to
   moisten the mixture. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients used in the manufacture of
   tablets include, but are not limited to, inert diluents, granulating and disintegrating agents,
   binding agents, and lubricating agents. Known dispersing agents include, but are not limited
15 to, potato starch and sodium starch glycollate. Known surface-active agents include, but are
   not limited to, sodium lauryl sulphate and poloxamers. Known diluents include, but are not
   limited to, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium
   phosphate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, and sodium phosphate. Known granulating and
   disintegrating agents include, but are not limited to, corn starch and alginic acid. Known
20 binding agents include, but are not limited to, gelatin, acacia, pre-gelatinized maize starch,
   polyvinylpyrrolidone, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Known lubricating agents
   include, but are not limited to, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, silica, and talc.
            Tablets may be non-coated or they may be coated using known methods to achieve
   delayed disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract of a subject, thereby providing sustained
25 release and absorption of the active ingredient. By way of example, a material such as
   glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be used to coat tablets. Further by way of
   example, tablets may be coated using methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108;
   4,160,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotically-controlled release tablets, optionally, with laser
   drilling. Tablets may further comprise a sweetener, a flavoring agent, a coloring agent, a
30 preservative, or some combination of these in order to provide for pharmaceutically elegant
   and palatable formulations.
            Hard capsules comprising the active ingredient may be made using a physiologically
   degradable composition, such as gelatin or HPMC. Such hard capsules comprise the active
                                                     47

   ingredient, and may further comprise additional ingredients including, for example, an inert
   solid diluent such as calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, or kaolin.
               Soft gelatin capsules comprising the active ingredient may be made using a
   physiologically degradable composition, such as gelatin. Such soft capsules comprise the
 5 active ingredient, which may be mixed with water or an oil medium such as peanut oil, liquid
   paraffin, or olive oil.

   aliphatic hydrocarbon groups. For example, C 1 -C 6 alkyl linker is intended to include C 1 , C 2 ,
   C 3 , C 4 , C 5 , and C 6 alkyl linker groups. Examples of alkyl linker include, moieties having
20 from one to six carbon atoms, such as, but not limited to, methyl (-CH 2 -), ethyl (-CH 2CH 2 -),

            Furthermore, the terms "aryl" and "heteroaryl" include multicyclic aryl and heteroaryl
   groups, e.g., tricyclic, bicyclic, e.g., naphthalene, benzoxazole, benzodioxazole,
   benzothiazole, benzoimidazole, benzothiophene, methylenedioxyphenyl, quinoline,
   isoquinoline, naphthrydine, indole, benzofuran, purine, benzofuran, deazapurine, or
 5 indolizine.
            In the case of multicyclic aromatic rings, only one of the rings needs to be aromatic
   (e.g., 2,3-dihydroindole), although all of the rings may be aromatic (e.g., quinoline). The
   second ring can also be fused or bridged.
            The aryl or heteroaryl aromatic ring can be substituted at one or more ring positions
10 with such substituents as described above, for example, alkyl, alkenyl, akynyl, halogen,

   alkylaryl, or an aromatic or heteroaromatic moiety. Aryl groups can also be fused or bridged
20 with alicyclic or heterocyclic rings, which are not aromatic so as to form a multicyclic system
   (e.g., tetralin, methylenedioxyphenyl).
            As used herein, "carbocycle" or "carbocyclic ring" is intended to include any stable
   monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic ring having the specified number of carbons, any of which
   may be saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic. For example, a C 3 -C 14 carbocycle is intended to
25 include a monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic ring having 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14
   carbon atoms. Examples of carbocycles include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl,
   cyclobutyl, cyclobutenyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptenyl, cycloheptyl,
   cycloheptenyl, adamantyl, cyclooctyl, cyclooctenyl, cyclooctadienyl, fluorenyl, phenyl,

    [4.4.0]bicyclodecane and [2.2.2]bicyclooctane.      A bridged ring occurs when one or more
   carbon atoms link two non-adjacent carbon atoms. In one embodiment, bridge rings are one
   or two carbon atoms. It is noted that a bridge always converts a monocyclic ring into a
   tricyclic ring. When a ring is bridged, the substituents recited for the ring may also be

   addition of the alcohol (1.0 - 1.5 equivalents). The reaction was stirred for 18 hours at room
   temperature. Water was added and the product extracted into ethyl acetate three times. The
   combined organic layers were washed with water three times, dried with magnesium
   sulphate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo at 45 'C to give the crude product. The crude
10 product was purified by silica chromatography and in some cases further purified by
   trituration with diethyl ether to give the clean desired ester product. All alcohols were either
   commercially available or made following known literature procedures.

   General Procedure 2- Conversion of the Ester Product into the Hydrochloride Salt
 5          To a mixture of the ester product in diethyl ether (25 ml per g) was added 2M HCl in
   diethyl ether (1.5 equivalents). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for two hours.
   The solvent was decanted, more diethyl ether added and the solvent decanted again. The
   remaining mixture was then concentrated in vacuo at 45 'C and further dried in a vacuum
   oven at 55 'C for 18 hours to give the solid HCl salt.
10
   General Procedure 3
            To a 100 mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a magnetic stirrer and
   nitrogen inlet/outlet, were added 11 mL of an MTBE solution containing freshly prepared
   mono-methyl fumaryl chloride (4.9 g, 33 mmol) and 50 mL of additional MTBE at 20 'C.
15 The resulting yellow solution was cooled to <20 'C with an ice water bath. Then, the
   alcohol, (33 mmol, 1 eq) was added dropwise, via syringe, over approximately 10 minutes.
   The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at <20 'C for 10 minutes after which time the
   cooling bath was removed and the reaction was allowed to warm to 20 'C and stir at 20 'C
   temperature for 16 hours. The reaction was deemed complete by TLC after 16 hours at RT.
20 The reaction mixture was filtered through a medium glass fritted funnel to collect the off
   white solids. The solids were dried in a vacuum oven at 25 'C overnight to afford the final
   product as an HCl salt. All alcohols were either commercially available or made following
   known literature procedures.
25 General Procedure 4- Alkylation with an Appropriate Alkyl Mesylate

   equivalent), and potassium carbonate (1.5 equivalent) in acetonitrile (50 ml per g of MMF)
   was heated at reflux overnight. The mixture was partitioned between ethyl acetate and
   saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, and the organic phase dried (MgSO 4).
30 Filtration and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure gave the crude product which
   was purified in each case by silica chromatography.

15 Example 2- Aqueous Chemical Stability of Several Compounds
            Stock solutions of the compounds in acetonitrile or acetonitrile/methanol were
   prepared at 20 mg/mL and 20 pL, spiked into 3mL of buffer phosphate (100mM) and
   incubated at 37 'C. Aliquots (50 pL) were sampled at different time points and diluted 20
   fold with ammonium formate (pH 3.5)/acetonitrile. The diluted samples were analyzed by
20 HPLC. The peak areas corresponding to the compounds were plotted against time and the
   data were fitted to a first-order mono-exponential decay where the rate constant and the half
   life were determined (Table 3). In some cases, in which the half life is too long (>360min),
   an estimated value of the half life is reported using the initial slope at low conversion
   (<10%).

   Example 3- Evaluation of Aqueous Chemical Stability with NMR
           The chemical hydrolysis was followed by dissolving the ester in phosphate buffered
   D 2 0 (pH 7.9) in an NMR tube, heating the NMR tube to 370 C and periodically recording the
 5 spectra. These various species produced by hydrolysis of the diesters were followed over
   time. See Figures 1-5.
   Example 4- Delivery of MMF in Rats Upon Oral Administration of Prodrugs
           Rats were obtained commercially and were pre-cannulated in the jugular vein.
10 Animals were conscious at the time of the experiment. All animals were fasted overnight and
   until 4 hours post-dosing of a prodrug in the disclosure.
           Blood samples (0.25 mL/sample) were collected from all animals at different time
   points up to 24 hours post-dose into tubes containing sodium fluoride/sodium EDTA.
   Samples were centrifuged to obtain plasma. Plasma samples were transferred to plain tubes
15 and stored at or below -70' C prior to analysis.
           To prepare analysis standards, 20 uL of rat plasma standard was quenched with 60 uL
   of internal standard. The sample tubes were vortexed for at least 1 min and then centrifuged
   at 3000 rpm for 10 min. 50 uL of supernatant was then transferred to 96-well plates
   containing 100 pL water for analysis by LC-MS-MS.
20         LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using an API 4000 equipped with HPLC and
   autosampler. The following HPLC column conditions were used: HPLC column: Waters
   Atlantis T3; flow rate 0.5 mL/min; run time 5 min; mobile phase A: 0.1% formic acid in
   water; mobile phase B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (ACN); gradient: 98% A/2% B at 0.0
   min; 98% A/2% B at 1 min; 5% A/95% B at 3 min; 5% A/95% B at 3.75 min; 97% A/3% B
25 at 4 min; and 98% A/2% B at 5.0 min. MMF was monitored in positive ion mode.

           MMF, DMF or MMF prodrug was administered by oral gavage to groups of two to
   six adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (about 250 g). Animals were conscious at the time of the
   experiment. MMF, DMF or MMF prodrug was orally administered in an aqueous solution of
   0.5% hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), 0.02% polysorbate 80, and 20 mM citrate
 5 buffer (pH 5), at a dose of 10 mg-equivalents MMF per kg body weight.
           The percent absolute bioavailability (F%) of MMF was determined by comparing the
   area under the MMF concentration vs time curve (AUC) following oral administration of
   MMF, DMF or MMF prodrug with the AUC of the MMF concentration vs time curve
   following intravenous administration of MMF on a dose normalized basis.
10         The MMF prodrugs, when administered orally to rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg MMF
   equivalents in the aqueous vehicle, exhibited an absolute oral bioavailability (relative to IV)

   Example 5- Delivery of MMF in Dogs Upon Oral Administration of Prodrugs
            Male Beagle dogs were obtained from the test facility's colony of non-native animals.
   All animals were fasted overnight prior to dose administration.
            Oral doses were administered via oral gavage. The gavage tube was flushed with 10
 5 mL of water prior to removal.
            All animals were observed at dosing and at each scheduled collection. All
   abnormalities were recorded.
            Blood samples were collected in Sodium Fluoride/Na 2 EDTA tubes and stored on wet
   ice until processed to plasma by centrifugation (300 rpm at 5oC) within 30 minutes of
10 collection. All plasma samples were transferred into separate 96-well plates (matrix tubes)
   and stored at -80 0C until concentration analysis was performed via LC/MS/MS using an
   RGA 3 assay.
   Extraction Procedure:
15 Note: Thawed test samples at 4'C. (Kept in ice while on bench).
    1. Aliquoted 20uL of study sample, standard, and QC samples into labeled 96-well plate.
   2. Added 120uL of appropriate internal standard solution (125ng/mL mouse embryo
   fibroblasts (MEF)) to each tube, except for the double blank to which 120uL of appropriate
   acetonitrile:FA (100:1) was added.
20 3. Sealed and vortexed for one minute.
   4. Centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
   5. Transferred 100uL of supernatant to a clean 96-well plate containing 100uL water.
   6. Sealed and vortexed gently for 2 minutes.
