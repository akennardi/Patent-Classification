                         AND ESCHERICHIA COLI IN WATER
Background of the Invention
[0001]
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for use in on-line detection of coliform
bacteria and E-Coli in water.
Description of the Prior Art
[0002]
The coliform group has been used extensively as an indicator of water quality and forms a
mandatory requirement for compliance in establishing water quality. The prior art highlighted
here shows methods currently in use for monitoring of coliforms in water. Current methods
used in detection of coliforms and Escherichia coli typically rely on coarse assumptions
regarding the incubation duration, antagonistic organism interference, poor detection of slow
growing rate and viable but non-culturable organism interference (VNBC). Most prevalent
method to quantify coliforms is a member filter technique for water. This method is enhanced
using enzymatic activity where beta-D galactosidase and beta-D glucuronidase are widely
used for the detection and enumeration of total coliforms and Escherichia coli (E-Coli),
respectively. Several chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates exist for the specific detection
of these enzymatic activities, and various commercial tests based on these substrates are
available. Numerous comparisons have shown these tests may be a suitable alternative to the
classical membrane filter techniques. These tests can be expensive and often prohibitive with
large incubation times, even though reduced, remains too long for same-day results. Efforts
to decrease these lengthy incubation times, via solid phase cytometry, have been employed
with a low detection threshold. The problem of identifying the colony numbers is exasperated
when natural colony increase associated with changes in temperature and time.
[0003]
Detection of coliforms by molecular methods is also evident in the literature, as these
methods allow for very specific and rapid detection without the requirement for a cultivation
step. The popular molecular-based methods are; immunological method, polymerase chain

                                               -2
reaction (PCR) method and in-situ hybridization (ISH) method. In the immunological
approach, various antibodies against coliform bacteria have been produced, but the
application of this technique often showed low antibody specificity. PCR can be used to
detect coliform bacteria by means of signal amplification: DNA sequence coding for the lacZ
gene (beta-galactosidase gene) and the uidA gene (beta-D glucuronidase gene) has been used
to detect total coliforms and E. coli, respectively. However, quantification with PCR is still
lacking in precision and necessitates extensive laboratory work. The ISH technique involves
the use of oligonucleotide probes to detect complementary sequences inside specific cells.
Oligonucleotide probes designed specifically for regions of the 16S RNA molecules of
Enterobacteriaceae can be used for microbiological quality control of drinking water samples.
ISH is seen as a viable alternative to the conventional culture methods for the detection of
coliforms in drinking water, as it provides quantitative data in a fairly short period of time (6
to 8 h). However, it still requires extensive research for reliable quantitative estimation. This
current state of the art shows that even though many innovative bacterial detection methods
have been developed, few have the potential for becoming a standardized method for the
detection of coliforms in drinking water samples. The longer waiting times, accuracy,
antagonistic organism interference and cost associated are still pressing issues in identifying
Coliforms and E-Coli in water.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments
[0024]
An example of a method for use in measuring on-line Coliforms and E-Coli will now be
described with reference to Figure 1.

                                               -6
[0025] The method will typically be performed using one or more electronic processing
devices, which may be provided in the form of discrete devices such as servers or personal
computers, or shared computer processing resources which may be obtained using Internet
based cloud computing services. The one or more electronic processing devices will typically
be coupled to one or more communication networks to allow data to be received or
transferred as required to perform the steps of the method.
[0026] In step 100, the method involves receiving, from at least one sensor measurement for
EC, turbidity, colour, nitrates, nitrites and ammonium detection sensors, the plurality of EC,
turbidity, colour, nitrates, nitrites and ammonium detection sensors, embodiments of the
method may utilise a plurality of EC, turbidity, colour, nitrates, nitrites and ammonium
detection sensors which may immersed in flowing water to allow multiple measurements to
be obtained.
[0027] Step 110 involves then involves determining total nitrogen content based on the
nitrates and nitrites.
[0028]
Step 120 Based on the ammonium measurement, calculate the nitrogen content from the
ammonium.
[0029] Having obtained two separate nitrogen calculations from 110 and 120 above, the
subsequent step 130 involves obtaining, from solar irradiance from meteorological data
source, meteorological data for a geographical region corresponding to the water body
location. The meteorological data source may be provided by an organisation that provides
weather services,      such as the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia. Typically, the
meteorological data source will facilitate access to meteorological data such as weather
observations and forecasts for different geographical regions. This access may be facilitated
via the Internet, for instance by using File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or an Application
Programming Interface (API). Accordingly, the meteorological data may be readily accessed
via a suitable Intemet-enabled interface of the meteorological data source.
[0030] In step 140, the method involves determining one value for the time period tested, as
an average, along with meteorological data. The average values for the parameters from

                                               -7
[100] may be determined in a variety of different ways, such as by calculating the mean
values of the measured parameters. The solar irradiance value may be directly obtained from
the meteorological data. In some cases, the solar irradiance values may be obtained using
different sources/techniques should the data for the location is not available for a given time
and day at the water source.
[0031] Next, step 150 involves calculating the Coliforms and E-Coli quantities based on part
on water parameter data collected from [110] - [140].
[0032] Accordingly, Coliform and E-Coli quantities can be determined without the need for
incubation, filtering techniques or any other time-consuming methods cited.
[0033] It should be noted in particular that the use of meteorological data for the time period
to determine the solar irradiance value will mean that the water body has had an exposure of
such irradiance over a period of time during the day.
[0034]
Further optional implementation features of the method will now be described.
[00351
As mentioned above, the solar irradiance value may be determined in different ways, and
thus in some implementations, the method may include determining a plurality of solar
irradiance values using different techniques, determining a maximum solar irradiance value
from the plurality of solar irradiance values; and then calculating the Coliforms and E-Coli
based at least in part on the maximum solar irradiance value. This may provide a more
conservative approach to ensure the Coliforms and E-Coli is calculated based on a highest
solar irradiance scenario, and thus avoid the situation where a solar irradiance calculation
based on a particular set of parameters might not accurately model the full extent of solar
irradiance in certain circumstances. The use of a maximum solar irradiance insures
possibility of under-estimating Coliforms and E-Coli which has a higher risk of inhibiting
water quality.
[00361
Implementations of the method may involve calculating solar irradiance values using the

                                                -8
meteorological data, for instance by using known calculation methods such as the linear
regression (LR), Angstrom-Prescott-Page (APP) and the artificial neural network (ANN)
models
 [0037]
For each of the above three models the basic dataset for a given location encompass solar
radiation (H), minimum and maximum temperatures (Tmin and Tmax), total rainfall and
evaporation (Lr and Le), and sunshine duration (S) over a period of time. A comprehensive
dataset is available for many meteorological sites to get the monthly averages. This dataset is
also important for ANN training and testing.
 [0038]
The linear regression methods (LR) involves the following methodology:
The monthly average daily extra-terrestrial solar radiation, Ho, on a horizontal surface can be
calculated from the following equation (Elminir et al., 2007):
                        24 x 3600                                 W
                  HO =IOk                   cosqpcososinw + 1sinpsin8
                             7E                                  180/
where lo is the solar constant, k is the eccentric correction factor of the earth's orbit, qp is the
latitude of the location (degrees), 6 is the solar declination angle (degrees) and co is the sunset
hour angle (degrees). The currently accepted and commonly used Jo value is set at 1367
W/m 2 , which is recommended by the World Radiation Centre (Montero et al., 2009; Page,
 1986; Stine, 1985). The eccentric correction factor k for each day can be calculated
(Yorukoglu and Celik, 2006):
                                  k = 1 + 0. 033cos( 360dn)
                                                          (365
where dn is the day number counted from beginning of the year (where dn = 1 for 1st of
January).
The declination angle 6 and sunset hour angle o for each day of the year can be calculated
below (Cooper, 1969; Luque and Hegedus, 2003):
                             8=23.45sin 360 x (284 + dn)
                                    0 = cos '(-tanptan6)

                                                 -9
Lastly, the maximum possible sunshine duration, So, for each day is calculated from (Soler
and Gopinathan, 1994):
                                                    2
                                              SO =    o>
To gauge the accuracy of the models, the (RMSE) was used.
Linear Regression (LR) Analysis
Having established the values from mathematical equations above for each day, the averages
were obtained which forms the linear regression model shown below:
                                                                     S
                     H = aTmin+bTax+cLr +dLe+eHo+f-+g
                                                                    so
where a to g are regression coefficients, to be determined empirically.
[00391
On the other hand, the Angstrom-Prescott-Page (APP) method for calculating solar irradiance
can be expressed using the formula:
                                            H           s
                                           - = a + b
                                           Ho          SO
where a and b are the empirical (or Angstrom) coefficients. The coefficient a can be
interpreted as the fraction of the monthly average solar radiation (H/Ho) entering the
atmosphere when there is a complete cloud cover (Ahmad and Tiwari, 2011). The second
coefficient b defines the rate of change of H/Ho with respect to the sunshine duration ratio
(S/So). It is an index of the latitudinal variation (Ahmad and Tiwari, 2011). To determine the
values for coefficients a and b, the plot clearness index (H/Ho) vs. sunshine duration ratio
(S/So) is plotted to get a linear trend-line.
[0040]
The OLL network was proposed and developed by Ergezinger and Thomsen. This method is
based on the linearization of the activation function, thus leading to a linear optimization
problem in each layer. The error made when linearizing the activation function is accounted
for by introducing a penalty term. This penalty term, whose influence is varied, is to maintain
optimum convergence for the network. The OLL neural network is then optimized in an
iterative procedure, where for each iteration, the corresponding weights are optimized by
solving a set of linear equations. It uses the

                                                 - 10
Figure below shows a basic OLL neural network structure. Inputs xi are connected to the
hidden layer with connect weights rai and the hidden neuron are connected to the output
neurons with connection weights sba. The b neurons in the output layer have a pure linear
activation function and hidden neurons have a sigmoid activation function. The training
algorithm for the OLL model described in Figure 5C, optimised by layer by layer:
Step 1: Initialization
Initial values for the weights R and S, where R and S are the weight vectors between the
hidden-input and output-hidden layers respectively, penalty constant p and the number of
iterations are defined. Weight vectors R and S are to be optimized in order to minimize the
error function.
Step 2: Optimization of Output Layer Weights
The optimum weight for S, S'"",         is obtained using:
                                          S'"'"'"= A- 1 e b
with
       P
 A=      Za"Zj  "   a, j = 0,..., A
      p=1
      P

     p=1
where P is the total number of training data, za and zjP are the scalar outputs of the hidden
neurons of training data p and tP is the target output value.
Update the weights S and calculate the RMS error using below:
                                                  Pj K      Yk
                                                P L(t'" -- y," )2
                                    ErrorRMS    p=1 k=1
where K is the total number of output neurons, tk is the target output value for neuron k and
training data p and yj is the network output value for training data p.
Step 3: Optimization of Hidden Layer Weights

                                                          - 11
The new updated weight R is then defined as Rtest, as shown:
                                                 AR    timum        -l

                  \XiSba              XMSbh                 A                 XbAa   XiXm

        p=1 b=1
                 where m = 0,...,I         h = 0,..., A
where sbalinearized and sbhlinearized are the linearized weights from neuron b of the output layer to
neurons a and h in the hidden layer (of training data P), XAa is the second derivative of the
activation function         XAa,   sba and sbh are the connection weights between the output-hidden
layer.
Once ARpium is obtained, the new update weight can be defined as:
                                                 R  = R old +  ARoptimum
Step 4: Test for Completion
RMS error, ERMSts, was then calculated comparing the Rtest matrix with S or SPt"'m" matrices
calculated in Step 3.
     a.   ERMStest <   E
          The hidden layer weight matrix R is updated R                   =  Rtest. Decrease the influence of the
          penalty term by decreasing p. Proceed to Step 5.
     b.   ERMStest>    E

                                                - 12
         Increase the influence of pt and repeat Step 4a.
Step 5: Process Termination
If RMS error solar radiation is not within the desired range, repeat Step 2, else the training
process is ceased.
 [0041]
It will thus be appreciated that calculation of the solar irradiance value using the any of the
three methods will require access to meteorological data including observations of a range of
different measurements including the maximum temperature, the minimum temperature, the
rain fall and evaporation.
 [0042]
alternatively or additionally, the solar irradiance value may be determined based on a value
calculated by the meteorological data source and included in the meteorological data. As
mentioned above multiple techniques can be used and a highest value may be used for
calculating the Coliforms and E-Coli.
 [0043]
In order to more specifically account for the particular water body in the Coliform and E-Coli
on-line calculation, the method may include determining a solar irradiance value for the
particular location of the water body along with nitrogen from nitrates and nitrates and
separate calculation of nitrogen from ammonium alone.
 [0044]
In particular, this may involve determining nitrogen from ammonium as a separate
calculation to nitrogen from nitrates and nitrite. In one example, the method may include
determining, using the water parameters such as EC, turbidity and colour then determining
the two nitrogen quantities in accordance with the identification of the parameters namely
nitrates-nitrite or ammonium for subsequent calculation of Coliforms and E-Coli
 [0045]
It should be appreciated that the particular set of water data that is stored may depend on the
specific techniques used for determining the solar irradiance on water body value and/or the

                                              - 13
Coliforms and E-Coli. In any event, the water Coliforms and E-Coli data may be stored in a
database or the like and in some examples may be organised into tables for each crop.
[00461
It will be appreciated that the nitrogen from nitrates and ammonium is calculated using the
formulas:
        a) N-N03    = Measured N03 /4.43
        b) N-Nh4    = Measured NH4* 14/17
[00471
With regard to the meteorological data, which is used for at least determining the solar
irradiance value, this may be obtained based on location data for the water body. For
example, a geographical location for a particular site to which this method is to be applied
may be used to obtain meteorological data corresponding to that location. In some cases,
meteorological data may only be available for neighbouring regions, and the method may
either use meteorological data for the closest region or may use averaged values of the
meteorological data for more than one neighbouring region if desired.
[0048]
Particular implementations of the method may include obtaining the meteorological data
using file transfer protocol (FTP) or an application programming interface (API). The
particular technique used for accessing the meteorological data will largely depend on the
techniques supported by the meteorological data source.
[0049]
The specific types of meteorological data that may be obtained and used in the method
include a relative humidity observation, a maximum temperature observation, a minimum
temperature observation, an air temperature         observation, a soil surface temperature
observation, an atmospheric pressure observation, and a solar radiation exposure observation.
The aforementioned observations can support the calculation of evapotranspiration values
using the Priestly Taylor method or the Turc method as discussed above, but it should be
appreciated that not all of these need to be obtained in all implementations of the method. On

                                             - 14
the other hand, additional types of meteorological data may also be obtained to support the
use of other techniques or for providing extended functionalities.
[0050]
As mentioned above, solar irradiance value may be obtained directly as part of the
meteorological data. This can be useful to allow comparisons to the values derived from
other techniques, but it should be understood that this is not essential.
[0051]
In another aspect, an apparatus may be provided for use in performing on-line detection of
Colifoms and E-Coli for a particular water body. The apparatus may include at least one
sensor for each of the EC, turbidity, colour, nitrate, nitrite and ammonium in water, and one
or more electronic processing devices coupled to the at least one or more of the above sensors
and a meteorological data source via one or more communications networks. In this regard,
the one or more electronic processing devices will be configured to perform the method as
described above.
[0052]
In some implementations, the one or more electronic processing devices may be configured
to provide an indication of the calculated Coliforms and E-Coli via app.
[0053]
As mentioned above, a plurality of sensors may be used, and in this respect the apparatus
may include the plurality of sensors, which may be coupled together via a sensor
communication network. In one example, the apparatus may include a gateway unit
configured to act as a parent node in the sensor communication network and a plurality of
sensor units. Each sensor unit may include a respective EC, turbidity, colour, nitrate, nitrite
and ammonium sensors and be configured to act as a child node in the sensor communication
network. The gateway unit may in turn be configured to receive measurements from the
sensor units and transfer the moisture measurements to the one or more electronic processing
devices.
[0054]
The one or more electronic processing devices may be coupled to the gateway unit and the

                                              - 15
meteorological data source via the Internet. In one specific embodiment, the one or more
electronic processing devices may be provided using a cloud computing system and the
meteorological data source may be accessed via an Internet API.
[0055]
In one example, the process is performed by one or more processing systems operating as
part of a distributed architecture, an example of which will now be described with reference
to Figure 2.
[0056]
In this example, the arrangement includes a number of processing systems 201, 203 along
with gateway and sensor units 205, 207, each interconnected via one or more
communications networks, such as the Internet 202, and/or a number of local area networks
(LANs) 204.
[00571
It will be appreciated that the configuration of the networks 202, 204 are for the purpose of
example only, and in practice the processing systems 201, 203 and gateway and sensor units
205, 207 can communicate via any appropriate mechanism, such as via wired or wireless
connections, including, but not limited to mobile networks, private networks, such as an
802.11 networks, the Internet, LANs, WANs, or the like, as well as via direct or point-to
point connections, such as Bluetooth, Zigbee or the like.
[0058]
The nature of the processing systems 201, 203 and their functionality will vary depending on
their particular requirements. In one particular example, the processing systems 201, 203
represent servers (such as for determining the Coliforms and E-Coli) and clients (for allowing
mining companies, water infrastructure companies, water recycling plants and aquaculture
plants to monitor Coliforms and E-Coli processes or updating data), although this is not
essential and is used primarily for the purpose of illustration.
[0059]
An example of a suitable processing system 201 is shown in Figure 3. In this example, the
processing system 201 includes an electronic processing device, such as at least one

                                               - 16
microprocessor 300, a memory 301, an optional input/output device 302, such as a keyboard
and/or display, and an external interface 303, interconnected via a bus 304 as shown. In this
example the external interface 303 can be utilised for connecting the processing system 201
to peripheral devices, such as the communications networks 202, 204, databases 211, other
storage devices, or the like. Although a single external interface 303 is shown, this is for the
purpose of example only, and in practice multiple interfaces using various methods (e.g.
Ethernet, serial, USB, wireless or the like) may be provided.
[00601
In use, the microprocessor 300 executes instructions in the form of applications software
stored in the memory 301 to perform required processes, such as communicating with other
processing systems 201, 203 or the gateway and/or sensor units 205, 207 depending on the
sensor network topology. Thus, actions performed by a processing system 201 are performed
by the processor 300 in accordance with instructions stored as applications software in the
memory 301 and/or input commands received via the I/O device 302, or commands received
from other processing systems 201, 203. The applications software may include one or more
software modules, and may be executed in a suitable execution environment, such as an
operating system environment, or the like.
[0061]
Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the processing systems 201 may be formed from any
suitable processing system, such as a suitably programmed computer system, PC, web server,
network server, or the like. In one particular example, the processing system 201 is a standard
processing system such as a 32-bit or 64-bit Intel Architecture based processing system,
which executes software applications stored on non-volatile (e.g., hard disk) storage,
although this is not essential. However, it will also be understood that the processing systems
201 could be or could include any electronic processing device such as a microprocessor,
microchip    processor, logic    gate configuration,    firmware optionally     associated  with
implementing logic such as an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), or any other
electronic device, system or arrangement.
[0062]
As shown in Figure 4, in one example, the processing systems 203 include an electronic

                                              - 17
processing device, such as at least one microprocessor 400, a memory 401, an input/output
device 402, such as a keyboard and/or display, and an external interface 403, interconnected
via a bus 404 as shown.       In this example the external interface 403 can be utilised for
connecting the processing system 203 to peripheral devices, such as the communications
networks 202, 204, databases, other storage devices, or the like. Although a single external
interface 403 is shown, this is for the purpose of example only, and in practice multiple
interfaces using various methods (e.g. Ethernet, serial, USB, wireless or the like) may be
provided.
[0063]                                                                                        1
n use, the microprocessor 400 executes instructions in the form of applications software
stored in the memory 401           to perform required processes,     for example to allow
communication with other processing systems 201, 203.          Thus, actions performed by a
processing system 203 are performed by the processor 401 in accordance with instructions
stored as applications software in the memory 402 and/or input commands received from a
user via the I/O device 403. The applications software may include one or more software
modules, and may be executed in a suitable execution environment, such as an operating
system environment, or the like.
[0064]
Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the processing systems 203 may be formed from any
suitable processing system, such as a suitably programmed PC, Internet terminal, lap-top,
hand-held PC, smart phone, PDA, tablet, or the like. Thus, in one example, the processing
system 203 is a standard processing system such as a 32-bit or 64-bit Intel Architecture based
processing system, which executes software applications stored on non-volatile (e.g., hard
disk) storage, although this is not essential. However, it will also be understood that the
processing systems 203 can be any electronic processing device such as a microprocessor,
microchip     processor, logic   gate configuration,   firmware optionally   associated   with
implementing logic such as an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), or any other
electronic device, system or arrangement.
[0065]
It will also be noted that whilst the processing systems 201, 203 are shown as single entities,

                                             - 18
it will be appreciated that this is not essential, and instead one or more of the processing
systems 201, 203 can be distributed over geographically separate locations, for example by
using processing systems provided as part of a cloud based environment.
[0066]
In a preferred implementation, the processing systems 201 may be provided as part of a cloud
computing service and will communicate with other elements of the arrangement via the
Internet 202. The use of other processing systems 203 in the form of client devices is not
essential to the method, but in practice will be advantageous to allow users such as
Aquaculture farmers, water companies and mining companies, hospitals or the like to
monitor the Coliforms and E-Coli status for a site. Furthermore, users can interact with the
processing systems 201 or data stored on the database 211 to update data for use in the
method, such as the input data or Coloforms data, if necessary.
[00671
The gateway and sensor units 205, 207 may be provided as specialised versions of the
processing systems 203 as shown in Figure 4, whereby the external interfaces 403 include
dedicated sensor interfaces for interfacing with respective soil moisture sensors along with
network interfaces as required for the particular sensor network topology. For instance, the
gateway unit 205 may differ from the sensor units 207 in terms of the particular network
connectivity provided. The gateway unit 205 may include external network connectivity for
allowing communications with the processing systems 201 via the Internet or any other
external network, along with internal network connectivity for enabling communications
within a localised sensor network, such as by using Zigbee or any other suitable networking
protocol. On the other hand, the sensor units 2017 may only include internal network
connectivity.
[0068]
Since the gateway and sensor units 205, 207 may need to be deployed in remote locations
these may include localised power sources such as a solar panel and rechargeable batteries.
To conserve power, the microprocessor 400 and other hardware used in the gateway and
sensor units 205, 207 may be selected for energy efficiency.

                                              - 19
[0069] However, it will be appreciated that the above described arrangement is shown as an
example only, and numerous other configurations may be used.
[0070] A detailed example of a method for use in on-line detection of Coliforms and E-Coli
will now be described with regard to the flow chart of Figures 5A to 5B.
[0071] In this particular example, it is assumed that the main data processing functionalities
of this method are provided as part of a cloud computing service which is able to
communicate with meteorological data services and gateway and sensor units having
respective soil moisture sensors via the Internet. This example will illustrate a typical loop of
Coliform and E-Coli calculations which may be carried out periodically and potentially only
at predetermined times of the day.
[0072] As an initial process, the method will involve checking the water field status at step
500. This may include accessing a water field table including particular information
regarding a field such as coordinates, date, time, type of water. If the field status is inactive
the method may proceed no further, however if the field status is active a determination may
be made on whether the field status should be changed to inactive.
[0073] Assuming field status is active, type of water source such as fresh water, effluent,
creek water, drinking water or bracking water selection should also be made at next step
[501] at the field status.
[0074] EC, turbidity, colour, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium measurements will be received at
step 502, and in the event that these are received for multiple soil moisture sensors in the
same field, these may be processed by averaging or taking a maximum measurement.
[0075] At step 503 based on the sensory input and steady state collection, ensure the steady
quantitative collection of the process parameters to avoid large variability.
[0076] At [504] meteorological data will be obtained for the day. In this example, the
meteorological data may be obtained from three separate meteorological data sources via
Internet APIs.

                                             -20
[0077] The maximum value of the solar irradiance/radiation data may be taken after
processing the three models namely: Linear regression, APP and Al. The data is sent to the
could at [506]
[0078] Moving on to step 507, the method may then include calculation of Coliforms and E
Coli in the cloud as function of EC, turbidity, Colour, nitrogen from nitrates, nitrite and
ammonium along with the solar irradiance obtained from [504].
[0079] Throughout this specification and claims which follow, unless the context requires
otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be
understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers or steps but not the
exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.
[0080] Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that numerous variations and modifications
will become apparent. All such variations and modifications which become apparent to
persons skilled in the art, should be considered to fall within the spirit and scope that the
invention broadly appearing before described.
