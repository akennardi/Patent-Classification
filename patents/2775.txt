   Summary
   [0004]     A work vehicle sometimes stops at a target location
   or reduces its velocity to a target velocity at the target
   location.   In this case, a braking device of the work vehicle
30 operates to stop the work vehicle or reduce the velocity of
   the work vehicle.   In a case where the work vehicle is stopped
   at the target location, the work vehicle can stop with good
   accuracy when large braking force is exhibited in the vicinity

   a machine that moves within the mine MR to transport the
   burden.   The transporting machine includes a dump truck.
   The burden includes at least one of soil and ore generated
   when the mine MR is mined.
 5  [0026]    The mine MR has at least a part of a loading
   place LPA, a discharging place DPA, a haul lane HL leading
   to at least one of the loading place LPA and the
   discharging place DPA, and an intersection IS at which the
   haul lanes HL intersect.    A crusher CR that crushes
10 discharged soil may be arranged in at least one discharging

   soil in the vicinity of the haul lane HL.    The bank BK may
   further be provided on at least one of the outside of the
   loading place LPA and the outside of the discharging place
15 DPA.
    [0027]    A dump truck 2 moves within the mine MR to haul
   the burden.   The dump truck 2 runs on at least a part of
   the haul lane HL and the intersection IS of the mine MR to
   move between the loading place LPA and the discharging
20 place DPA.   The dump truck 2 is loaded with the burden in
   the loading place LPA.    The loading place LPA is a region
    (place) in the mine MR where loading work for the burden is
   performed.   In the loading place LPA, the loading machine
   that is another mining machine other than the dump truck 2
25 loads the burden onto the dump truck 2.
    [0028]    The burden is unloaded (discharged) from the dump
   truck 2 in the discharging place DPA.    The discharging
   place DPA is a region   (place) in the mine MR where
   discharging work for the burden is performed.       In the

   so-called unmanned dump truck that autonomously runs on a
   running path in accordance with a command from a management
   device 10.   When the dump truck 2 autonomously runs,
   manipulation of the operator (driver) is not required.            The
 5 phrase "the dump truck 2 autonomously runs" means that the
   dump truck 2 does not run in accordance with the
   manipulation of the operator, but runs in accordance with
   the command from the management device 10.     In the present
   embodiment, the dump truck 2 can also run in accordance
10 with the manipulation of the operator.
   [0030]     The management system 1 includes the management
   device 10 and a communication system 9.    The management
   device 10 manages the mining machine that operates in the
   mine MR.   The communication system 9 transmits information.

   7 of the mine MR.   The communication system 9 transmits the
   information, using wireless communication, between the
   management device 10, the dump truck 2, and another mining
   machine 3 (e.g., a loading machine 3S such as an excavator,
20 and a vehicle 3C).   The management device 10, the dump
   truck 2, and the other mining machine 3 can bi
   directionally and wirelessly communicate with one another
   via the communication system 9.    In the present embodiment,
   the communication system 9 has a plurality of repeaters 6
25 that relays a signal   (radio wave) between the management
   device 10, the dump truck 2, and the other mining machine 3.
   [0031]     In the present embodiment, a location of the dump
   truck 2 and a location of the other mining machine 3 are
   detected by using a global navigation satellite system
30 (GNSS).  An example of the global navigation satellite
   system includes, but is not limited to, a GPS.       The GNSS
   has a plurality of positioning satellites 5.      The GNSS
   detects a location in a coordinate system that defines

                                   11
   latitude, longitude, and height.     The coordinate system of
   the GNSS is also referred to as a global coordinate system
   in the present embodiment.     The location detected by the
   GNSS includes coordinate data of latitude, longitude, and
 5 height.
   [0032]     The location of the dump truck 2 and the location
   of the other mining machine 3 in the mine MR are detected
   by the GNSS.    The location detected by the GNSS is an
   absolute location defined in the global coordinate system.
10 In the following description, the location detected by the
   GNSS is appropriately referred to as a GPS location.            The
   GPS location is the absolute location and the coordinate
   data (coordinate value) of latitude, longitude, and height.
   In the GNSS, a positioning state is changed by the
15 influence of the arrangement of the positioning satellites
   5, the ionosphere, the troposphere, or a landform around an
   antenna that receives information from the positioning
   satellite 5.    This positioning state includes, for example,
   a fixed solution    (accuracy: about ±1 cm to 2 cm),      a float
20 solution  (accuracy: about ±10 cm to several meters),         a
   single solution    (accuracy: about several meters),       and non
   positioning   (positioning calculation disability) or the
   like.

   [0034]     FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating the
   dump truck 2 that runs on the haul lane HL.     The processing
 5 device 12 executes various types of processes related to
   the management of the dump truck 2 and various types of
   processes related to the management of the other mining
   machine 3.   When the dump truck 2 autonomously runs in the
   mine MR, the processing device 12 generates a running path
10 RP on which the dump truck 2 runs.    The running path RP is
   an aggregate of a plurality of points PI.    In other words,
   a track that passes through the plurality of points PI is
   the running path RP.    For each of the points PI, the
   absolute location   (coordinate data of latitude, longitude,
15 and height) is defined.    The point PI constituting the
   running path RP includes at least absolute location
   information and velocity information.    The velocity
   information is a target velocity of the dump truck that
   runs at the spot.    Hereinafter, the absolute location
20 information and the velocity information related to the
   running path are collectively referred to as running path
   information.   The dump truck 2 that has received the
   running path information from the processing device 12 runs
   along the running path RP including at least a part of the
25 loading place LPA, the discharging place DPA, the haul lane
   HL, and the intersection IS.

                                 14
   work vehicle control system 30 will be described, the work
   vehicle control system 30 may be provided in the other
   mining machine 3 that is the work vehicle other than the
   dump truck 2.   Hereinafter, the work vehicle control system
 5 30 is appropriately referred to as the control system 30.
   [0039]     The dump truck 2 includes a vehicle body 21, a
   vessel 22,  a running device 23, and an obstacle sensor 24.
   The vessel 22 and the running device 23 are attached to the
   vehicle body 21.   A drive device 2D for driving the running
10 device 23 is attached to the vehicle body 21.      The drive
   device 2D includes an internal combustion engine 2E such as
   a diesel engine, a generator 2G, and an electric motor 23M.
   The generator 2G is driven by the internal combustion
   engine 2E to generate electric power.   The electric motor
15 23M is driven by the electric power generated by the
   generator 2G.
   [0040]     The running device 23 includes a front wheel 23F,
   a rear wheel 23R, a braking device 23B, and a steering
   device 2S.   The front wheel 23F is steered by the steering
20 device 2S.   The front wheel 23F functions as a steering
   wheel of the dump truck 2.   The rear wheel 23R is driven by
   the electric motor 23M arranged within the wheel, and
   functions as a drive wheel of the dump truck 2.        The drive
   device 2D of the dump truck 2 may transmit power of the
25 internal combustion engine 2E to the rear wheel 23R via a
   transmission including a torque converter to drive the rear
   wheel 23R.
   [0041]     The vessel 22 is a carrier onto which the burden
   is loaded.   The vessel 22 is loaded with the burden by the
30 loading machine.   In the discharging work, the vessel 22 is
   raised to discharge the burden.
   [0042]     The obstacle sensor 24 is arranged on a lower
   part of a front side of the vehicle body 21.     The obstacle

                                  15
   sensor 24 detects, in a non-contact manner, an obstacle in
   front of the vehicle body 21.     In the present embodiment,
   the obstacle sensor 24 that is a non-contact sensor
   includes a radar 24A and a laser sensor 24B.
 5 [0043]     The laser sensor 24B is a device that detects a
   location of an object that exists around the dump truck 2.
   The laser sensor 24B radiates a laser beam in a range, for
   example, illustrated in FIG. 2, and receives the laser beam
   reflected by the object.    In this manner, the laser sensor
10 24B detects a direction and a distance of the object with
   respect to the laser sensor 24B.     The object around the
   dump truck 2 includes an object that exists in the vicinity
   of the running path RP   (e.g., the bank BK, a side wall, an
   embankment, a tree, and a building).     The object that
15 exists in the vicinity of the running path RP may be an
   artificially manufactured structure.     Next, the control
   system 30 will be described.
   [0044]     The control system 30 includes a scan matching
   navigation location output controller 33 and a vehicle body
20 controller 20.   The scan matching navigation location
   output controller 33 is a location output device, and the
   vehicle body controller 20 is a control unit.        In addition
   to this, the control system 30 includes the non-contact
   sensor 24,  a gyro sensor 26, a velocity sensor 27,        a GPS
25 receiver 31 that is a positioning device, a running path
   producing device 32, a wireless communication device 34, a
   first signal line 35, and a second signal line 36.          As
   illustrated in FIG. 3, the vehicle body controller 20, the
   running path producing device 32,    and the scan matching
30 navigation location output controller 33 are connected to
   the first signal line 35.    They communicate with one
   another via the first signal line 35 to exchange
   information.

                                16
   [0045]    The vehicle body controller 20 that is the
   control unit receives the location of the dump truck 2
   output from at least one of the scan matching navigation
   location output controller 33 and the GPS receiver 31.          The
 5 vehicle body controller 20 then generates and outputs an
   instruction to control the dump truck 2 based on the
   received location of the dump truck 2 and the running path
   information received from the running path producing device
   32 which will be described later.  The vehicle body
10 controller 20 also generates and outputs an instruction to
   control a braking device 2B of the dump truck 2 using the
   received location of the dump truck 2.
   [0046]    FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating the vehicle body
   controller 20 according to the first embodiment.       The
15 vehicle body controller 20 has a processing unit 20P, a
   storage unit 20M, and an input/output unit 20IF.       The
   processing unit 20P includes a judgment unit 20PA, a
   braking parameter determination unit 20PB, a dead reckoning
   navigation location estimation unit 20PC, a braking control
20 unit 20PD, a drive control unit 20PE, and a steering
   control unit 20PF.
   [0047]    The judgment unit 20PA judges whether to brake
   the dump truck 2, that is, whether the vehicle body
   controller 20 causes the braking device 2B to operate.
25 When the vehicle body controller 20 causes the braking
   device 2B to operate, the braking parameter determination
   unit 20PB determines control information for controlling
   the braking device 2B.  The dead reckoning navigation
   location estimation unit 20PC calculates the location of
30 the dump truck 2 using a method of dead reckoning
   navigation which will be described later.  Specifically,
   the location of the dump truck 2 is estimated using an
   angular velocity of the dump truck 2 from the gyro sensor

                                 17
   26 and a velocity of the dump truck 2 from the velocity
   sensor 27.   Since the dead reckoning navigation location
   estimation unit 20PC estimates the location of the own dump
   truck 2 by means of the dead reckoning navigation, the dead
 5 reckoning navigation location estimation unit 20PC is one
   of a plurality of location information generating units
   held by the dump truck 2 in the present embodiment.          The
   location information generating units obtain and output the
   location of the dump truck 2.    Information output by the
10 location information generating units is location
   information of the dump truck 2.
   [0048]     The braking control unit 20PD generates an
   instruction for controlling the braking device 2B based on
   the location of the dump truck 2, the running path
15 information received from the running path generating
   device 32, and the control information determined by the
   braking parameter determination unit 20PB.    The braking
   control unit 20PD then outputs the instruction to the
   braking device 2B.
20 [0049]     The drive control unit 20PE generates a drive
   instruction based on the location of the dump truck 2 and
   the running path information received from the running path
   generating device 32.   The drive control unit 20PE then
   outputs the drive instruction to the drive device 2D.            The
25 steering control unit 20PF generates an instruction for
   controlling the steering device 2S based on the location of
   the dump truck 2 and the running path information received
   from the running path generating device 32.     The steering
   control unit 20PF then outputs the instruction to the
30 steering device 2S.   At this time, the braking control unit
   20PD, the drive control unit 20PE, and the steering control
   unit 20PF receive the location, namely, the location
   information of the dump truck 2 from at least one of the

   scan matching navigation location output controller 33, the
   GPS receiver 31, and the dead reckoning navigation location
   estimation unit 20PC, and receive the running path
   information from the running path producing device 32.
 5 [0050]    The storage unit 20M stores a computer program
   for causing the dump truck 2 to autonomously run, a
   computer program for controlling the operation of the dump
   truck 2, and a data table TB in which information that is
   used for a method of controlling the work vehicle according
10 to the present embodiment is described.  The gyro sensor 26,
   the velocity sensor 27, the steering device 2S, the drive
   device 2D, the first signal line 35, and the second signal
   line 36 are connected to the input/output unit 20IF.         The
   input/output unit 20IF is an interface between the vehicle
15 body controller 20 and instruments connected to the vehicle
   body controller 20.
   [0051]    In the present embodiment, the braking control
   unit 20PD, the drive control unit 20PE, and the steering
   control unit 20PF held by the vehicle body controller 20
20 cause the dump truck 2 to autonomously run using the
   obtained location of the dump truck 2 and the obtained
   running path information.  Specifically, the vehicle body
   controller 20 controls at least one of accelerating,
   steering, and braking of the dump truck 2 so that the
25 location of the dump truck 2 received from at least one of
   the scan matching navigation location output controller 33,
   the GPS receiver 31, and the dead reckoning navigation
   location estimation unit 20PC coincides with the location
   of the running path RP included in the running path
30 information.  Owing to this control, the vehicle body
   controller 20 causes the dump truck 2 to run along the
   running path RP.
   [0052]    The running path producing device 32 obtains the

   running path information generated by the processing device
   12 of the management device 10 illustrated in FIG. 1, and
   outputs the running path information to the vehicle body
   controller 20.   The running path producing device 32 is
 5 connected to the wireless communication device 34 to which
   an antenna 34A is connected.    The wireless communication
   device 34 receives information sent from at least one of
   the management device 10 and the mining machine 3 other
   than the own dump truck.   The mining machine 3 other than
10 the own dump truck includes the dump truck 2 other than the
   own dump truck in addition to the other mining machine 3
   other than the dump truck 2.
   [0053]     The wireless communication device 34 receives the
   running path information sent from the wireless
15 communication device 18 of the control facility 7
   illustrated in FIG. 1, and outputs the running path
   information to the running path producing device 32.           The
   GPS receiver 31 is connected to the wireless communication
   device 34.
20 [0054]     FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating information
   required for running control of the dump truck in three
   running modes.   In the present embodiment, the dump truck 2
   runs in the three running modes.    As illustrated in FIG. 5,
   a first running mode is such a running mode that the
25 location of the dump truck is obtained using at least
   detection data of the GPS receiver 31 to cause the dump
   truck to autonomously run based on that location.         The
   first running mode is appropriately referred to as a GPS
   running mode.
30 [0055]     A second running mode is such a running mode that
   the location of the dump truck 2 is calculated using a
   method of scan matching navigation based on map information
   37 produced in advance as described later and a detection

   result of the laser sensor 24B to cause the dump truck 2 to
   autonomously run based on the calculated location of the
   dump truck 2.  The second running mode is appropriately
   referred to as a scan matching navigation running mode.           As
 5 illustrated in FIG. 5, in the scan matching navigation
   running mode, the location of the dump truck 2 is
   calculated in the scan matching navigation location output
   controller 33.
   [0056]    A third running mode is such a running mode as to
10 cause the dump truck 2 to autonomously run based on the
   location estimated by the dead reckoning navigation using a
   detection result of the gyro sensor 26 and a detection
   result of the velocity sensor 27.  The third running mode
   is appropriately referred to as a dead reckoning navigation
15 running mode.  As illustrated in FIG. 5, in the dead
   reckoning navigation running mode, the location of the dump
   truck 2 is estimated in the dead reckoning navigation
   location estimation unit 20PC.  The location information
   generating units in the present embodiment include the GPS
20 receiver 31, the scan matching navigation location output
   controller 33, and the dead reckoning navigation location
   estimation unit 20PC.
   [0057]    The running modes of the present embodiment,
   namely, the GPS running mode, the scan matching navigation
25 running mode, and the dead reckoning navigation running
   mode are different from one another in measurement accuracy
   for the location.  The measurement accuracy for the
   location of the dump truck 2 obtained by these location
   information generating units is appropriately referred to
30 as location measurement accuracy.  In the present
   embodiment, the location measurement accuracy of the dump
   truck in the GPS running mode is higher than the location
   measurement accuracy of the dump truck in the scan matching

   navigation running mode and the dead reckoning navigation
   running mode, that is, an error from the actual location
   where the dump truck exists is small.    The location
   measurement accuracy of the dump truck in the scan matching
 5 navigation running mode is higher than the location
   measurement accuracy of the dump truck in the dead
   reckoning navigation running mode.    The degree of the
   location measurement accuracy of the dump truck in each
   running mode is not limited to that of the present
10 embodiment.
   [0058]     <Location detection of dump truck 2 using GPS
   receiver 31>
         The GPS receiver 31 detects the GPS location that is
   the location of the dump truck 2 using the GPS.         The GPS
15 receiver 31 is one of the plurality of location information
   generating units held by the dump truck in the present
   embodiment.   An antenna 31A that receives the information
   from the positioning satellite 5 is connected to the GPS
   receiver 31.   The antenna 31A outputs, to the GPS receiver
20 31, a signal that is based on the information received from
   the positioning satellite 5.    The GPS receiver 31 detects a
   location of the antenna 31A using the information from the
   positioning satellite 5.
   [0059]     In the process of detecting the location of the
25 antenna 31A, based on, for example, the number of
   positioning satellites 5 from which the antenna 31A has
   received radio waves, the GPS receiver 31 outputs the fixed
   solution, the float solution, or the single solution
   indicating the accuracy of the detected GPS location.           The
30 GPS receiver 31 also outputs information indicating the
   state of the non-positioning when the GPS location is in
   the positioning calculation disability.    In the present
   embodiment, when the location accuracy of the GPS is the

                                                Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT
                                 22
   fixed solution, the dump truck 2 can autonomously run based
   on the detected GPS location.    When the location accuracy
   of the GPS is the float solution and the single solution,
   or when the GPS location is in the positioning calculation
 5 disability, the dump truck 2 does not autonomously run
   based on the detected GPS location.    The location accuracy
   of the GPS and the condition as to whether the dump truck
   executes the autonomous running are not limited to those of
   the present embodiment.
10 [0060]    The scan matching navigation location output
   controller 33 obtains the location of the dump truck 2
   based on information of the object that exists in the
   vicinity of the running path RP obtained from the detection
   result of the laser sensor 24B, and on the map information
15 37 including a location of an object that exists in advance
   in the mine MR.   The scan matching navigation location
   output controller 33 is one of the plurality of location
   information generating units held by the dump truck in the
   present embodiment.
20 [0061]    In the present embodiment, the vehicle body
   controller 20, the running path producing device 32, and
   the scan matching navigation location output controller 33
   are realized by, for example, a processor such as a central
   processing unit  (CPU) and a memory.   In this case, these
25 functions are realized when the processor reads and
   executes the computer program stored in the memory.          The
   memory corresponds to a non-volatile or volatile
   semiconductor memory such as a random access memory         (RAM),
   a read only memory (ROM), a flash memory, an erasable
30 programmable read only memory (EPROM), and an electrically
   erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), a magnetic
   disk, a flexible disk, and a magneto-optical disk.         They
   may be realized by dedicated hardware.    Alternatively, a

                                 23
   plurality of processing circuits may realize these
   functions in cooperation with each other.
   [0062]    In the vehicle body controller 20 illustrated in
   FIG. 4, the processing unit 20P is the processor such as
 5 the CPU, the storage unit 20M is the memory, and the
   input/output unit 20IF is an interface circuit.        The
   processing unit 20P realizes the function of the vehicle
   body controller 20 by reading and executing the computer
   program stored in the storage unit 20M.   The computer
10 program stored in the storage unit 20M includes that for
   realizing the method of controlling the work vehicle
   according to the present embodiment.
   [0063]    The radar 24A and the laser sensor 24B are
   connected to the second signal line 36.   The laser sensor
15 24B is also connected to the scan matching navigation
   location output controller 33 in addition to the second
   signal line 36.   This configuration allows the scan
   matching navigation location output controller 33 to
   directly receive a detection value of the laser sensor 24B.
20 [0064]    The vehicle body controller 20 obtains detection
   values of the radar 24A and the laser sensor 24B via the
   second signal line 36.   The vehicle body controller 20 can
   obtain a relative location between the dump truck 2 and the
   object using the detection values of the radar 24A and the
25 laser sensor 24B.   In other words, when the radar 24A and
   the laser sensor 24B detect a relative location with
   respect to the object, the relative location between the
   dump truck 2 and the object is detected.
   [0065]    The gyro sensor 26 detects an orientation or an
30 orientation change amount of the dump truck 2.      The gyro
   sensor 26 is connected to the vehicle body controller 20
   and outputs a detection value that is the detection result
   to the vehicle body controller 20.   The velocity sensor 27

                                  24
   detects a rotational velocity of the wheel of the dump
   truck 2 to detect a running velocity that is the velocity
   of the dump truck 2.   The velocity sensor 27 is connected
   to the vehicle body controller 20 and outputs a detection
 5 value that is the detection result to the vehicle body
   controller 20.   Next, control that is performed when the
   vehicle body controller 20 causes the dump truck 2 to
   autonomously run using the dead reckoning navigation will
   be described.
10 [0066]     <Estimation of location of dump truck 2 using
   dead reckoning navigation>
         In the present embodiment, the vehicle body controller
   20 causes the dump truck 2 to autonomously run using the
   dead reckoning navigation.    Specifically, the dead
15 reckoning navigation location estimation unit 20PC of the
   vehicle body controller 20 obtains a current location of
   the dump truck 2 using the dead reckoning navigation while
   the braking control unit 20PD, the drive control unit 20PE,
   and the steering control unit 20PF cause the dump truck 2
20 to autonomously run based on the running path RP included
   in the running path information received from the running
   path producing device 32.    The dead reckoning navigation is
   navigation that estimates the current location of the dump
   truck 2 that is an object based on an orientation
25 (orientation change amount) and a moving distance
   (velocity) from a known starting point.
   [0067]     The orientation  (orientation change amount) of
   the dump truck 2 is detected by using the gyro sensor 26
   held by the dump truck 2.    The moving distance    (velocity)
30 of the dump truck 2 is detected by using the velocity
   sensor 27 held by the dump truck 2.    The dead reckoning
   navigation location estimation unit 20PC obtains the
   location of the dump truck 2 using the obtained orientation

                                                Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT
                                25
   (orientation change amount) of the dump truck 2 and the
   obtained moving distance  (velocity) of the dump truck 2.
   [0068]    The vehicle body controller 20 calculates and
   outputs a control amount related to the running of the dump
 5 truck 2 using the obtained location of the dump truck 2 so
   that the dump truck 2 runs along the running path RP.            The
   control amount includes a moving amount   (braking command),
   a steering amount  (steering command),  and a running
   velocity adjustment amount  (velocity command).      The vehicle
10 body controller 20 controls the running (manipulation) of
   the dump truck 2 using the calculated control amount so
   that the dump truck 2 runs along the running path RP.
   [0069]    The accuracy of the location estimation (accuracy
   of the location information) of the dump truck by means of
15 the dead reckoning navigation is not so high.       In a case
   where a running distance of the dump truck 2 by means of
   the dead reckoning navigation becomes longer, therefore,
   detection errors of one or both of the gyro sensor 26 and
   the velocity sensor 27 are accumulated, whereby an error
20 might occur between the estimated location    (estimation
   location) and the actual location.    When the location of
   the dump truck 2 is obtained only by the dead reckoning
   navigation and the dead reckoning navigation running is
   continued, the error between the actual location of the
25 dump truck 2 and the estimation location becomes too large,
   and it becomes difficult to continue the running.         In the
   present embodiment, therefore, the vehicle body controller
   20 may correct the location  (estimation location) of the
   dump truck 2 obtained by the dead reckoning navigation
30 using a location obtained by a method with higher accuracy
   such as, for example, the location obtained by the GPS
   receiver 31 and the location obtained by the scan matching
   navigation location output controller 33.    Next, a process

                                                Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT
                                  26
   performed by the scan matching navigation location output
   controller 33 to obtain the location of the dump truck 2
   will be described.
   [0070]     <Calculation of location of dump truck 2 using
 5 scan matching navigation location output controller 33>
         The scan matching navigation location output
   controller 33 obtains the location of the dump truck 2
   using the detection value of the laser sensor 24B and the
   map information 37 of the mine MR produced in advance.            In
10 other words, the scan matching navigation location output
   controller 33 arithmetically operates the location of the
   dump truck 2 by matching the detection result of the laser
   sensor 24B with the map information 37.
   [0071]     In this case, the scan matching navigation
15 location output controller 33 obtains the location of the
   dump truck 2 using the detection value of the laser sensor
   24B and the map information 37, and outputs the location of
   the dump truck 2 to the first signal line 35.       The vehicle
   body controller 20 receives, via the first signal line 35,
20 the location of the dump truck 2 obtained by the scan
   matching navigation location output controller 33, and
   causes the dump truck 2 to run along the running path RP.
   [0072]     The map information 37 is information including a
   location of the object   (e.g., the bank BK and the side
25 wall) provided in the vicinity of the running path RP or
   the like of the mine MR.    The map information 37 is
   connected to the first signal line 35.    The map information
   37 needs to be produced in advance before the location of
   the dump truck is calculated by the scan matching
30 navigation.   In order to produce the map information 37,
   for example, the detection result of the laser sensor 24B
   in the dump truck 2 that runs on the haul lane HL can be
   used.   For example, in a case where the location of the

                                               Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT
                                 27
   dump truck 2 can be obtained by the GPS receiver 31 with
   high accuracy, the presence or absence and the location of
   the bank BK provided in the vicinity of the haul lane HL
   are detected by the laser sensor 24B, and the presence or
 5 absence and the location data of the bank BK can be stored
   at any time in the map information 37 corresponding to the
   haul lane HL.
   [0073]     FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating a part of the
   map information 37 in the first embodiment.    A part of the
10 map information 37 in FIG. 6 represents the detection
   result of the bank BK obtained by the radar sensor 24B in a
   region around the haul lane HL.   The haul lane HL is a
   blank region in a central part extending in an X direction
   of FIG. 6, and the bank BK is regions with patchy patterns
15 of black and white in an upper part and a lower part of FIG.
   6.  FIG. 7 is an enlarged diagram illustrating an XIV part
   in FIG. 6.   As illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7, the map
   information 37 indicates, in a plane view, a location of a
   grid GR in an XY coordinate system and whether the bank BK
20 exists in each grid GR.   The grid GR is the mine MR divided
   into a predetermined size.
   [0074]     In the present embodiment, regarding each grid GR
   in the map information 37, a grid DR1 at a location where
   the bank BK has been detected is represented by a black
25 square in the drawing, and a grid DR2 at a location where
   the bank BK has not been detected is represented by a white
   square in the drawing.   The map information 37 stores the
   presence or absence and the location information of the
   bank BK.   The map information 37 is an external storage
30 device  (auxiliary storage device) including at least one of
   an ROM, a flash memory, and a hard disk drive.
   [0075]     FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram illustrating an
   exemplary partial region of the map information 37

                                28
   according to the first embodiment.   FIG. 9 is a schematic
   diagram illustrating an exemplary detection result of the
   bank BK obtained by the laser sensor 24B when the dump
   truck runs on the haul lane HL.   FIG. 10 is a schematic
 5 diagram illustrating the map information of FIG. 8 matched
   with the detection result of the laser sensor 24B of FIG. 9,
   and illustrating the location of the own dump truck
   calculated by the scan matching navigation.    In FIGS. 8 to
   10, the grid DR1 at the location where the bank BK exists
10 in the map information 37 is represented by narrow parallel
   oblique lines, and a grid DR3 at a location where the bank
   BK has been detected by the laser sensor 24B is represented
   by a broad parallel oblique lines.
   [0076]    The calculation of the location of the dump truck
15 by means of the scan matching navigation illustrated in
   FIGS. 8 to 10 is performed by the scan matching navigation
   location output controller 33.   In the calculation of the
   location of the own dump truck performed by the scan
   matching navigation location output controller 33, by using
20 a plurality of points  (particles) PA virtually arranged
   within a range in which the dump truck is predicted to
   exist at a certain point of time, it is possible to
   calculate the location of the dump truck that is close to a
   true location while suppressing a calculation cost.         Since
25 the location estimation by means of the particles is a
   known method, a detailed explanation will be omitted.
   [0077]    In the map information 37 illustrated in FIG. 8,
   each of the squares is the grid GR.   The colored grid DR1
   is the grid where the bank BK has been detected, and the
30 white grid DR2 represents the grid where the bank BK has
   not been detected.  FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating the
   grid DR3 that is detection data actually detected by the
   laser sensor 24B of the dump truck.

   [0078]    The map information 37 illustrated in FIG. 8 is
   matched with the detection result of the laser sensor 24B
   illustrated in FIG. 9, and, as illustrated in FIG. 10, a
   final estimation value  (expected value) Po of a location
 5 where a probability that the dump truck 2 exists is
   possibly the highest is calculated using the method of the
   location estimation by means of the particles.      The scan
   matching navigation location output controller 33 outputs
   the most approximate location as the location information
10 of the dump truck 2.   In the present embodiment, the
   location information of the dump truck 2 may include
   orientation information indicating the orientation of the
   dump truck 2.
   [0079]    The vehicle body controller 20 obtains the
15 location of the dump truck 2 output by the scan matching
   navigation location output controller 33.   The vehicle body
   controller 20 controls the running of the dump truck 2
   using the obtained information so that the dump truck 2
   runs along the running path RP.
20 [0080]    The dump truck 2 that works in the mine MR
   illustrated in FIG. 1 might activate a brake while running
   on the haul lane HL, the loading place LPA, and the
   discharging place DPA to stop.   The accuracy of the
   location that is required when the dump truck 2 stops is
25 different depending on a stopping place or a purpose.           In
   the present embodiment, the accuracy of the location that
   is required at the time of the stop of the dump truck 2 is
   determined on the basis of to what extent a displacement
   between a target location for the stop and a location where
30 the dump truck 2 has actually stopped is acceptable.          The
   accuracy of the location that is required at the time of
   the stop of the dump truck 2 is appropriately referred to
   as target location accuracy.

                                30
   [0081]    In the haul lane HL, for example, the dump truck
   2 might stop at the intersection IS,  or stop since traffic
   congestion occurs just before the loading place LPA or the
   discharging place DPA.  In the haul lane HL, however, the
 5 dump truck 2 runs with a certain interval kept.       At the
   time of the stop, the dump truck 2 stops with a certain
   interval kept from the intersection IS or a vehicle ahead.
   Therefore, even if the location where the dump truck 2
   stops is somewhat displaced, operation of the mine MR is
10 hardly affected.  Consequently, the accuracy of the target
   location that is required when the dump truck 2 stops in
   the haul lane HL becomes relatively low.   This is not
   limited to the haul lane HL.   Even in a case where the dump
   truck 2 stops on the running path RP on its way to a
15 destination such as a loading location which will be
   described next, the target location accuracy becomes
   relatively low.
   [0082]    In the loading place LPA, the dump truck 2 might
   stop at the loading location so that, for example, the
20 loading machine 3S can load ore or the like onto the dump
   truck 2.  In this case, since the dump truck 2 needs to
   stop near the loading machine 3S, the target location
   accuracy required when the dump truck 2 stops at the
   loading location is higher than the target location
25 accuracy required when the dump truck 2 stops on the
   running path RP.  The target location accuracy may be
   changed depending on whether the loading machine 3S is an
   excavator type (backhoe) illustrated in FIG. 1 including a
   caterpillar track and an upper swing body, or a loader type
30 (front end) including a tire.   In this case, the target
   location accuracy for the excavator type is preferably
   higher than the target location accuracy for the loader
   type.

   [0083]    In the discharging place DPA, the dump truck 2
   might stop at a discharging location for the crusher CR to,
   for example, discharge the burden into the crusher CR
   illustrated in FIG. 1.  Since a throw opening through which
 5 the burden is thrown in the crusher CR is not large as
   compared with the vessel 22 of the dump truck 2, the dump
   truck 2 needs to stop at a precise location when the burden
   is discharged in the crusher CR.   When the dump truck 2
   stops at a location displaced from the throw opening of the
10 crusher CR, the burden might be spilled from the throw
   opening, or the dump truck 2 might come into contact with
   the crusher CR illustrated in FIG. 1.   Therefore, the
   target location accuracy required when the dump truck 2
   stops at the discharging location for the crusher CR is
15 higher than the target location accuracy at the loading
   location in the loading place LPA.
   [0084]    Examples of another situation in which the dump
   truck 2 stops include a case where soil is discharged
   sequentially from an end of a broad region within the
20 discharging place DPA, a case where an edge of the
   discharging place DPA is formed into a cliff and soil is
   discharged to a cliff bottom, a case where the dump truck 2
   is parked in a parking lot, and a case where the dump truck
   2 stops at a fueling place.  In each of these situations,
25 the target location accuracy required when the dump truck 2
   stops may be set in any way.   For example, the target
   location accuracy required when the dump truck 2 stops may
   be set to be equal to the target location accuracy required
   when the dump truck 2 stops on the running path RP, may be
30 set to be equal to the target location accuracy required
   when the dump truck 2 stops at the loading location, and
   may be set to be equal to the target location accuracy
   required when the dump truck 2 stops at the discharging

   location for the crusher CR.   The target location accuracy
   required when the dump truck 2 stops may be set to the
   location accuracy between the target location accuracy
   required when the dump truck 2 stops on the running path RP
 5 and the target location accuracy required when the dump
   truck 2 stops at the loading location.   Alternatively, the
   target location accuracy required when the dump truck 2
   stops may be set to the target location accuracy between
   the target location accuracy required when the dump truck 2
10 stops at the loading location and the target location
   accuracy required when the dump truck 2 stops at the
   discharging location for the crusher CR.
   [0085]    FIG. 11 is a diagram illustrating locations
   associated with the stop of the dump truck 2.      FIG. 12 is a
15 diagram for explaining control that is executed by the
   vehicle body controller 20 when the dump truck 2 stops.            A
   vertical axis of FIG. 12 represents a velocity Vc of the
   dump truck 2, and a horizontal axis represents a location L
   of the dump truck 2.  When the current location of the dump
20 truck 2 approaches a target stop location Lp included in
   the running path information, the vehicle body controller
   20 illustrated in FIG. 4 controls the braking device 2B
   using the velocity information of the running path RP
   included in the running path information to generate
25 braking force.  The control that is executed by the vehicle
   body controller 20 at the time of the braking of the dump
   truck is appropriately referred to as braking control.           The
   braking control is executed when the vehicle body
   controller 20 causes the dump truck 2 to autonomously run.
30 The vehicle body controller 20 executes the braking control
   in either case where the dump truck 2 stops or reduces its
   velocity as long as the dump truck 2 is under braking.
   [0086]    In the example illustrated in FIG. 11,      the

                                                       Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT

   vehicle body controller 20 starts the braking control when
   the dump truck 2 reaches a location Ls.           The location Ls is
   appropriately referred to as a control start location Ls.
   Upon executing the braking control, the vehicle body
 5 controller 20 obtains braking force FB that is generated by
   the braking device 2B.       As illustrated in FIG. 12, the
   velocity of the dump truck 2 at a timing when the vehicle
   body controller 20 starts the braking control, that is, the
   velocity of the dump truck 2 at the control start location
10 Ls is assumed to be Vcs.
   [0087]     The braking force FB can be obtained by Formula
   (1).
         FB = G x m x Vc 2 /(2   x  d)                     (1)
   [0088]     In Formula    (1),   G is a braking force gain, m is
15 mass of the vehicle body, Vc is the velocity of the dump
   truck 2, and d is a target distance.           The braking force
   gain G is the control information for controlling the
   braking device 2B.    The braking force gain G is determined
   by the location measurement accuracy          (first accuracy) of
20 the dump truck 2 obtained by the location information
   generating units of the dump truck 2, and the target
   location accuracy (second accuracy) indicating how
   accurately the dump truck 2 is expected to stop with
   respect to the target stop location.           This point will be
25 described later.
   [0089]     The mass m of the vehicle body is the sum of mass
   of the dump truck 2 and mass of the burden.            The mass of
   the burden can be obtained by, for example, a load cell
   provided in the dump truck 2.          The velocity Vc is the
30 detection value of the velocity sensor 27 illustrated in
   FIG. 3.   The vehicle body controller 20 obtains the
   velocity Vc from the velocity sensor 27 at every control
   cycle.   The target distance d is a distance along the

                                                     Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT

   running path RP between a current location Ln of the dump
   truck 2 and the target stop location Lp.         At the time of
   starting the braking control, the braking force FB obtained
   from Formula   (1) is G x m x Vcs 2 /(2 x   (Ls - Lp)).
 5 [0090]     When obtaining the braking force FB, the vehicle
   body controller 20 may calculate in consideration of an
   inclination pitch angle of the running path RP.              The
   inclination pitch angle of the running path RP can be
   calculated from the coordinate of each point PI on the
10 running path RP illustrated in FIG. 2.        When the
   inclination pitch angle is positive       (upslope), the vehicle
   body controller 20 subtracts the braking force FB.               When
   the inclination pitch angle is negative (downslope), the
   vehicle body controller 20 adds the braking force FB.
15 [0091]     When the dump truck 2 approaches the target stop
   location Lp beyond the braking start location Ls, the
   vehicle body controller 20 increases the braking force FB
   of the braking device 2B so that the braking force FB is
   equal to or larger than the previous braking force FB, and
20 preferably, so that the braking force FB is larger than the
   previous braking force FB, whereby the dump truck 2 can be
   stopped at the target stop location Lp with good accuracy.
   In the present embodiment, in a case where the target
   distance d becomes a predetermined threshold value dc, the
25 vehicle body controller 20 causes the braking device 2B to
   generate the stronger braking force FB when the dump truck
   2 reaches a location Lc in the example illustrated in FIGS.
   11 and 12.   The location Lc is appropriately referred to as
   a control change location.    After the target distance d
30 becomes the predetermined threshold value dc, the vehicle
   body controller 20 obtains the braking force FB using a
   method different from the method of Formula (1).              As the
   braking force FB that is generated after the control change

                                                Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT
                                 35
   location Lc is reached, such braking force FB may be
   employed that the braking force FB obtained by Formula (1)
   is multiplied by a predetermined multiplying factor.
   Alternatively, no restriction may be imposed on the braking
 5 force FB, that is, the braking force FB may be generated by
   full braking.   Although magnitude of the threshold value dc
   is not limited, it is smaller than a distance between the
   control start location Ls and the target stop location Lp.
   [0092]     As described above, the braking control includes
10 first control BCF that causes the braking device 2B of the
   dump truck 2 that has reached the control start location Ls
   to generate the braking force, and second control BCS that
   causes the braking device 2B to generate the braking force
   FB equal to or larger than the first control BCF when the
15 dump truck 2 reaches the control change location Lc         (refer
   to FIG. 12).   The first control BCF is executed before the
   second control BCS.   In the first control BCF, that is,
   between the control start location Ls and the control
   change location Lc, the vehicle body controller 20 can
20 change the braking force FB by changing magnitude of the
   braking force gain G of Formula   (1) in accordance with the
   situation.   As described above, the braking force gain G is
   information for changing the braking force FB at the time
   of the first control BCF.
25 [0093]     FIG. 13 is a diagram illustrating a relation
   between the velocity Vc and the location L obtained when
   the braking force gain G is relatively smaller than that
   illustrated in FIG. 12.   FIGS. 14 and 15 are diagrams
   illustrating the dump truck 2 that stops when the braking
30 force gain G is relatively small.    FIG. 16 is a diagram
   illustrating the dump truck 2 that stops when the braking
   force gain G is relatively large.
   [0094]     In the present embodiment, since the vehicle body

                                              Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT
                                36
   controller 20 causes the braking device 2B to generate the
   larger braking force FB in the second control BCS, an
   impact occurs on the dump truck 2 when the dump truck 2
   stops.
 5 [0095]   When the braking force gain G is relatively small,
   the braking device 2B of the dump truck 2 has the small
   braking force FB at the time of the first control BCF.
   Then, as illustrated in FIG. 13, during a period after the
   first control BCF is started at the control start location
10 Ls of FIG. 14 and before the first control BCF is ended at
   the control change location Lc, the reduction in the
   velocity Vc of the dump truck 2 becomes small.     Therefore,
   the dump truck 2 has a high velocity Vcc when starting the
   second control BCS.  As a result, the dump truck 2 urgently
15 stops at the target stop location Lp.  When the braking
   force gain G is relatively small, the impact that occurs on
   the dump truck 2 is large.  When the braking force gain G
   is relatively small, however, a certain level of velocity
   is maintained even immediately before the target stop
20 location Lp.  Therefore, for example, even when an
   unexpected protrusion, track or the like exists between the
   control start location Ls and the target stop location Lp
   as illustrated in FIGS. 14 and 15, it is possible to get
   over the protrusion, the track or the like as long as the
25 certain level of velocity is maintained.  As a result, as
   illustrated in FIG. 15, the accuracy of the location where
   the dump truck 2 stops is high.
   [0096]   When the braking force gain G is relatively large,
   the braking device 2B of the dump truck 2 has the large
30 braking force FB at the time of the first control BCF.
   Then, as illustrated in FIG. 12, during the period after
   the first control BCF is started at the control start
   location Ls of FIG. 14 and before the first control BCF is

                                37
   ended at the control change location Lc, the reduction in
   the velocity Vc of the dump truck 2 becomes large.
   Therefore, the dump truck 2 has a low velocity Vcc when
   starting the second control BCS.   As a result, as
 5 illustrated in FIG. 16, the dump truck 2 sometimes stops
   before the target stop location Lp.   When the braking force
   gain G is relatively large, the degree of velocity
   reduction by the second control BCS is small.      Therefore,
   the impact that occurs on the dump truck 2 is small.
10 However, as illustrated in FIG. 16, for example, when an
   unexpected protrusion, track or the like exists between the
   control start location Ls and the target stop location Lp,
   the velocity of the dump truck 2 might not be enough for
   the dump truck 2 to get over the protrusion, the track or
15 the like, and the dump truck 2 might stop.   As a result,
   the accuracy of the location where the dump truck 2 stops
   becomes low.
   [0097]    As described above, the accuracy of the location
   where the dump truck 2 stops and the impact that occurs on
20 the dump truck 2 caused by changing the braking force gain
   G have a trade-off relation.   The accuracy of the location
   where the dump truck 2 stops when the braking control is
   performed by changing the braking force gain G is
   appropriately referred to as braking control accuracy RPc.
25 When the dump truck 2 performs the braking control based on
   the location of the own dump truck obtained by the location
   information generating units having predetermined location
   measurement accuracy PP, the accuracy PRp of the location
   where the dump truck 2 finally stops  (appropriately
30 referred to as stop location accuracy) is represented by
   the sum of the location measurement accuracy (first
   accuracy PP) of the dump truck 2 obtained by the location
   information generating unit of the dump truck 2 and the

                                               Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT
                                 38
   braking control accuracy PRc as represented in Formula (2).
         PRp = PP + PRc                                    (2)
   [0098]     As can be understood from Formula (2),      even when
   the braking control accuracy PRc is low, the reduction in
 5 the stop location accuracy PRp is suppressed as long as the
   location measurement accuracy PP is high.   Similarly, even
   when the location measurement accuracy PP is low, the
   reduction in the stop location accuracy PRp is suppressed
   as long as the braking control accuracy PRc is high.
10 [0099]     The dump truck 2 is configured such that wear of
   the tire, a load on each part of the vehicle body, and a
   load on the braking device 2B are decreased by reducing the
   impact at the time of the braking.   In the braking control,
   therefore, the impact at the time of the braking is
15 expected to be as small as possible.   In order to reduce
   the impact that occurs on the dump truck 2, the braking
   force gain G only needs to be increased in the first
   control BCF.   When the braking force gain G is large,
   however, the braking control accuracy PRc becomes low.
20 [0100]     When the dump truck 2 is stopped at a
   predetermined place, the stop location accuracy PRp that is
   the accuracy of the location where the dump truck 2 stops
   only needs to satisfy the target location accuracy PST
   (second accuracy) that is the location accuracy required at
25 the time of the stop of the dump truck 2 at the
   predetermined place.   Formula (2) can be rewritten as
   Formula (3).
         PST = PP + PRc                                    (3)
   [0101]     In order to reduce the impact that occurs when
30 the dump truck 2 stops, the braking force gain G needs to
   be increased, that is, the braking control accuracy PRc
   needs to be reduced.   It can be understood from Formula          (3)
   that a certain level of accuracy is ensured for the target

                                                Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT
                                 39
   location accuracy PST even when the braking control
   accuracy PRc is low as long as the location measurement
   accuracy PP is high.   When the location measurement
   accuracy PP is low and the target location accuracy PST is
 5 high, the braking control accuracy PRc needs to be
   increased in order to ensure the target location accuracy
   PST.   In this case, the braking force gain G needs to be
   reduced.   As a result, the impact that occurs when the dump
   truck 2 stops is increased.
10 [0102]     The target location accuracy PST is determined by
   the running path information.    Therefore, when the required
   target location accuracy PST is not so high, the control
   system 30 reduces the braking control accuracy PRc if the
   location measurement accuracy PP is ensured, thereby
15 reducing the impact that occurs at the time of the stop of
   the dump truck 2, and ensuring the required degree of the
   stop location accuracy PRp.   When the location measurement
   accuracy PP cannot be ensured, the control system 30
   increases the braking control accuracy PRc, thereby
20 ensuring the required degree of the stop location accuracy
   PRp.   In this case, the impact that occurs at the time of
   the stop of the dump truck 2 is increased.
   [0103]     When the very high target location accuracy PST
   is required, even if the location measurement accuracy PP
25 is high, the control system 30 increases the braking
   control accuracy PRc, thereby ensuring the required stop
   location accuracy PRp.   In this case, the impact that
   occurs at the time of the stop of the dump truck 2 is
   increased.
30 [0104]     In the present embodiment, in a case where the
   location measurement accuracy PP is constant, the control
   system 30 increases the braking control accuracy PRc to
   cause the dump truck 2 to stop at the target stop location

                                               Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT

   Lp without fail when the target location accuracy PST is
   high, and the control system 30 reduces the impact that
   occurs at the time of the stop of the dump truck 2 when the
   target location accuracy PST is low.   The control system 30
 5 reduces the braking control accuracy PRc as the location
   measurement accuracy PP becomes high to ensure the accuracy
   of the location where the dump truck 2 stops and decrease
   the impact that occurs at the time of the stop of the dump
   truck 2.
10 [0105]    For this purpose, in the present embodiment, the
   braking force gain G is set in accordance with the location
   measurement accuracy PP  (first accuracy) and the target
   location accuracy PST  (second accuracy).  Specifically, the
   high braking force gain G is set in the first control BCF
15 so that the impact that occurs when the dump truck 2 stops
   is reduced as the location measurement accuracy PP that is
   the first accuracy becomes high or as the target location
   accuracy PST that is the second accuracy becomes low.           The
   low braking force gain G is set in the first control BCF so
20 that the target location accuracy PST at the time of the
   stop of the dump truck 2 can be ensured as the location
   measurement accuracy PP that is the first accuracy becomes
   low, or as the target location accuracy PST that is the
   second accuracy becomes high.
25 [0106]    As described above, in the present embodiment,
   the braking force gain G is set in accordance with the
   target location accuracy PST and the location measurement
   accuracy PP.  Therefore, even when the stopping place and
   the location measurement accuracy PP are changed, the
30 accuracy of the location where the dump truck 2 stops can
   be ensured while the suppression of the impact at the time
   of the stop of the dump truck 2 is suppressed.
   [0107]    FIG. 17 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary

   data table TB in which the braking force gains G are
   described.   In the data table TB, nine braking force gains
   in total including braking force gains Gl    to G33 are
   described.   The numbers 11 to 33 are identifiers for
 5 identifying the braking force gain G.    The braking force
   gain G is unambiguously determined once the location
   measurement accuracy PP   (first accuracy) and the target
   location accuracy PST   (second accuracy) are determined.           An
   alphabet L attached to the location measurement accuracy PP
10 and the target location accuracy PST represents that the
   accuracy is relatively low, M represents that the accuracy
   is higher than L, and H represents that the accuracy is
   higher than M.   In the present embodiment, both of the
   location measurement accuracy PP and the target location
15 accuracy PST have the three levels.    However, the levels
   are not limited to the three levels, and may be two levels
   and four or more levels.    The levels of the location
   measurement accuracy PP and the levels of the target
   location accuracy PST may be different.    For example, the
20 location measurement accuracy PP may have the two levels
   and the target location accuracy PST may have the three
   levels.  The location measurement accuracy PP and the
   target location accuracy PST may not be provided with the
   levels, and may be represented by numerical values.          In
25 this case, the braking force gain G can be calculated from
   the numerical values of the location measurement accuracy
   PP and the target location accuracy PST.
   [0108]     In the present embodiment, an example of the PPH
   having the high location measurement accuracy PP        (first
30 accuracy) includes the time of the GPS running mode.           The
   PPM having the middle degree of the location measurement
   accuracy PP corresponds to, for example, the time of the
   scan matching navigation running mode, and the PPL having

                                 42
   the low location measurement accuracy PP corresponds to,
   for example, the time of the dead reckoning navigation
   running mode.   The PSTH indicating that the place has the
   high target location accuracy PST (second accuracy)
 5 corresponds to, for example, stopping at the discharging
   location for the crusher CR.    The PSTM that is the place
   having the middle degree of the target location accuracy
   PST corresponds to, for example, stopping at the loading
   location, and the PSTL that is the place having the low
10 target location accuracy PST corresponds to, for example,
   stopping on the running path RP.
   [0109]    The braking force gains Gil,   G12, G13 at the time
   of the location measurement accuracy PPL increase in this
   order, the braking force gains G21, G22, G23 at the time of
15 the location measurement accuracy PPM increase in this
   order, and the braking force gains G31, G32, G33 at the
   time of the location measurement accuracy PPH increase in
   this order.   In other words, the braking force gain G is
   set so that the impact that occurs when the dump truck 2
20 stops is reduced as the target location accuracy PST
   becomes low as long as the location measurement accuracy PP
   is the same.   A specific numerical value of each braking
   force gain G may be appropriately set.
   [0110]    The braking force gains Gl,    G21, G31 at the time
25 of the target location accuracy PSTH increase in this order,
   the braking force gains G12, G22, G32 at the time of the
   target location accuracy PSTM increase in this order, and
   the braking force gains G13, G23, G33 at the time of the
   target location accuracy PSTH increase in this order.           In
30 other words, the braking force gain G is set so that the
   impact that occurs when the dump truck 2 stops is reduced
   as the location measurement accuracy PP becomes high as
   long as the target location accuracy PST is the same.           In

                                 43
   still other words, the braking force gains Gl      to G33 in
   FIG. 17 are configured such that the braking force gain is
   increased toward the lower right, and the braking force
   gain is reduced toward the upper left.
 5 [0111]     The data table TB is stored in the storage unit
   20M of the vehicle body controller 20 illustrated in FIG. 4.
   When the vehicle body controller 20 executes the braking
   control, the processing unit 20P, specifically, the braking
   parameter determination unit 20PB reads the data table TB
10 from the storage unit 20M to obtain the braking force gain
   G corresponding to the location measurement accuracy PP and
   the target location accuracy PST determined by the braking
   parameter determination unit 20PB at every control cycle.
   The braking control unit 20PD then obtains the braking
15 force FB in the first control BCF using the braking force
   gain G obtained by the braking parameter determination unit
   20PB to generate and output an instruction for causing the
   braking device 2B to generate the obtained braking force FB.
   [0112]     FIG. 18 is a flowchart illustrating exemplary
20 braking control according to the first embodiment.        The
   braking control according to the present embodiment is such
   control that the vehicle body controller 20 of the control
   system 30 controls the braking device 2B of the dump truck
   2 to stop the dump truck 2.   The braking control according
25 to the present embodiment corresponds to the method of
   controlling the work vehicle according to the present
   embodiment.   In step S101, the judgment unit 20PA of the
   processing unit 20P of the vehicle body controller 20
   illustrated in FIG. 4 judges whether to stop the dump truck
30 2.   In this judgment, the judgment unit 20PA judges whether
   to stop the dump truck 2 based on the running path
   information obtained from the running path producing device
   32 illustrated in FIG. 3 and the current location of the

                                 44
   dump truck 2.   For example, when the dump truck 2 reaches
   the control start location Ls, the judgment unit 20PA
   judges that the control for stopping the dump truck 2 is to
   be started.
 5 [0113]     In step S101, when the judgment unit 20PA judges
   that the dump truck 2 is not to be stopped (step S101, No),
   the braking control according to the present embodiment is
   ended.   In step S101, when the judgment unit 20PA judges
   that the dump truck 2 is to be stopped (step S101, Yes),
10 the braking parameter determination unit 20PB of the
   processing unit 20P obtains, in step S102, the location
   measurement accuracy PP and the target location accuracy
   PST.   The location measurement accuracy PP is determined on
   the basis of the location information generating units
15 illustrated in FIG. 5, namely, the positioning state output
   by the GPS receiver 31, the state of the scan matching
   navigation location output controller 33, and the dead
   reckoning navigation location estimation unit 20PC.
   [0114]     In the present embodiment, for example, when the
20 output of the GPS receiver 31 is the fixed solution, the
   vehicle body controller 20 employs the GPS running mode as
   the running mode.   In this case, the location measurement
   accuracy PP selected by the braking parameter determination
   unit 20PB is high, namely, the PPH.
25 [0115]     When the output of the GPS receiver 31 is the
   float solution or the single solution, or the GPS location
   is the state of the non-positioning, the state of the scan
   matching navigation location output controller 33 is
   referred to.   Specifically, when the state of the scan
30 matching navigation location output controller 33 is normal,
   and predetermined location estimation accuracy can be
   ensured by the scan matching navigation, the vehicle body
   controller 20 employs the scan matching navigation running

                                               Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT
                                 45
   mode as the running mode.   In this case, the location
   measurement accuracy PP selected by the braking parameter
   determination unit 20PB is middle, namely, the PPM.
   [0116]     When the state of the scan matching navigation
 5 location output controller 33 is abnormal, or predetermined
   location estimation accuracy cannot be ensured by the scan
   matching navigation, the vehicle body controller 20 employs
   the dead reckoning navigation running mode as the running
   mode.  In this case, the location measurement accuracy PP
10 selected by the braking parameter determination unit 20PB
   is low, namely, the PPL.   For this selection, the vehicle
   body controller 20 sends, to the braking parameter
   determination unit 20PB, information as to which running
   mode has been employed.
15 [0117]     Since the target location accuracy PST is
   included in the running path information of the target stop
   location Lp, the braking parameter determination unit 20PB
   obtains the target location accuracy PST from the running
   path information generated by the running path producing
20 device 32.
   [0118]     Next, in step S103, the braking parameter
   determination unit 20PB reads the data table TB from the
   storage unit 20M to obtain the braking force gain G
   corresponding to the location measurement accuracy PP and
25 the target location accuracy PST determined in step S102.
   The braking parameter determination unit 20PB determines
   the obtained braking force gain G as the braking force gain
   G that is used in the present control cycle.     In step S104,
   the braking control unit 20PD obtains the braking force FB
30 using the braking force gain G determined by the braking
   parameter determination unit 20PB and using Formula        (1) to
   control the braking device 2B so that the braking device 2B
   has the obtained braking force FB, thereby braking the dump

   truck 2.
   [0119]     At the time of the stop of the dump truck 2, the
   present embodiment can suppress the impact at the time of
   the stop while realizing the different target location
 5 accuracy PST that depends on the place where the dump truck
   2 stops.   The configuration of the present embodiment can
   also be appropriately applied to the following embodiment.
   [0120]     Second Embodiment
         While the first embodiment is the braking control that
10 is used when the dump truck 2 stops, a second embodiment is
   braking control that is used when the dump truck 2 running
   in the mine MR reduces its velocity before it enters a
   curve.   In the second embodiment, the dump truck 2, the
   control system 30,  and the vehicle body controller 20 are
15 the same as those of the first embodiment.
   [0121]     FIG. 19 is a diagram illustrating the dump truck
   2 that enters a curve.   As illustrated in FIG. 19, when the
   running dump truck 2 enters a curve CN, the dump truck 2
   needs to reduce the velocity Vc to a velocity limit set at
20 every curve CN or less before it enters the curve CN.            The
   velocity limit is set, for example, based on a radius of
   curvature R of the curve CN.    Specifically, the smaller the
   radius of curvature R of the curve CN is, the lower the
   velocity limit becomes.
25 [0122]     When the dump truck 2 enters the curve CN, the
   vehicle body controller 20 illustrated in FIG. 4 starts the
   braking control according to the second embodiment once the
   dump truck 2 illustrated in FIG. 19 reaches the control
   start location Ls.   The vehicle body controller 20 then
30 reduces, before reaching a target velocity reduction end
   location Lpi, the velocity Vc of the dump truck 2 to the
   velocity limit of the curve CN or less.    The target
   velocity reduction end location Lpi is an entrance CNI of

                                 47
   the curve CN.   In the second embodiment, the dump truck 2
   is not completely stopped at the target velocity reduction
   end location Lpi.   Unlike the first embodiment, therefore,
   the second control BCS that activates the stronger braking
 5 force may not be performed, and only the first control BCF
   may be used so that the velocity is reduced to the velocity
   limit or less.   In the second embodiment, unlike the first
   embodiment, there is only one pattern of target location
   accuracy PC that is required at the target velocity
10 reduction end location Lpi located at the entrance CNI of
   the curve CN.
   [0123]     FIG. 20 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary
   data table TBa in which braking force gains Ga are
   described.   The data table TBa is used for the braking
15 control according to the second embodiment.    Three braking
   force gains in total including braking force gains Gall to
   Ga3l are described in the data table TBa.   The braking
   force gain Ga is unambiguously determined once the location
   measurement accuracy PP is determined.
20 [0124]     The braking force gains Gall, Ga2l, Ga3l increase
   in this order.   In other words, the braking force gain Ga
   is set so that the impact that occurs when the dump truck 2
   reduces its velocity is reduced as the location measurement
   accuracy PP becomes high.
25 [0125]     The data table TBa is stored in the storage unit
   20M of the vehicle body controller 20 illustrated in FIG. 4.
   When the vehicle body controller 20 executes the braking
   control, the control which is the same as that of the first
   embodiment is executed.   A detailed explanation will be
30 omitted.
   [0126]     Although the present embodiment has been
   described assuming that the velocity is reduced at the
   entrance CNI of the curve CN, the present embodiment is not

                                              Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT
                                48
   limited to this situation.  For example, the present
   embodiment may be applied to a case where the velocity is
   reduced when entering the intersection IS, and a case where
   the velocity is reduced just before a place in which the
 5 velocity limit is determined such as an easily slipping
   road surface.
   [0127]    In the first embodiment, the vehicle body
   controller 20 is configured to calculate the braking force
   FB based on the braking force gain G in the first control
10 BCF to activate the braking device 2B, and activate, in the
   second control BCS, the braking force larger than that of
   the first control BCF.  However, the present invention is
   not limited to this embodiment of the two-level braking
   control.  For example, the braking force FB may be
15 determined so that the stop at the target stop location Lp
   is achieved only by the first control BCF.  In this case,
   the larger the braking force in the first control BCF is,
   the higher the stop location accuracy PRp becomes.       However,
   the impact that occurs on the dump truck 2 at the time of
20 the stop is increased.  The control start location Ls with
   respect to the target stop location Lp may be changed in
   accordance with the braking force.  In this case as well,
   it is preferable that the braking force gain is determined
   so that the impact that occurs on the dump truck 2 is
25 reduced while the target location accuracy PST is ensured.
   [0128]    In the aforementioned embodiment, the calculation
   formula for calculating the braking force FB is defined as
   Formula (1).  However, the calculation formula is not
   limited to Formula (1), and the braking force FB may be
30 calculated by any calculation formula as long as the
   braking force gain G is contained.
   [0129]    In the aforementioned embodiment, the control
   system provided in the dump truck 2 is configured to

                                                Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT
                                 49
   perform the braking control.    However, the present
   invention is not limited to this aspect, and, for example,
   the braking device may be activated in such a manner that
   the braking force FB is calculated by the management device
 5 10,  and the calculated braking force FB is sent to the dump
   truck 2 through the communication system 9.
   [0130]     In the aforementioned embodiment, the location
   measurement accuracy PP and the target location accuracy
   PST are prepared in advance so as to be divided into the
10 three levels.   However, the present invention is not
   limited to this aspect, and, for example, the braking force
   gain may be calculated by the quantified location
   measurement accuracy PP and target location accuracy PST.
   [0131]     In the aforementioned embodiment, when it is
15 judged whether the accuracy of the GPS location is high
   accuracy, it is judged whether the solution of the GPS
   location detected by the GPS receiver 31 is the fixed
   solution.   However, the present invention is not limited to
   this judgement.   For example, even when the solution of the
20 GPS location is the float solution, it may be judged that
   the accuracy of the GPS location is high accuracy as long
   as a predetermined condition is satisfied.
   [0132]    In the first embodiment and the second embodiment,
   an exemplary case where the work vehicle is the mining
25 machine that is used in the mine has been described.
   However, the work vehicle is not limited to the mining
   machine.   The work vehicle only needs to have at least the
   running device 23 and the braking device 2B.      For example,
   a work vehicle that is used in an underground mine and a
30 work vehicle that is used in a work site on the ground may
   be employed.   The work vehicle is a concept including the
   mining machine.
   [0133]    In the first embodiment and the second embodiment,

                                                Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT
                                 50
   the work vehicle is the dump truck 2.    However, the work
   vehicle may be a wheel loader, a grader, or a general
   vehicle 3C.   In the first embodiment and the second
   embodiment, the dump truck 2 is the unmanned dump truck.
 5 However, the dump truck 2 is not limited to this example,
   and may be configured to assist driving of a manned dump
   truck.
   [0134]     The method by which the scan matching navigation
   location output controller 33 obtains the location of the
10 dump truck 2 is also not limited to that of the present
   embodiment.   Any method may be employed as long as it is a
   method to calculate the current location of the dump truck
   2 by comparing the detection result of the obstacle sensor
   24 and the map information 37 stored in advance.         In the
15 present embodiment, the radar sensor and the laser sensor
   have been described as the examples of the non-contact
   sensor 24.   However, the non-contact sensor 24 is not
   limited to these examples, and, for example, a situation
   around the dump truck 2 may be detected using a stereo
20 camera or a mono camera.
   [0135]     In the aforementioned above embodiment, the
   location of the work vehicle is detected using the GPS
   detector.   However, the present invention is not limited to
   this example, and the location of the work vehicle may be
25 able to be detected on the basis of known location
   information generating units.    In particular, since the
   GNSS cannot be detected in an underground mine, for example,
   existing location information generating units such as an
   indoor messaging system (IMES), a pseudo satellite
30 (pseudolite), a radio frequency identifier    (RFID), a beacon,
   a surveying tool, a wireless LAN, an ultra wide band (UWB),
   and a simultaneous localization and mapping    (SLAM), or
   self-location estimation of the work vehicle using a

                                               Docket No. PKOA-16113-PCT
                                 51
   landmark  (mark provided in the vicinity of the running
   path) may be used.
   [0136]     The first embodiment and the second embodiment
   can suppress, upon braking the dump truck 2 so that the
 5 dump truck 2 has the target velocity at the target location,
   the reduction in the accuracy that is required for the
   location of the work vehicle that has reached the target
   location while suppressing the impact that occurs on the
   dump truck 2.   In particular, since the dump truck 2 that
10 is used in the mine has the large mass, the impact easily
   occurs on the dump truck 2 at the time of the braking.
   However, the aforementioned embodiment can suppress the
   reduction in the accuracy of the location for the stop or
   the like while suppressing the impact on the dump truck 2.
15 Therefore, the aforementioned embodiment is suitable for
   the large work vehicle that is used in the mine.
   [0137]     The first embodiment and the second embodiment have
   been described so far.   However, the first embodiment and the
   second embodiment are not limited by the aforementioned
20 contents.   The aforementioned components include what can be
   easily conceived by a person skilled in the art, what is
   substantially identical, and what is within so-called scope
   of equivalence.   The aforementioned components can be
   appropriately combined.   At least one of various types of
25 omission, substitution, and modification can be performed for
   the components in a range not deviating from the gist of the
   first embodiment and the second embodiment.
   [0138]     Unless the context clearly requires otherwise,
   throughout the description and the claims, the words
30 "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be construed in
   an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive
   sense; that is to say, in the sense of "including, but not
   limited to".
