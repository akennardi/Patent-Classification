Abstract
MATERIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AN
IN-PIT CRUSHER AND CONVEYER
A material management system (200) and method manages and tracks the progress of excavated
material transferred through an excavation site (100) by a conveyer system (190) operating in
cooperation with an in-pit crusher and conveyer (IPCC) (102). The material management system
(200) distinguishes the material dispensed into the IPCC (102) into identified material batches.
To track the identified material batches, the material management system (200) records data
regarding the conveyer speed (324) and the conveyer distance (326)associated with the IPCC
(102), as well as possible other data regarding the identified material batches. The material
management system processes (200) this to track the identified material batches along the
conveyer route.

Description
MATERIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AN IN-PIT CRUSHER AND
CONVEYER
Technical Field
[0001]      The present disclosure relates generally to excavation of material from an excavation
site utilizing in part an in-pit crusher and conveyer system and, more particularly, to managing
and tracking the excavated material transferred through excavation site.
Background
[0002]      Excavating material such as coal, ore, or other minerals from an excavation site, such
as an open pit mine, may be accomplished using an excavating machine such as a rope shovel
equipped with a digging tool to physically remove material from the ground and to dispense the
material to a hauling machine such as a dump truck. The hauling machine transports the material
from the excavation site to a processing site while the excavating machine remains in place to
continue excavating material. Typically, if the processing site is located at any substantial
distance from the excavation site, a plurality of hauling machines may be required to be
continuously available as the rope shovel continues excavating. The number of hauling machines
necessary depends in part upon their hauling capacity, with the larger capacity hauling machines
needing to make fewer trips to maintain pace with the rope shovel. One advantage of utilizing a
fleet of independent hauling machines, though, is that it enables tracking and tracing of the
material being excavated by the rope shovel. For example, U.S. Publication No. 2013/0272829
("the '829 publication") describes a method of utilizing sensors and probabilistic data models to
track material being hauled about an excavation site by a hauling machine. Furthermore, the
individual hauling machines can be directed to different processing sites depending upon the
material being excavated.
[0003]      More recently, excavation sites have begun utilizing in-pit crushing and conveying
("IPCC") systems that operate in cooperation with the excavating machine to excavate and
transport material about the site. The IPCC can include a funnel-like hopper to receive material

                                                 -2
dispensed from the rope shovel and a local processing unit referred to as an in-pit crusher that
functions to break-up or pulverize the material for easier handling. To remove the processed
material, the IPCC may be operatively associated with one or more conveyers that transports the
processed material away from the excavation site to a common hauling point or processing site.
Benefits of the IPCC process include reducing the number of required hauling machines and/or
the travel distance that the hauling machines must cover to exit the excavation site. However, the
advantage of utilizing individual hauling machines to manage handling of the excavated material
is reduced. Accordingly, the present disclosure is directed to a system and method for managing
excavated material that is processed in part through an IPCC unit.
Summary
[0004]     The disclosure describes, in one aspect, a material management system for use at an
excavation site to track and trace excavated material. The material management system includes
a machine controller operatively associated with an excavating machine that has a digging tool
for excavating and dispensing material. The machine controller can communicate with a machine
transmitter/receiver disposed on the excavating machine to exchange data with the rest of the
material management system. The material management system also includes an IPCC controller
operatively associated with an in-pit crusher and conveyer (IPCC) and a secondary conveyer
system receiving material from the IPCC. The IPCC controller is configured to monitor the
operating status of the IPCC and the secondary conveyer system and to communicate that
information with an IPCC transmitter/receiver disposed on the IPCC. The material management
system further uses an excavation network to communicate with the machine transmitter/receiver
and the IPCC transmitter/receiver. The excavation network is configured to distinguish material
into indentified material batches and to track the identified material batches on the secondary
conveyer system based on a dispensing time, a conveyer speed, and a conveyer distance.
[0005]     In another aspect, the disclosure describes a method of managing the excavation of
material at an excavation site with an excavating machine. The excavating machine dispenses
material into the hopper of an IPCC while recording a dispensing time that material is dispensed.
The method distinguishes the dispensed material into individual identified material batches based
on the dispensing time. The individual material batches are discharged from the IPCC to a
secondary conveyer system operatively associated with the IPCC. A conveyer speed and a

                                                   -3
conveyer distance associated with the secondary conveyer system are recorded and used to track
the identified material batches on secondary conveyer system.
[0006]      In yet another aspect, the disclosure describes a material management system for
excavation in cooperation with an excavating machine dispensing material to an in-pit crusher
and conveyer (IPCC) operatively associated with as secondary conveyer system. The material
management system is configured to manage and track material on the secondary conveyer
system by conducting a process that includes recording a dispensing time when material is
dispensed from the excavating machine to the IPCC and recording a conveyer distance regarding
the secondary conveyer. The material management system receives a conveyer speed operatively
associated with the secondary conveyer and can process the dispensing time, conveyer distance,
and conveyer speed to track progress of material on the secondary conveyer system.

Detailed Description
[0007]      Now referring to the figures, wherein like reference numbers refer to like elements,
there is illustrated in FIG. 1 an excavating machine 100 operating in cooperation with a in-pit
crusher and conveyer ("IPCC") system 102 to excavate material from an excavation site 104. An
excavation site 104 in accordance with the present disclosure may be a large scale, open cast or

                                                  -4
open-pit mine in which overburden is removed or stripped from the surface of the ground by the
excavating machine 100 to access the material of interest, which may be coal, ore, or minerals.
Excavation results in the planar or horizontal pit floor 106 being continuously lowered while the
excavation site 104 is expanded by operation of the excavating machine 100 to remove material
from a vertical bank or pit wall 108 that rises from the pit floor 106. In addition to mining, the
excavation site 104 may be intended to create cannels, reservoirs, or other large scale civil
engineering projects.
[0008]     For excavation on the scale of the present disclosure, the excavating machine 100 may
be a mining shovel such as a rope shovel or power shovel that removes material from the
excavation site 104 by digging into the pit wall 108 to loosen and remove material from the
vertical bank. To dig or crowd into the pit wall 108, the excavating machine 100 can include a
digging tool 110 that is pivotally and slidably supported on an upper structure 112 that in turn is
supported on and carried by an undercarriage 114. To mobilize the excavating machine 100 and
propel it about the excavation site 104, the undercarriage 114 can include traction devices such
as continuous tracks 116 that are disposed on each side of the excavating machine 100. The
continuous tracks 116 form a closed loop or belt disposed around one or more drive wheels or
drive sprockets 118 that are rotatably attached to the undercarriage 114 at fixed locations.
Rotation of the drive sprockets 118 cause the continuous tracks 116 to translate with respect to
the undercarriage 114 thereby propelling the excavating machine 100 over the pit floor 106 in
the forward or reverse directions, or they can turn the excavating machine 100 toward the sides.
In other embodiments, however, other traction devices can be utilized to propel the excavating
machine 100 about the excavation site 104 such as rotating wheels. Furthermore, in addition to
the illustrated rope shovel, other examples of mobile excavating machines 100 include draglines,
excavators, wheel or track loaders, hoes and the like. In addition, the excavating machine 100
can be stationary in configuration by omission of the continuous tracks 116.
[0009]     The digging tool 110 can include a boom 120, which may be an elongated, beam-like
structure pivotally connected at its proximate lower end 122 to the upper structure 112 and that
extends upwardly to a distal upper end 124. The boom 120 may project forward of the
excavating machine 100 by extending at an angle of, for example, 600 with respect to the upper
structure 112. To support the boom 120 at its upright, angled orientation, one or more suspension
ropes 126 can be attached proximate the distal upper end 124 and extend down to an A-frame

                                                  -5
shaped backstay 128 disposed on the upper structure 112. To penetrate into and remove material
from the vertical pit wall 108, the boom 120 can support a dipper assembly 130 that includes a
bucket-like dipper 132 disposed at the distal end of an elongated dipper arm 134. The dipper arm
134 is pivotally supported and can slide with respect to the upright boom 120 by operation of a
saddle block 136 disposed approximately midway between the proximate lower end 122 and the
distal upper end 124. During a digging operation, the dipper assembly 130 is swung upwardly
with respect to the pit wall 108 while being projected or forced forwardly into the pit wall 108 so
that material is dislodged and collected into the dipper 132 which may have a predetermined
capacity or volume for holding material. To enable the dipper assembly 130 to translate with
respect to the boom 120, the saddle block 136 can be configured as a sleeve or cradle that
supports and interacts with the dipper arm 134 via bearings, rollers, or the like. The process of
extending and penetrating the dipper assembly 130 into the pit wall 108 to remove material may
be referred to as crowding. To dispense material from the dipper assembly 130, the bottom of the
bucket-like dipper 132 can be released allowing the material to fall out.
[0010]    To cause the relative motion between the dipper assembly 130 and the boom 120, the
excavating machine 100 can include a hoist system 140 disposed on the upper structure 112 that
includes various motors, actuators, and rigging for operation. For example, to hoist or lower the
dipper 132 in the vertical direction, the hoist system 140 can include hoist cables or hoist ropes
142 that are attached to the rear of the dipper 132 and that extend upwardly around a sheave 144
or pulley disposed at the distal upper end 124 of the boom 120. The hoist ropes 142 partially
wrap around the sheave 144 to reverse direction and extend back downwards generally parallel
to the boom 120 to wrap around a hoist wench 146 disposed in the upper structure 112. The hoist
wench 146 may be operatively coupled to a motor to selectively rotate to wind in or pay out the
hoist ropes 142. Winding in the hoist ropes 142 can pivot the dipper assembly 130 upwardly with
respect to the boom 120 while paying out the hoist ropes 142 can lower the dipper assembly 130
with respect to the boom 120. In addition, the dipper assembly 130 can be operatively associated
with one or more crowd ropes 150 that are attached proximate to the respective ends of the
dipper arm 134 and that wrap around the saddle block 136 to extend down to a crowd wench 152
rotatably disposed on the boom 120. The crowd wench 152 can rotate to pay out or take in the
crowd ropes 150 in a manner that causes the dipper arm 134 to slidably translate with respect to
the boom 120 by operation of the saddle block 136. Sequential action of the hoisting and
crowding motions with respect to the pit wall 108 crowds the dipper assembly 130 into the pit
wall 108 dislodging material and filling the dipper 132. While the foregoing description of the

                                                   -6
digging tool 110 relates to a rope-operated configuration, it will be appreciated that in other
embodiments, the digging tool 110 may be operated by other methods or processes.
[0011]     To move the dislodged material away from the pit wall 108, the upper structure 112
can swing or rotate with respect to the undercarriage 114. For example, the upper structure 112
and the undercarriage 114 may be operatively connected through a rotatable turntable or swing
platform 160 that can swing the upper structure 112 about a swing axis 162 that extends
vertically through the excavating machine 100. To provide power for the hoist system 140, hoist
and crowd wenches 146, 152, and the continuous tracks 116, the excavating machine 100
includes an electrical system 164 that receives three-phase electrical power through a trail cable
166 from an off-board electrical source and that distributes power to the various components. In
alternative embodiments, however, the excavating machine may include an on-board prime
mover such as an internal combustion engine that combusts hydrocarbon-based fuel to generate
mechanical power. To accommodate an operator and the various controls, gauges, and interfaces
for operating the excavating machine 100, an operator's station 168 can be disposed on the upper
structure 112 in a location that provides a view towards the digging tool 110.
[0012]     The in-pit crusher and conveyer ("IPCC") system 102 operates in cooperation with the
excavating machine 100 to process and transfer the material excavated from the pit wall 108. To
receive the material dispensed from the excavating machine 100, the IPCC 102 can include a
hopper 170 that is supported on an IPCC frame 174. The hopper 170 can be configured as
funnel-like structure that receives material through its opened top end and that tappers inwardly
towards its bottom end to direct the material to first conveyer 176 disposed underneath the
hopper 170. The conveyer 176 can be a flexible, closed belt that extends around and is supported
by conveyer pulleys that cause the conveyer to translate with respect to the hopper 170. To
pulverize the deposited material, the conveyer 176 can extend at an upward angle to direct
material toward the top of a material processing device 180 located behind the hopper 170. The
conveyer 176 thereby drops the excavated material into the opened top of the material processing
device 180 for processing the material by grinding or breaking it up into smaller particulates or
aggregate for easier handling. To break up the material, the material processing device 180 can
include internal gears, teeth or blades that interact to shred or masticate the deposited material
that is then dispensed from the lower end. The material processing device 180 can further include

                                                  -7
vibrators and the like to assist in processing the material. After processing, the material may be
ground or crushed into a finer grade of aggregate for easier handling and transfer.
[0013]     In an embodiment, the IPCC 102 can be configured to independently move about the
excavation site 104, for example, to follow the excavating machine 100 as the pit wall 108 shifts
in location to continue the excavation process. In particular, the IPCC frame 174 can be
supported on another plurality of continuous tracks 184 that contact and can be made to translate
with respect to the pit floor 106. However, in other embodiments, the IPCC 102 may be
stationary and require another device to move it about the excavation site 104. In a further
embodiment, to accommodate an operator and various controls and input devices for configuring
and operating the IPCC 102, an onboard operator's station 186 in the form of an indoor cab may
be disposed on and carried by the IPCC frame 174. The controls and inputs can enable
adjustment of the characteristics of the IPCC such as processing rate, pulverization grade, and
the like. However, in other embodiments the operator's station 186 can be a basic input panel
disposed at an accessible location on the IPCC frame 174.
[0014]     Referring to FIG. 2, the excavation process utilizing the excavating machine 100 and
the IPCC 102 is illustrated. The excavating machine 100 is initially oriented toward the pit wall
108 extending along the excavation site 104 with the digging tool 110 directed toward the pit
wall 108 and the IPCC 102 located generally behind the excavating machine 100. In this initial
orientation, the digging tool 110 can be crowded into the pit wall 108 to dislodge and collect
material. Because the excavating machine 100 can pivot or rotate with respect to the pit wall 108,
the excavating machine 100 is associated with a swing radius 163 that is defined by the distance
the digging tool 110 extends outwardly with respect to the swing axis 162. The IPCC 102 is
preferably located within the swing radius 163 so the excavating machine 100 can swing the
digging tool 110 away from the pit wall 100 over the hopper 170 to dispense the collected
material therein. The hopper 170 can direct the dispensed material to the material processing
device 180 that processes the material as described above while the excavating machine 100 can
swing the digging tool 110 back toward the pit wall 108 to dislodge and remove more material.
[0015]      To direct the processed material away from the excavation site 104, the IPCC 102 can
be operatively associated with a secondary conveyer system 190. In the illustrated embodiment,

                                                   -8
the secondary conveyer system 190 can include an intermediate conveyer 192 receiving the
discharged material from the IPCC 102 and a main conveyer 194 disposed in and leading from
the excavation site 104. The main conveyer 194 can be generally fixed in location while the
intermediate conveyer 192 is relatively more mobile so it can be adjusted and extended to follow
proximately with the excavating machine 100 and the IPCC 102. The intermediate conveyer 192
may start at one end proximate to the IPCC 102 to receive processed material and terminates at
the main conveyer 194 onto which it passes the processed material. The intermediate conveyer
therefore extends over a conveyer span or conveyer distance 195 within the excavation site 104.
The intermediate and main conveyers 192, 194 can be of a closed loop construction and include
closed belts, slide plates, or trays, and can be straight in alignment or can include various suitable
bends or turns. In an embodiment, the intermediate conveyer 190 can be made of a plurality of
joined sections that enables new sections to be inserted to increase its length as the IPCC 102
moves about the excavation site 104. In another embodiment, the intermediate conveyer 192 can
be a telescoping conveyer having extendable and retractable sections for selectively adjusting its
length. In addition, the secondary conveyer system 190 can be configured to elevate the
processed material from the pit floor 106 out of the excavation site 104 to a location where the
material may be more accessible.
 [0016]    In the illustrated embodiment, to increase productivity, a second excavating machine
 196 operating in conjunction with a second IPCC 198 can be included in the excavation site 100.
The second excavating machine 196 and second IPCC 198 can have the same construction or a
different design from the first excavating machine 100 and the first IPCC 102. In addition, to
direct material from the second IPCC 198 away from the excavation site 104, the second IPCC
 198 can be operatively associated with second intermediate conveyer 199 that extends to and
passes material to the main conveyer 194. The second intermediate conveyer 199 can have the
same construction as the first intermediate conveyer 192 and can extend for any suitable
distance. It should be appreciated that in addition to the second IPCC 198 and the second
intermediate conveyer 199, any additional number of IPCCs and conveyers can be included at
the excavation site 104 to increase productivity.
 [0017]    In the present embodiment, to manage and track the transfer of excavated material
about the excavation site 104, the first excavating machines 100 and the first IPCC 102 with its
associated secondary conveyer system 190 can be operatively arranged to communicate and

                                                 -9
cooperate with each other. Referring to FIG. 3, to direct the cooperative interaction between the
first excavating machine 100, first IPCC 102, and secondary conveyer system 190, the first
excavating machine 100 and the first IPCC 102 can be operatively associated with a
computerized or electronic material management system 200 that is configured to coordinate,
control, and guide cooperative operation of the devices to mange and track material. The material
management system 200 can be physically embodied as a communications network or
computerized excavation network 202 that interconnects and establishes communication to
exchange data and information between the first excavating machine 100, the first IPCC 102,
and the secondary conveyer system associated with the first IPCC; although in specific
embodiments, the material management system 200 may reside with, or be more particularly
associated with, a specific component.
[0018]     For example, to establish interaction between the first excavating machine 100 and the
excavation network 202 in a manner that maintains the material management system 200 for
execution, the first excavating machine 100 can include an electronically actuated machine
controller 210 onboard that is able to execute and process various software instructions,
programs, functions, steps, routines, tasks and processes. The machine controller 210 can be
embodied as a microprocessor, an application specific integrated circuit ("ASIC"), or other
appropriate circuitry and may have computer readable and writable memory or other data storage
capabilities. The computer readable and writable memory can include any suitable type of
electronic memory devices such as random access memory ("RAM"), read only memory
("ROM"), dynamic random access memory ("DRAM"), flash memory and the like. The
computer readable and writable memory may store data and applications such as data tables,
charts, maps, and the like saved in and executable from the memory or another electronically
accessible storage medium to assist in operation of the excavating machine 100. The machine
controller 210 may be responsible for controlling operation of other components of the
excavating machine or may be integrated with other control devices through, for example, a
CAN bus associated with the excavating machine. Although in the schematic representation of
FIG. 3, the machine controller 210 is represented as a single, discrete unit, in other embodiments,
the machine controller 210 and its functions may be distributed among a plurality of distinct and
separate components associated with the first excavating machine 100.

                                                  -10
[0019]     To enable the machine controller 210 to send, receive, and process data about the
excavation process via the excavation network 202, the machine controller 210 can be
operatively associated with any of various sensors, communication devices, and other logical or
electronic components. For example, to establish communication with the IPCC 102 and/or the
excavation network 202, a mobile machine communications device that can be in the form of a
machine receiver/transmitter 212 can be disposed on the first excavating machine 100 and is
configured to send and receive electronic signals that may be in digital or analog format. The
machine receiver/transmitter 212 can include an antenna to receive and emit signals such as radio
frequency waves. In other embodiments, the machine receiver/transmitter 212 can communicate
through other wireless technologies such as infrared, Bluetooth, optical recognition, and the like.
Furthermore, in other embodiments, the machine receiver/transmitter 212 can be configured for
wired communication by sending and receiving electrical, optical, or other forms of signals over
communications wires, busses, or fiber optics. While the present embodiment of the machine
receiver/transmitter 212 can send and receive signals, in other embodiments the machine
receiver/transmitter 212 may be limited to either receiving or transmitting, and the term
"receiver/transmitter" should be interpreted in both the conjunctive and disjunctive sense. The
machine receiver/transmitter 212 and the machine controller 210 can include or be associated
with circuitry or like to convert or interpret the sent or received signals into data and information
that can be electronically or digitally processed to facilitate operation of the excavating machine
100.
[0020]     To provide information about the location or position of the first excavating machine
100 with respect to the excavation site 104, the machine controller 210 can also be operatively
associated with a positioning device or machine position sensor 214. The machine position
sensor 214 can recognize or determine the relative position of the first excavating machine 100
with respect to other units disposed about the excavation site and can relay the machine position
data to the guidance system 200 via the machine controller 210 and the machine
transmitter/receiver 212. For example, the machine position sensor 214 can operate on a global
navigation satellite system ("GNSS") whereby the machine position data associated with the first
excavating machine 100 is triangulated from received satellite signals. However, in other
embodiments, the machine position sensor 214 can operate based on other technologies such as
ground-based systems using pseudolites, visual perception such as LIDAR, stereo, camera,
Radar, range radios, and the like.

                                                 -11
[0021]     In an embodiment, the machine position sensor 214 may be associated with a particular
part or component of the first excavating machine 100 such as, for example, the digging tool 110
to provide precise machine position data with respect to that particular component. In another
embodiment, the first excavating machine 100 can be equipped with one or more kinematic
sensors 216 that monitor and sense positional and operational information regarding the
excavating machine 100 including the digging tool 110. For example, the kinematic sensors 216
can measure the swing position or swing angle of the digging tool 110 with respect to the swing
axis 162 of the excavating machine 100 or can measure the extension of the digging tool 110
with respect to the excavating machine 100. The machine controller 210 can use the information
from the kinematic sensors 216 to determine more precisely the position and movement of the
digging tool 110 at a given time and can communicate that information to the excavation
network 202 via the machine transmitter/receiver 214. Hence, the machine position data may
reflect the precise location of the digging tool as it engages, dislodges, and gathers material from
the excavation site 104.
[0022]     To interface or interact with an operator of the first excavating machine 100, the
machine controller 210 can be operatively associated with an electronic user interface 220. The
electronic user interface 220 may be disposed at an accessible location in the operator's station
168 onboard of the excavating machine 100, although in other embodiments, it may be an off
board, handheld device configured to remotely operate the first excavating machine 100. The
electronic user interface 220 can include various components to interface with the operator such
as a display screen 222, which may be a liquid crystal display with touch screen capabilities. The
electronic user interface 220 may also include various dials, switches, or buttons 224 through
which commands may be entered. To record or log actions or events occurring with operation of
the first excavating machine 100, the electronic user interface 220 can include a clock 226 that
can measure time intervals or instances in digital or analog format.
[0023]     In an embodiment, to integrate the machine controller 210 with operation of the first
excavating machine 100, the machine controller 210 can be operatively associated with the
components used to physically direct operation of the first excavating machine 100. For
example, the machine controller 210 can be in communication with one or more input devices
228 such as joysticks, steering wheels, gear selectors, pedals, and the like by which the operator
directs movement and operation of the first excavating machine 100. Accordingly, the machine

                                                 -12
controller 210 receives current information indicating the task or operation the first excavating
machine is being directed to perform. In a further embodiment, the machine controller 210 may
also be operatively associated with the continuous tracks 116 or other traction or propulsion
devices included with the first excavating machine 100.
[0024]     To integrate the first IPCC 102 and the associated secondary conveyer system 190 with
the excavation network 202, those components may also include various electronic or logical
devices, sensors, and controls. In various embodiments, those components may be included on
the first IPCC 102, the first intermediate conveyer 194 associated with the first IPCC 102, or
may be distributed between both. For example, a first IPCC controller 240 can be disposed on
the first IPCC 102 itself and can be operatively associated with the first intermediate conveyer
194. The first IPCC controller 240 may have a similar construction, architecture, and/or
functionality as to the machine controller 210 to execute various software instructions, programs,
routines, functions, processes and the like. To enable communication with the excavation
network 202, the first IPCC controller 240 can be operatively associated with a communication
device that may also be embodied as a first IPCC transmitter/receiver 242 that can send and
receive radio frequency signals or other communication signals. To assess or determine the
location of the first IPCC 102 with respect to the excavation site 104, the first IPCC controller
240 can communicate with a first IPCC location sensor 244. The first IPCC location sensor 244
can also operate on global navigation satellite positioning ("GNSS") technology or any other
suitable positioning technology and can provide updated information regarding the position of
the first IPCC 102 especially if it relocates with respect to pit walls 108 within the excavation
site 104.
[0025]     To track the material received by the first IPCC 102 from the first excavating machine
100, the first IPCC 102 controller can be in communication with a first speed sensor 246 that
measures the travel speed of the first intermediate conveyer 192. Specifically, the first speed
sensor 246 can measure the speed at which the conveyer belt, or the pulleys and sprockets
responsible for translating the conveyer belt, translates with respect to the first IPCC 102 to
determine the speed the first intermediate conveyer 192 is moving material from the first IPCC
102 about the excavation site 104. The first speed sensor 246 can be configured as a frictional
roller sensor in rolling contact with some moving part of the first intermediate conveyer 192, a
magnetic pickup sensor sensing the strength of a magnet moving thereby, an optical sensor, or

                                                  -13
can have any other suitable configuration and can output the conveyer speed in meters-per
minute (mpm), miles per hours (mph), or any other suitable unit.
[0026]     In addition to the first speed sensor 246, the first IPCC controller 240 can be
operatively associated with one or more first IPCC sensors 248 to measure other parameters,
characteristics, and settings of the first IPCC 102 and/or the first intermediate conveyer 192,
such as the weight or volume of material being processed and transferred, or the granularity of
the material after processing. To interface with an operator, the first IPCC controller 240 can
communicate with an electronic user interface 250 that also includes a display device 252 such
as an LCD screen and one or more dials, switches, and buttons 254 to interact with the operator.
The dials, switch, and buttons 254 may allow an operator to input operational commands, such
as setting the conveyer speed for the first intermediate conveyer 192 or setting the processing
rate of the first IPCC 102. In an embodiment, the first IPCC sensor 248 and/or the electronic user
interface 250 can determine or receive the present length or distance of the first intermediate
conveyer 192 which maybe update if the conveyer distance changes. To record time intervals or
instances that may be associated with various actions undertaken by the first IPCC 102, the first
IPCC controller 240 can be associated with a first IPCC clock 256 that may be displayed on the
display device 252.
[0027]     In the embodiments in which a second IPCC 198 and a second intermediate conveyer
199 are included at the excavation site 104, the second IPCC 198 can be operatively associated
with a second IPCC controller 260 that may have the same or similar architectural configuration
as the first IPCC controller 240. Specifically, the second IPCC controller 260 can include a
communication device configured as a second IPCC receiver/transmitter 262 to exchange
communication signal with the excavation network 202. To determine the relative location of the
second IPCC 198 with respect to excavation site 104 and other units thereabout, a second IPCC
location sensor 264 can be included with the second IPCC 198 to receive and triangulate satellite
signals or can utilize other positioning technologies. The second IPCC controller 260 can also
measure the speed of the second intermediate conveyer 199 or another conveyer associated with
the second 198 IPCC using a second speed sensor 266. To measure or sense other characteristics,
parameters, and setting of the second IPCC 198 and/or the associated second intermediate
conveyer 199, a second IPCC sensor 268 can be operatively associated with the second IPCC
controller 260.

                                                  -14
[0028]     To interface with an operator, the second IPCC controller 260 can also be operatively
associated with a second electronic user interface 270 that can include a second display device
272 and one or more dials, switches, and buttons 274 for inputting commands and settings such
as conveyer speed, processing rate or setting the conveyer distance of the second intermediate
conveyer 199. The second electronic user interface 270 can also include a second clock 276 that
enables the second IPCC controller 260 to record temporal events or actions occurring with
respect to the second IPCC 198 or the associated second intermediate conveyer 199. It should be
appreciated that in embodiments where additional excavating machines, IPCCs, and conveyers
are present at the excavation site, they may be similarly configured with electronic and logical
devices and sensors to communicate and interact with the excavation network 202.
[0029]     To integrate and administer the material management system 200, the excavation
network 202 can also be communicatively linked with a base station 290 that may be physically
present at the excavation site 104 and can include various computer systems and peripheral
devices for functionally executing various networking management tasks. For example, the base
station can electronically store comprehensive excavation site data 292 such as terrain data,
excavation plans, material locations and the like. The excavation site data 292 may stored in an
electronically readable format in a database or the like at the excavation base station 290 and can
be transmitted and supplemented by data exchanges over the excavation network 202. In an
embodiment, the excavation site data 292 can include information from topographic or terrain
excavation maps 294 regarding the location, by coordinates or otherwise, of the different types of
material present at the excavation site 104. For example, the excavation maps 294 can identify
the locations of coal, ore or mineral deposits at the excavation site 104 or can indicate if a certain
location consists primarily of overburden. The excavation maps 294 can be three-dimensional to
reflect the depth of the different materials at a particular location. Information for the excavation
maps 294 can be gathered by pre-excavation scouting and exploration of the excavation site 104.
The base station 290 can also receive, store, and exchange data signals and electronic
information between the excavating machine 100, the first and second IPCCs 102, 198, and other
devices connected through the excavation network 202. In addition, the base station 290 and the
logic devices located thereat can be operatively associated with suitable inputs and interfaces to
enable operators to interact with the excavation network 202, for example, by updating or
monitoring excavation site data 292. In an alternative embodiment, the excavation network 202
may be decentralized and operate on a peer-to-peer network architecture.

                                                 -15
Industrial Applicability
[0030]     The foregoing material management system 200 can be used to track and manage the
progress or transfer of excavated material through the excavation site 104 and more specifically
to associate and record information regarding distinguishable batches of excavated material.
Referring to FIG. 4, there is an illustrated embodiment of a process 300 or series of processes for
executing the material management system 300, which can be embodied as software including
instructions and commands written in computer-executable programming code. In accordance
with the disclosure and with reference to FIGS. 2, 3, and 4, the process 300 can start with a
material removal step 302 in which the excavating machine digs and removes material from the
excavation site 104 with the digging tool 110.
[0031]     To determine the specific location at the excavating site where the material is removed
from, the process 300 in a receive position step 304 can receive excavating machine position data
306 associated with the location of the excavating machine and preferably with the location of
the digging tool 110 as it engages material. Specifically, the machine position sensor 214 can
monitor and generate the machine position data 306 that can be transmitted to the material
management system 200 via the machine receiver/transmitter 212 over the excavation network
202. The excavating machine position data 306 may be measured in coordinates such as
longitude or latitude or by another suitable designation and may reflect the kinematic motions of
the digging tool during a digging operation. In an optional embodiment, the process 300
associated with the material management system 200 can also include a step of receiving and
recording operator observed information 308 transmitted from the machine receiver/transmitter
212 disposed on the excavating machine 100. Operator observed information 308 can include
any noted observations about the quality or characteristic of the material made by the operator of
the excavating machine 100 at the time of digging, which can be input through the electronic
user interface 220 on the excavating machine 100 and, in a receiving and recording step 309, can
be received and recorded by the material management system 200 for subsequent use.
[0032]     To assess other characteristics or aspects associated with the excavated material, the
process 300 in a comparison step 310 can compare the machine position data 306 with
excavation site data 292 that can be received from the base station 290. The excavation site data
292 may include the excavation maps 294, which may have information associating specific

                                                  -16
locations about the excavation site 104 with various characteristics or attributes of the excavated
material. This data may include the grade or type of the material at the material removal position,
such as identifying the material as ore, mineral, coal, or overburden, which may be known
through pre-excavation exploration. Other information may include material consistency, volume
percentages, or impurities.
[0033]     To associate the excavating machine position data 306 and any retrieved excavation
site data 292 with the material, the process 300 in a data reception step 312 can receive and
record a dispensing time 314 and/or processing rate 316 transmitted from the excavating
machine 100 or the first IPCC 102 respectively. The dispensing time 314 may reflect the relevant
time the excavating machine 100 dispenses material from the digging tool 110 to the hopper 170
of the first IPCC 102 and the processing rate 316 may reflect how quickly the first IPCC 102
processes and discharges material to the first intermediate conveyer 192.
[0034]     In a material identification step 320, the process 300 can use the dispensing time 314
and the processing rate 316 to distinguish the processed material into identified material batches.
In a specific embodiment, the material identification step 320 can associate the time the material
enters and/or is discharged from the first IPCC to distinguish individual and distinct batches of
material that are deposited on the first intermediate conveyer 192. The identified material batches
can be further associated with a unique identification number or the like to enable the material
management system 200 to continuously track the identified material batches during transfers
through the excavation site 104. It can be appreciated the quantity of material in each identified
material batch may correspond to the capacity of the digging tool for each dig or scoop, although
in other embodiments the quantities may differ.
[0035]     After the process 300 has distinguished the material discharged from the IPCC 102 into
identified material batches, the material management system 200 in a data association step 322
can associate data about material information with the individual identified material batches. For
example, the material information may include the location or position where the material in the
identified material batches was obtained from the excavation site, which can be determined from
the excavating machine position data 306 and which can be provided in longitude, latitude, and
depth. Also, from the comparison step 310 and the excavation site data 292, the association step

                                                 -17
322 can associate material information such as material type, material grade, and other material
information gathered by the material management system 200. Also, based on the known volume
of the dipper, or if the IPCC sensor is configured to measure mass or granularity, the association
step 322 can associate material information regarding mass, volume, or granularity data with the
individual identified material batches. Processing conditions occurring in the IPCC may also be
assigned to the identified material batches. The granularity of the material information can be
maintained to the level of individual loads or dispensed volumes from the excavating machine
100.
[0036]     To continue tracking the identified material batches after they have been distinguished
and begin being conveyed along the first intermediate conveyer 192, the process 300 in another
data recordation step 324 can receive and record conveyer speed data 326 and conveyer distance
328 reflecting the distance or length of the intermediate conveyer 192. The conveyer speed data
326 can be determined by the speed sensor 246 associated with the first IPCC 102 and the
conveyer distance 328 can be input through electronic user interface 250 or otherwise recorded
at, for example, the base station 290. The conveyer speed data 326 and the conveyer distance
data 328 are related to the travel time of the indentified material batches on the intermediate
conveyer 192 according to the following equation:
(Eqn 1.) Travel Time 328    = Conveyer Distance 328 / Conveyer speed 326
[0037]     Accordingly, by applying Eqn. 1 in an application step 330, the process 300 can track
the progress of the identified material batches along the conveyer route in a tracking step 332.
Furthermore, the material management system 200 can determine when the identified material
batches will be discharged at the end of the intermediate conveyer 192, for example, onto
another conveyer such as the main conveyer 194. In the event the identified material batches are
discharge to main conveyer 194, the process 300 in another data recordation step 340 can receive
additional data regarding conveyer speed 342 and conveyer distance 344 associated with the
main conveyer 194. Accordingly, the material management system 200 may in continued
tracking step 346 utilize Eqn. 1 to continue tracking and tracing the identified material batches
along the main conveyer 194 to an extraction point or processing site where the material exits the
excavation site 104.

                                                  -18
[0038]     Hence, by using Eqn. 1 and recording the relevant travel times, the material
management system 200 can track and trace the identified batches moving through the secondary
conveyer system 190 without the use of technologies such as RFID or barcodes. The material
management system 200 can further determine when the distinct identified material batches will
exit the excavation site 104. Further, the excavating machine position data 306 regarding the
excavation location, any operator observed information 308, and any relevant excavation site
data 292 remains associated with the individually indentified material batches and can be used
for sorting or further processing the excavated material. It will be appreciated that the process
300 can be applied in the embodiments that include a second IPCC 198 and second intermediate
conveyer 199 to individually distinguish and track identified material batches from those units as
well. Further, the material management system 200 can facilitate operation of the plurality of
conveyers about the excavation site 104, for example, by speeding up or slowing down select
conveyers to prevent the identified material batches from becoming commingled and losing the
data associations.
