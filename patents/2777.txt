15                                     BACKGROUND
                   The present invention relates generally to fastener driving tools, and
    more specifically to such a tool having a pre-pressurized power delivery source.
                   Power tools for use in driving fasteners into work pieces are known
20  in the art. Such tools can be operated by a variety of power sources, including
   pneumatic, combustion, electric or powder-activated power sources.              In some
   power tools, the power source is integrated with a housing of the tool for easy
   portability. Other applications require power to be fed with a feed line from an
    external source, such as pneumatic tools operated by an air compressor.
                                                1

                   Fastener driving tools of this type, and particularly pneumatically
   powered tools, include a metal housing and a magazine portion that is attached to
   the housing and/or the handle.         Generally, the magazine retains a supply of
   fasteners which are fed to a drive track in the housing configured for receiving and
 5 guiding a fastener as it is driven by a reciprocating piston and driver blade from
   the drive track into a work piece.
                   A suitable pneumatically powered fastener-driving tool with a
   portable power source is disclosed in US Patent No. 6,876,379, which is
   incorporated by reference. In such a tool, the tool housing defines a main chamber
10 having a cylinder for accommodating reciprocation of the driver blade and piston.
   The driving stroke of the piston moves a driver blade in the drive track that
   impacts a fastener to drive the fastener into a work piece. The piston is powered
   by a pneumatic power source, most preferably a portable container or vessel of
   compressed gas such as carbon dioxide or the like, which forces the piston in a
15 driving direction under operator control through pulling of a trigger. The piston
   also configured to be oppositely driven by a partial vacuum or other known
   apparatus in a return stroke to the retracted or pre-driving position.
                   One drawback of conventional tools of this type is that the
   mechanical mechanism used to trigger and power the fastener driving power cycle
20 is relatively inefficient in the use of the limited supply of compressed gas. A main
   result is that the operational life of such tools is relatively short and unacceptable
                                                2

   to many users.      As such, this type of tool has had a limited commercial
   application.
                                       SUMMARY
 5
                  The present, preferably pressurized fluid-powered fastener driving
   tool addresses the drawbacks of previous tools of this type and features an
   electrical control circuit or program connected to a solenoid valve for more
   accurate dosing of the compressed fluid, preferably a gas, used to power the tool.
10 The control program, preferably incorporated in a microprocessor, is connected to
   the solenoid valve to control the flow of fluid to a piston and driver blade for
   driving a fastener. A periodic opening of the solenoid under electrical control
   enhances the efficient use of the compressed fluid in the container. The opening
   time (which can be user adjustable) results in a quantity of fluid being introduced
15 into the drive cylinder to act upon the drive piston and subsequently drive the
   fastener. The tool is optionally configured for returning the piston via an urging
   member using energy stored during the driving stroke, or by re-directing the drive
   gas volume to the underside of the drive piston. Alternately, a small amount of
   additional fluid may be directed to the underside of the piston to accomplish
20 return.    A combination of two or more of the described methods is also
   contemplated.
                  In addition, the compressed gas used to drive the piston and driver
   blade in the fastener driving process is optionally retained in the tool and recycled
                                             3

   for both returning the piston to the initial position and for use in driving
   subsequent fasteners.     This return may be supplemented or replaced by a
   mechanical return such as a resilient bumper and a return spring. As a result, the
   portable compressed fluid supply in the present tool lasts longer than conventional
 5 tools.
                 Another feature of the present fastener-driving tool relates to the
   operational attribute of such compressed power sources, in that the container
   includes a supply of pressurized liquid along with the supply of compressed gas.
   When the tool is designed to be powered by compressed gas, in the event the
10 liquid flows into the tool, performance is impeded. To address this problem, the
   compressed power source is provided with an anti-siphon device for preventing
   the flow of compressed liquid into the tool.       Such an anti-siphon device is
   designed for use in either a reusable or a disposable pressurized container. In
   some embodiments, the anti-siphon tube is provided with specialized structures for
15 impeding the flow of pressurized liquid into the tube, including a drip shelf, a
   bottom end with a restricted opening, and a depending protective ring.
                 More specifically, a pressurized fluid container is provided for use
   with a fastener-driving tool, the container having an outer shell defining an inner
   chamber, having an open neck and an effective height, a closure sealingly engaged
20 on the open neck, and a tube depending from the closure.
                 In another embodiment, a driver tool powered by compressed gas is
   provided, including a magazine for storing and supplying fasteners to a tool nose,
                                             4

   a cylinder with a reciprocating piston attached to a driver blade, and a compressed
   gas container being in fluid communication with the reciprocating piston and
   having an anti-siphon tube.
                  In still another embodiment, a pressurized fluid container is
 5 provided. The container includes an outer shell defining an inner chamber, having
   an open neck and an effective height, a closure sealingly engaged on the open
   neck, a flexible tube depending from the closure, and a float attached to a free end
   of the tube and in contact with a liquid phase of a fluid in the container.

                               DETAILED DESCRIPTION
                 Referring now to FIG. 1, a suitable prior art fastener-driving tool that
   is compatible with the present invention is generally designated 10. This tool is
   described in greater detail in commonly-assigned US Patent No. 6,786,379 which
15 is incorporated by reference. However, it is also contemplated that the present
   invention is applicable in other types of pneumatically powered fastener-driving
   tools that are well known in the art, and is not limited to the illustrated
   embodiment.     The tool 10 includes a grip frame or housing 12, made of a variety
   of materials, but preferably metal to withstand the forces generated by pressurized
20 gas contained within.    It is contemplated that the housing 12 be provided in a
   variety of configurations, both enclosed and open, frame-style to provide a
   mounting point for the various tool components discussed below. Included in the
                                              6

   housing 12 is a handle 14, and a tool nose 16 having a shear block and defining an
   outlet 18 for the passage of fasteners 20 into a work piece. It is also contemplated
   that the housing 12 may take a variety of shapes and optionally partially, rather
   than completely encloses at least some of the tool components.
 5                A fastener storage device or magazine 22 retains a supply of the
   fasteners 20 and includes a biasing element (not shown) for urging the fasteners
   toward the nose 16.        While a strip-style magazine 22 is depicted, other
   conventional fastener storage device types are contemplated, including but not
   limited to rotary or coil magazines.
10                Preferably removably secured to the magazine 22 for support and
   replacement purposes is a portable vessel or container 24 of pressurized fluid,
   which is contemplated as being a pressurized gas, preferably carbon dioxide (CO 2 )
   or nitrous oxide (N2 0).     Other pressurized gases are contemplated, including
   nitrogen (N2) and air.     The following description of a preferred embodiment
15 utilizes self contained pre-pressurized CO 2 in a two-phase mixture as the power
   source.   An advantage of using a two-phase mixture of CO 2 is that when the
   mixture is stored in the removable container 24 that is in equilibrium and has two
   phases of CO 2 remaining in the vessel, a constant pressure of the gas phase is
   maintained. That is, as gaseous CO 2 is removed from the vessel 24 to power the
20 fastener-driving tool 10, liquid CO 2 changes to a gas phase to replace lost gaseous
   CO 2 and maintain a constant pressure in the vessel. Another advantage of using a
   pressurized power source such as CO 2 is that, due to the relatively high pressure of
                                              7

   the gas (in the range of 800 psi), the number and size of the moving tool parts can
   be reduced.    This reduces the likelihood of experiencing a mechanical failure,
   simplifies repairs, and lowers the overall manufacturing costs.            It is also
   contemplated that the tool 10 is optionally powered by the pressurized liquid phase
 5 of CO 2. Fluid communication between the gas container 24 and an inner chamber
   26 of the housing 12 is effected by a conduit 28, here a flexible hose; however
   other conduits are contemplated, as well as a direct connection between the
   container 24 and the housing 12.       An optional adjustable regulator 30 reduces
   pressure within the inner chamber 26 to approximately 400 psi or other pressures
10 as known to those skilled in the art.
                  A pneumatic engine 32         includes a cylinder 34 enclosing a
   reciprocating piston 36 attached to a driver blade 38.            Depending on the
   application, the piston 36 and the drive blade 38 are separate parts fastened
   together or are integrally joined. As is known in the art, reciprocation of the driver
15 blade 38 in a passageway (not shown) defined by the tool nose 16 drives fasteners
   20 out the outlet 18.     Compressed gas provided by the container 24 fills and
   pressurizes the inner chamber 26.
                  A mechanical linkage controls the flow of compressed fluid within
   the inner chamber and powers the reciprocal action of the piston 36 and the driver
20 blade 38.    Included in this linkage is a pivoting trigger 40 which is biased,
   preferably by a spring 42, or by magnets or other known structures. A trigger arm
   44 engages a biased sear 46 which in turn releases a biased activating bolt or valve
                                             8

   opening member 48 that is held in place by the internal pneumatic pressure of the
   inner chamber 26. A trigger piston 50 at an end of the valve-opening member 48
   engages a respective stem 52 of a counter-biased control valve 54 for periodically
   opening a supply port 56 for pressurizing the piston 36 to initiate a fastener
 5 driving cycle.
                  As is known in the art, as the piston 36 is driven down the cylinder
   34, pressurized gas is vented through escape ports 58 in communication with a
   return chamber 60 that temporarily stores the pressurized gas which is then used to
   return the piston 36 to the start position depicted in FIG. 1. Pressurized gas can
10 also be provided directly from the container 24 for assisting in return of the piston
   36. Piston return is also facilitated by a resilient rubber-like bumper 62 located at
   an end of the cylinder 34 closest to the tool nose 16. As the piston 36 returns to
   the start position, gas ahead of the piston is vented to atmosphere from the
   cylinder through a main port 64, which also receives the pressurized gas released
15 by the control valve 54 at the beginning of the driving cycle. It has been found
   that the above-described system is relatively inefficient in the use of pressurized
   gas, and thus limits the operational life of the gas container 24 and impairs the
   commercial adaptability of the tool 10.
                  Referring now to FIG. 2, the present pneumatic drive system is
20 incorporated into a fastener-driving tool generally designated 70.      Components
   shared with the tool 10 are designated with identical reference numbers.         The
   present fastener driver tool 70 includes the following major component groups.
                                              9

   These are: the fluid storage vessel 24, the pressure regulator 30, an electro
   mechanical solenoid valve 72, the drive cylinder 34 and the piston 36, associated
   electrical control system, program or control circuitry (all three are considered
   equivalent or synonymous) 74 and the conventional magazine 22 and the
 5 associated fastener feeder mechanism.
                 An important feature of the present tool 70 relates to the use of the
   control circuitry 74 that is operatively associated with the housing 12 and is
   configured for electrically controlling a flow of compressed fluid for driving the
   piston 36. In the preferred embodiment, this control is achieved by at least one
10 microprocessor 76 or similar control module powered by a power source 78,
   preferably a battery or other conventional power source, and preferably having a
   user interface 80. The battery 78 and the interface 80 are preferably connected to
   the control system 76 via wiring 82, or optionally wirelessly, as feasible.       The
   electro-magnetic solenoid valve 72 is electrically connected to the control system
15 76 via the wiring 82 and is operationally disposed relative to the supply port 56 or
   the main port 64 as is known in the art of pneumatic power technology for directly
   controlling the flow of pressurized fluid to the piston 36.
                  Through the user interface 80, the user can adjust the performance of
   the tool 70, including among other things the duration of energization time of the
20 solenoid valve 72.    Depending on the application, additional energization time
   provides more driving power to the fastener 20 which may be needed for longer
   fasteners and/or for harder substrates. As is known in the art, the user interface 80
                                             10

   may include a visual display, LED indicators, a touch screen, user actuated buttons
   and similar control interfaces.
                  In the tool 70, the pressurized fluid container 24 is directly
   connected to the tool housing 12 through a fitting 86 that in turn is in fluid
 5 communication with the regulator 30.         Thus, the conduit 28 is eliminated as
   shown, but is contemplated as an option in the event the user wishes to personally
   carry the container 24 to reduce the weight of the tool 70. An outlet 88 of the
   regulator 30 is in fluid communication with a solenoid intake tube 90. If desired,
   a pressure sensor and gauge 92 is optionally located in the relatively low-pressure
10 intake tube 90, and/or at the relatively high pressure mounting fitting 86 for
   monitoring pneumatic pressure between the container 24 and the intake tube 90.
   As is the case in the tool 10, the regulator 30 is adjustable for changing operational
   pressures as needed.
                  A further feature of the present tool 70 is that the control system 74
15 is optionally programmed to receive and compare pressure data from the
   respective pressure sensors/gauges 92 located in the flow path before and after the
   regulator 30, the gauges respectively identified as 92a and 92b.          Each of the
   gauges 92a, 92b is electrically connected to the control system 74, and the micro
   processor 76 is configured to compare the transmitted pressure data. In the event
20 both gauges transmit a similar pressure value, the significance is that the container
   24 is close to being empty, and the user has a limited number of fasteners that can
   be driven before a refill container is obtained. The control system 74 is configured
                                              11

   such that the user interface 80 displays or emits an alarm to the user to replace the
   container 24.   It is contemplated that the alarm is visual and/or audible and/or
   sensory. The precise pressure value that triggers the alarm may vary to suit the
   situation.
 5               Another feature of the tool 70 is that the trigger 40 is electrically
   connected to the control system 74 through a switch 94, which is preferably a
   micro switch or similar switching device, such as an optical or magnetically
   triggered switch, and suitable wiring 82.      Upon closing of the switch 94, the
   control system 74 energizes the solenoid valve 72 for periodically opening and
10 allowing a dose of pressurized fluid from the container 24. The period of time of
   energization of the valve 72 is user adjustable via the user interface 80.
                 Also, as is common in fastener driving tools, the nose 16 is equipped
   with a reciprocating work piece contact element (WCE) 96 that retracts relative to
   the nose 16 to permit the driving of a fastener 20. In the tool 70, the WCE 96 is
15 electrically connected to a switch 98, similar to the switch 94 and preferably a
   micro switch or similar switch that is triggered by WCE movement, such as
   magnetically or optically, for sending a signal to the control system 74.
   Preferably, the microprocessor 76 is programmed so that the solenoid valve 72
   will open only when the switches 94 and 98 are closed or otherwise energized.
20 The specific order of energization of the switches 94, 98 may vary to suit the
   desired operation of the tool 70.         For so-called sequential operation, the
   microprocessor 76 is configured such that the switch 98 is energized before the
                                             12

   micro switch 94. Alternatively, in so-called repetitive operation, the micro switch
   94 is energized before the micro switch 98.              The microprocessor 76 is
   programmed to provide a sufficient energization time for the solenoid valve 72 to
   enable the piston 36 to reach the opposite end of the cylinder 34 adjacent the
 5 bumper 62. At the expiration of the allotted time period, the valve 72 is then
   closed, shutting off the flow of pressurized gas and enabling piston return.
                  To enhance piston return at the end of the driving cycle, in addition
   to the bumper 62 and pneumatic return, the present tool 70 is optionally equipped
   with an in-cylinder return spring 100 which biases the piston 36 to the start
10 position shown in FIG. 2.    Preferably, the return spring 100 is of the helical type
   which surrounds the driver blade 38; however other configurations                  are
   contemplated.     The biasing force of the spring 100 is selected so as not to
   appreciably impair the driving force of the piston 36. As the piston 36 is returned,
   any residual gas above or in front of the piston is vented to atmosphere through an
15 exhaust port 102 in the solenoid valve 72.
                                Still another feature of the tool 70 is at least one tool
   condition indicator 104, shown on the user interface 80; however other locations
   are contemplated, including on the housing 12. The tool condition indicators 104
   are contemplated to include at least one of a visual indicator, an audible indicator,
20 and a tactile indicator, such as a vibrating indicator.      In the case of a visual
   indicator for the condition indicator 104, the indicator is contemplated to be in the
   form of at least one of a single LED, an LED bank and a screen.           Information
                                              13

   displayed or indicated by the indicator 104 includes tool temperature, number of
   fasteners remaining, status of battery charge, total fasteners driven, internal tool
   pressure, fastener driving pressure (regulator adjustment), or the like.
                   Referring now to FIGs. 3, 4A and 4B, when gas such as CO 2 is used
 5 as the power source, it is important for efficiency and power consistency to
   prevent liquid CO 2 from entering the inner chamber 26.        Anti-siphon tubes are
   known in the art. These are typically installed in the vessel or container 24, which
   is often refillable, and are bent from a central axis vessel according to the desired
   bottle orientation. This requires "clocking" the tube after determining where the
10 valve attachment threads stop on the top of the vessel. Proper orientation of the
   anti-siphon tube is a lengthy process and does not provide liquid free flow in all
   vessel orientations. Also, if the bent angle of the tube is improperly positioned,
   pressurized liquid may enter the tube, depending on the orientation of the tool.
   This problem is more prevalent when the tool 70 is used at odd angles for driving
15 fasteners in areas with limited access.
                   Accordingly, the pressurized fluid vessel or container 24 is
   preferably supplied with a tube 106, preferably an anti-siphon tube configured for
   depending into an interior chamber 108 of the tube.        The purpose of the anti
   siphon tube 106 is to prevent the flow of pressurized gas such as CO 2 in the liquid
20 phase from being drawn into the tool inner chamber 26 or into the regulator 30
   where it has been found to impair tool performance. This problem has been found
   to occur more frequently when conventional tools 10 are used at an angle to
                                             14

   vertical, or are even inverted from the orientation depicted in FIG. 1. Preferably,
   the length of the anti-siphon tube 106 is approximately     3 3 % to 6 6 % of an effective
   interior axial length "A" of the container 24. More preferably, the length of the
   siphon tube 106 is approximately 5 0% of the effective interior axial length "A" of
 5 the container 24. It is contemplated that the length of the anti-siphon tube 106 is
   variable depending on the amount of liquid phase fluid in the container 24 at the
   initial or fill condition or state. Depending on the application, the tube 106 may be
   a siphon tube and thus extends almost the full effective length "A" at 106' (FIG. 8
   shown in phantom) of the container 24 and into a liquid phase of the pressurized
10 fluid.
                    More specifically, the pressurized gas in the container 24 is depicted
   as being in a gas phase 110 and a liquid phase 112. As the tool 10 is angled, the
   tendency for the liquid phase 112 to enter the intake conduit 28 or equivalent
   connection fitting 86 is increased. Accordingly, the present anti-siphon tube 106
15 is preferably provided with structure for impeding the flow of the liquid phase 112
   into the tube.     In the preferred embodiment, this structure takes the form of a
   flared, generally conical drip shelf 114 formed at a free end of the tube 106, a
   substantially closed bottom 116 with a relatively small intake opening 118, and at
   least one depending annular protective shield 120. These structures combine to
20 impede the entry of pressurized gas in the liquid phase 112 into the tube 106. In
   addition, the anti-siphon tube 106 is provided with a tubular shank 122 used to
                                               15

   calculate the desired length relative to the container effective length "A,"
   regardless of whether or not the drip shelf 114 and the shield 102 are provided.
                  Opposite the intake opening 118, the anti-siphon tube 106 is
   connected to a closure 124 taking the form of a plug that sealingly engages an
 5 open neck 126 of the container 24. As shown, and particularly for use in refillable
   containers 24, the plug 124 is threadably engaged on the neck 126; however other
   attachment technologies are contemplated to retain the gas within the container 24
   at the desired pressure.
                  As seen in FIGs. 5 and 6, as the container 24 is angled or inverted,
10 the latter position often used for refilling the container, the configuration of the
   anti-siphon tube 106 prevents the unwanted intake of pressurized gas in the liquid
   phase 112.
                  Referring now to FIGs. 7 and 8, an alternate embodiment of the
   container 24 is generally designated 130. Components shared with the container
15 24 are designated with identical reference numbers. The main difference between
   the containers 24 and 130 is that the former is refillable, and the latter is
   disposable. As such, the container 130 has a closure 132 taking the form of a cap
   that is sealably secured to the open neck 126.        The anti-siphon tube 106 is
   fastened, as by welding, chemical adhesive, integrally formed such as by molding
20 drawing of metal or the like to the cap 132, and depends into an internal chamber
   134 of the container 130 defined by an outer shell 136.
                                             16

                 As described above in relation to the container 24, the anti-siphon
   tube 106 extends between about 33% and       66 % of the effective height "A" of the
   container, and more specifically about     5 0%  of the effective height, but being
   variable as described above.     For the purposes of the present invention, the
 5 "effective height" is measured internally from a bottom upward to a point where a
   largest diameter of the container 24 begins to narrow towards the neck 126. This
   length has been found to reduce the tendency for pressurized liquid within the
   container 130 to enter the tube. To support the tube 106 within the chamber 134, a
   bulkhead 138 extends radially from the tube and contacts an inner wall 140 of the
10 chamber in a body portion 142 of the container.
                  Referring now to FIGs. 8 and 10, the cap 132 is preferably frangible,
   and, as is known in the art, is pierced by a pointed puncture device 144 in fluid
   communication with the inner housing chamber 26 by a conduit 28 or equivalent
   structure. It is contemplated that in the container 130, the tube 106 is optionally
15 provided with at least one of the conical drip shelf 114, the substantially closed
   bottom end 116, the restricted opening 118 and the depending protective ring 120
   as seen in FIGs. 4A, 4B.
                  Referring now to FIG. 9, an alternate embodiment of the container
   130 is generally designated 150. Components shared with the containers 24 and
20 130 are designated with identical reference numbers. A main difference between
   the containers 130 and 150 is that the latter has a bulkhead 152 extending radially
   from the anti-siphon tube 106 and engaging the inner wall 138 of the chamber 134
                                            17

   in the region of the neck 126, as opposed to the body portion 142. The container
   150 is also optionally equipped with at least one of the conical drip shelf 114, the
   substantially closed bottom end 116, the restricted opening 118 and the depending
   protective ring 120 as seen in FIGs. 4A, 4B.
 5                In the present tool 70 configured for sequential operation, the
   fastener driving cycle sequence is as follows with the tool at rest and a compressed
   gas vessel 24 attached. Next, the operator places the WCE 96 against the work
   surface and pulls the trigger 40. The switch 94 is electrically connected to the
   trigger 40, and once activated or energized, signals control circuitry or equivalent
10 programming in the control system or microprocessor 76 to activate the firing
   sequence.
                  A signal is sent from the control circuit to open the solenoid valve
   72. Upon opening, the valve 72 allows pressurized gas to flow from the container
   24 to the regulator 30 where the pressure is reduced (typically to 80-500 psi). The
15 gas then flows through the now open solenoid valve 72 and into the drive cylinder
   34. Upon receipt of the flow of pressurized gas, the drive piston 36 then descends,
   comes in contact with the next fastener 20 to be driven, and then subsequently
   drives the fastener into the work surface.
                  If so equipped, the return spring 100 or other energy storing device
20 installed on the underside of the piston 36 compresses to provide energy to urge
   the piston back to the initial position after the drive cycle is complete.     Upon
   expiration of the control timing signal, adjustable via the user interface 80, the
                                              18

   solenoid valve 72 closes, shutting off the supply of gas to the piston 36. It is
   contemplated that the valve 72 is closed before the piston 36 has completed its
   travel down the cylinder 34. Upon descending to the bottom of the cylinder 34,
   the piston 36 is returned to the initial position by the stored energy in the return
 5 spring 100.     Alternately or in addition to the return spring 100, the partially
   expanded gas in the cylinder 34 above the piston 36 is allowed to exit from the
   cylinder volume above the piston and be routed to the underside of the piston. The
   solenoid valve 72 is allowed, through the exhaust valve 102, to vent the volume
   above the piston 36 to atmospheric pressure and to allow the force under the piston
10 (spring, gas pressure or combination) to displace the piston back to the top of the
   cylinder 34.
                   Repetitive operation is also contemplated with the second switch 98
   connected to the WCE 96. The control circuitry is set to the contact fire mode.
   The switch 98, in communication with the WCE 96, is activated by the operator
15 pressing the WCE against the work surface after the trigger switch 94 is first
   activated. At this point, the driving sequence is initiated.
                   The disclosed anti-siphon tube 106 has a length of between 33% and
   66% (50% length preferred for a fluid charge having less than 50% liquid charge
   in an initial state of the vessel 24) of the effective length "A" of the interior of the
20 typical cylindrical vessel 24, and is preferably installed on the container axis. It
   will be understood that the length of the anti-siphon tube 106 is adjustable
   depending on the amount of liquid in the vessel at the initial, filled stage or
                                               19

   condition. The described tube 106 allows the vessel 24 to be placed in virtually
   any orientation and exclude liquid from passing out of the vessel.         With the
   addition of the drip shelf 114, liquid would be further excluded from entering the
   tube 106 after the vessel 24 is tipped over and then subsequently righted. The
 5 present tube end, including components 114, 116, 118, 120 prevents drops flowing
   down the tube from entering the tube inlet 118.
                  Referring now to FIG. 11, another alternate embodiment of the
   present vessel is depicted and generally designated 160. Components shared with
   the vessel of 150 of FIG. 9, as well as the vessels 24 and 130 are designated with
10 identical reference numbers. A significant difference of the vessel 160 from the
   others described above is that it is designed for applications where the desired
   fluid for operating the tool is the liquid phase 112.      Dedicated features of the
   vessel 160 include providing a siphon tube 162 at least partially in a flexible
   format, such as manufactured of plastic or rubber tubing.        In the embodiment
15 depicted in FIG. 11, an upper portion of the tube 162 preferably passes through the
   bulkhead 152; however it is also contemplated to attach the tube directly to an
   underside of the cap 132.
                  In addition, a float 164 is fastened to a free end 166 of the siphon
   tube 162. The float 164 is made of a buoyant material as is known in the art, and
20 is provided with an internal passageway 168 in fluid communication with the
   siphon tube 162 and having an inlet 170 in contact with the liquid fluid 112 in the
   vessel. The siphon tube 162 is provided in a sufficient length so that despite a
                                             20

   wide variety of levels of liquid fluid 112 in the vessel 160, the float 164 will
   maintain contact with the liquid fluid to maintain a constant flow into the tube. It
   is also contemplated that the tube 162 is optionally an anti-siphon tube, in which
   case the inlet 170 is plugged and an alternate anti-siphon port 172 is provided that
 5 is in communication with gas phase 110 within the container 160.
                  Another feature of the vessel 160 is that the cap 132 is made of a
   metal disk fastened to the outer shell 136, as by welding or the like. To enhance
   the sealing relationship of the vessel 160 with the associated fitting on the tool 10,
   70, at least one sealing member 174, such as an O-ring, a flange seal or the like, is
10 disposed on at least one of an upper surface 176 of the cap, and on a threaded
   portion 178 of the neck 126. It will be appreciated that any such sealing member
   174 is situated in an associated receptacle or groove 180 in the receiving structure.
   It will also be appreciated that such sealing members 174 are optionally provided
   in the vessels 24, 130 and 150.
15                While a particular embodiment of the present portable pressurized
   power source for fastener driving tool has been described herein, it will be
   appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made
   thereto without departing from the invention in its broader aspects and as set forth
   in the following claims.
20                While various embodiments of the present invention have been
   described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of
   example only, and not by way of limitation. It will be apparent to a person skilled
                                             21

   in the relevant art that various changes in form and detail can be made therein
   without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, the present
   invention should not be limited by any of the above described exemplary
   embodiments.
 5                Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless
   the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as
   "comprises" and "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a
   stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any
   other integer or step or group of integers or steps.
10                The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or
   information derived from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should
   not be taken as an acknowledgment or admission or any form of suggestion that
   that prior publication (or information derived from it) or known matter forms part
   of the common general knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this
15 specification relates.
