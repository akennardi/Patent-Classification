   Patent Application No. PCT/US2010/049849, are incorporated herein by reference.
              This Application claims priority to United States Provisional Applications
   61/245,273, filed September 23, 2009, and 61/289,886, filed December 23, 2009, the
10 disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
   2.         TECHNICAL FIELD
              The present disclosure generally pertains to glycosyl hydrolase enzymes,
   compositions comprising such enzymes, and methods of using the enzymes and
   compositions, for example for the saccharification or conversion of cellulosic and
15 hemicellulosic materials into sugars.
   3.       BACKGROUND
              Bioconversion of renewable lignocellulosic biomass to a fermentable sugar that
   is subsequently fermented to produce alcohol (e.g., ethanol) as an alternative to liquid
   fuels has attracted the intensive attention of researchers since thel 970s, when the oil
20 crisis occurred because OPEC decreased the output of petroleum (Bungay, H. R.,
   "Energy: the biomass options". NY: Wiley; 1981; Olsson L, Hahn-Hagerdal B. Enzyme
   Microb Technol 1996,18:312-31; Zaldivar, J et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 2001, 56:
   17-34; Galbe, M et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 2002, 59:618-28). Ethanol has been
   widely used as a 10% blend to gasoline in the USA or as a neat fuel for vehicles in Brazil
25 in the last two decades. The importance of fuel bioethanol will increase in parallel with
   skyrocketing prices for oil and gradual depletion of its sources. Additionally, fermentable
   sugars are increasingly used to produce plastics, polymers and other biobased products,
   and this industry is expected to expand substantially in the coming years. Thus, the
   demand for abundant low cost fermentable sugars, which can be used as a feed stock in
30 lieu of petroleum based feedstocks, continues to grow.
                                                  -2-

              Chiefly among the useful renewable feedstocks are cellulose and hemicellulose
   (xylans), which can be converted into fermentable sugars. The enzymatic conversion of
   these polysaccharides to soluble sugars, for example glucose, xylose, arabinose,
   galactose, mannose, and/or other hexoses and pentoses, occurs due to combined
 5 actions of various enzymes. For example, endo-1,4-p-glucanases (EG) and exo
   cellobiohydrolases (CBH) catalyze the hydrolysis of insoluble cellulose to
   cellooligosaccharides (e.g., with cellobiose being a main product), while P-glucosidases
   (BGL) catalyzes the conversion of the oligosaccharides to glucose. Xylanases together
   with other accessory proteins (non-limiting examples of which include L-a
10 arabinofuranosidases, feruloyl and acetylxylan esterases, glucuronidases, and P
   xylosidases) catalyze the hydrolysis of hemicelluloses.
             The cell walls of plants are composed of a heterogeneous mixture of complex
   polysaccharides that interact through covalent and noncovalent means. Complex
   polysaccharides of higher plant cell walls include, for example, cellulose (P-1,4 glucan),
15 which generally constitutes 35-50% of carbon found in cell wall components. Cellulose
   polymers self associate through hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions and
   hydrophobic interactions to form semi-crystalline cellulose microfibrils. These microfibrils
   also include noncrystalline regions, generally known as amorphous cellulose. The
   cellulose microfibrils are embedded in a matrix formed of hemicelluloses (including, e.g.,
20 xylans, arabinans, and mannans), pectins (e.g., galacturonans and galactans), and
   various other P-1,3 and P-1,4 glucans. These matrix polymers are often substituted with,
   for example, arabinose, galactose and/or xylose residues to yield highly complex
   arabinoxylans, arabinogalactans, galactomannans, and xyloglucans. The hemicellulose
   matrix is, in turn, surrounded by polyphenolic lignin.
25           The complexity of the matrix makes it difficult to degrade by microorganisms as
   lignin and hemicellulose components must be broken down before enzymes can act on
   the core cellulose microfibrils. Ordinarily, a consortium of different enzymatic activities is
   required to break down cell wall polymers to release the constituent monosaccharides.
   For saccharification of plant cell walls, the lignin must be permeabilized and
30 hemicellulose disrupted to allow cellulose-degrading enzymes to act on their substrate.
              Regardless of the type of cellulosic feedstock, the cost and hydrolytic efficiency
   of enzymes are major factors that restrict the commercialization of biomass
   bioconversion processes. The production costs of microbially produced enzymes are
                                                  -3-

   tightly connected with the productivity of the enzyme-producing strain and the final
   activity yield in the fermentation broth. The hydrolytic efficiency of a multienzyme
   complex depends both on properties of individual enzymes, the synergies among them,
   and their ratio in the multienzyme blend.
 5            There exists a need in the art to identify enzyme and/or enzymatic
   blends/compositions that are capable of converting plant and/or other cellulosic or
   hemicellulosic materials into fermentable sugars with improved efficacy and yield.
   4.       SUMMARY
              The disclosure provides certain glycosyl hydrolase polypeptides having
10 hemicellulolytic activity, including, e.g., xylanases (e.g., endoxylanases), xylosidases
   (e.g., P-xylosidases), arabinofuranosidases (e.g., L-a-arabinofuranosidases), nucleic
   acids encoding these polypeptides, and methods for making and using the polypeptides
   and/or nucleic acids. The disclosure is based, in part, on the discovery of novel
   enzymes and variants having xylanase, P-xylosidase, and/or L-a-arabinofuranosidase
15 activities. The disclosure is also based on the identification of enzyme blends (or
   compositions) that efficiently catalyze the hydrolysis of cellulosic and hemicellulosic
   materials. For purpose of this disclosure, an enzyme can be defined either as a
   polypeptide having the particular enzymatic activity or as that enzyme. For example, a
   xylanase can be referred to as a polypeptide having xylanase activity or as a xylanase
20 enzyme, and a P-xylosidase can be referred to as either a polypeptide having p
   xylosidase activity or a p-xylosidase enzyme.
              The enzymes and/or enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure can be
   used to produce sugars from biomass. The sugars so produced can be used by
   microorganisms for ethanol production or can be used to produce other bioproducts in
25 various industrial applications. Therefore, the disclosure also provides industrial
   applications (e.g., saccharification processes in ethanol production) using the enzymes
   and/or enzyme blends/compositions described herein. The enzymes and/or enzyme
   blends/compositions of the present disclosure can be used to decrease enzyme costs in
   biofuel production.
30            In one aspect, the invention of the disclosure pertains to enzymes (including
   variants thereof), or enzyme blends/compositions that are useful for hydrolyzing the
   major components of a lignocellulosic biomass (including, e.g., cellulose, hemicellulose,
                                                   -4-

   and lignin) or any material comprising cellulose and/or hemicellulose. Such
   lignocellulosic biomass and/or material comprising cellulose and/or hemicellulose
   include, e.g., seeds, grains, tubers, plant waste or byproducts of food processing or
   industrial processing (e.g., stalks), corn (including, e.g., cobs, stover, and the like),
 5 grasses (e.g., Indian grass, such as Sorghastrum nutans; or, switchgrass, e.g., Panicum
   species, such as Panicum virgatum), wood (including, e.g., wood chips, processing
   waste), paper, pulp, recycled paper (e.g., newspaper).
              The enzyme blends/compositions of the invention can be used to hydrolyze
   cellulose comprising a linear chain of p-1,4-linked glucose moieties, or hemicellulose, of
10 a complex structure that varies from plant to plant.
              The enzyme blends/compositions of the invention can comprise a number of
   different enzymes, including, e.g., cellulases and/or hemicellulases. For example, the
   enzymes blends/compositions of the invention can be used to hydrolyze biomass or a
   suitable feedstock. The enzyme blends/compositions of the invention desirably comprise
15 mixtures of enzymes, selected from, e.g., xylanases, xylosidases, cellobiohydrolases,
   arabinofuranosidases, and/or other enzymes that can digest hemicellulose to monomer
   sugars. An enzyme blend/composition of the invention can comprise a mixture of two or
   more, three or more, or four or more enzymes selected from one or more xylanases, one
   or more xylosidases, one or more cellobiohydrolases, one or more
20 arabinofuranosidases, and one or more other enzymes that are capable of converting
   hemicelluose to monomer sugars. The other enzymes that can digest hemicellulose to
   monomer sugars include, without limitation, a cellulase, a hemicellulase, or a
   composition comprising a cellulase or a hemicellulase. An enzyme blend/composition of
   the invention can comprise a mixture of two or more, three or more, or four or more
25 enzymes selected from a xylanase, a xylosidase, a cellobiohydrolase, an
   arabinofuranosidase, and at least one other enzyme capable of converting hemicellulose
   to monomer sugars. A non-limiting example of an enzyme blend/composition of the
   invention comprises a mixture of a xylanase, a xylosidase, a cellobiohydrolase, an
   arabinofuranosidase, and a s-glucosidase. The enzyme blend/composition of the
30 invention is suitably one that is non-naturally occurring.
             As used herein, the term "naturally occurring composition" refers to a
   composition produced by a naturally occurring source, which comprises one or more
   enzymatic components or activities, wherein each of these components or activities is
                                                  -5-

   found at the ratio and level produced by the naturally-occuring source as it is found in
   nature, untouched and unmodified by the human hand. Accordingly, a naturally
   occurring composition is, for example, one that is produced by an organism unmodified
   with respect to the cellulolytic or hemicelluloytic enzymes such that the ratio or levels of
 5 the component enzymes are unaltered from that produced by the native organism in its
   native environment. A "non-naturally occurring composition," on the other hand, refers to
   a composition produced by: (1) combining component cellulolytic or hemicelluloytic
   enzymes either in a naturally occurring ratio or a non-naturally occurring, i.e., altered,
   ratio; or (2) modifying an organism to express, overexpress or underexpress one or more
10 endogeneous or exogenous enzymes; or (3) modifying an organism such that at least
   one endogenous enzyme is deleted. A "non-naturally occurring composition" can also
   refer to a composition produced by a naturally-occurring and unmodified organism, but
   cultured in a man-made medium or environment that is different from the organism's
   native environment, such that the amounts or weight ratios of particular enzymes in the
15 composition differ from those existing in a composition made by a native organism grown
   in its native habitat.
              The enzyme blend/composition of the invention described herein is, for
   example, a fermentation broth. The fermentation broth can be one of a filamentous
   fungus, including, e.g., a Trichoderma, Humicola, Fusarium, Aspergillus, Neurospora,
20 Penicillium, Cephalosporium, Achlya, Podospora, Endothia, Mucor, Cochliobolus,
   Pyricularia, or Chrysosporium. An exemplary fungus of Trichoderma spp. is a
    Trichoderma reesei. An exemplary fungus of Penicillium spp. is a Penicillium
   funiculosum. The fermentation broth can be, for example, a cell-free fermentation broth
   or a whole cell broth.
25            The enzyme blend/composition of the invention described herein is, in another
   example, a cellulase compostion. The cellulase composition is a filamentous fungal
   cellulase composition, including, for example, a Trichoderma, such as a Trichoderma
   reesei, cellulase composition. The cellulase composition can be produced by a
   filamentous fungus, for example, a Trichoderma, such as a Trichoderma reesei.
30            For example, an enzyme blend/composition of the invention can comprise (a)

   more p-xylosidase enzyme(s) is a Group 1 p-xylosidase or a Group 2 s-xylosidase,
   wherein the Group 1 p-xylosidase is an Fv3A or an Fv43A, and the Group 2 p-xylosidase
   is a Pf43A, an Fv43D, an Fv39A, an Fv43E, an Fo43A, an Fv43B, a Pa51A, a Gz43A, or
   a Trichoderma reesei BxI1; (c) one or more L-a-arabinofuranosidase enzyme(s),

   desirably able to achieve at least 0.00005 fraction product per mg protein per gram of
10 phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) as determined by a calcofluor assay. In a
   non-limiting example, the combined weight of xylanase enzyme(s) in the composition
   can represent or constitute 5 wt.% to 45 wt.% (e.g., 5 wt.% to 25 wt.%, 5 wt.% to 15
   wt.%, 10 wt.% to 15 wt.%) of the combined or total protein weight in the composition,
   whereas the combined weight of p-xylosidase enzyme(s) can represent or constitute 2
15 wt.% to 50 wt.% (e.g., 2 wt.% to 30 wt.%, 5 wt.% to 25 wt.%, 5 wt.% to 10 wt.%) of the
   total proteins in the composition, whereas the combined weight of L-at
   arabinofuranosidase enzyme(s) can represent or constitute 2 wt.% to 50 wt.% (e.g., 2

   wt.%, 50 wt.% to 60 wt.%) of the combined or total protein weight in the composition.
   The enzyme blend/composition as described herein is, for example, a fermentation broth
   composition. The fermentation broth is, for example, one of a filamentous fungus,
   including, without limitation, a Trichoderma, Humicola, Fusarium, Aspergilus,
25 Neurospora, Penicillium, Cephalosporium, Achlya, Podospora, Endothia, Mucor,
   Cochliobolus, Pyricularia, or Chrysosporium. An exemplary fungus of Trichoderma spp.
   is a Trichoderma reesei. An exemplary fungus of Penicillium spp. is a Penicillium
   funiculosum. The fermentation can be, for example, a cell-free fermentation broth or a
   whole cell broth. The enzyme blend/composition as described herein can also be a
30 cellulase composition, for example, a filamentous fungal cellulase composition. The
   cellulase composition, for example, can be produced by a filamentous fungus, such as
   by a Trichoderma.
             For example, an enzyme blend/composition of the invention can comprise (a)

 5 (d) one or more cellulase enzyme(s); and optionally (e) one or more other components.
   The one or more celluase enzyme(s) of (e) is desirably able to to achieve at least
   0.00005 fraction product per mg protein per gram of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose
   (PASC) as determined by a calcofluor assay. The enzyme blend/composition is suitably
   one that is non-naturally occurring. In a non-limiting example, the combined weight of
10 xylanase enzyme(s) in the composition can represent or constitute 5 wt.% to 45 wt.%
   (e.g., 5 wt.% to 25 wt.%, 5 wt.% to 15 wt.%, 10 wt.% to 15 wt.%) of the combined or total

   to 25 wt.%, 5 wt.% to 10 wt.%) of the total protein weight in the composition, whereas the
15 combined weight of the Group 2 p-xylosidase enzyme(s) can constitute 2 wt.% to 50
   wt.% (e.g., 2 wt.% to 30 wt.%, 5 wt.% to 25 wt.%, 5 wt.% to 10 wt.%) of the total protein
   weight in the composition, and wherein the combined weight of the cellulase enzyme(s)
   can represent or constitute 30 wt.% to 80 wt.% (e.g., 40 wt.% to 70 wt.%, 50 wt.% to 60
   wt.%) of the combined or total protein weight in the composition. The ratio of the weight
20 of Group 1 p-xylosidase enzymes to the weight of Group 2 p-xylosidase enzymes can
   be, for example, 1:10 to 10:1 (e.g., 1:8 to 8:1, 1:6 to 6:1, 1:4 to 4:1, 1:2 to 2:1, or 1:1).
   The enzyme blend/composition can further comprise additional components, which may
   be accessory proteins or other protein/non-protein components. The additional
   components can constitute, for example, 1 wt.% to 50 wt.%, 1 wt.% to 10 wt.%, 2 wt.% to
25 5 wt.%, 5 wt.% to 10 wt.%, or 5 wt.% to 20 wt.% of the total weight of proteins in the
   composition. The enzyme blend/composition as described herein is, for example, a
   fermentation broth composition. The fermentation broth is, for example, one of a
   filamentous fungus, including, without limitation, a Trichoderma, Humicola, Fusarium,
   Aspergillus, Neurospora, Penicillium, Cephalosporium, Achlya, Podospora, Endothia,

    Trichoderma spp. is a Trichoderma reesei. An exemplary fungus of Penicillium spp. is a
   Penicillium funiculosum. The fermentation can be, for example, a cell-free fermentation
   broth or a whole cell broth. The enzyme blend/composition as described herein can also

   6.       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 5            Enzymes have traditionally been classified by substrate specificity and reaction
   products. In the pre-genomic era, function was regarded as the most amenable (and
   perhaps most useful) basis for comparing enzymes and assays for various enzymatic
   activities have been well-developed for many years, resulting in the familiar EC
   classification scheme. Cellulases and other glycosyl hydrolases, which act upon
10 glycosidic bonds between two carbohydrate moieties (or a carbohydrate and non
   carbohydrate moiety--as occurs in nitrophenol-glycoside derivatives) are, under this
   classification scheme, designated as EC 3.2.1.-, with the final number indicating the
   exact type of bond cleaved. For example, according to this scheme an endo-acting
   cellulase (1,4-p-endoglucanase) is designated EC 3.2.1.4.
15            With the advent of widespread genome sequencing projects, sequencing data
   have facilitated analyses and comparison of related genes and proteins. Additionally, a
   growing number of enzymes capable of acting on carbohydrate moieties (i.e.,
   carbohydrases) have been crystallized and their 3-D structures solved. Such analyses
   have identified discreet families of enzymes with related sequence, which contain
20 conserved three-dimensional folds that can be predicted based on their amino acid
   sequence. Further, it has been shown that enzymes with the same or similar three
   dimensional folds exhibit the same or similar stereospecificity of hydrolysis, even when
   catalyzing different reactions (Henrissat et al., 1998, FEBS Lett 425(2): 352-4; Coutinho
   and Henrissat, 1999, in Genetics, biochemistry and ecology of cellulose degradation. T.
25 Kimura. Tokyo, Uni Publishers Co: 15-23.).
              These findings form the basis of a sequence-based classification of
   carbohydrase modules, which is available in the form of an internet database, the
   Carbohydrate-Active enZYme server (CAZy), available at http://afmb.cnrs
   mrs.fr/CAZY/index.html (Carbohydrate-active enzymes: an integrated database
30 approach.     See Cantarel et al., 2009, Nucleic Acids Res. 37 (Database issue):D233-38).
              CAZy defines four major classes of carbohydrases distinguishable by the type
   of reaction catalyzed: Glycosyl Hydrolases (GH's), Glycosyltransferases (GT's),
                                                -31-

   Polysaccharide Lyases (PL's), and Carbohydrate Esterases (CE's). The enzymes of the
   disclosure are glycosyl hydrolases. GH's are a group of enzymes that hydrolyze the
   glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between a carbohydrate and a
   non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for glycosyl hydrolases, grouped by
 5 sequence similarity, has led to the definition of over 85 different families. This
   classification is available on the CAZy web site.
              The enzymes of the disclosure belong, inter alia, to the glycosyl hydrolase
   families 3, 10, 11, 30, 39, 43, and/or 51.
              Glycoside hydrolase family 3 ("GH3") enzymes include, e.g., p-glucosidase
10 (EC:3.2.1.21); P-xylosidase (EC:3.2.1.37); N-acetyl P-glucosaminidase (EC:3.2.1.52);
   glucan P-1,3-glucosidase (EC:3.2.1.58); cellodextrinase (EC:3.2.1.74); exo-1,3-1,4
   glucanase (EC:3.2.1); and P-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23). For example, GH3 enzymes
   can be those that have P-glucosidase, P-xylosidase, N-acetyl P-glucosaminidase, glucan
   p-1,3-glucosidase, cellodextrinase, exo-1,3-1,4-glucanase, and/or p-galactosidase
15 activity. Generally, GH3 enzymes are globular proteins and can consist of two or more
   subdomains. A catalytic residue has been identified as an aspartate residue that, in p
   glucosidases, located in the N-terminal third of the peptide and sits within the amino acid
   fragment SDW (Li et al. 2001, Biochem. J. 355:835-840). The corresponding sequence
   in Bgl1 from T. reesel is T266D267W268 (counting from the methionine at the starting
20 position), with the catalytic residue aspartate being the D267. The hydroxyl/aspartate
   sequence is also conserved in the GH3 P-xylosidases tested. For example, the
   corresponding sequence in T. reesei Bx11 is S31 0D311 and the corresponding sequence
   in Fv3A is S290D291.
              Glycoside hydrolase family 39 ("GH39") enzymes have a-L-iduronidase
25 (EC:3.2.1.76) or P-xylosidase (EC:3.2.1.37) activity. The three-dimensional structure of
   two GH39 P-xylosidases, from Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum (Uniprot
   Accession No. P36906) and Geobacillus stearothermophilus (Uniprot Accession No.
   Q9ZFM2), have been solved (see Yang et aL J. Mol. Biol. 2004, 335(1):155-65 and
   Czjzek et al., J. Mol. Biol. 2005, 353(4):838-46). The most highly conserved regions in
30 these enzymes are located in their N-terminal sections, which have a classic (a/P)8 TIM
   barrel fold with the two key active site glutamic acids located at the C-terminal ends of P
   strands 4 (acid/base) and 7 (nucleophile). Fv39A residues El 68 and E272 are predicted
   to function as catalytic acid-base and nucleophile, respectively, based on a sequence
                                                 -32-

   alignment of the abovementioned GH39 P-xylosidases from Thermoanaerobacterium
   saccharolyticum and Geobacillus stearothermophilus with Fv39A.
             Glycoside hydrolase family 43 ("GH43") enzymes include, e.g., L-a
   arabinofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.55); P-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37); endo-arabinanase (EC
 5 3.2.1.99); and/or galactan 1,3-p-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.145). For example, GH43
   enzymes can have L-a-arabinofuranosidase activity, p-xylosidase activity, endo
   arabinanase activity, and/or galactan 1,3-p-galactosidase activity. GH43 family enzymes
   display a five-bladed-P3-propeller-like structure. The propeller-like structure is based
   upon a five-fold repeat of blades composed of four-stranded P-sheets. The catalytic
10 general base, an aspartate, the catalytic general acid, a glutamate, and an aspartate that
   modulates the pKa of the general base were identified through the crystal structure of
   Cellvibriojaponicus CjAbn43A, and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (see Nurizzo
   et al. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002, 9(9) 665-8). The catalytic residues are arranged in three
   conserved blocks spread widely through the amino acid sequence (Pons et al. Proteins:
15 Structure, Function and Bioinformatics, 2004, 54:424-432). Among the GH43 family
   enzymes tested for useful activities in biomass hydrolysis, the predicted catalytic
   residues are shown as the bold and underlined residues in the sequences of Figure 53.
   The crystal structure of the Geobacillus stearothermophylus xylosidase (Brux et al. J.
   Mol. Bio., 2006, 359:97-109) suggests several additional residues that may be important
20 for substrate binding in this enzyme. Because the GH43 family enzymes tested for
   biomass hydrolysis had differing substrate preferences, these residues are not fully
   conserved in the sequences aligned in Figure 53. However among the xylosidases
   tested, several conserved residues that contribute to substrate binding, either through
   hydrophobic interaction or through hydrogen bonding, are conserved and are noted by
25 single underlines in Figure 53.
             Glycoside hydrolase family 51 ('GH51 ") enzymes have L-a
   arabinofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.55) and/or endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4) activity. High
   resolution crystal structure of a GH51 L-a-arabinofuranosidase from Geobacillus
   stearothermophilus T-6 shows that the enzyme is a hexamer, with each monomer
30 organized into two domains: an 8-barrel (P/a)and a 12-stranded      P sandwich with jelly-roll
   topology (see H6vel et al. EMBO J. 2003, 22(19):4922-4932). It can be expected that
   the catalytic residues will be acidic and conserved across enzyme sequences in the
   family. When the amino acid sequences of Fv51A, Pf51A, and Pa5lA are aligned with
                                                 -33-

   GH51 enzymes of more diverse sequence, 8 acidic residues remain conserved. Those
   are shown bold and underlined in Figure 54.
              Glycoside hydrolase family 10 ("GH 10") enzymes also have an 8-barrel (P/a)
   structure. They hydrolyze in an endo fashion with a retaining mechanism that uses at
 5 least one acidic catalytic residue in a generally acid/base catalysis process (Pell et al., J.
   Biol. Chem., 2004, 279(10): 9597-9605). Crystal structures of the GH10 xylanases of
   Penicillium simplicissimum (Uniprot P56588) and Thermoascus aurantiacus (Uniprot
   P23360) complexed with substrates in the active sites have been solved (see Schmidt et
   al. Biochem., 1999, 38:2403-2412; and Lo Leggio et al. FEBS Lett. 2001, 509: 303-308).
10 Trichoderma reeseiXyn3 residues that are important for substrate binding and catalysis
   can be derived from an alignment with the sequences of abovementioned GH10
   xylanases from Penicillium simplicissimum and Thermoascus aurantiacus (Figure 55A).
   Trichoderma reeseiXyn3 residue E282 is predicted to be the catalytic nucleophilic
   residue, whereas residues E91, N92, K95, Q97, S98, H128, W132, Q135, N175, E176,
15 Y219, Q252, H254, W312, and/or W320 are predicted to be involved in substrate binding
   and/or catalysis.
              Glycoside hydrolase family 11 ("GH 11") enzymes have a p-jelly roll structure.
   They hydrolyze in an endo fashion with a retaining mechanism that uses at least one
   acidic catalytic residue in a generally acid/base catalysis process. Several other residues
20 spread throughout their structure may contribute to stabilizing the xylose units in the
   substrate neighboring the pair of xylose monomers that are cleaved by hydrolysis. Three
   GH1 1 family endoxylanases were tested and their sequences are aligned in Figure 55B.
   E118 (or E86 in mature T. reeseiXyn2) and E209 (or E177 in mature T. reeseiXyn2)
   have been identified as catalytic nucleophile and general/acid base residues in
25 Trichoderma reeseiXyn2, respectively (see Havukainen et al. Biochem., 1996, 35:9617
   24).
              Glycoside hydrolase family 30 ("GH30") enzymes are retaining enzymes having
   glucosylceramidase (EC 3.2.1.45); P-1,6-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.75); P-xylosidase (EC
   3.2.1.37); P-glucosidase (3.2.1.21) activity. The first GH30 crystal structure was the
30 Gaucher disease-related human P-glucocerebrosidase solved by Grabowski, Gatt and
   Horowitz (Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol 1990; 25(6) 385-414). GH30 have an (a/p)8 TIM
   barrel fold with the two key active site glutamic acids located at the C-terminal ends of p
   strands 4 (acid/base) and 7 (nucleophile) (Henrissat B, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,
                                                 -34-

   92(15):7090-4, 1995; Jordan et al., Applied Microbiol Biotechnol, 86:1647, 2010).
   Glutamate 162 of Fv30A is conserved in 14 of 14 aligned GH30 proteins (13 bacterial
   proteins and one endo-b-xylanase from the fungi Biospora accession no. ADG62369)
   and glutamate 250 of Fv30A is conserved in 10 of the same 14, is an aspartate in
 5 another three and non-acidic in one. There are other moderately conserved acidic
   residues but no others are as widely conserved.

             The present disclosure provides also compositions (e.g., cellulase
   compositions, or enzyme blends/compositions) or fermentation broths enriched with one
   or more of the above-described polypeptides. The enzyme blend/composition is thus a
25 non-naturally-occurring composition. The cellulase composition can be, for example, a
   filamentous fungal cellulase composition, such as a Trichoderma cellulase composition.
   The fermentation broth can be a fermentation broth of a filamentous fungus, for example,
   a Trichoderma, Humicola, Fusarium, Aspergillus, Neurospora, Penicillium,
   Cephalosporium, Achlya, Podospora, Endothia, Mucor, Cochliobolus, Pyricularia, or
30 Chrysosporium fermentation broth. In particular, the fermentation broth can be, for
   example, one of Trichoderma spp. such as a Trichoderma reesei, or Penicillium spp.,
                                               -56-

   such as a Penicillium funiculosum. The fermentation broth can also suitably be a cell
   free fermentation broth.
              Additionally the instant disclosure provides host cells that are recombiantly
   engineered to express a polypeptide described above. The host cells can be, for
 5 example, filamentous fungal host cells, such as Trichoderma, Humicola, Fusarium,
   Aspergillus, Neurospora, Penicillium, Cephalosporium, Achlya, Podospora, Endothia,
   Mucor, cochliobolus, Pyricularia, or Chrysosporium cells. In particular, the host cells can
   be, for example, a Trichoderma spp. cell (such as a Trichoderma reesei cell), or a
   Penicillium cell (such as a Penicillium funiculosum cell), an Aspergillus cell (such as an
10 Aspergillus oryzae or Aspergillus nidulans cell), or a Fusarium cell (such as a Fusarium
   verticilloides or Fusarium oxysporum cell ).
                         6.1.1       Fusion proteins
              The present disclosure also provides a fusion protein that includes a domain of
   a protein of the present disclosure attached to one or more fusion segments, which are
15 typically heterologous to the protein (i.e., derived from a different source than the protein
   of the disclosure). Suitable fusion segments include, without limitation, segments that
   can enhance a protein's stability, provide other desirable biological activity, and/or
   facilitate purification of the protein (e.g., by affinity chromatography). A suitable fusion
   segment can be a domain of any size that has the desired function (e.g., imparts
20 increased stability, solubility, action or biological activity; and/or simplifies purification of a
   protein). Fusion segments can be joined to amino and/or carboxyl termini of the
   domain(s) of a protein of the present disclosure. The fusion segments can be
   susceptible to cleavage. There may be some advantage in having this susceptibility, for
   example, it may enable straight-forward recovery of the protein of interest. Fusion
25 proteins are preferably produced by culturing a recombinant cell transfected with a fusion
   nucleic acid that encodes a protein, which includes a fusion segment attached to either
   the carboxyl or amino terminal end, or fusion segments attached to both the carboxyl
   and amino terminal ends, of a protein, or a domain thereof.
              Accordingly, proteins of the present disclosure also include expression products
30 of gene fusions (e.g., an overexpressed, soluble, and active form of a recombinant
   protein), of mutagenized genes (e.g., genes having codon modifications to enhance
   gene transcription and translation), and of truncated genes (e.g., genes having signal
   sequences removed or substituted with a heterologous signal sequence).
                                                   -57-

             Glycosyl hydrolases that utilize insoluble substrates are often modular
   enzymes. They usually comprise catalytic modules appended to one or more non
   catalytic carbohydrate-binding domains (CBMs). In nature, CBMs are thought to
   promote the glycosyl hydrolase's interaction with its target substrate polysaccharide.
 5 Thus, the disclosure provides chimeric enzymes having altered substrate specificity;
   including, for example, chimeric enzymes having multiple substrates as a result of
   "spliced-in" heterologous CBMs. The heterologous CBMs of the chimeric enzymes of
   the disclosure can also be designed to be modular, such that they are appended to a
   catalytic module or catalytic domain (a "CD", e.g., at an active site), which can likewise
10 be heterologous or homologous to the glycosyl hydrolase.
             Thus, the disclosure provides peptides and polypeptides consisting of, or
   comprising, CBM/CD modules, which can be homologously paired or joined to form
   chimeric (heterologous) CBM/CD pairs. Thus, these chimeric polypeptides/peptides can
   be used to improve or alter the performance of an enzyme of interest. Accordingly, the
15 disclosure provides chimeric enzymes comprising, e.g., at least one CBM of an enzyme
   of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42,
   43, 44, or 45. A polypeptide of the disclosure, for example, includes an amino acid
   sequence comprising the CD and/or CBM of the glycosyl hydrolase sequence of SEQ ID
   NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 43, 44, or
20 45. The polypeptide of the disclosure can thus suitably be a fusion protein comprising
   functional domains from two or more different proteins (e.g., a CBM from one protein
   linked to a CD from another protein).
             The polypeptides of the disclosure can suitably be obtained and/or used in
   "substantially pure" form. For example, a polypeptide of the disclosure constitutes at
25 least about 80 wt.% (e.g., at least about 85 wt.%, 90 wt.%, 91 wt.%, 92 wt.%, 93 wt.%,
   94 wt.%, 95 wt.%, 96 wt.%, 97 wt.%, 98 wt.%, or 99 wt.%) of the total protein in a given
   composition, which also includes other ingredients such as a buffer or solution.
             Also, the polypeptides of the disclosure can suitably be obtained and/or used in
   recombinant culture broths (e.g., a filamentous fungal culture broth). The recombinant
30 culture broths can be non-naturally occurring; for example, the culture broth can be
   produced by a recombinant host cell that is engineered to express a heterologous
   polypeptide of the disclosure, or by a recombinant host cell that is engineered to express
   an endogenous polypeptide of the disclosure in greater or lesser amounts than the
                                                -58-

   endogenous expression levels (e.g., in an amount that is 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, or more- fold
   greater or less than the endogenous expression levels). Furthermore, the polypeptides
   of the disclosure can suitably be obtained and/or used as recombinant culture broths
   produced by "integrated" host cell strains that have been engineered to express a
 5 plurality of polypeptides of the disclosure in desired ratios. Exemplary desired ratios are
   described herein, for example, in Section 6.3.4 below.
            6.2     Nucleic Acids and Host Cells

   disclosure, for example one described in Section 6.1 above.
10            The disclosure provides isolated, synthetic or recombinant nucleic acids
   comprising a nucleic acid sequence having at least about 70%, e.g., at least about 71%,
   72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%,
   87%, 88%; 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%, or
   complete (100%) sequence identity to a nucleic acid of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13,
15 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50, over a region
   of at least about 10, e.g., at least about 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200,
   250, 300, 350, 400, 450,500,550, 600, 650,700,750,800,850, 900, 950,1000, 1050,

   1800, 1850, 1900, 1950, or 2000 nucleotides. The present disclosure also provides
20 nucleic acids encoding at least one polypeptide having a hemicellulolytic activity (e.g., a
   xylanase, p-xylosidase, and/or L-a- arabinofuranosidase activity).
              Nucleic acids of the disclosure also include isolated, synthetic or recombinant
   nucleic acids encoding an enzyme having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
   14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 43, 44, or 45, and
25 subsequences thereof (e.g., a conserved domain or carbohydrate binding domain
   ("CBM"), and variants thereof. A nucleic acid of the disclosure can, for example, encode
   the mature portion of a protein of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24,
   26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 43, 44, or 45.

            6.3     Enzyme Blends for Saccharification
              The present disclosure provides a composition comprising an enzyme
   blend/composition that is capable of breaking down lignocellulose material. Such a
15 multi-enzyme blend/composition comprises at least one polypeptide of the present
   disclosure, in combination with one or more additional polypeptides of the present
   disclosure, or one or more enzymes from other microorganisms, plants, or organisms.
   Synergistic enzyme combinations and related methods are contemplated. The
   disclosure includes methods for identifying the optimum ratios of the enzymes included
20 in the blends/compositions for degrading a particular lignocellulosic material. These
   methods include, e.g., tests to identify the optimum enzyme blend/composition and ratios
   for efficient conversion of a given lignocellulosic substrate to its constituent sugars. The
   Examples below include assays that may be used to identify optimum ratios and
   blends/compositions of enzymes with which to degrade lignocellulosic materials.
25                      6.3.1       Background
              The cell walls of higher plants are comprised of a variety of carbohydrate
   polymer (CP) components. These CP interact through covalent and non-covalent
   means, providing the structural integrity required to form rigid cell walls and resist turgor
   pressure in plants. The major CP found in plants is cellulose, which forms the structural
30 backbone of the cell wall. During cellulose biosynthesis, chains of poly-p-1,4-D-glucose
   self associate through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions to form cellulose
   microfibrils, which further self-associate to form larger fibrils. Cellulose microfibrils are
                                                 -67-

   often irregular structurally and contain regions of varying crystallinity. The degree of
   crystallinity of cellulose fibrils depends on how tightly ordered the hydrogen bonding is
   between and among its component cellulose chains. Areas with less-ordered bonding,
   and therefore more accessible glucose chains, are referred to as amorphous regions.
 5            The general model for cellulose depolymerization to glucose involves a
   minimum of three distinct enzymatic activities. Endoglucanases cleave cellulose chains
   internally to shorter chains in a process that increases the number of accessible ends,
   which are more susceptible to exoglucanase activity than the intact cellulose chains.
   These exoglucanases (e.g., cellobiohydrolases) are specific for either reducing ends or
10 non-reducing ends, liberating, in most cases, cellobiose, the dimer of glucose. . The
   accumulating cellobiose is then subject to cleavage by cellobiases (e.g., p-1,4
   glucosidases) to glucose.
              Cellulose contains only anhydro-glucose. In contrast, hemicellulose contains a
   number of different sugar monomers. For instance, aside from glucose, sugar
15 monomers in hemicellulose can also include xylose, mannose, galactose, rhamnose,
   and arabinose. Hemicelluloses mostly contain D-pentose sugars and occasionally small
   amounts of L-sugars. Xylose is typically present in the largest amount, but mannuronic
   acid and galacturonic acid also tend to be present. Hemicelluloses include xylan,
   glucuronoxylan, arabinoxylan, glucomannan, and xyloglucan.
20            The enzymes and multi-enzyme compositions of the disclosure are useful for
   saccharification of hemicellulose materials, including, e.g., xylan, arabinoxylan, and
   xylan- or arabinoxylan-containing substrates. Arabinoxylan is a polysaccharide
   composed of xylose and arabinose, wherein L-a -arabinofuranose residues are attached
   as branch-points to a P-(1,4)-linked xylose polymeric backbone.
25            Most biomass sources are rather complex, containing cellulose, hemicellulose,
   pectin, lignin, protein, and ash, among other components. Accordingly, in certain
   aspects, the present disclosure provides enzyme blends/com positions containing
   enzymes that impart a range or variety of substrate specificities when working together
   to degrade biomass into fermentable sugars in the most efficient manner. One example
30 of a multi-enzyme blend/composition of the present invention is a mixture of
   cellobiohydrolase(s), xylanase(s), endoglucanase(s), P-glucosidase(s), P-xylosidase(s),
                                                 -68-

   and, optionally, accessory proteins. The enzyme blend/composition is suitably a non
   naturally occurring composition.
             Accordingly, the disclosure provides enzyme blends/compositions (including
   products of manufacture) comprising a mixture of xylan-hydrolyzing, hemicellulose
 5 and/or cellulose-hydrolyzing enzymes, which include at least one, several, or all of a
   cellulase, including a glucanase; a cellobiohydrolase; an L-a-arabinofuranosidase; a
   xylanase; a P-glucosidase; and a P-xylosidase. Preferably each of the enzyme
   blends/compositions of the disclosure comprises at least one enzyme of the disclosure.
   The present disclosure also provides enzyme blends/compositions that are non-naturally
10 occurring compositions. As used herein, the term "enzyme blends/compositions" refers
   to:
            (1)    a composition made by combining component enzymes, whether in the
                   form of a fermentation broth or partially or completely isolated or purified;
           (2)     a composition produced by an organism modified to express one or more
15                 component enzymes; in certain embodiments, the organism used to
                   express one or more component enzymes can be modified to delete one
                   or more genes; in certain other embodiments, the organism used to
                   express one or more component enzymes can further comprise proteins
                   affecting xylan hydrolysis, hemicellulose hydrolysis, and/or cellulose
20                 hydrolysis;
           (3)     a composition made by combining component enzymes simultaneously,
                   separately, or sequentially during a saccharification or fermentation
                   reaction; and
           (4)     an enzyme mixture produced in situ, e.g., during a saccharification or
25                 fermentation reaction;
           (5)     a composition produced in accordance with any or all of the above (1)-(4).
             The term "fermentation broth" as used herein refers to an enzyme preparation
   produced by fermentation that undergoes no or minimal recovery and/or purification
30 subsequent to fermentation. For example, microbial cultures are grown to saturation,
   incubated under carbon-limiting conditions to allow protein synthesis (e.g., expression of
   enzymes). Then, once the enzyme(s) are secreted into the cell culture media, the
   fermentation broths can be used. The fermentation broths of the disclosure can contain
                                                -69-

   unfractionated or fractionated contents of the fermentation materials derived at the end
   of the fermentation. For example, the fermentation broths of the invention are
   unfractionated and comprise the spent culture medium and cell debris present after the
   microbial cells (e.g., filamentous fungal cells) undergo a fermentation process. The
 5 fermentation broth can suitably contain the spent cell culture media, extracellular
   enzymes, and live or killed microbial cells. Alternatively, the fermentation broths can be
   fractionated to remove the microbial cells. In those cases, the fermentation broths can,
   for example, comprise the spent cell culture media and the extracellular enzymes.
              Any of the enzymes described specifically herein can be combined with any
10 one or more of the enzymes described herein or with any other available and suitable
   enzymes, to produce a suitable multi-enzyme blend/composition. The disclosure is not
   restricted or limited to the specific exemplary combinations listed below.
                        6.3.2       Biomass
              The disclosure provides methods and processes for biomass saccharification,
15 using enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure. The term "biomass," as
   used herein, refers to any composition comprising cellulose and/or hemicellulose
   (optionally also lignin in lignocellulosic biomass materials). As used herein, biomass
   includes, without limitation, seeds, grains, tubers, plant waste or byproducts of food
   processing or industrial processing (e.g., stalks), corn (including, e.g., cobs, stover, and
20 the like), grasses (including, e.g., Indian grass, such as Sorghastrum nutans; or,
   switchgrass, e.g., Panicum species, such as Panicum virgatum), wood (including, e.g.,
   wood chips, processing waste), paper, pulp, and recycled paper (including, e.g.,
   newspaper, printer paper, and the like). Other biomass materials include, without
   limitation, potatoes, soybean (e.g., rapeseed), barley, rye, oats, wheat, beets, and sugar
25 cane bagasse.
              The disclosure provides methods of saccharification comprising contacting a
   composition comprising a biomass material, for example, a material comprising xylan,
   hemicellulose, cellulose, and/or a fermentable sugar, with a polypeptide of the
   disclosure, or a polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid of the disclosure, or any one of
30 the enzyme blends/compositions, or products of manufacture of the disclosure.
              The saccharified biomass (e.g., lignocellulosic material processed by enzymes
   of the disclosure) can be made into a number of bio-based products, via processes such
                                                  -70-

   as, e.g., microbial fermentation and/or chemical synthesis. As used herein, "microbial
   fermentation" refers to a process of growing and harvesting fermenting microorganisms
   under suitable conditions. The fermenting microorganism can be any microorganism
   suitable for use in a desired fermentation process for the production of bio-based
 5 products. Suitable fermenting microorganisms include, without limitation, filamentous
   fungi, yeast, and bacteria. The saccharified biomass can, for example, be made it into a
   fuel (e.g., a biofuel such as a bioethanol, biobutanol, biomethanol, a biopropanol, a
   biodiesel, a jet fuel, or the like) via fermentation and/or chemical synthesis. The
   saccharified biomass can, for example, also be made into a commodity chemical (e.g.,
10 ascorbic acid, isoprene, 1,3-propanediol), lipids, amino acids, proteins, and enzymes, via
   fermentation and/or chemical synthesis.
                        6.3.3.       Pretreatment
              Prior to saccharification, biomass (e.g., lignocellulosic material) is preferably
   subject to one or more pretreatment step(s) in order to render xylan, hemicellulose,
15 cellulose and/or lignin material more accessible or susceptable to enzymes and thus
   more amenable to hydrolysis by the enzyme(s) and/or enzyme blends/compositions of
   the disclosure.
              In an exemplary embodiment, the pretreatment entails subjecting biomass
   material to a catalyst comprising a dilute solution of a strong acid and a metal salt in a
20 reactor. The biomass material can, e.g., be a raw material or a dried material. This
   pretreatment can lower the activation energy, or the temperature, of cellulose hydrolysis,
   ultimately allowing higher yields of fermentable sugars. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.
   6,660,506; 6,423,145.
              Another exemplary pretreatment method entails hydrolyzing biomass by
25 subjecting the biomass material to a first hydrolysis step in an aqueous medium at a
   temperature and a pressure chosen to effectuate primarily depolymerization of
   hemicellulose without achieving significant depolymerization of cellulose into glucose.
   This step yields a slurry in which the liquid aqueous phase contains dissolved
   monosaccharides resulting from depolymerization of hemicellulose, and a solid phase
30 containing cellulose and lignin. The slurry is then subject to a second hydrolysis step
   under conditions that allow a major portion of the cellulose to be depolymerized, yielding
   a liquid aqueous phase containing dissolved/soluble depolymerization products of
   cellulose. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,536,325.
                                                  -71-

              A further exemplary method involves processing a biomass material by one or
   more stages of dilute acid hydrolysis using about 0.4% to about 2% of a strong acid;
   followed by treating the unreacted solid lignocellulosic component of the acid hydrolyzed
   material with alkaline delignification. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,409,841.
 5            Another exemplary pretreatment method comprises prehydrolyzing biomass
   (e.g., lignocellulosic materials) in a prehydrolysis reactor; adding an acidic liquid to the
   solid lignocellulosic material to make a mixture; heating the mixture to reaction
   temperature; maintaining reaction temperature for a period of time sufficient to
   fractionate the lignocellulosic material into a solubilized portion containing at least about
10 20% of the lignin from the lignocellulosic material, and a solid fraction containing
   cellulose; separating the solubilized portion from the solid fraction, and removing the
   solubilized portion while at or near reaction temperature; and recovering the solubilized
   portion. The cellulose in the solid fraction is rendered more amenable to enzymatic
   digestion. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,705,369.
15            Further pretreatment methods can involve the use of hydrogen peroxide H2 0 2 .
   See Gould, 1984, Biotech, and Bioengr. 26:46-52.
              Pretreatment can also comprise contacting a biomass material with
   stoichiometric amounts of sodium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide at a very low
   concentration.    See Teixeira etal.,1999, Appl. Biochem.and Biotech. 77-79:19-34.
20            Pretreatment can also comprise contacting a lignocellulose with a chemical
   (e.g., a base, such as sodium carbonate or potassium hydroxide) at a pH of about 9 to
   about 14 at moderate temperature, pressure, and pH. See PCT Publication
   W02004/081185.
              Ammonia is used, for example, in a preferred pretreatment method. Such a
25 pretreatment method comprises subjecting a biomass material to low ammonia
   concentration under conditions of high solids. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No.
   20070031918 and PCT publication WO 06110901.

15             The enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure can comprise one or more
   cellulases. Cellulases are enzymes that hydrolyze cellulose (p-1,4-glucan or P D
   glucosidic linkages) resulting in the formation of glucose, cellobiose,
   cellooligosaccharides, and the like. Cellulases have been traditionally divided into three
   major classes: endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4) ("EG"), exoglucanases or
20 cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91) ("CBH") and p-glucosidases (P -D-glucoside
   glucohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.21) ("BG") (Knowles et al., 1987, Trends in Biotechnology
   5(9):255-261; Shulein, 1988, Methods in Enzymology, 160:234-242). Endoglucanases
   act mainly on the amorphous parts of the cellulose fiber, whereas cellobiohydrolases are
   also able to degrade crystalline cellulose.

   glucoside glucohydrolase classified as EC 3.2.1.21, and/or members of certain GH
   families, including, without limitation, members of GH families 1, 3, 9 or 48, which
   catalyze the hydrolysis of cellobiose to release p-D-glucose.
             Suitable P-glucosidase can be obtained from a number of microorganisms, by
20 recombinant means, or be purchased from commercial sources. Examples of p
   glucosidases from microorganisms include, without limitation, ones from bacteria and
   fungi. For example, a p-glucosidase of the present disclosure is suitably obtained from a
   filamentous fungus.
             The p-glucosidases can be obtained, or produced recombinantly, from, inter
25 alia, Aspergillus aculeatus (Kawaguchi et al. Gene 1996, 173: 287-288), Aspergillus
   kawachi (Iwashita et al. Apple. Environ. Microbiol. 1999, 65: 5546-5553), Aspergillus
   oryzae (WO 2002/095014), Cellulomonas biazotea (Wong et al. Gene, 1998, 207:79-86),
   Penicillium funiculosum (WO 2004/078919), Saccharomycopsis fibuligera (Machida et al.
   Apple. Environ. Microbiol. 1988, 54: 3147-3155), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Wood et
30 al. Nature 2002, 415: 871-880), or Trichoderma reesei (e.g., P-glucosidase 1 (U.S.
   Patent No. 6,022,725), P-glucosidase 3 (U.S. Patent No.6,982,159), P- glucosidase 4
   (U.S. Patent No. 7,045,332), P-glucosidase 5 (US Patent No. 7,005,289), P-glucosidase
                                                -83-

   6 (U.S. Publication No. 20060258554), P-glucosidase 7 (U.S. Publication No.
   20060258554)).
              The P-glucosidase can be produced by expressing an endogenous or
   exogenous gene encoding a P-glucosidase. For example, P-glucosidase can be
 5 secreted into the extracellular space e.g., by Gram-positive organisms (e.g., Bacillus or
   Actinomycetes), or eukaryotic hosts (e.g., Trichoderma, Aspergillus, Saccharomyces, or
   Pichia). The p-glucosidase can be, in some circumstances, overexpressed or
   underexpressed.
              The P-glucosidase can also be obtained from commercial sources. Examples of
10 commercial P-glucosidase preparation suitable for use in the present disclosure include,
   for example, Trichoderma reesei p-glucosidase in Accellerase* BG (Danisco US Inc.,
   Genencor); NOVOZYM T M 188 (a P-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger); Agrobacterium
   sp. P-glucosidase, and Thermatoga maritima P-glucosidase from Megazyme (Megazyme
   International Ireland Ltd., Ireland.).
15            Moreover, the p-glucosidase can be a component of a whole cellulase, as
   described in Section 6.3.5.4 below.
              p-glucosidase activity can be determined by a number of suitable means known
   in the art, such as the assay described by Chen et al., in Biochimica et Biophysica Acta
   1992, 121:54-60, wherein 1 pNPG denotes 1 pmoL of Nitrophenol liberated from 4
20 nitrophenyl-p-D-glucopyranoside in 10 min at 500C (122"F) and pH 4.8.
                           6.3.5.2        Endoglucanases
              The enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure optionally comprise one or
   more endoglucanase. Any endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4) can be used in the methods and
   compositions of the present disclosure. An endoglucanse can be produced by
25 expressing an endogenous or exogenous endoglucanase gene. The endoglucanase
   can be, in some circumstances, overexpressed or underexpressed.
              For example, Trichoderma reesei EG1 (Penttila et al., Gene 1986, 63:103-112)
   and/or EG2 (Saloheimo et al., Gene 1988, 63:11-21) are suitably used in the methods

             Any cellobiohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.91) ("CBH") can be optionally used in the
   methods and blends/compositions of the present disclosure. The cellobiohydrolase can
20 be produced by expressing an endogeneous or exogeneous cellobiohydrolase gene.
   The cellobiohydrolase can be, in some circumstances, overexpressed or under
   expressed.
             For example, Trichoderma reesei CBHI (Shoemaker et al. Bio/Technology

                            6.3.5.4        Whole Cellulases
              An enzyme blend/composition of the disclosure can further comprise a whole
   cellulase. As used herein, a "whole cellulase" refers to either a naturally occurring or a
   non-naturally occurring cellulase-containing composition comprising at least 3 different
15 enzyme types: (1) an endoglucanase, (2) a cellobiohydrolase, and (3) a p-glucosidase,
   or comprising at least 3 different enzymatic activities: (1) an endoglucanase activity,
   which catalyzes the cleavage of internal P-1,4 linkages, resulting in shorter
   glucooligosaccharides, (2) a cellobiohydrolase activity, which catalyzes an "exo"-type
   release of cellobiose units (P-1,4 glucose-glucose disaccharide), and (3) a P-glucosidase
20 activity, which catalyzes the release of glucose monomer from short
   cellooligosaccharides (e.g., cellobiose).
              A "naturally occurring cellulase-containing" composition is one produced by a
   naturally occurring source, which comprises one or more cellobiohydrolase-type, one or
   more endoglucanase- type, and one or more P-glucosidase-type components or
25 activities, wherein each of these components or activities is found at the ratio and level
   produced in nature, untouched by the human hand. Accordingly, a naturally occurring
   cellulase-containing composition is, for example, one that is produced by an organism
   unmodified with respect to the cellulolytic enzymes such that the ratio or levels of the
   component enzymes are unaltered from that produced by the native organism in nature.
30 A "non-naturally occurring cellulase-containing composition" refers to a composition
   produced by: (1) combining component cellulolytic enzymes either in a naturally
   occurring ratio or a non-naturally occurring, i.e., altered, ratio; or (2) modifying an
   organism to overexpress or underexpress one or more cellulolytic enzymes; or (3)
                                                -86-

   modifying an organism such that at least one cellulolytic enzyme is deleted. A "non
   naturally occurring cellulase containing" composition can also refer to a composition
   resulting from adjusting the culture conditions for a naturally-occurring organism, such
   that the naturally-occurring organism grows under a non-native condition, and produces
 5 an altered level or ratio of enzymes. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the whole
   cellulase preparation of the present disclosure can have one or more EGs and/or CBHs
   and/or P-glucosidases deleted and/or overexpressed.
             In the present disclosure, a whole cellulase preparation can be from any
   microorganism that is capable of hydrolyzing a cellulosic material. In some
10 embodiments, the whole cellulase preparation is a filamentous fungal whole cellulase.
   For example, the whole cellulase preparation can be from an Acremonium, Aspergillus,
   Emericella, Fusarium, Humicola, Mucor, Myceliophthora, Neurospora, Penicillium,
   Scytalidium, Thielavia, Tolypocladium, or Trichoderma species. The whole cellulase
   preparation is, for examplean Aspergillus aculeatus, Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus
15 foetidus, Aspergillus japonicus, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus niger, or Aspergillus
   oryzae whole cellulase. Moreover, the whole cellulase preparation can be a Fusarium
   bactridioides, Fusarium cerealis, Fusarium crookwellense, Fusarium culmorum,
   Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium graminum, Fusarium heterosporum, Fusarium
   negundi, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium reticulatum, Fusarium roseum, Fusarium
20 sambucinum, Fusarium sarcochroum, Fusarium sporotrichioides, Fusarium sulphureum,
   Fusarium torulosum, Fusarium trichothecioides, or Fusarium venenatum whole cellulase
   preparation. The whole cellulase preparation can also be a Humicola insolens, Humicola
   lanuginosa, Mucor miehei, Myceliophthora thermophila, Neurospora crassa, Penicillium
   purpurogenum, Penicillium funiculosum, Scytalidium thermophilum, or Thielavia terrestris
25 whole cellulase preparation. Moreover, the whole cellulase preparation can be a
    Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma koningii, Trichoderma longibrachiatum,
    Trichoderma reesei (e.g., RL-P37 (Sheir-Neiss G et al. Apple. Microbiol. Biotechnology,
   1984, 20, pp.46-53), QM9414 (ATCC No. 26921), NRRL 15709, ATCC 13631, 56764,
   56466, 56767), or a Trichoderma viride (e.g., ATCC 32098 and 32086) whole cellulase
30 preparation.
             The whole cellulase preparation can, in particular, suitably be a Trichoderma
   reesei RutC30 whole cellulase preparation, which is available from the American Type
   Culture Collection as Trichoderma reesei ATCC 56765. For example, the whole
                                                -87-

   cellulase preparation can also suitably be a whole cellulase of Penicillium funiculosum,
   which is available from the American Type Culture Collection as Penicillium funiculosum
   ATCC Number: 10446.
               The whole cellulase preparation can also be obtained from commercial
 5 sources. Examples of commercial cellulase preparations suitable for use in the methods
   and compositions of the present disclosure include, for example, CELLUCLASTTM and
   Cellic T M (Novozymes A/S) and LAMINEX       TM               TM                TM
                                                    BG, IndiAge     44L, Primafast    100,
   PrimafastTM 200, SpezymeTM CP, Accellerasel 1000 and Accellerasel 1500 (Danisco
   US. Inc., Genencor).
10             Suitable whole cellulase preparations can be made using any microorganism
   cultivation methods known in the art, especially fermentation, resulting in the expression
   of enzymes capable of hydrolyzing a cellulosic material. As used herein, "fermentation"
   refers to shake flask cultivation, small- or large-scale fermentation, such as continuous,
   batch, fed-batch, or solid state fermentations in laboratory or industrial fermenters
15 performed in a suitable medium and under conditions that allow the cellulase and/or
   enzymes of interest to be expressed and/or isolated.
               Generally, the microorganism is cultivated in a cell culture medium suitable for
   production of enzymes capable of hydrolyzing a cellulosic material. The cultivation takes
   place in a suitable nutrient medium comprising carbon and nitrogen sources and
20 inorganic salts, using procedures and variations known in the art. Suitable culture media,
   temperature ranges and other conditions for growth and cellulase production are known
   in the art. As a non-limiting example, a typical temperature range for the production of
   cellulases by Trichoderma reesel is 24 0 C to 28 0 C
               The whole cellulase preparation can be used as it is produced by fermentation
25 with no or minimal recovery and/or purification. For example, once cellulases are
   secreted into the cell culture medium, the cell culture medium containing the cellulases
   can be used directly. The whole cellulase preparation can comprise the unfractionated
   contents of fermentation material, including the spent cell culture medium, extracellular
   enzymes and cells. On the other hand, the whole cellulase preparation can also be
30 subject to further processing in a number of routine steps, e.g., precipitation,
   centrifugation, affinity chromatography, filtration, or the like. For example, the whole
   cellulase preparation can be concentrated, and then used without further purification.
                                                  -88-

   The whole cellulase preparation can, for example, be formulated to comprise certain
   chemical agents that decrease cell viability or kills the cells after fermentation. The cells
   can, for example, be lysed or permeabilized using methods known in the art.
             The endoglucanase activity of the whole cellulase preparation can be
 5 determined using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as a substrate. A suitable assay
   measures the production of reducing ends created by the enzyme mixture acting on
   CMC wherein 1 unit is the amount of enzyme that liberates 1 pmoL of product/min
   (Ghose, T. K., Pure & Appl. Chem. 1987, 59, pp. 257-268).
             The whole cellulase can be a P-glucosidase-enriched cellulase. The P
10 glucosidase-enriched whole cellulase generally comprises a P-glucosidase and a whole
   cellulase preparation. The P-glucosidase-enriched whole cellulase compositions can be
   produced by recombinant means. For example, such a whole cellulase preparation can
   be achieved by expressing a P-glucosidase in a microorganism capable of producing a
   whole cellulase The p-glucosidase-enriched whole cellulase composition can also, for
15 example, comprise a whole cellulase preparation and a P-glucosidase. For instance, the
   p-glucosidase-enriched whole cellulase composition can suitably comprise at least 5
   wt.%, 7 wt.%, 10 wt.%, 15 wt.% or 20 wt.%, and up to 25 wt.%, 30 wt.%, 35 wt.%, 40
   wt.%, or 50 wt.% p-glucosidase based on the total weight of proteins in that
   blend/composition.

   Trichoderma harzianum xylanase (Rose et al. 1987, J. Mol. Biol.194(4):755-756).
             The xylanase can be produced by expressing an endogenous or exogenous
   gene encoding a xylanase. The xylanase can be, in some circumstances,
15 overexpressed or underexpressed.
                       6.3.7      p-Xvlosidases
             The enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure, for example, can
   suitablycomprise one or more P-xylosidases. For example,the p-xylosidase is a Group 1
   P-xylosidase enzyme (e.g., an Fv3A or an Fv43A) or a Group 2 P-xylosidase enzyme

             The P-xylosidase can be produced by expressing an endogenous or exogenous
   gene encoding a P-xylosidase. The P-xylosidase can be, in some circumstances,
10 overexpressed or underexpressed.

             The enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure can, for example, suitably
   comprise one or more L-a-arabinofuranosidases. The L-a-arabinofuranosidase is, for
   example, an Af43A, an Fv43B, a Pf51A, a Pa51A, or an Fv51A. Af43A, Fv43B, Pf51A,
15 Pa5lA, and Fv51A polypeptides are described in Section 6.1 above.
             The enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure optionally comprise one or
   more L-a-arabinofuranosidases in addition to or in place of the foregoing L-a
   arabinofuranosidases. L-a-arabinofuranosidases (EC 3.2.1.55) from any suitable
   organism can be used as the additional L-a-arabinofuranosidases. Suitable L-a
20 arabinofuranosidases include, e.g., an L-a-arabinofuranosidases of Aspergillus oryzae

             The L-a-arabinofuranosidase can be produced by expressing an endogenous
   or exogenous gene encoding an L-a-arabinofuranosidase. The L-a-arabinofuranosidase
   can be, in some circumstances, overexpressed or underexpressed.
15                     6.3.9       Accessory proteins
             The enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure can, for example, suitably
   further comprise one or more accessory proteins. Examples of accessory proteins

25 cellobiose dehydrogenases and manganese peroxidases. In particular embodiments,
   the cellulose disrupting proteins are cellulose binding modules.
           6.4     Further Applications
             In addition to saccharification of biomass, the enzymes and/or enzyme
   blends/compositions of the disclosure can be used in industrial, agricultural, food and
30 feed, as well as food and feed supplement processing processes. Exemplary
   applications are described below.
                                                 -92-

                       6.4.1       Wood, Paper and Pulp Treatments
             The enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions, and methods of the disclosure can
   be used in wood, wood product, wood waste or by-product, paper, paper product, paper
   or wood pulp, Kraft pulp, or wood or paper recycling treatment or industrial process.
 5 These processes include, e.g., treatments of wood, wood pulp, paper waste, paper, or
   pulp, or deinking of wood or paper. The enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the
   disclosure can be, for example, used to treat/pretreat paper pulp, or recycled paper or
   paper pulp, and the like. The enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure
   can be used to increase the "brightness" of the paper when they are included in the
10 paper, pulp, recycled paper or paper pulp treatment/pretreatment. It can be appreciated
   that the higher the grade of paper, the greater the brightness; the brightness can impact
   the scan capability of optical scanning equipment. As such, the enzymes, enzyme
   blends/compositions, and methods/processes can be used to make high grade, "bright"
   papers, including inkjet, laser and photo printing quality paper.
15           The enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure can be used to
   process or treat a number of other cellulosic material, including, e.g., fibers from wood,
   cotton, hemp, flax or linen.
             Accordingly, the disclosure provides wood, wood pulp, paper, paper pulp, paper
   waste or wood or paper recycling treatment processes using an enzyme, enzyme
20 blend/composition of the disclosure.
              The enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure can be used for
   deinking printed wastepaper, such as newspaper, or for deinking noncontact-printed
   wastepaper, e.g., xerographic and laser-printed paper, and mixtures of contact and
   noncontact-printed wastepaper, as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,767,728 or 6,426,200;
25 Neo, J. Wood Chem. Tech. 1986, 6(2):147. They can also be used to produce xylose
   from a paper-grade hardwood pulp in a process involving extracting xylan contained in
   pulp into a liquid phase, subjecting the xylan contained in the obtained liquid phase to
   conditions sufficient to hydrolyze xylan to xylose, and recovering the xylose. The
   extracting step, for example, can include at least one treatment of an aqueous
30 suspension of pulp or an alkali-soluble material by an enzyme or an enzyme
   blend/composition (see, U.S. Patent No. 6,512,110). The enzymes, enzyme
   blends/compositions of the disclosure can be used to dissolve pulp from cellulosic fibers
   such as recycled paper products made from hardwood fiber, a mixture of hardwood fiber
                                                -93-

   and softwood fiber, waste paper, e.g., from unprinted envelopes, de-inked envelopes,
   unprinted ledger paper, de-inked ledger paper, and the like, as described in, e.g., U.S.
   Patent No. 6,254,722.
                        6.4.2       Treating Fibers and Textiles
 5             The disclosure provides methods of treating fibers and fabrics using one or
   more enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure. The enzymes, enzyme
   blends/compositions can be used in any fiber- or fabric-treating method, which are
   known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,261,828; 6,077,316; 6,024,766;
   6,021,536; 6,017,751; 5,980,581; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20020142438 Al. For
10 example, enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure can be used in fiber
   and/or fabric desizing. The feel and appearance of a fabric can be, for example,
   improved by a method comprising contacting the fabric with an enzyme or enzyme
   blend/composition of the disclosure in a solution. Optionally, the fabric is treated with the
   solution under pressure. The enzymes, enzyme blends/composition of the disclosure
15 can also be used to remove stains.
               The enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure can be used to
   treat a number of other cellulosic material, including fibers (e.g., fibers from cotton,
   hemp, flax or linen), sewn and unsewn fabrics, e.g., knits, wovens, denims, yarns, and
   toweling, made from cotton, cotton blends or natural or manmade cellulosics or blends
20 thereof. The textile treating processes can be used in conjunction with other textile
   treatments, e.g., scouring and/or bleaching. Scouring, for example, is the removal of
   non-cellulosic material from the cotton fiber, e.g., the cuticle (mainly consisting of waxes)
   and primary cell wall (mainly consisting of pectin, protein and xyloglucan).
                        6.4.3       Treating Foods and Food Processing
25             The enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure have numerous
   applications in food processing industry. They can, for example, be used to improve
   extraction of oil from oil-rich plant material, e.g., oil-rich seeds. The enzymes, enzyme
   blends/compositions of the disclosure can be used to extract soybean oil from soybeans,
   olive oil from olives, rapeseed oil from rapeseed, or sunflower oil from sunflower seeds.
30             The enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure can also be used
   to separate components of plant cell materials. For example, they can be used to
   separate plant cells into components. The enzymes, enzyme blends/ compositions of
                                                  -94-

   the disclosure can also be used to separate crops into protein, oil, and hull fractions.
   The separation process can be performed using known methods.
             The enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure can, in addition to
   the uses above, be used to increase yield in the preparation of fruit or vegetable juices,
 5 syrups, extracts and the like. They can also be used in the enzymatic treatment of
   various plant cell wall-derived materials or waste materials from, e.g., cereals, grains,
   wine or juice production, or agricultural residues such as, e.g., vegetable hulls, bean
   hulls, sugar beet pulp, olive pulp, potato pulp, and the like. Further, they can be used to
   modify the consistency and/or appearance of processed fruits or vegetables.
10 Additionally, they can be used to treat plant material so as to facilitate processing of the
   plant material (including foods), purification or extraction of plant components. The
   enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure can be used to improve feed
   value, decrease the water binding capacity, improve the degradability in waste water
   plants and/or improve the conversion of plant material to ensilage, and the like.
15           The enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure can also be used
   in baking applications. In some embodiments, they are used to create non-sticky doughs
   that are not difficult to machines and to reduce biscuit sizes. They can also be used to
   hydrolyze arabinoxylans to prevent rapid rehydration of the baked product that can lead
   to loss of crispiness and reduced shelf-life. For example, they are used as additives in
20 dough processing.
                        6.4.4      Animal Feeds and Food or Feed or Food Additives
             The disclosure provides methods for treating animal feeds and foods and food
   or feed additives (supplements) using enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the
   disclosure. Animals including mammals (e.g., humans), birds, fish, and the like. The
25 disclosure provides animal feeds, foods, and additives (supplements) comprising
   enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure. Treating animal feeds, foods
   and additives using enzymes of the disclosure can help in the availability of nutrients,
   e.g., starch, protein, and the like, in the animal feed or additive (supplements). By
   breaking down difficult to digest proteins or indirectly or directly unmasking starch (or
30 other nutrients), the enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions can make nutrients more
   accessible to other endogenous or exogenous enzymes. They can also simply cause
   the release of readily digestible and easily absorbed nutrients and sugars.
                                                  -95-

               When added to animal feed, enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the
   disclosure improve the in vivo break-down of plant cell wall material partly by reducing
   the intestinal viscosity (see, e.g., Bedford et al., Proceedings of the 1st Symposium on
   Enzymes in Animal Nutrition, 1993, pp. 73-77), whereby a better utilization of the plant
 5 nutrients by the animal is achieved. Thus, by using enzymes, enzyme
   blends/compositions of the disclosure in feeds, the growth rate and/or feed conversion
   ratio (i.e., the weight of ingested feed relative to weight gain) of the animal can be
   improved.
               The animal feed additive of the disclosure may be a granulated enzyme product
10 which can be readily mixed with feed components. Alternatively, feed additives of the
   disclosure can form a component of a pre-mix. The granulated enzyme product of the
   disclosure may be coated or uncoated. The particle size of the enzyme granulates can
   be compatible with that of the feed and/or the pre-mix components. This provides a safe
   and convenient mean of incorporating enzymes into feeds. Alternatively, the animal feed
15 additive of the disclosure can be a stabilized liquid composition. This may be an
   aqueous- or oil-based slurry. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,245,546.
               An enzyme, enzyme blend/composition of the disclosure can be supplied by
   expressing the enzymes directly in transgenic feed crops (e.g., as transgenic plants,
   seeds and the like), such as grains, cereals, corn, soy bean, rape seed, lupin and the
20 like. As discussed above, the disclosure provides transgenic plants, plant parts and
   plant cells comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide of the disclosure.
   The nucleic acid is expressed such that the enzyme of the disclosure is produced in
   recoverable quantities. The xylanase can be recovered from any plant or plant part.
   Alternatively, the plant or plant part containing the recombinant polypeptide can be used
25 as such for improving the quality of a food or feed, e.g., improving nutritional value,
   palatability, and rheological properties, or to destroy an antinutritive factor.
               The disclosure provides methods for removing oligosaccharides from feed prior
   to consumption by an animal subject using an enzyme, enzyme blend/composition of the
   disclosure. In this process a feed is formed to have an increased metabolizable energy
30 value. In addition to enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure,
   galactosidases, cellulases, and combinations thereof can be used.
                                                  -96-

              The disclosure provides methods for utilizing an enzyme, an enzyme
   blend/composition of the disclosure as a nutritional supplement in the diets of animals by
   preparing a nutritional supplement containing a recombinant enzyme of the disclosure,
   and administering the nutritional supplement to an animal to increase the utilization of
 5 hemicellulase contained in food ingested by the animal.
                        6.4.5      Waste Treatment
              The enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure can be used in a
   variety of other industrial applications, e.g., in waste treatment. For example, in one
   aspect, the disclosure provides a solid waste digestion process using the enzymes,
10 enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure. The methods can comprise reducing the
   mass and volume of substantially untreated solid waste. Solid waste can be treated with
   an enzymatic digestive process in the presence of an enzymatic solution (including the
   enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure) at a controlled temperature.
   This results in a reaction without appreciable bacterial fermentation from added
15 microorganisms. The solid waste is converted into a liquefied waste and any residual
   solid waste. The resulting liquefied waste can be separated from said any residual
   solidified waste. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,709,796.
                        6.4.6       Detergent, Disinfectant and Cleaning Compositions
              The disclosure provides detergent, disinfectant or cleanser (cleaning or
20 cleansing) compositions comprising one or more enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions
   of the disclosure, and methods of making and using these compositions. The disclosure
   incorporates all known methods of making and using detergent, disinfectant or cleanser
   compositions. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,413,928; 6,399,561; 6,365,561; 6,380,147.
              In specific embodiments, the detergent, disinfectant or cleanser compositions
25 can be a one- and two-part aqueous composition, a non-aqueous liquid composition, a
   cast solid, a granular form, a particulate form, a compressed tablet, a gel and/or a paste
   and a slurry form. The enzymes, enzyme blends/compositions of the disclosure can also
   be used as a detergent, disinfectant, or cleanser additive product in a solid or a liquid
   form. Such additive products are intended to supplement or boost the performance of
30 conventional detergent compositions, and can be added at any stage of the cleaning
   process.
                                                  -97-

              The present disclosure provides cleaning compositions including detergent
   compositions for cleaning hard surfaces, detergent compositions for cleaning fabrics,
   dishwashing compositions, oral cleaning compositions, denture cleaning compositions,
   and contact lens cleaning solutions.
 5            When the enzymes of the disclosure are components of compositions suitable
   for use in a laundry machine washing method, the compositions can comprise, in
   addition to an enzyme, enzyme blend/composition of the disclosure, both a surfactant
   and a builder compound. They can additionally comprise one or more detergent
   components, e.g., organic polymeric compounds, bleaching agents, additional enzymes,
10 suds suppressors, dispersants, lime-soap dispersants, soil suspension and anti
   redeposition agents, and corrosion inhibitors.
              Laundry compositions of the disclosure can also contain softening agents, as
   additional detergent components. Such compositions containing carbohydrase can
   provide fabric cleaning, stain removal, whiteness maintenance, softening, color
15 appearance, dye transfer inhibition and sanitization when formulated as laundry
   detergent compositions.
              The disclosure thus further provides a process of saccharification a biomass
   material comprising hemicellulose. Such a biomass material can optionally comprise
   cellulose. Exemplary biomass materials include, without limitation, corcob, switchgrass,
20 sorghum, and/or bagasse. Accordingly the disclosure provides a process of
   saccharification, comprising treating a biomass material herein comprising hemicelluose
   and optionally cellose with an enzyme blend/composition as described herein. The
   enzyme blend/compositon used in such a processs of the invention include 0.5 g to 40 g

25 0.5 g to 7 g, etc) of polypeptides having xylanase activity per kg of hemicellulose in the
   biomass material. The enzyme blend/composition used in such a process of the
   invention can also include 1 g to 40 g (e.g., 2 g to 20 g, 3 g to 7 g, 1 g to 5 g, or 2 g to 5
   g, etc.) of polypeptides having xylanase activity per kg of hemicellulose in the biomass
   material. The enzyme blend/composition used in such a process can include 0.5 g to 50
30 g (e.g., 0.5 g to 50 g, 0.5 g to 45 g, 0.5 g to 40 g, 0.5 g to 30 g, 0.5 g to 25 g, 0.5 g to 20
   g, 0.5 g to 15 g, 0.5 g to 10 g, etc) of polypeptides having p-xylosidase activity per kg of
   hemicellulose in the biomass material. The enzyme blend/composition used in such a
   process can also include 1 g to 50 g (e.g., 2 g to 40 g, 4 g to 20 g, 4 g to 10 g, 2 g to 10
                                                  -98-

   the biomass material. The enzyme blend/compositon used in such a process of the
   invention can include 0.2 g to 20 g (e.g., 0.2 g to 18 g, 0.2 g to 15 g, 0.3 g to 10 g, 0.2 g
   to 8 g, 0.2 g to 5 g, etc) of polypeptides having L-a-arabinofuranosidase activity per kg of
 5 hemicellolose in the biomass material. The enzyme blend/composition used in such a
   process of the invention can include 0.5 g to 20 g (e.g., 1 g to 10 g, 1 g to 5 g, 2 g to 6 g,
   0.5 g to 4 g, or 1 g to 3 g, etc) of polypeptides having L-ax-arabinofuranosidase activity
   per kg of hemicellolose in the biomass material. The enzyme blend/composition can
   also include 1 g to 100 g (e.g., 1 g to 100 g, 2 g to 80 g, 3 g to 50 g, 5 g to 40 g, 2 g to 20
10 g, 10 g to 30 g, or 12 g to 18 g, etc) of polypeptides having cellulase activity per kg of
   cellulose in the biomass material.     Optionally, the amount of polypeptides having p
   glucosidase activity can constitute up to 50% of the total weight of polypeptides having
   cellulase activity.
             A suitable process of the invention preferably yields 60% to 90% xylose from
15 the hemicellulose xylan of the biomass material treated. Suitable biomass materials
   include one or more of, for example, corncob, switchgrass, sorghum, and/or bagasse.
   As such, a process of the invention preferably yields at least 70% (e.g. at least 75%, at
   least 80%) xylose from hemicellulose xylan from one or more of these biomass
   materials. For example, the process yields 60% to 90% of xylose from hemicellulose
20 xylan of a biomass material comprising hemicellulose, including, without limitation,
   corncob, switchgrass, sorghum, and/or bagasse.
             The process of the invention optionally further comprises recovering
   monosaccharides.
             The invention is further illustrated by the following examples. The examples are
25 provided for illustrative purposes only. They are not to be construed as limiting the
   scope or content of the invention in any way.

             The following assays/methods were used in Example 1 and subsequent
30 examples.     Any deviations from the protocols provided below are indicated.
                                                  -99-

                         7.1.1      Preparation of hemicellulose from plant tissues
               Hemicellulose preparations were prepared using a modification of the
   NaOH/sonication procedure described by Erbringerova et al. (Carbohydrate Polymers
   1998, 37:231). Dry plant material was ground to pass a 1 mm screen and 10 g of this
 5 material was suspended in 250 mL of 5% (wt/v) NaOH. The suspension was heated to
   800C without stirring for 30 min then sonicated for 15 min at ambient temperature using a
   probe sonicator at high setting. The suspension was returned to 800C for an additional
   30 min then allowed to cool to room temperature. Solids were removed from the
   suspension by centrifugation at 3000 x g for 15 min and the resulting supernatant was
10 decanted into 1 L of ethanol which was cooled on ice. After 30 min the resulting
   precipitate was recovered by first decanting the clear liquid above the precipitate then
   filtration without allowing the precipitate to fully air dry. The filter cake was first washed
   with 200 mL of cold, 80% ethanol then removed from the filter without allowing it to air
   dry. The filter cake was re-dissolved in 200 mL of water and the pH of the solution was
15 adjusted to 5.5 with acetic acid. The extracted carbohydrate was re-precipitated by
   addition to 1 L of ethanol on ice and the resulting precipitate was again recovered by
   filtration as above. The filter cake was frozen and remaining solvent and water was
   removed by lyophylization. Yield of recovered carbohydrate ranged from 6 to 23% of the
   starting plant material depending on the tissue and the preparation.
20                       7.1.2      Dilute ammonia pretreatment of biomass substrates
               Corncob and switchgrass were pretreated prior to enzymatic hydrolysis
   according to the methods and processing ranges described in W006110901A (unless
   otherwise noted).
                         7.1.3      Compositional analysis of biomass
25             The 2-step acid hydrolysis methods described in "Determination of structural
   carbohydrates and lignin in the biomass" (National Renewable Energy Laboratory,
   Golden, CO 2008, available at http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/42618.pdf) were used
   to measure the composition of biomass substrates. Enzymatic hydrolysis results are
   reported in terms of percent conversion with respect to the theoretical yield from the
30 starting glucan and xylan content of the substrate.
                                                 -100-

                       7.1.4        Preparation of crude oligomers from ammonia
                       pretreated corncob
             Crude oligomers for screening hemicellulases were prepared from corncob by
   the following procedure. Hammer-milled corncob (~1/4 in mean diameter) plus 6%
 5 ammonia (w/w) was heated to 145 0 C with direct injection of steam into a stirred pressure
   reactor. After 20 min excess ammonia was flashed out of the reactor at a final vacuum
   of -0.1 bar. The ammonia pretreated cob was then placed in a sterile stirred reactor for
   enzyme saccharification. Enough water was added to obtain a final total solids loading
   of 25% (w/w) after all additions are made. The pH of the reactor was maintained at pH
10 5.3 with 4 N sulfuric acid and the temperature controlled at 470C. Spezyme* CP,
   Multifect*Xylanase (Danisco US Inc., Genencor), and Novo 188 (Novozymes, Denmark)
   were added at loadings of 20, 10 and 5 mg/g of cellulose, respectively, and allowed to
   saccharify the pretreated cob to sugars and oligomers for 116 h. The material was then
   cooled to 330C and the pH adjusted to 5.8 with 4 N NaOH. The glucose and xylose were
15 then fermented to ethanol by adding a seed culture of a recombinant Zymomonas
   mobilis strain (10% total volume, ATCC accession no. PTA-1798) as described in U.S.
   7,354,755. The fermentation progress was followed until all of the glucose and -95% of
   the xylose was consumed. A 0.5 L aliquot of the fermentation broth was clarified by
   centrifugation (21,000 x g) for 20 min followed by filtration of the supernatant through a
20 0.2 micron filtering unit (Nalgene). The ethanol was removed from the filtered
   fermentation broth on a rotovap maintained at 350C under house vacuum. The total
   volume of the final liquor was reduced by ~4x by the latter procedure.
                       7.1.5        Total Protein assays
             Different total protein determination methods were employed depending on the
25 nature of the protein sample (i.e., purified, fermentation broth, commercial product, etc.).
   The BCA protein assay is an example of a colorimetric assay that measures protein
   concentration with a spectrophotometer.
             Reagents: BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Chemical, Product #23227), 50 mM
   Sodium Acetate buffer pH 5.0, 15% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), 0.1 N NaOH, BSA stock
30 solution, Reagent A, Reagent B (from protein assay kit)
             Procedure: Enzyme dilutions were prepared in test tubes using 50 mM Sodium
   Acetate buffer. Diluted enzyme solution (0.1 mL) was added to 2 mL Eppendorf
   centrifuge tubes containing 1 mL 15% TCA. The tubes were vortexed and placed in an
                                                -101-

   ice bath for 10 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 6 min. The
   supernatant was poured out, the pellet resuspended in 1 mL 0.1 N NaOH, and the tubes
   vortexed until the pellet dissolved. BSA standard solutions were prepared from a stock
   solution of 2 mg/mL. BCA working solution was prepared by mixing 0.5 mL Reagent B
 5 with 25 mL Reagent A. The resuspended protein (0.1 mL each) was added to 3
   Eppendorf centrifuge tubes. Two mL Pierce BCA working solution was added to each of
   the sample and serially diluted BSA standard Eppendorf tubes. All tubes were incubated
   in a 370C water bath for 30 min. The samples were then cooled to room temperature (15
   min) and the absorbance measured at 562 nm in a spectrophotometer.
10            Calculations: Average values for each BSA protein standard absorbance were
   calculated and plotted, absorbance on x-axis and concentration (mg/mL) on the y-axis. A
   linear curve fit was applied and the equation for the line calculated using the formula:
   y=mx +b
              The raw concentration of the enzyme samples was calculated by substituting
15 the absorbance for the x- value. The total protein concentration was calculated by
   multiplying with the dilution factor.
              The total protein of purified samples was determined by A280 (see, e.g., Pace
   et al., Protein Science, 1995, 4:2411).
              Some protein samples were measured using the Biuret method as modified by
20 Weichselbaum and Gornall using Bovine Serum Albumin as a calibrator (modified Biuret)
   (Weichselbaum, Amer. J. Clin. Path. 1960, 16:40; Gornall et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1949,
   177:752).
              Total protein content of fermentation products was also sometimes measured
   as total nitrogen by combustion, capture and measurement of released nitrogen, either
25 by Kjeldahl (rtech laboratories, www.rtechlabs.com ) or in-house by the DUMAS method
   (TruSpec CN, www.leco.com ) (SADER, et al. Archives of Veterinary Science, 9(2):73
   79, 2004). For complex protein-containing samples, e.g. fermentation broths, an average
   16% N content, and the conversion factor of 6.25 for nitrogen to protein was used. In
   some cases, total precipitable protein was measured to remove interfering non-protein
30 nitrogen. A 12.5 % final TCA concentration was used and the protein-containing TCA
   pellet was resuspended in 0.1 M NaOH.
                                                -102-

             In other cases, Coomassie Plus- the Better Bradford Assay (Thermo Scientific,
   Rockford, IL product #23238) was used according to manufacturer recommendation.
                       7.1.6      Synthetic substrate (para-nitrophenyl substrate)
                       activity assays
 5           Active protein from T. reesei expression of cloned genes was confirmed with
   model substrate assays. Cellulase and hemicellulase activities on the synthetic
   substrates, such as 4-nitrophenyl a-L-arabinofuranoside (pNPA, Sigma N3641) and 4
   nitrophenyl p-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG, Sigma N7006), and 4-nitrophenyl p-D
   xylopyranoside (pNPX, Sigma N2132) were measured as follows: Substrate solution was
10 prepared by dissolving 30 mg of synthetic substrate in 100 mL 50 mM Sodium Acetate
   buffer, pH 4.8. Sodium carbonate (1 M) was prepared for reaction quenching. Substrate
   solution (100 pL) was dispensed into Costar 96 well plates (Cat no. 9017). 20 pL of
   enzyme sample was dispensed into a microtiter plate well. The microtiter plate was
   incubated at 500C for 10 min using a Thermomixer R heating and cooling shaker
15 (Eppendorf). 50 pL of 1 M sodium carbonate was added to each well to quench the
   reaction. Absorbance at 400 nm wavelength was read with SpectraMax 340C384
   Microplate Spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). Units per mL were determined by
   using a p-nitrophenol standard curve. A Quad-delete Trichoderma host, from which the
   cbh1, cbh2, egil and egI2 genes were deleted (see WO 05/001036), was analyzed with
20 the enzyme samples as a control for the activity of enzymes expressed in this
   background.
                       7.1.7      Cob saccharification assay
             Typically, Corncob saccharification in a microtiter plate format was performed in
   accordance with the following procedures. The biomass substrate, dilute ammonia
25 pretreated corncob, was diluted in water and pH-adjusted with sulfuric acid to create a
   pH 5, 7% cellulose slurry that was used directly in the assay. The enzymes tested
   included: commercial cellulase products, e.g. Accellerase* 1000, Accellerase* 1500
   (Danisco US Inc., Genencor), T. reeseifermentation broths, and purified enzymes. The
   enzymes were loaded based on mg total protein per gram of cellulose (as determined by
30 compositional analysis) in the corncob substrate. The enzymes were diluted in 50 mM
   Sodium Acetate pH 5.0 to obtain the desired loading concentration at the required
   volume. Forty microliters of enzyme solution was added to 70 mg of dilute-ammonia
   pretreated corncob at 7% cellulose per well (equivalent to 4.5% cellulose final). The
                                              -103-

   assay plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The assay plates were
   covered with aluminum plate sealers and the plates incubated at 500C, 200 rpm, for
   three days. At the end of the incubation period, the saccharification reaction was
   quenched by adding 100 pL of 100 mM glycine buffer, pH10.0 per well and the plate was
 5 centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 rpm. Ten microliters of the supernatant were added to 200
   pL of MilliQ water in a 96-well HPLC plate and the soluble sugars were measured by
   HPLC.
                This describes a typical method that was used in multiple Examples herein. In
   certain Examples, corncob saccharification was measured using a modified protocol.
10 The modifications are described with the individual examples.
                          7.1.8      Sugar analysis by HPLC
                Typically, samples from cob saccharification hydrolysis were prepared by
   centrifugation to clear insoluble material, filtration through a 0.22 pm nylon filter (Spin-X
   centrifuge tube filter, Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY) and dilution to an appropriate
15 concentration of soluble sugars with distilled water. Monomer sugars were determined
   on a Shodex Sugar SH-G SH1 011, 8x300mm with a 6x50 mm SH-1 011 P guard column
   (www.shodex.net). Solvent was 0.01 N H2 SO 4 run at 0.6 mL/min. Column temperature
   was 500C and detection was made using a refractive index detector. External standards
   of glucose, xylose and arabinose were run with each sample set. Certain examples
20 herein use a protocol to achieve the same end with a somewhat modified set of
   protocols. The specific modifications to the protocols are described with individual
   examples.
                Oligomeric sugars were separated by size exclusion chromatography using a
   Tosoh Biosep G2000PW column 7.5 mm x 60 cm (www.tosohbioscience.de). The
25 solvent was distilled water at 0.6 mL/min and the column was run at room temperature.
   Six carbon sugar standards used for size calibration were: stachyose, raffinose,
   cellobiose and glucose; and 5 carbon sugars were: xylohexose, xylopentose, xylotetrose,
   xylotriose, xylobiose and xylose. Xylo-oligomers were obtained from Megazyme
   (www.megazyme.com). Detection was by refractive index and when reported
30 quantitatively results are either as peak area units or relative peak areas by percent.
               Total soluble sugars were determined by acid hydrolysis of the centrifuged and
   filter clarified samples described above. The clarified sample was diluted 1:1 with 0.8 N
                                                -104-

   H2 SO 4 and the resulting solution was autoclaved in a capped vial for a total cycle time of
   1 h at 121 C. Results are reported without correction for loss of monomer sugar during
   the hydrolysis.
                        7.1.9       Protein Analysis by HPLC
 5             To separate and quantify the enzymes contained in broth from 14L
   fermentations of the integrated expression strains, liquid chromatography (LC) and mass
   spectroscopy (MS) were performed. Enzyme samples were first treated with a
   recombinantly expressed endoH glycosidase from S. plicatus (e.g., NEB P0702L).
   EndoH was used at a ratio of 0.01-0.03 pg endoH protein per pg sample total protein and
10 incubated for 3 h at 370C, pH 4.5-6.0 to enzymatically remove N-linked gycosylation prior
   to HPLC analysis. Approximately 50 pg of protein was then injected for hydrophobic
   interaction chromatography using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system with an HIC-phenyl
   column and a high-to-low salt gradient over 35 min was performed on samples of
   concentrated fermentation broth. The gradient was achieved using high salt buffer A: 4 M
15 ammonium sulphate containing 20 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.75 and low salt buffer
   B: 20 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.75.           Peaks were detected with UV light at 222 nm
   and fractions were collected and identified by mass spectroscopy.
                        7.1.10      Cellulase Activity Assay Using Calcofluor White
               Cellulase activity was measured on PASC using a calcofluor white detection
20 method (Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 161:313-317). All chemicals used were of analytical
   grade. Avicel PH-1 01 was purchased from FMC BioPolymer (Philadelphia, PA).
   Calcofluor white was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Phosphoric acid swollen
   cellulose (PASC) was prepared from Avicel PH-101 using an adapted protocol of
   Walseth, TAPPI 1971, 35:228 and Wood, Biochem. J. 1971, 121:353-362. In short,
25 Avicel was solubilized in concentrated phosphoric acid then precipitated using cold
   deionized water. After the cellulose was collected and washed with more water to
   neutralize the pH, it was diluted to 1% solids in 50 mM Sodium Acetate buffer, pH 5.0.
               All enzyme dilutions were made into 50 mM Sodium Acetate buffer, pH 5.0.
   GC220 Cellulase (Danisco US Inc., Genencor) was diluted to 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 mg
30 protein/g PASC, to produce a linear calibration curve. Samples to be tested were diluted
   to fall within the range of the calibration curve, i.e. to obtain a response of 0.1 to 0.4
   fraction product. 150 pL of cold 1% PASC was added to 20 pL of enzyme solution in 96
                                                 -105-

   well microtiter plates. The plate was covered and incubated for 2 h at 500C, 200 rpm in
   an Innova incubator/shaker. The reaction was quenched with 100 pL of 50 pg/mL
   Calcofluor in 100 mM Glycine, pH 10. Fluorescence was read on a fluorescence
   microplate reader (SpectraMax M5 by Molecular Devices) at excitation wavelength Ex =
 5 365 nm and emission wavelength Em = 435 nm. The result (shown in Figure 25) is
   expressed as the fraction product according to the equation:
   FP = 1 - (FI sample - Fl buffer)/(FI zero enzyme - Fl buffer),
       wherein FP is fraction product, and Fl = fluorescence units.
                       7.1.11      Cultivation of Fusarium verticiloidesand purification
10                     of major hemicellulase activities detected in the extracellular
                       protein
              Wild type Fusarium verticillioides source was as described in Table 1 of Fuchs
   et aL., Fungal Genetics and Biology 2004, 41:852-863. The fungus was grown using
   destarched corn grain fiber using a modification of the method described in Li etaL.,
15 Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology 2005, (121-124):321-334.
              Starch was removed from the dried corn pericarp fraction from a corn dry mill
   fractionation by slurrying 200 g of corn pericarp in 3 L of tap water and heating to 800C
   with 5 mL (500 mg) of high temperature amylase Liquozyme SC DS (Novozymes,
   Denmark). The mixture was stirred occasionally with a spatula and held at 802C for 30
20 min then allowed to cool to room temperature for about 2 h. The resulting slurry was
   decanted onto a 20 mesh screen to partially de-water. The solids on the screen were
   further washed with 4 L of tap water then air dried overnight before a final drying in an
   oven at 6 0LC. The dried material was ground to pass a 1 mm screen in a knife mill
   before use.
25            The F. verticilioides culture was maintained on potato dextrose agar (Sigma
   P6685) and a rich growth media of 24 g/L potato dextrose was inoculated with mycelia
   from the plate. The growth culture was incubated for 3 days at 300C with agitation at 130
   rpm. After 3 days growth the 150 mL of the resulting cell mass and spent media were
   used to inoculate a corn pericarp induction media. The induction media was 80 g de
30 starched corn pericarp in 1 L base media (15 g KH 2 PO4 , 5 g ammonium sulfate, 20 g
   yeast extract, 0.5 g magnesium sulfate and 1 g Tween 80 at pH4.8). The culture was
   maintained at 3 0C with agitation at 130 rpm for 7 days.
                                                -106-

              Extracellular protein was separated from the spent grain and fungal cell mass
   by centrifugation at 2,000 x G for 20 min. The partially clarified supernatant was passed
   first through a 0.45 pm filter and then through a 0.22 pm filter. The clarified filtrate was
   stored at 42C until used. The filtrate was concentrated approximately 14-fold with
 5 Amicon ultra-4 centrifugal filters with a 30 kD cutoff (Millipore).
              L-a-arabinofuranosidase (LARF) and p-xylosidase (BXL) activities were purified
   from the fungal supernatant by first exchanging the proteins into 50 mM pH 6.3 (N
   Morpholino) ethanesulphonic acid-NaOH (MES) buffer, then applying protein onto a GE
   Health Sciences Q-Sepharose Fast Flow quaternary amine anion exchange column (20
10 mL bed volume equilibrated with MES buffer). The protein purification system used was
   a GH Health Sciences Akta system using Unicorn software. Proteins were eluted with a
   0-0.5 M NaCl gradient in MES buffer.
              Activity in column fractions was monitored using either 4-nitrophenyl p-D
   xylopyranoside (for BXL activity) or 4-nitrophenyl a-L-arabinofuranoside (for LARF
15 activity). In both cases, 2 pL of the column fraction was added to 95 pL of 50 mM pH 5.0
   Sodium Acetate buffer and 5 pL of the p-nitrophenyl substrate, mixed and incubated 2
   min at 230C. 100 pL of 1 N sodium carbonate stop solution was added and absorbance
   at 405 nm was read.
              Active enzyme fractions from the anion exchange system were collected,
20 concentrated on Amicon Centriprep filtration, and applied to a GE Health Sciences SP
   Sepharose Fast Flow sulfopropyl cation exchange column (20 mL bed equilibrated with
   Sodium Acetate buffer) using the same protein purification system described above.
   Proteins were eluted with a 0-1 M NaCl gradient in Sodium Acetate buffer, and activity in
   the fractions was monitored as described above. Active fractions were then collected,
25 pooled and concentrated if necessary. Proteins in active fractions were identified by MS
   MS.
                         7.1.12     Protein Identification by MS-MS
              The identification of a representative set of Fusarium verticihioides family GH54
   L-a-arabinofuranosidase (LARF), family GH51 LARF, two family GH3 p-xylosidases and
30 a family GH30 P-xylosidase (BXL) is described below.
                                                -107-

              For the identification of GH54 LARF, 200 pL of 1 N HCI (EM Industries,
   Hawthorne, NY) was added to 250 pL of "Fraction B3" (0.35 mg protein) from the
   purification procedure described above and the sample iced for 10 min. Next, 200 pL of
   50% TCA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added and samples were iced for another
 5 10 min to precipitate protein. Samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 16,000 rcf and the
   supernatants were discarded. The pelleted protein was washed with 90% cold acetone
   (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ), then centrifuged for 1 min at 16,000 rcf. The supernatant
   was discarded and the pellet was left to air dry. First, 30 pL of 8 M urea (MP
   Biomedicals, Solon, OH) was added to the pellet, then 4 pL of 0.2 M DTT (Sigma
10 Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Sample was incubated at 520C for 30 min and then 4 pL of 0.44
   M iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added and the solution incubated
   at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Next, 120 pL of 0.1% n-octyl B-D
   glucopyranoside water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added slowly, and then
   sample was divided into two equal parts. To half the sample, 7.5 pg Trypsin (Promega
15 Corp., Madison, WI) was added, and to the other half, 4 pg of AspN (Roche Applied
   Science, Indianapolis, IN) was added. Both samples were incubated at 370C for 1 h.
   Samples were quenched with 10% Trifluoroacetic Acid (Thermoscientific, Waltham, MA)
   for a final volume of 0.1% TFA. Both samples were run on a Thermofinnigan (San Jose,
   CA) LCQ-Deca electrospray ionization (ESI) ion-trap mass spectrometer. A Vydac C1 8
20 column (5 u, 300A, 0.2 x 150 mm, Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) was run at a flow
   rate of 200 pL/min. The injection volumes were 50 pL, and were filtered through an on
   line trapping cartridge (Peptide CapTrap, Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) before
   loading onto the column. Separation of the digests was performed with a gradient as
   follows (Solvent A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2 0 (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ), Solvent
25 B: 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ)). For the
   identification of GH51 LARF, the two GH3 P-xylosidases, and GH30 P-xylosidase, the
   method described above was used, except samples were digested with Chymotrypsin
   (7.5 pg, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in addition to Trypsin and AspN. The
   TurboSequest search engine within Bioworks 3.31 (Thermo, San Jose) was used to
30 identify proteins from the Fusarium verticillioides protein database. The protein database
   was downloaded from the BROAD Institute at http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/
   genome/fusariumverticillioides/MultiDownloads.html.

                         7.1.13       Induction of Fusarium verticillioidesEnzymes by Dilute
                         Aqueous Ammonia Pretreated Switchqrass
               For induction of Fusarium verticillioides enzymes in response to dilute aqueous
   ammonia pretreated switchgrass, switchgrass was ground to <1 mm diameter, then
 5 pretreated with 6% ammonia based on dry weight at 50% initial dry matter at 16        C
   maximum temperature for 90 min. The resulting material was 43.3% solids and
   contained 0.336% residual ammonia.
               Wild type F. verticillioides culture was maintained on potato dextrose agar
   (Sigma P6685) and a rich growth media of 24 g/L potato dextrose was inoculated with
10 mycelia from the plate. The growth culture was incubated for 3 days at 242C with
   agitation at 140 rpm, during which time it became turbid with Fusarium cells. After 3
   days growth, 4 flasks each containing 100 mL of base Christakapoulos media (0.1%
   KH 2 PO 4 , 0.03% CaCl2, 0.03% MgSO 4 x 7 H2 0, 2.61% Na 2HPO 4 x 7 H 20, 0.134%
   NaH 2 PO 4   x 1 H2 0, 1.0% anhydrous ammonium phosphate) were inoculated with 4 mL of
15 the resulting cell suspension. To the suspension, two grams dry matter of dilute aqueous
   ammonia-pretreated switchgrass was added as the sole carbon source.
               After addition of the pretreated switchgrass, the pH was adjusted to 6.5 and the
   flask was swirled at 180 rpm at 23LC for 168 h. Prior to size exclusion chromatography,
   samples were analyzed at different time points by Bradford assay for protein, p
20 nitrophenyl arabinofuranosidase, p-nitrophenyl xylosidase and p-nitrophenyl glucosidase
   activities, and by SDS-PAGE gels for induction of enzymes. Intact non-pretreated
   switchgrass, 2% glucose and no carbon source were included as parallel controls and
   were found to lead to much lower levels of enzyme induction than was the case for dilute
   aqueous ammonia-pretreated switchgrass carbon source.
25                       7.1.14       Size exclusion chromatography fractionation of the
                         Fusarium verticillioidesculture broth
               The Fusarium verticillioides culture media containing the expressed enzymes
   from the 168-h induction described above was centrifuged at 3,500 x g to remove debris
   and cells. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.4 pm filter yielding a clear deep
30 yellow liquid. The liquid was concentrated (~4X) two times in a large Amicon ultra 10K
   MW cutoff concentrator (UFC901024). A 1.7 mL concentrated sample was set aside for
   size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and assayed for protein content by BCA assay as
   described earlier. The concentrated protein sample was loaded onto a Superdex 16/60
                                                   -109-

   SEC column equilibrated with 50 mM Sodium Acetate buffer pH 5.0. The column was
   eluted at 1 mL/min at 4 2C. Absorbance of the sample at 214 nm and 280 nm were
   monitored. After elution of the void volume, 1 mL fractions were collected in a deep well
   polypropylene microtiter plate. The protein-containing fractions were aggregated into a
 5 separate deep well plate and all fractions were measured for total protein concentration
   by BCA assay, and p-nitrophenyl arabinosidase, p-nitrophenyl xylosidase, and p
   nitrophenyl glucosidase activities as described in Example 1 (Synthetic substrate activity
   assays).
                       7.1.15     Purification of A NUMBER OF GH43, GH51 and GH3
10                     HOMOLOGS (SECTION 8.1 BELOW) from T. reeseifermentation
                       by cation exchange chromatography
             Shake flask-scale enzyme production from wild type Trichoderma reesei
   cultures was performed as described in WO 2005/001036. The extracellular enzyme
   preparations were concentrated by Amicon Centriprep filtration if necessary, and applied
15 to a GE Health Sciences SP-Sepharose Fast Flow sulfopropyl cation exchange column
   (20 mL bed equilibrated with Sodium Acetate buffer) using a GE Health Sciences Akta
   system protein purification system using Unicorn software. Proteins were eluted with a
   0-1 M NaCl gradient in Sodium Acetate buffer and activity in the fractions were
   monitored as described above. Active fractions were then collected, pooled and
20 concentrated if necessary. Activity in column fractions was monitored using either 4
   nitrophenyl P-D-xylopyranoside (for BXL activity) or 4-nitrophenyl a-L-arabinofuranoside
   (for LARF activity). In both cases, 2 pL of the column fraction was added to 95 pL of 50
   mM pH 5.0 Sodium Acetate buffer and 5 pL of the p-nitrophenyl substrate, mixed and
   incubated 2 min at 232C. One hundred microliters of 1 N sodium carbonate stop solution
25 was added and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. In some cases an anion
   exchange protein purification step was useful before the cation exchange. In this case,
   the enzyme fractions were exchanged into 50 mM pH 6.3 (N-Morpholino)
   ethanesulphonic acid-NaOH (MES) buffer, and then the protein sample was applied onto
   a GE Health Sciences Q-Sepharose Fast Flow quaternary amine anion exchange
30 column (20 mL bed volume equilibrated with MES buffer). The Akta protein purification
   system as described for the cation exchange step was used. Proteins were eluted with a
   0-0.5 M NaCl gradient in MES buffer. The active enzymes were then exchanged into 50
   mM, pH 5.0 Sodium Acetate buffer before cation exchange chromatography.

                      7.1.16        Purification of Xylanases
             Xylanase purification was conducted in two stages:
             Staqe 1: Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC).     (NH4 )2 SO 4 was
   added to fermentation supernatant to achieve a final concentration of 1 M. The
 5 separation column used was a Hiprep Phenyl (highsub), 16/10, 20 mL. Buffer A: 20 mM
   sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. Buffer B: Buffer A + 1 M (NH4) 2 SO 4 . Stepwise Elution: 45%
   B; 0% B; water+10% glycerol.
             Staae 2: Gel filtration (GF). Eluate of 0% B from the HIC column was collected
   and loaded on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 prep grade (320 mL, GE Healthcare)
10 column. The mobile phase was 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 0.15 M
   NaCI. The elution profile is shown in Figure 26. Figure 27 shows the SDS-PAGE
   detection of the two step separation of AfuXyn 5.
             The Applied Biosystems BIOCAD@ Vision and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech
   AKTA Explorer were used for protein purification of T. reeseiXYN3. Approximately 150
15 mL of Xylanase 3, from an ultrafiltration concentrate, was loaded onto a Sephadex G
   25M desalting column (total volume ~525 mL) equilibrated in 10 mM TES buffer, pH 6.8.
   300-400 mL of this desalted sample was then loaded onto an anion-exchange column
   (high density quaternary amine resin; Applied Biosystems Inc.). The bound protein was
   then eluted using a salt gradient between 0-1 M sodium chloride using 8-column
20 volumes of 25 mM TES buffer. Elution of the protein occurred between 0-250 mM
   sodium chloride, and was detected using 10% Bis-Tris NUPAGE@ SDS-PAGE (Novex).
             The eluted Xylanase 3-containing samples were concentrated to 10 mL with
   Vivaspin 5,000 MWCO (molecular weight cut-off) membrane concentrators (Vivascience;
   GE Healthcare). The concentrate was then loaded onto a High Load 26/60 Superdex
25 200 (ID no 17-1071-01; GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated with 25 mM TES
   buffer, pH 6.8, containing 100 mM sodium chloride, and the bound protein was eluted
   over 8-column volumes of the TES buffer with sodium chloride.
             The purity of the eluted protein was assessed using 10% Bis-Tris NUPAGE
   SDS-PAGE (Novex), and determined to be greater than 95% pure.

             The ultrafiltration concentrate (UFC) of Fusarium verticilioides 43D was buffer
   exchanged and dialyzed against 50 mM Sodium Acetate buffer, pH 4.0, overnight. The
   dialyzed material was passed through a HiTrap 1 mL column prepacked with sulfopropyl
 5 sepharose fast flow resin (GE Healthcare) designed for use with a syringe. The purified
   Fv43D was eluted with 50 mM Sodium Acetate buffer, pH 4.0, with 250 mM sodium
   chloride. The UFC and Sodium Acetate buffer were pushed through the column using a
   5 mL syringe fitted with a GE Healthcare connector. The purified Fv43D was dialyzed
   overnight against 50 mM Sodium Acetate buffer, pH 4.0. The purified protein was
10 assayed by SDS-PAGE, HPLC, and mass spectroscopy to demonstrate homogeneity.

             The ultrafiltration concentrate (UFC) of Fusarium verticillioides 51A was buffer
   exchanged and dialyzed against 50 mM Sodium Acetate buffer, pH 5.0, overnight. The
   dialyzed material was passed through a RESOURCE 15 6 mL column prepacked with
15 methyl sulfonate media (GE Healthcare). The UFC was loaded at 1 mL/min against 50
   mM Sodium Acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and eluted at 5 mL/min against 50 mM Sodium
   Acetate buffer, pH 5.0, using a 0 to 250 mM sodium chloride gradient. The eluted
   fractions were collected and assayed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions with purified Fv51A were
   concentrated using a 10,000 MWCO Vivaspin concentrator from Sartorius Stemdim
20 Biotech. The purified Fv51A was dialyzed against 50 mM Sodium Acetate buffer, pH
   5.0, overnight. The purified protein was assayed by SDS-PAGE, HPLC, and mass
   spectroscopy to demonstrate homogeneity. The AKTA Explorer 100 system from GE
   Healthcare was used for the purification of Fv51 A.

25 FROM VARIOUS SPECIES IN TRICHODERMA REESEI
           8.1     Fusarium verticillioidesgenes
             The sequence for Fv51A was obtained by searching the Fusarium verticillioides
   genome in the Broad Institute database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/) for GH51
   arabinofuranosidase homologs.
30           The following genes from Fusarium verticillioides were expressed in
    Trichoderma reesei: Fv3A, Fv43A, Fv43B, Fv43D, Fv51 A, Fv3B, Fv43C, Fv39A, Fv43E,
   Fv30A, Fv30B, and Fv43F. Fv3A sequence was obtained by searching for GH3           p
                                               -112-

   xylosidase homologs in Fusarium verticillioides genome. The annotated sequence
   lacked a signal sequence and the gene prediction program Augustus
   (http://augustus.gobics.de/) was used to identify upstream sequence which contained a
   signal sequence. Sequences for Fv39A, Fv43A, Fv43B, Fv43D, Fv43E, and Fv30A were
 5 obtained by searching the Fusarium verticillioides genome for GH39, GH30, and GH43
   P-xylosidase homologs.
             Open reading frames of the hemicellulase genes of interest were amplified by
   PCR using purified/extracted genomic DNA from Fusarium verticillioides as the template.
   The PCR thermocycler used was DNA Engine Tetrad 2 Peltier Thermal Cycler (BioRad
10 Laboratories). The DNA polymerase used was PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA Polymerase

              The forward primers included four additional nucleotides (sequences - CACC)
35 at the 5'-end to facilitate directional cloning into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
   CA) (Figure 28). The PCR conditions for amplifying the open reading frames were as
   follows (except for Fv51A): Step 1: 940C for 2 min. Step 2: 940C for 30 sec. Step 3:
   570C for 30 sec. Step 4: 720C for 30-45 sec. Steps 2, 3 and 4 were repeated for an
   additional 29 cycles. Step 5: 720C for 2 min. For Fv51A, the following conditions were
40 used: Step 1: 940C for 2 min. Step 2: 940C for 30 sec. Step 3: 560C for 30 sec. Step
   4: 720C for 45 sec. Steps 2, 3, 4 were repeated for an additional 25 cycles. Step 5: 40C
   hold.
             The PCR products of the corresponding hemicellulase open reading frames
   were purified using a Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified
                                                 -114-

   PCR products were cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector, transformed into TOP1 0
   chemically competent E. co/i cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and plated on LA plates
   with 50 ppm kanamycin. Plasmid DNA was obtained from the E. coli transformants
   using a QlAspin plasmid preparation kit (Qiagen). Sequence data for the DNA inserted
 5 in the pENTR/D-TOPO vector was obtained using M1 3 forward and reverse primers
   (Sequetech, Mountain View, CA). A pENTR/D-TOPO vector with the correct DNA
   sequence of the corresponding hemicellulase open reading frame was recombined with
   the pTrex3gM destination vector (WO 05/001036, Figure 29) using LR clonase reaction
   mixture (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
10 product of the LR clonase reaction was subsequently transformed into TOP1 0 chemically
   competent E. coli cells which were then plated on LA containing 50ppm carbenicillin.
   The resulting expression vectors were pTrex3gM plasmids containing the corresponding
   hemicellulase open reading frames that resulted from the recombination event between
   the attR1 and attR2 sites of pTrex3gM and the attL1 and attL2 sites of pENTR/D-TOPO;
15 and the Aspergillus nidulans acetamidase selection marker (amdS). DNA of the
   expression vectors containing the corresponding hemicellulase open reading frames
   were isolated using a Qiagen miniprep kit and used for biolistic transformation of
    Trichoderma reesei spores.
             Biolistic transformation of Trichoderma reeseiwith the pTrex3gM expression
20 vector containing the corresponding hemicellulase open reading frame was performed
   using the following protocol. Transformation of the Trichoderma reeseicellulase quad
   delete (Acbhl, Acbh2, Aegl, Aeg2) strain by helium-bombardment was accomplished
   using a Biolistic@ PDS-1000/He Particle Delivery System from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA)
   following the manufacturer's instructions (see patent publications WO 05/001036 and US
25 2006/0003408). Transformants were transferred to fresh acetamide selection plates
   (see patent publication WO 2009114380). Stable transformants were inoculated into filter
   microtiter plates (Corning), containing 200 pL/well of Glycine Minimal media (6.0 g/L
   glycine; 4.7 g/L (NH4 ) 2 SO 4 ; 5.0 g/L KH 2 PO 4 ; 1.0 g/L MgSO 4-7H 2 0; 33.0 g/L PIPPS; pH
   5.5) with post sterile addition of ~2% glucose/sophorose mixture (US 7,713,725) as the
30 carbon source, 10 mL/L of 100 g/L of CaCl 2, 2.5 mL/L of T. reesei trace elements (400X):
   175 g/L Citric acid anhydrous; 200 g/L FeSO 4 -7H 20; 16 g/L ZnSO 4-7H 2O; 3.2 g/L
   CuSO 4 -5H 2 0; 1.4 g/L MnSO 4 -H2 0; 0.8 g/L H3 Bo3 ). Transformants were grown in liquid
   culture for 5 days in an 0 2-rich chamber housed in a 28"C incubator. The supernatant
   samples from the filter microtiter plate were collected on a vacuum manifold.
                                                   -115-

   Supernatant samples were run on 4-12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
   according to the manufacturer's instructions to check for expression. The gel was
   stained with Simply Blue stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Purification of GH43, GH51
   and GH3 enzymes from T. reeseifermentations was performed by cation exchange
 5 chromatography as described in Example 1.
           8.2    Genes from other species
             Pf43A and Pf51A sequences were obtained by sequencing of the Penicillium
   funiculosum genome. The queries used for the searches of the P. funiculosum genome
   were other fungal GH43 and GH51 homologs available in the public genomes.         A gene
10 prediction program named Augustus (http://augustus.gobics.de/) was used to verify the
   intron sequences, along with the start codon. Fv43D sequence was used to query the
   Gibberella zeae (Fusarium graminearum) and Fusarium oxysporum genomes available
   in the Broad Institute database and retrieve sequences for Gz43A and Fo43A
   respectively. The genes for Gz43A and Fo43A were synthesized by GeneArt (Geneart
15 GmbH, Regensburg, Germany) with the CBH1 signal sequence in place of the native
   signal sequence. Neither gene contained introns. The Pf51A gene was codon
   optimized and synthesized by GeneArt with the CBH1 signal sequence in place of the
   native signal sequence.
             Pf43A and Pf51 A were cloned and expressed in Trichoderma reesei using the
20 following primers:

             The methods used for cloning and expression of all these genes were similar to

   9.       EXAMPLE 3: TESTING FOR ACTIVITY OF NOVEL HEMICELLULASES ON
   SYNTHETIC SUBSTRATES
              The activities of Fv3A, Fv43A, Fv43B, Fv43D and a number of other proteins in,
20 for example, Table 2, were tested on synthetic substrates pNPX and pNPA as described
   in Synthetic substrate activity assay in Example 1. T. reesei Bxl1 was used in at 0.7 g/L.
   The other enzyme samples, and the Quad-delete host control, were added by volume
   from growth cultures (microtiter plate or shake flask scale). Therefore, the absolute
   activity cannot be compared across samples but is an indication of an active expressed
25 protein with the relative pNPX and pNPA activity shown in Table 2. Activity on para
   nitrophenyl substrates is not used as a predictor of performance in biomass
   saccharification.

   protein/g cellulose. Following 4 days incubation, 500C, 200 rpm, the assay plate was
   quenched and analyzed by HPLC for soluble sugars.
25           Enzymes were found that enhanced glucose or xylose or arabinose yield, or
   reduced cellobiose or xylobiose concentration in this enzyme mixture. Results are
   shown in Figures 30A and 30B.
             The saccharification performance of expressed proteins was also evaluated as

   found that enhanced glucose, or xylose or arabinose yield, or reduced cellobiose or
   xylobiose concentration in this enzyme mixture.
             The saccharification performance of expressed proteins was also evaluated as
20 additions to the enzyme mix with a xylanase deficiency. During the construction of the
    Trichoderma reese/integrated expression strains (described in Example 9 below), one T.
   reesei strain (strain # 44) was isolated that over-expressed Bgll, Fv3A, Fv51 A, Fv43D
   proteins but did not over-express endo-xylanase. This strain was used as the
   background to which candidate xylanases were added for performance screening. Endo
25 xylanase candidates were evaluated in a 3 day cob saccharification assay by addition to
   the enzyme products from strain #44. The screen was conducted as described in the
   corncob saccharification assay (Example 1) with the following enzymes and

             The enzyme composition produced by Strain #44 was added at 20 mg protein/g
 5 cellulose; candidate xylanase enzymes were added at 3 and 7 mg protein/g cellulose.
   Following 3 days incubation, at 502C, 200 rpm, the assay plate was quenched and
   analyzed by HPLC for soluble sugars. Enzymes were found that enhanced xylose, or
   glucose, or arabinose yield, or reduced cellobiose or xylobiose concentration in this
   enzyme mixture. Results are shown in Figure 32.
10           The saccharification performance of expressed Fv51A and Pa5lA proteins in

   shown in Figure 33.
30           Fv51A and Pa5lA also were evaluated in a 3 day cob saccharification assay by
   addition to an enzyme mixture of Accellerase* 1000/ Trichoderma reesei Xyn2. Purified
   Fv51A (29 mg/mL TP) and Pa5lA (29 mg/mL) were used in this part of the study.
                                              -120-

 5 soluble sugars. Enzyme combinations were found that enhanced xylose, or glucose, or
   arabinose yield in this enzyme mixture. Results are shown in Figure 34.
             The saccharification performance of expressed proteins was also evaluated as

25 enhanced glucose or xylose or arabinose yield, or reduced cellobiose or xylobiose
   concentration in this enzyme mixture, with or without another p-xylosidase (T. reesei
   Bxll). Results are shown in Figures 35A-35C.
           10.2    Activity of candidate endo-xvlanases with birchwood xylan
             The activity of candidate endo-xylanases was evaluated using birchwood xylan
30 as a substrate using the following assay. Ninety microliters of a 1% (wt/vol) birchwood
   xylan (Sigma X0502) stock solution was added to wells in a 96-well microtiter plate and
   pre-incubated at 500C for 10 min. Enzyme dilutions and xylose standards were added
                                              -121-

   (10 pL) to the microtiter plate and the plates incubated at 500C for 10 min. Meanwhile,
   100 pL of DNS solution was added to PCR tubes. Following the 10-min incubation, 60
   pL of the enzyme reaction was transferred to the PCR tubes containing the DNS
   solution. The tubes were incubated in a thermocycler at 950C for 5 min, and then cooled
 5 to 40C. One hundred microliters of the reaction mixture was transferred to a 96-well
   plate, and absorbance at 540 nm was measured. A xylose standard curve was
   generated and used to calculate the activity. One xylanase unit is defined as the amount
   of enzyme required to generate 1 pmole of xylose reducing sugar equivalents per minute
   under the conditions of the assay. Results are shown in Table 3.
10         10.3     Enzyme hydrolysis of arabinoxylan oligomers from saccharified
           corncob
             In this study, enzyme hydrolysis of the arabinoxylan oligomers remaining after
   digestion of dilute ammonia pretreated corncob with cellulase and hemicellulase
   preparations was monitored. Preparation of crude oligomers is described in Example 1.
15 Total oligomer sugars were determined by HPLC (see Example 1) after acid hydrolysis
   of the crude oligomers with 2% (v/v) sulfuric acid in a sealed vial at 121 C for 30 min.
   The sugar concentrations were corrected for a small amount of sugar degradation as
   determined by control samples of known sugar mixtures treated by the same procedure.
   The concentration of total sugars in the crude oligomer preparation determined by this
20 method was 45 g/L glucose, 168 g/L xylose, and 46 g/L arabinose. When accounting for
   monomer sugar present in crude oligomers before acid hydrolysis, 86% of the glucose,
   90% of the xylose, and 43% of the arabinose was present in oligomeric form. Various      p
   xylosidases, arabinofuranosidases, and mixtures thereof were tested for increased
   conversion of arabinose monomer from the crude oligomers preparation. The crude
25 oligomer preparation was diluted 20-fold to 12 g/L oligomers in 50 mM Sodium Acetate
   buffer, pH 5.0, and maintained at 501C in a heating block in capped 1.5 mL Eppendorf
   tubes. Enzymes were added at final concentrations of 0.06-0.09 g/L and incubated for
   24 h to reach completion. Samples were then removed for HPLC analysis of momomer
   sugars as described in Example 1. The results are listed in Table 4 as % conversion to
30 monomer sugar based on total sugar as determined by acid hydrolysis.
             To obtain the highest yields (44-71%) of arabinose from the remaining
   arabinoxylan oligomers in the crude oligomer mix, the data in Table 4 show that binary
   combinations of Fv3A+Fv51 A, Fv3A+Fv43B, and Fv43A+Fv43B provide the best results.
                                               -122-

   From the sequence families and activity on artificial substrates, it is deduced that Fv3A is
   a p-xylosidase and Fv51 A is an L-a-arabinofuranosidase.
              It is known that arabinose sugars in arabinoxylan from corncob are frequently
   linked to xylose at both the 2 and 3 carbon positions of the arabinose sugar. Thus the
 5 activity of Fv3A is likely to hydrolyze the xyl(1 -2)ara linkage which then makes available
   the ara(1 -3) xyl linkage to hydrolysis by the L-a-arabinofuranosidase. Of the P
   xylosidases tested only Fv3A and Fv43A appeared to have this activity. Also in this
   screening only Fv43B appeared to have L-a-arabinofuranosidase activity among the
   Family 43 members from Fusarium verticillioides. Results are shown in Table 4.
10 11.      EXAMPLE 5: SUBSTRATE RANGE OF B-XYLOSIDASES FOR EFFECTIVE
            CORNCOB HYDROLYSIS
            In this example, the substrate range of 3 P-xylosidases and their relation to
   effective conversion of corncob xylooligomers to monomer sugars were determined.
   Preparation of corncob hydrolysate containing oligomeric sugars and assay of monomer
15 sugars was performed as described in Example 1. The proton NMR spectra of
   oligomeric sugars with degree of polymerization (DP) greater than 2 as separated by
   size exclusion chromatography on Bio-Gel P2 were determined (Figure 36 and Figure
   37) . The spectra of oligomers before enzyme treatment is labeled "MD07 oligomers" in
   the bottom panel of Figure 36 and spectra of the same oligo containing fractions after
20 enzyme treatments are in the remaining panels of Figure 36 and Figure 37 labeled with
   the treatment enzyme.
            The Bio-gel P2 fractions containing oligomers of greater than DP2 (5-10 mg)
   were lyophilized then dissolved in 0.7 mL of a D20 solution containing 0.5 mM 2,2
   dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS) as internal standard. Aliquots of 0.55 mL were
25 used for the NMR samples in order to optimize suppression of the residual water peak.
   Standard versions of the Varian 2D correlation pulse sequences were used, with
   optimization of the 11C spectral width for the heteronuclear experiments. Spectra were
   acquired on a Varian Unity Inova using a high sensitivity cryoprobe operating at 500
   MHz. Structure elucidation was done by identifying the correlations that characterize the
30 spin-system for the individual sugar residues and then identifying the inter-glycosidic
   correlations.
              The arabinose containing oligomers as determined by NMR, are dominated by
   one or more branched structures in which arabinose is linked P- 1->3 to a xylose residue
                                                -123-

   in a polymer fragment. The arabinose residue in the resulting branch is further
   substituted by a xylose residue linked P-1 -2    to the arabinose. Little arabinose without
   this second substitution is present in the remaining xylo-oligomers. T. reesei BxI1 is not
   very effective at cleaving the furthest out xylose 1-2 to arabinose bond as evidenced by
 5 the remaining signals at 5.5 to 5.55 ppm in the spectra. The combination of the Fv43A
   that is effective on longer chain xylose oligomers and the Fv43B L-a
   arabinofuranosidase removes most but not all of the branched species with signals in the
   5.5 ppm range and unlike treatment with the T. reesei Bx11, leaves none of the signal at
   5.35 that is attributable to remaining arabinose branched to xylose oligomer.
10            The anomeric proton region of the spectra of the remaining xylo-oligomers after
   treatment with the Fv51A alone or in combination with the Fv3A show different results.
   The L-a-arabinofuranosidase alone is not effective at reducing the complexity of signals
   in the region. The Fv3A p-xylosidase removes essentially all of the xylose subtending
   the arabinose branch leaving mostly simply linked arabinose 1-3 xylose oligomer
15 structures. Addition of the L-a-arabinofuranosidase to the p-xylosidase results in a fairly
   complete conversion to monomer sugars as evidenced by the increase in signal coming
   from the a and    P anomeric  protons of reducing sugars.
              It can thus be concluded that the increased effectiveness of one p-xylosidase
   over another is likely to be due to the substrate range in terms of the structural
20 complexity of the aglycon allowable as substrate.
   12.      EXAMPLE 6: SEQUENCE COMPARISON AND CRITICAL RESIDUES IN
   DETERMINING SUBSTRATE RANGE IN GH3 B-XYLOSIDASES
              The T. reesei p-xylosidase (Bxl1) is 61% similar to the F. verticillioides ortholog
   (Fv3A) and shares 42% sequence identity as shown in the alignment of Figure 38.
25 Fv3A has much broader substrate range than Bx11, which is likely to be attributable to
   the non-conserved amino acids among the two proteins.
   13.      EXAMPLE 7: DETERMINATION OF DEFINED HEMICELLULASE ACTIVITY
   FOR CORNCOB HYDROLYSIS TO MONOMER SUGARS
              Pretreated corncob as described in Example 1 was used as water slurry
30 adjusted to about pH 5 with H2 SO 4 in water at 18.6 g dry corncob solids/1 00 g of total
   slurry. 0.78 g of the slurry was added to 4 mL glass vials and sufficient pH 5.0, 50 mM
   Sodium Acetate buffer was added to give a total reaction weight of 1.06 g after the
                                                -124-

   desired enzyme additions. The hemicellulases were added as the purified preparations
   described in Example 1. Supernatant from the quad deleted T. reesei strain (Quad in
   Tables 5 and 6) is the concentrate of background proteins expressed by the T. reesei
   strain deleted in 4 major cellulase activities (described in WO 05/001036). Accellerase*
 5 1000 is a whole cellulase mixture with high p-glucosidase activity. The vials were
   incubated at 230 rpm in an orbital shaker at 480C for 72 h then 2 mL of water was added.
   A sub-sample was taken and further diluted, centrifuged and filtered for HPLC analysis
   for monomer sugars as described in Example 1. Experimental results defining useful
   amounts of defined hemicellulase activity for hydrolyzing pretreated corncob to monomer
10 sugars is shown in Table 5.
             The results from the design-of-experiments (DoE)were fit to a surface model
   and used to determine best ratios of the 7 enzyme components for best yield of glucose,
   xylose and arabinose at the two total protein concentrations tested. Results of the ratios
   for the seven enzyme components are shown in Table 6.
15           Another exploration of the ratios (Table 7) was conducted including Fv3A, and
   again including Fv43D and holding that activity constant at a low level. The reaction set
   up and reaction conditions were identical to those described for the full DoE experiment.
             Reactions (run numbers) 20, 21, and 22 contain only the whole cellulase
   enzyme mix and at the 21 mg/g of glucan loading monomerized about 48% of the
20 glucose present in the cob and 24% of the xylose. Addition of the endoxylanase,
    Trichoderma reeseiXyn3 allowed decrease of the whole cellulase protein load while
   retaining about the same glucose monomer yield and increased the xylose monomer
   yield to about 40% (run# 1). All the combinations that gave arabinose yields of above
   40% required the combination of Fv43D, Fv43A and Fv43B or Fv51A or of Fv3A and
25 Fv51A or Fv43B. Those combinations also tended to have highest release of xylose to
   monomer sugar.
             Another set of reactions aimed at refining the required mix of hemicellulases
   was run holding both the loading of whole cellulase constant and the loading of the
   endoxylanase constant. Accellerase* 1000 whole cellulase preparation was held
30 constant at 12 mg/g glucan and purified T. reeseiXyn3 endoxylanase was held at 6 mg/g
   xylan. Fv51A was the only L-a-arabinofuranosidase in the mixture, at different doses.
   Other reaction conditions remained the same but the hydrolysate was analyzed by size
                                                -125-

   exclusion chromatography as described in Example 1. The quantitation of individual
   sugars was performed by peak area only and the results are shown in Table 8.
              All combinations released similar amounts of glucose and about the same
   amount of total soluble xylose. The degree of reduction to monomer xylose varied by
 5 treatment. Without added activity to convert oligomer to monomer about 50% of the
   solubilized xylose remained oligomeric unless at least a P-xylosidase was added. Fv3A
   at 2 mg Fv3A protein/g xylan reduced >DP2 oligomers to 3.6 mg/mL. Addition of 2 mg
   Fv51A protein/g xylan to the 2 mg Fv3A protein/g xylan further decreased the >DP2
   oligomers to 1.5 mg/mL. About 2 mg of Fv51A/g xylan appeared to be sufficient to
10 reduce the >DP2 oligomers to a minimum when the required 2 mg/g Fv3A was present
   (Table 8).
              A mix of 6 mg/g xylan T. reeseiXyn3, 2 mg/g Fv3A and either 1 or 2 mg/g
   Fv51 A is a suitable loading to reduce total cob arabinoxylan to monomer sugars. The
   addition of Fv43D to the mix aids in taking the xylobiose or other DP2 oligomers to
15 monomer. Arabinose hydrolysis to monomer was not measured in this experiment.
   14.      EXAMPLE 8: EFFECTIVENESS OF HEMICELLULASES AT PRODUCING
   MONOMER SUGARS FROM CORNCOB
              In this example, the effectiveness of a set of purified hemicellulase activities at
   producing monomer xylose and arabinose sugars when acting alone on diluted ammonia
20 pretreated corncob is demonstrated. Three mixtures (Mixes A, B, & C) of purified
   hemicellulases were prepared and used to hydrolyze hemicellulose in pretreated cob in 1
   g total, 14% solids reactions prepared as in Example 1 and run under the conditions
   described in Example 1. Monomer sugars were analyzed by HPLC as described in
   Example 1 after 72 h of reaction and the amounts obtained are shown in Table 9.
25              0    Mix A: 6 mg Trichoderma reeseiXyn3; 4 mg Fv3A; 1 mg Fv51A/g xylan
                e    Mix B: 6 mg Trichoderma reeseiXyn3; 1 mg Fv43D; 3 mg Fv43A; 3 mg
                     Fv43B/g xylan
                *    Mix C: 6 mg Trichoderma reeseiXyn3; 3 mg Fv3A; 1 mg Fv43D; 1 mg
                     Fv51A/g xylan
30            In this experiment the defined hemicellulase sets yielded slightly less monomer
   sugar than seen in earlier experiments which included activities to solubilize cellulose.
   The yields were still greater than those seen with endoxylanase-only addition to whole
                                               -126-

   cellulase preparations. The hemicellulase activities are effective in taking xylan to
   monomer.
              The same set of mixtures was used on hemicellulose preparations made from
   corncob, total stover from grain sorghum, switchgrass and sugar cane bagasse using the
 5 procedures in the general methods in accordance with Example 1. Stock suspensions of
   each hemicellulose preparation at 100 mg/mL in 50 mM pH 5.0 Sodium Acetate buffer
   were made and the pH was checked. Each of them was diluted to 10 mg preparation
   per mL with more 50 mM acetate buffer. Aliquots of each enzyme mixture were added to
   100 pL of the 10 mg/mL suspension and the reactions were run in duplicate, incubated at
10 480C for 6 h with agitation. Reactions were diluted with 100 PL of water, centrifuged and
   filtered before HPLC analysis for monomer sugars as described in Example 1. 200 pL of
   each hemicellulose suspension was diluted with 200 pL of 0.8 N H2 SO 4 , autoclaved at
   121 0C for 30 min on liquid cycle then filtered and sugars analyzed by HPLC as described
   in Example 1. Results shown in Table 10 are reported as the average monomer sugar
15 released by the enzyme mixture as a percentage of the acid hydrolysable sugar present
   in the reaction.
              Mixes A and C performed well on hemicellulose from cob and as seen in other
   experiments on whole pretreated cob. Mixtures containing Fv3A increase conversion of
   arabinose to monomer and give a slight advantage in conversion of xylose to monomer.
20 All 3 mixtures work well on hemicellulose purified from other monocots. The mixing of
   one endoxylanase, either one or two p-xylosidases, one of which has substrate
   specificity beyond two or three xylose units linked  P 1->4 and      an L a
   arabinofuranosidase results in an effective hemicellulase blend against monocot
   hemicellulose.

   OF TRICHODERMA REESEI
              An integrated expression strain of Trichoderma reesei was constructed that co
   expressed five genes: T. reeseip-glucosidase gene bgIl, T. reeseiendoxylanase gene
   xyn3, F. verticilloides f-xylosidase gene fv3A, F. verticillioides f-xylosidase gene fv43D,
30 and F. verticillioides a-arabinofuranosidase gene fv51A.

   transformation of T. reeseistrain are described below.

              The N-terminal portion of the native T. reesei#-glucosidase gene bg1l was
   codon optimized by DNA 2.0 (Menlo Park, USA). This synthesized portion comprised of
   the first 447 bases of the coding region. This fragment was PCR amplified using primers
 5 SK943 and SK941. The remaining region of the native bgll gene was PCR amplified
   from a genomic DNA sample extracted from T. reesei strain RL-P37, using primer SK940
   and SK942. These two PCR fragments of the bg1l gene were fused together in a fusion

   concentrates (UFC) or centrate. For the generation of UFC, T reesefermentation
   broths (14L-scale) were obtained after cell separation by centrifugation, concentrated
20 using membrane-ultrafiltration through a Millipore 10 kD molecular weight cut off
   membrane. Then pH was adjusted to 4.8. The cell-separated broth was then polished
   by filtration, using FW6 Buchner filtration. Each enzyme sample was assayed for total
   protein concentration using the modified Biuret method.
               The saccharification performance was evaluated in vials or in shake flasks.
25 Each enzyme preparation was assayed for saccharification performance on 20% dry
   solids (DS) loading of dilute ammonia pretreated corncob (see, W02006/110901). All
   saccharification reactions were then titrated with sulfuric acid to pH 5.0 and sodium azide
   was added to a final concentration of 0.01% (w/v), for microbial contamination control.
   Each saccharification reaction was then dosed with 20 mg of total protein (TP) enzyme
30 preparation per g of substrate glucan or xylan, as appropriate. Accellerase* 1500
   (Ac 500) and the integrated strain UFC's were dosed at 20 mg total protein/g glucan.
   An enzyme blend was prepared in a ratio of 25:9:4:3:1 Accellerase*
   1500:Xyn3:Fv3A:Fv51A: FV43D. In the blend, Accellerase* 1500 was dosed at 20 mg
                                                -133-

   total protein/g glucan and the hemicellulases were dosed per g xylan (4.3 mg Xyn3/g of
   xylan, 1.7 mg Fv3A/g of xylan, 1.4 mg Fv51A/g of xylan, 0.5 mg Fv43D/g of xylan). Each
   saccharification reaction was incubated at 500C in a rotary shaker set to 200 rpm, then
   sampled and diluted 10 x (v/v) before monomeric sugar concentration was determined
 5 using HPLC analysis (detailed in Section 16.1 below under the "monomeric HPLC
   analysis" section) after 1, 2, 3 and 7 days of saccharification (Figures 47A, 47B). On day
   3 of saccharification, each reaction was also sampled by weight (w/w) for oligomeric
   sugar concentration by HPLC analysis (Section 16.1, Figure 47C). These results show
   that the enzyme compositions produced by integrated strains H3A and G9A provide
10 better glucose and xylose yields than Accellerase*1 500 or enzyme blends created from
   individually expressed enzymes.
              A chromatographic comparison of the enzyme composition produced by three
   different integrated strains is shown in Figure 47D.
            16.1    HPLC Analysis
15            Monomeric Sugar HPLC Analysis: Each sample was analyzed by HPLC using
   a BioRad Aminex HPX-87H ion exclusion column (300 mm x 7.8 mm). All day 1, 2, 3,
   and 7 samples were diluted 10 x volumetrically with 5 mM sulfuric acid, filtered through a
   0.2 pm filter before injection into the HPLC and run under manufacture specifications.
              Oliqomeric Sugar HPLC Analysis (acid hydrolysis): Day 3 saccharification
20 samples were diluted 10 x by weight with Milli-Q water, then sulfuric acid was added to
   the final concentration of 4% (w/w). A xylose and glucose standard (sugar recovery
   standard - "SRS") of known concentration was also prepared and measured for
   monomeric sugar HPLC analysis as stated above, and oligomer sugar HPLC analysis.
   Oligomer HPLC samples and were then autoclaved at 121 C for 15 min, and filtered
25 through a 0.2 pm filter before injection into the HPLC BioRad Aminex HPX-87H ion
   exclusion column (300 mm x 7.8 mm), and run under manufacturer specifications.
   Oligomer sugar concentration was determined by multiplying the percent retained xylose
   and glucose concentration of the sugar recovery standard (SRS) after acid hydrolysis, by
   the post acid hydrolysis HPLC sugar concentrations of each sample, then subtracting the
30 monomeric sugar concentration determined in the "monomeric sugar HPLC Analysis"
   section above.

   17.       EXAMPLE 11: IDENTIFICATION OF PHYLOGENETICALLY BROAD ENZYME
   CLASSES WHICH CAN IMPROVE THE SACCHARIFICATION PERFORMANCE OF T.
   REESEI INTEGRATED EXPRESSION STRAIN
               In this example, enzyme activities which limit the efficacy of enzyme
 5 compositions produced by a T. reesel integrated expression strain were identified and
   enzymes from different species which can compensate for those limiting activities or
   which could substitute for integrated strain components are exemplified.
              0.95g of pretreated corncob as described in Example 1 was added to 20 mL
   glass vials. Sufficient pH 5.0, 50 mM Sodium Acetate buffer and 1 N H2 SO 4 were added
10 to give a total reaction weight of 3.00 g at 22 g dry corncob solids/1 00g of total slurry, pH
   5.0 post enzyme additions. The T. reeseienzyme composition produced by integrated
   strain H3A (Figures 48A, 49A, and 50A) was added as an ultrafiltered (i.e., cell-free)
   concentrate to 7 mg total protein per g of glucan and xylan combined in the feedstock to
   all vials. In addition, candidate hemicellulases were added as the ultrafiltered
15 preparations from 14 L fermentation cultures expressed by T. reeseiQuad delete strain
   (described in WO 05/001036). The candidate hemicellulases were added at 0, 0.5, 1.0
   or 3.0 mg enzyme protein per g of glucan and xylan combined. The hemicellulases
   included constituents of the enzyme composition produced by the integrated strain itself
   including:
20               e    Fusarium verticillioides Fv3A
                 *    Fusarium verticillioides Fv51 A
                 e    Fusarium verticillioides Fv43D
   As well as enzymes from different fungi
                 e    Fusarium oxysporum Fo43A
25               e    Gibberella zeae Gz43A
                 *    Penicillium funiculosum Pf43A
                 *    Aspergillus fumigatus Af43A
                 e    Podospora anserina Pa51 A
                 *    Penicillium funiculosum Pf51 A
30            The vials were incubated at 180 rpm in an orbital shaker at 480C for 72 h. Then
   12 mL of water was added. A sub-sample was taken and further diluted, centrifuged and
   filtered for HPLC analysis for monomer sugars as described in Example 1.
                                                  -135-

               The results shown in Figure 48A and Figure 48B demonstrate that addition of
   p-xylosidase activities such as Fusarium verticillioides Fv43D and Fusarium oxysporum
   Fo43A markedly improved monomer xylose release relative to 7 mg T. reesel integrated
   strain total protein per g of Glucan and Xylan combined. Significant improvements were
 5 even observed at the low additions of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/g.
               The results shown in Figure 49A and Figure 49B demonstrate that addition of
   all of the hemicellulases lead to a significant increase in monomer glucose, even >10%
   at hemicellulase loadings of 1-3 mg per g of Glucan and Xylan combined.
               The results shown in Figure 50A and Figure 50B demonstrate that addition of
10 GH51 enzymes such as Fusarium verticillioides Fv51 A, and especially Podospora
   anserine Pa5lA and Penicillium funiculosum Pfu51A, led to an increase in monomer
   arabinose level.
   18.       EXAMPLE 12: SACCARIFICATION OF VARIOUSLY PRETREATED
   SWITCHGRASS BY CELLULASE AND HEMICELLULASE PREPARATIONS
15             The saccharification performance of expressed cellulases and hemicellulases
   on pretreated raw switchgrass was evaluated. A range of conditions for dilute ammonia
   pretreatment of switchgrass were evaluated for saccharification performance with an
   enzyme cocktail composed of enzymes described herein.          Pretreatment conditions vary
   and pretreatment efficacy affects enzymatic hydrolysis performance.
20             Pretreatment of raw switchgrass was performed in sealed, 6" x %", stainless
   steel tubes that were immersed in a heated sand bath. A slurry of raw switchgrass,
   water, and ammonium hydroxide (~28% solution) was mixed to the desired percent
   solids and percent ammonia and then loaded into a pretreatment tube. Tubes were then
   held at the desired temperature (+/- 20 C) for the desired time and then quenched in ice
25 water for approximately 1 min before being brought to room temperature. The pretreated
   slurry was removed from the tubes and allowed to dry overnight in the hood (>90% solids
   attainable).
               Dried pretreated solids were then saccharified at 10% solids, pH 5, 500C, 200
   rpm using Accellerase* 1500, Xyn 3, Fv3A, Fv51A, and Fv43D (25, 9, 7, 3, 1 mg total
30 protein/g glucan or xylan respectively). A 5 mL total hydrolysate volume in 20 mL
   scintillation vials was used.
                                                -136-

              Glucan and xylan yields were based on monomeric glucose and xylose
   released compared to the glucan or xylan available from the raw biomass. Monomeric
   sugar concentrations were measured by HPLC (BioRad Aminex HPX 87-H column).
              Pretreatment time, temperature, percent solids, and percent NH3 , were varied
 5 over a wide range in order to optimize saccharification results. Each pretreatment
   condition that had both glucan and xylan yields better than ~50% is considered a strong
   performer. The pretreatment parameters that performed strongly are listed in Table 12
   along with their respective glucan, xylan, and total percent yields. Glucan and Xylan
   conversions are based on monomeric sugars released during saccharification as
10 compared to glucan or xylan theoretically available in the raw switchgrass. Total
   conversion is glucose and xylose only (Figure 51).
   19.     EXAMPLE 13: SACCHARIFICATION OF PRETREATED SWITCHGRASS BY
   CELLULASE AND HEMICELLULASE PREPARATIONS
              In addition to the above Examples, the saccharification performance of enzyme
15 mixes and enzyme compositions produced by an integrated strain was tested on several
   substrates, pretreatments and conditions. These experiments show the range of
   performance using the enzyme mix or an integrated strain product. They demonstrate
   good performance across a range of substrates and pretreatments, pH, and
   temperatures.
20            Dilute ammonia pretreated switchgrass was prepared according to the methods
   and process ranges in W006110901A : Switchgrass (38.7% glucan, 22.2% xylan, 2.5%
   arabinan, 23.2% lignin) was hammer-milled to pass through a 1mm screen, then
   pretreated at 1601C for 90 min with 6% NH3 (weight / weight DM, added as NH40H).
   This pretreated substrate was treated with enzyme mixes containing Accellerase* 1500,
25 Multifect* Xylanase (both commercial products of Danisco A/S, Genencor Division, Palo
   Alto, CA), Fv3A, Fv51A, and Fv43D in a total reaction mass of 50g at 15% solids. The
   total protein (TP) of the commercial products was determined by Biuret assay. The other
   enzymes were ultra-filtration concentrates (UFCs) following expression in cellulase quad
   deleted strains of T. reesei, with TP determined by Total Nitrogen analysis of TCA
30 precipitable protein. All reactions were dosed with Accellerase* 1500 at 25 mg TP/g
   Glucan and Multifect* Xylanase (MF Xyl) at 9 mg TP/g Xylan, and Fv3A, Fv51 A, and
   Fv43D were added as indicated in Figure 56A-56B at 3.6 mg TP/g Xylan , 3.0 mg TP/g
   Xylan and 1.0 mg TP/g Xylan, respectively. All enzymes were dosed relative to the
                                               -137-

   starting carbohydrate contents of the switchgrass before pretreatment. The
   saccharification reactions were carried out at 470C and 330C at pH 5.3 for three days.
             The results at 330C showed that addition of Fv3A, Fv51A, and Fv43D increased
   glucan conversion (Figure 56A) and more than doubled the xylan conversion (Figure
 5 56B). The results at 470C showed that addition of Fv3A, Fv51A, and Fv43D gave some
   increased glucan conversion (Figure 56A) and more than doubled the xylan conversion
   (Figure 56B). Additions of Fv51A or Fv43D, alone, gave large increases in xylan
   conversion, especially to xylo-oligomers or xylose monomers, respectively. Addition of
   Fv3A alone increased xylose yields, but in combination with Fv51A gave a large increase
10 in xylan conversion to monomer.
   20.     EXAMPLE 14: SACCHARIFICATION OF PRETREATED SWITCHGRASS BY
   AN INTEGRATED T. REESEl STRAIN
             The saccharification performance of an enzyme composition produced by an
   integrated T. reeseistrain (H3A) was evaluated on dilute ammonia pretreated
15 switchgrass prepared according to the methods and process ranges in W006110901 A:
   Switchgrass (37% glucan, 21% xylan, 5% arabinan, 18% lignin) was hammer-milled to
   pass through a 1 mm screen, then pretreated at 1600C for 90 min with 10.0% NH3
   (weight / weight DM, added as NH40H). In duplicate 500 mL glass Erlenmeyer flasks,
   50 g of pretreated slurry at 25% solids was saccharified at 480C, pH 5.3 for 7 days, with
20 supernatant from the integrated strain was dosed at 14 mg TP/g of carbohydrate (glucan
   plus xylan). TP of H3A was determined by Total Nitrogen analysis of TCA-precipitable
   protein. Enzymes were dosed relative to the starting carbohydrate contents of the
   switchgrass before pretreatment.
             At the end of 7 days, high levels of glucan conversion (52-55%, Figure 57A)
25 and xylan conversion (51%-53%, (Figure 57B) were measured by HPLC. These results
   show that the enzyme composition produced by the integrated strain can saccharify
   dilute ammonia pretreated switchgrass at high solids (25% dry matter).
   21.     EXAMPLE 15: SACCHARIFICATION OF HARDWOOD PULP BY AN
   INTEGRATED T. REESEI STRAIN
30           The saccharification performance of an enzyme composition produced by
   integrated T reeseistrain H3A was evaluated on industrial hardwood unbleached pulp
   (derived from Kraft process and oxygen delignification, Smurfit Kappa Cellulose Du Pin,
                                               -138-

   Biganos, France) with the following composition: Glucan 75.1 %, Xylan 19.1 %, Acid
   soluble lignin 2.2 %. The enzymatic saccharification studies were carried out using NREL
   standard assay method LAP-009 "Enzymatic Saccharification of Lignocellulosic
   Biomass" (http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/42629.pdf), except that the cellulose loading
 5 was different (varying from 9.3-20%) and a total mass of 100 g was used. The
   experimental condition was 200 rpm and pH 5.0, 50'C. Enzyme was dosed at 20 mg
   TP/g glucan (based on final dry matter) at the start of the experiment. Samples were
   taken at timed intervals if they were liquefied, and then analyzed by HPLC for sugar
   concentration. Glucose, xylose, and cellobiose concentration were determined using a
10 Waters HPLC system (Alliance system, Waters Corp., Milford, MA). The HPLC column
   used for sugar analysis was from BioRad (Aminex HPX-87H ion exclusion column (300
   mm x 7.8 mm), BioRad Inc., Hercules, CA). All samples were diluted 10 x with 5 mM
   sulfuric acid, filtered through a 0.2 pm filter before injection into the HPLC. As indicated
   (TABLE 13) two experiments were carried out in "fed-batch" mode: Pretreated hardwood
15 pulp to an initial dry matter content of 7.0% at Time 0 and the rest of the substrate was
   added at discrete times in four equal portions during the first 24 h to bring the final dry
   solids loading to 20%.
             Results showed high levels of glucan and xylan conversion to monomers (up to
   89% and 90%, respectively) with the enzyme composition produced by integrated strain
20 H3A. Conversions increased with higher enzyme loadings and longer saccharification
   times. Conversion was lower when the solids were at 20% than at 15%, but this lower
   conversion at 20% could be partially mitigated by using a fed-batch process.
   22.      EXAMPLE 16: SACCHARIFICATION OF HARDWOOD PULP BY AN
   INTEGRATED T. REESEI STRAIN OVER A RANGE OF TEMPERATURE AND PH
25           The saccharification performance of an enzyme composition produced by an
   integrated T. reesei strain (H3A) on industrial hardwood unbleached pulp (as used in the
   preceding example) at 7% cellulose loading and 20 mg TP/g glucan of integrated strain
   supernatant (based on final dry matter and composition of the pretreated substrate) was
   tested at temperatures from 450 C - 601C and pH's from 4.65 - 5.4 (buffered in 0.1 M
30 sodium citrate). Results after 2 days saccharification are shown in TABLE 14 and show
   good glucan and xylan conversions over the whole range of conditions tested. These
   results suggested optimum conditions for saccharification of this substrate as pH 4.9 and
   501C but good conversions are seen even at pH 5.0, 601C. In a follow-up experiment at
                                                 -139-

   500C, including lower pH's (and otherwise unchanged experimental conditions) good
   saccharifications were seen at pH 3.8, pH 4.0 and pH 4.25, with glucose & xylose titers
   of 45.1 & 9.7 g/L; 50.0 & 11.4 g/L; and 57.2 & 13.2 g/L, respectively.
   23.     EXAMPLE 17: SACCHARIFICATION OF STEAM-EXPANDED SUGARCANE
 5 BAGASSE WITH AN ENZYME COMPOSITION PRODUCED BY AN INTEGRATED
   STRAIN AT DIFFERENT ENZYME DOSES
              The saccharification performance of an enzyme composition produced by an
   integrated T reesei strain (H3A) on steam-expanded sugarcane bagasse was evaluated
   at 7% cellulose loading. The bagasse was pretreated by steam injection in a StakeTech
10 reactor at 210 psig, 2000C with a 4 min residence time. The pretreated material had the
   following composition: Glucan 40.9 %, Xylan 20.8 %, Lignin 27%. The integrated strain
   supernatant was dosed at 10, 20, 30, 50 or 80 mg TP/g glucan (based on final dry matter
   and composition of the pretreated substrate). Saccharification was carried out in a 5 mL
   reaction volume at 500C, pH 5 for 3 days. The results (Figure 58A-C) showed that the
15 integrated strain product out-performed Accellerase* 1500 (20 mg protein/g glucan) in
   glucan conversion to glucose (Figure 58A and Figure 58C) and, especially, xylan
   conversion to xylose (Figure 58B and Figure 58C) even at half the Accellerase* 1500
   dose. Glucan conversion, especially at Day 1, increased significantly as the dose of H3A
   total protein increased (Figure 58A and Figure 58C), whereas xylan conversion was
20 more rapid, with little increase from Day 1 to Day 3, and very high, even at the lowest
   dose of H3A total protein (Figure 58B and Figure 58C).
   24.     EXAMPLE 18: SACCHARIFICATION OF DILUTE-ACID PRETREATED CORN
   FIBER WITH VARIOUS ENZYMES
              The saccharification performance of enzyme mixtures on dilute sulfuric acid
25 pretreated corn fiber was evaluated in a 250 mL shake flask. In a typical experiment,
   corn fiber (initial composition 38% C6 sugars and 27% C5 sugars) was adjusted to 15%
   DS (dry solids) and 0.36% (w/w%) sulfuric acid was added. Corn fiber slurry was then
   autoclaved at 121 C for 60 min. The slurry was then adjusted to pH 5.0 using 6 N
   NaOH. The sugar content of the pretreated sample was 21 g/L glucose and 12 g/L
30 xylose. Enzymes were added to the pretreated substrate as follows (as indicated in
   Figure 59A, 59B, 59C); Accellerase* 1500 (AC 1500): 20 mg TP/g glucan and 45 mg
   TP/g glucan; Accellerase 1500 + Multifect* Xylanase (MF): (25 mg/g glucan + 9mg
   TP/g xylan) and (25 mg TP/g glucan + 20 mg TP/g xylan); Accellerase* 1500 +Xyn 3+
   Fv3A+ Fv51 A + Fv43D: (25 mg TP/g glucan + 9 mg TP/g xylan + 7 mg TP/g xylan + 3
                                              -140-

   mg TP/g xylan + 1 mg TP/g xylan) (the full enzyme "blend"). The total protein (TP) of the
   commercial products (Accellerase* 1500 and Multifect* Xylanase: Danisco US Inc.,
   Genencor) were determined by Biuret assay. The other enzymes were ultra-filtration
   concentrates (UFCs) following expression in cellulase quad-deleted strains of T. reesei
 5 (as described earlier) - their TP were determined by Total Nitrogen analysis of TCA
   precipitable protein. All enzymes were dosed relative to the starting carbohydrate
   contents of the corn fiber before pretreatment. Enzymatic saccharification was carried
   out at 200 rpm and 50'C for 24 h, 48 h and 120 h. Samples were withdrawn at different
   time intervals and analyzed for the formation of glucose and xylose sugars by HPLC.
10 The adjusted sugar (glucose or xylose) reflected the sugar being produced from the
   enzymatic step, with the starting sugars subtracted.
             The results show that the full enzyme blend out-performed the (Accellerase*
   1500 + Multifect* Xylanase) ("AC 1500 + ME") in glucan conversion and in xylan
   conversion, even when both were dosed at the same total protein. The full enzyme
15 blend gave almost complete glucan conversion of this substrate after 5 days
   saccharification.
