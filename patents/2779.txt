         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         [0001]          The   field  of the     invention   generally  relates  to   compounds,
         compositions and methods for treatment of cancer.
         BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   10    [0002]          Cancer is a leading cause of death in Canada. The Canadian Cancer
         Society estimate there will be approximately 170000 new cases of cancer in 2011, and
         approximately 75000 deaths as a result of cancer.
         [0003]          An emerging approach for the treatment of cancer relates to the
         concept of synthetic lethality. Two genes (or two gene products) are synthetic lethal
   15    if mutation of either alone is compatible with viability but mutation of both leads to
         death.    Put another way, "synthetic lethality" describe situations where a mutation
         and a drug (for example) together cause a cancer cell's death - either the mutation or
         the drug would not result in cell death. Targeting a gene (or gene product) that is
         synthetic lethal to a cancer-relevant mutation should kill only cancer cells and spare
   20    normal cells. Synthetic lethality therefore provides a framework for the development
         of anti-cancer specific agents.
         [0004]          The approach of synthetic lethality to the treatment of cancer is
         emerging, is not yet a routine approach largely due to the absence identification of
         synthetic lethal genes (and gene products).
   25    [0005]          N-myristoylation of proteins is a modification in which myristate (a
          14-carbon saturated fatty acid) is covalently attached to the NH 2 terminal glycine of a
         variety of cellular, viral, and onco-proteins (e.g.,     oncogenic Src-related tyrosine
         kinases, heterotrimeric G alpha subunits, etc.).
                                                    -1 -

WO 2014/067002                                                                   PCT/CA2013/050821
         [0006]          Cellular myristoylated proteins have diverse biological functions in
         signal transduction and oncogenesis.       Modification of proteins by myristoylation is
         required for the subcellular targeting, protein conformation and biological activity of
         many important proteins in eukaryotic cells, including those required for signal
    5    transduction and regulatory functions important in cell growth. Tyrosine kinases of
         the   Src  family    (proto-oncogenes)     are   among  the   most  extensively   studied
         myristoylated proteins.
         [0007]          Myristoylation of proteins is catalyzed by N-myristoyltransferase
         (NMT).     NMT is responsible for this activity in eukaryotic cells and works by
   10    modifying its polypeptide substrate after the removal of the initiator methionine
         residue by methionyl aminopeptidase.           This modification occurs primarily as a
         cotranslational process, although myristoylation can also occur post-translationally
         after proteolytic cleavage of proteins, typically during apoptosis. Two isozymes of the
         mammalian NMT enzymes have been cloned and are designated NMT1 and NMT2.
   15    NMTs play a pro-survival role in cells. The two NMTs are present in all normal cells.
         [0008]          There remains a need for compounds, composition and method for the
         treatment of cancer.
         [0009]          This background information is provided for the purpose of making
         known information believed by the applicant to be of possible relevance to the present
   20    invention. No admission is necessarily intended, nor should it be construed, that any

   10    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         [00152]         As will be described in more detail below, there is described herein
         compounds, composition and methods for the treatment of a subject with cancer.
         There are also described here methods for identifying subject with cancer that are
         suitable for treatment with the compounds, composition and methods are described
   15    herein. There are also described here methods for identifying subject with cancer.
         [00153]         The present application provides methods and compositions for the
         treatment of NMT deficient cancers in a subject.          NMT-deficient cancers include
         cancers deficient in NMT2 or NMT1.           In a specific example, the NMT deficient
         cancer is a NMT2 deficient cancer.
   20    [00154]         The term "cancer", as used herein, refers to a variety of conditions
         caused by the abnormal, uncontrolled growth of cells. Cells capable of causing
         cancer, referred to as "cancer cells", possess characteristic properties such as
         uncontrolled proliferation, immortality,       metastatic  potential, rapid growth and
         proliferation rate, and/or certain typical morphological features. Cancer cells may be
   25    in the form of a tumour, but such cells may also exist alone within a subject, or may
         be a non-tumorigenic cancer cell.     A cancer can be detected in any of a number of
         ways, including, but not limited to, detecting the presence of a tumor or tumors (e.g.,
         by clinical or radiological means), examining cells within a tumor or from another
         biological sample (e.g., from a tissue biopsy), measuring blood markers indicative of
   30    cancer, and detecting a genotype indicative of a cancer. However, a negative result in
         one or more of the above detection methods does not necessarily indicate the absence

         may still have a cancer, as evidenced by a subsequent relapse.
         [00155]          In a specific example of the present disclosure,           the cancer is
         lymphoma.
    5    [00156]          The term "lymphoma" as used herein refers to a malignant growth of B
         or T cells in the lymphatic system. "Lymphoma" includes numerous types of
         malignant growths, including Hodgkin's Lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
         The term "non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma" as used herein, refers to a malignant growth of
         B or T cells in the lymphatic system that is not a Hodgkin's Lymphoma (which is
   10    characterized, e.g., by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells in the cancerous area).
         Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas encompass over 29 types of lymphoma, the distinctions
         between which are based on the type of cancer cells.
         [00157]          In a more specific example of the present disclosure, the cancer is a B
         lymphoma.
   15    [00158]          Thus, in one embodiment, the compounds, compositions and methods
         of the disclosure are suitable for the treatment of a subject with B cell lymphoma.
         [00159]          Examples of B-cell lymphomas include, but are not limited to, for
         example, follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma,
         B-CLL/SLL, immunocytoma/Waldenstrom's,              and MALT-type/monocytoid        B cell
   20    lymphoma. Also contemplated are the treatment of pediatric lymphomas such as
         Burkitt's lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, precursor
         B-LBL, precursor T-LBL, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

    5    [00161]          The term "subject", as used herein, refers to an animal, and can
         include, for example, domesticated animals, such as cats, dogs, etc., livestock (e.g.,
         cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, etc.), laboratory animals (e.g., mouse, rabbit, rat,
         guinea pig, etc.), mammals, non-human mammals, primates, non-human primates,
         rodents, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and any other animal. In a specific example,
   10    the subject is a human.
         [00162]          The term "treatment" or "treat" as used herein, refers to obtaining
         beneficial or desired results, including clinical results. Beneficial or desired clinical
         results can include, but are not limited to, alleviation or amelioration of one or more
         symptoms or conditions, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e. not
   15    worsening) state of disease, preventing spread of disease, delay or slowing of disease
         progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, diminishment of the
         reoccurrence of disease, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable
         or undetectable. "Treating" and "Treatment" can also mean prolonging survival as
         compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. "Treating" and "treatment"
   20    as used herein also include prophylactic treatment. For example, a subject with early
         cancer, for example an early stage lymphoma, can be treated to prevent progression or
         alternatively a subject in remission can be treated with a compound or composition
         described herein to prevent recurrence.
         [00163]          It is shown herein that B cell lymphoma cells express NMT1, but not
   25    NMT2. This is in contrast to the leukemic and other cells tested which express both
         NMT1 and NMT2. (As shown in Figures 1 and 4)
         [00164]          It is further shown herein that B lymphoma cells are sensitive to
         inhibition of cell viability by NMT inhibitors.
         [00165]          In one example, the NMT inhibitor is tris-dibenzylideneacetone
   30    dipalladium (Tris-DBA) (Figure 2)
         [00166]          In other examples, the NMT inhibitor 2-hydroxymyristae (HMA) is
         used to inhibit B lymphoma cells.

         [00167]         In yet another example, the pyrazole sulphonamide inhibitor of T.

         [00168]         In another example, the inhibitor is DDD86481.
    5    [00169]         In a specific example, treatment of a subject with B lymphoma
         comprises administering said subject with an NMT inhibitor.
         [00170]         NMT inhibitor compounds or derivatives may be used in the present
         invention for the treatment of NMT2 deficient cancer.
         [00171]         There term "deficient" as used herein refers broadly to inhibition,
   10    reduction or elimination of (as compared to wild type or control samples), for
         example, NMT synthesis, levels, activity, or function, as well as inhibition of the
         induction or stimulation of synthesis, levels, activity, or function of the protein of
         NMT (for example NMT 1 or NMT2).            The term also refers to any metabolic or
         regulatory pathway, which can regulate the synthesis, levels, activity, or function of
   15    NMT. The term includes also includes inhibition, reduction or elimination resulting
         form binding with other molecules and complex formation.           Therefore, the term
         "NMT deficient" refers to that which results in the inhibition, reduction, or
         elimination of protein function or protein pathway function. However, the term does
         not imply that each and every one of these functions must be inhibited at the same
   20    time.
         [00172]         In some examples, a cancer may be identified as being deficient in
         NMT by determining the presence of a mutation in a NMT gene. Such methods of
         nucleic acid detection and amplification are well known to the skilled worker.
         [00173]         For example the nucleic acid to be amplified may be from a biological
   25    sample. Various methods (such as phenol and chloroform extraction) of extraction are
         suitable for isolating the DNA or RNA. Nucleic acid extracted from a sample can be
         amplified using nucleic acid amplification techniques well known in the art. Non
         limiting examples include chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase polymerase
         chain reaction (RT-PCR), nested PCR, ligase chain reaction, amplifiable RNA
   30    reporters, Q-beta replication, transcription-based amplification, boomerang DNA
         amplification, strand displacement activation, cycling probe technology, isothermal

         nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA), or other sequence replication
         assays or signal amplification assays may also be used.
         [00174]         Methods of amplification are well known in the art. Some methods
         employ reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA.
    5    [00175]         In one example, PCR is used to amplify a target sequence of interest,
         e.g., a NMT2 sequence.
         [00176]         Nucleic acids may be amplified prior to detection or may be detected
         directly   during   an   amplification   step,    e.g., "real-time" methods.   In  some
         embodiments, the target sequence is amplified using a labeled primer such that the
   10    resulting amplicon is detectably labeled. In some embodiments, the primer is
         fluorescently labeled. In some embodiments, the target sequence is amplified and the
         resulting amplicon is detected by electrophoresis.
         [00177]         The level of gene expression can be determined by assessing the
         amount of NMT2 mRNA in a sample. Methods of measuring mRNA in samples are
   15    known in the art. To measure mRNA levels, the cells in the samples can be lysed and
         the levels of mRNA in the lysates or in RNA purified or semi-purified from lysates
         can be measured by any variety of methods familiar to those in the art. Such methods
         include, without limitation, hybridization assays using detectably labeled DNA or
         RNA probes, e.g., northern blotting, or quantitative or semi-quantitative RT-PCR
   20    methodologies using appropriate oligonucleotide primers. Alternatively, quantitative
         or semi-quantitative in situ hybridization assays can be carried out using, for example,
         tissue sections, or unlysed cell suspensions, and detectably labeled, e.g., fluorescent,
         or enzyme-labeled, DNA or RNA probes. Additional methods for quantifying mRNA
         include RNA protection assay ("RPA"), cDNA and oligonucleotide microarrays,
   25    representation   difference analysis   ("RDA"), differential display, EST sequence
         analysis, serial analysis of gene expression ("SAGE"), and multiplex ligation
         mediated amplification with the Luminex FlexMAP ("LMF").
         [00178]         Amplification can also be monitored using "real-time" methods. Real
         time PCR allows for the detection and quantitation of a nucleic acid target. Typically,
   30    this approach to quantitative PCR utilizes a fluorescent dye, which may be a double
         strand specific dye, such as SYBR Green.RTM. I. Alternatively, other fluorescent
         dyes, e.g., FAM or HEX, may be conjugated to an oligonucleotide probe or a primer.

         Various instruments capable of performing real time PCR are known in the art. The
         fluorescent signal generated at each cycle of PCR is proportional to the amount of
         PCR product. A plot of fluorescence versus cycle number is used to describe the
         kinetics of amplification and a fluorescence threshold level is used to define a
    5    fractional cycle number related to initial template concentration. When amplification
         is performed and detected on an instrument capable of reading fluorescence during
         thermal cycling, the intended PCR product from non-specific PCR products can be
         differentiated using melting analysis. By measuring the change in fluorescence while
         gradually increasing the temperature of the reaction subsequent to amplification and
   10    signal generation it may be possible to determine the (Act) of the intended product(s)
         as well as that of the nonspecific product.
         [00179]         The methods may include amplifying multiple nucleic acids in sample,
         also known as "multiplex detection" or "multiplexing." As used herein, the term
         "multiplex PCR" refers to PCR, which involves adding more than one set of PCR
   15    primers to the reaction in order to detect and quantify multiple nucleic acids,
         including nucleic acids from one or more target gene markers. Furthermore,
         multiplexing with an internal control, e.g.,       18s rRNA, GADPH, or .beta.-actin)
         provides a control for the PCR without reaction.

   20    NMT by determining epigenetic inactivation a NMT gene.
         [00181]         In some examples, a cancer may be identified as being deficient in
         NMT by determining the activity of NMT (including NMT 1 or NMT2) in a sample of
         cells from a subject. Activity may be determined relative to a control, for example in
         the case of defects in cancer cells, relative to non-cancerous cells, preferably from the
   25    same tissue. Thus, a cancer deficient in NMT may have reduced or eliminated NMT
         activity and/or expression.     The activity of NMT may be determined by using
         techniques well known in the art, and/or as described herein. In these examples, a
         cancer deficient in NMT has a reduced or eliminated activity.
         [00182]         In some examples, a cancer may be identified as NMT (e.g., NMT1,

         subject with cancer, or suspected of having cancer. In this example, the presence,
         absence or amount of myristoylated protein can be determined, for example, using
    5    click chemistry using appropriate fatty acid analogs.        Non-limiting methods are
         described herein. Alternate methods of determining the presence, absence, or amount
         of myristoylated proteins will be known to the skilled worker. A sample which has a
         reduced amount myristoylated protein in a sample (optionally as compared to a
         control) is indicative of an NMT deficient sample, or NMT deficient cancer. In some

         is indicative of an NMT2 deficient sample, or an NMT2 deficient cancer.
         [00184]         In some examples, a cancer may be identified as NMT deficient by
         determining the amount of the amount of acylation of proteins in a biological sample
         from a subject with cancer, or suspect of having cancer.          In this example, the
   15    presence, absence or amount of acylation of proteins can be determined.           Such
         methods would be known to the skilled worker.          A sample which has a reduced

         [00185]         In some examples, a cancer may be identified as a NMT deficient by
         determining the presence of one or more sequence variations such as mutations and
         polymorphisms may include a deletion, insertion or substitution of one or more
         nucleotides, relative to the wild-type nucleotide sequence. The one or more variations
   25    may be in a coding or non-coding region of the nucleic acid sequence and, may
         reduce or abolish the expression or function of NMT. Thus, the variant nucleic acid
         may encode a variant polypeptide which has reduced or abolished activity or may
         encode a wild-type polypeptide which has little or no expression within the cell, for
         example through the altered activity of a regulatory element.

   10    [00208]         In the case of lymphoma in a patient, known treatments are dependent
         upon the subject being treated, the type of disease, and its stage. Existing treatment

         [00211]           It will be appreciated that alternate methods to inhibit NMT1 or NMT2
         may be used in a synthetic lethal strategy for the treatment of cancer, and in particular
         the treatment of B cell lymphoma. For example, expression of NMT1 or NMT2 may
         be inhibited using anti-sense or RNAi technology. The use of these approaches to
   20    down-regulate gene expression and/or protein activity is known to the skilled worker.

         amount of concentration of acylated proteins.
    5    [00216]         The term "sample" as used herein refers to any sample from a subject,
         including but not limited to a fluid, cell or tissue sample that comprises cancer cells,
         or which is suspected of containing cancer cells, which can be assayed for gene
         expression levels, proteins levels, enzymatic activity levels, and the like. The sample
         may include, for example, a blood sample, a fractionated blood sample, a bone
   10    marrow sample, a biopsy, a frozen tissue sample, a fresh tissue specimen, a cell
         sample, and/or a paraffin embedded section, material from which RNA can be
         extracted in sufficient quantities and with adequate quality to permit measurement of
         relative mRNA levels, or material from which polypeptides can be extracted in
         sufficient quantities and with adequate quality to permit measurement of relative
   15    polypeptide levels.
         [00217]         The determination, analysis or measurement of NMT1 or NMT2, or
         the presence or absence of NMT1 and/or NMT2 can be correlated with the benefit of
         NMT 1-inhibtor or NMT2-inhibitor treatment of cancer in the patient.
         [00218]         The determination, analysis or measurement of myristolyated proteins,
   20    or the presence or absence of myristolyated proteins can be correlated with the benefit
         of NMT1-inhibtor or NMT2-inhibitor treatment of cancer in the patient.
         [00219]         The determination, analysis or measurement of acylated proteins, or

   25    [00220]         In a specific example, antibodies of the present invention          are
         immunoreactive or immunospecific for, and therefore specifically and selectively bind
         to a protein of interest, for example the protein NMT1 or NMT2. In one example,
         antibodies which are immunoreactive and immunospecific for human NMT1                 or
         NMT2 can be used.          Antibodies for human NMT1         or NMT2 are preferably
   30    immunospecific. The term "antibody" and "antibodies" includes, but is not limited to,
         monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.

         [00221]        In   another   example,    antibodies  of the    present   invention  are
         immunoreactive or immunospecific for, and therefore specifically and selectively bind
         to both NMT1       or NMT2 protein.          In this example,    antibodies which are
         immunoreactive and immunospecific for both human NMT 1 or NMT2 can be used.
    5    Antibodies for human NMT1 or NMT2 are preferably immunospecific. In this
         example, and owing to the different molecular mass of NMT1 and NMT2, it is
         possible identify the presence or absence of both proteins using a single antibody,
         using, for example SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.              The term "antibody" and
         "antibodies" includes, but is not limited to, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
   10    [00222]        The term "binds specifically" refers to high avidity and/or high affinity
         binding of an antibody to a specific polypeptide e.g., an epitope of NMT1 or NMT2.
         Antibody binding to its epitope on this specific polypeptide is stronger than binding of
         the same antibody to any other epitope, particularly those which may be present in
         molecules in association with, or in the same sample, as the specific polypeptide of
   15    interest.  Antibodies which bind specifically to a polypeptide of interest may be
         capable of binding other polypeptides at weak, yet detectable, level.        Such weak
         binding, or background binding, is readily discernable from the specific antibody
         binding to the compound or polypeptide of interest, e.g., by use of appropriate
         controls, as would be known to the worker skilled in the art.
   20    [00223]        In one example, a sample containing cancerous cells or suspected as
         containing cancerous cells is obtained from a subject with cancer. Collection of such
         a sample is well known to the skilled worker. In a specific example, the sample is a
         blood sample. Methods of obtaining a sample sample, processing and/or storage of
         such a sample are also well known to the skilled worker.
   25    [00224]        In a specific example, the detection, analysis or measurement of NMT1
         or NMT2 protein within a sample is carried out using immunohistochemistry.          In a
         more specific example, the detection, analysis, or measurement of NMT 2 within a
         sample is carried out using immunohistochemistry.        It will be clear to the skilled
         worker that other immuno-assays, both qualitative or quantitative, may be used in the
   30    present invention.
         [00225]        In   additional   examples,    immunohistochemistry     (IHC)    may   be
         accomplished using any suitable method or system of immunohistochemistry.           Non

         limiting examples include automated systems, quantitative IHC, semi-quantitative
         IHC, and manual methods.
         [00226]         The term "quantitative" immunohistochemistry refers to an automated
         method of scanning and scoring samples that have undergone immunohistochemistry,
    5    to identify and quantitate the presence of a specified biomarker, such as an antigen or
         other protein. For example, to quantitate NMT1 and/or NMT2.            The score given to
         the sample is a numerical representation of the intensity of the immunohistochemical
         staining of the sample, and represents the amount of target biomarker (such as NMT1
         or NMT2) present in the sample. As used herein, Optical Density (OD) is a numerical
   10    score that represents intensity of staining as well as the percentage of cells that are
         stained. As used herein, semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry refers to scoring of
         immunohistochemical results by human eye, where a trained operator ranks results
         numerically (e.g., as 0 [weak or absent staining], 1 or 2 [strong staining]).
         [00227]         Automated sample processing, scanning and analysis systems suitable
   15    for use with immunohistochemistry are known in the art, and may be used with the
         present invention.    Such systems may include automated staining and microscopic
         scanning, computerized image analysis, serial section comparison (to control for
         variation in the orientation and size of a sample), digital report generation, and
         archiving and tracking of samples (such as slides on which tissue sections are placed).
   20    Cellular imaging systems are commercially available that combine conventional light
         microscopes with digital image processing systems to perform quantitative analysis
         on cells and tissues, including immunostained samples.
         [00228]         In practice, in the example in which a patient sample is determined to
         have low (e.g., weak or absent) NMT2 tumour staining, the patient is considered a
   25    good candidate for NMT1 inhibitor treatment. In another specific example, a patient
         determined to have high (e.g., strong) NMT2 tumour staining is considered a poor
         candidate for NMT 1 inhibitor treatment.
         [00229]         It will be appreciated that the cut point for IHC negative vs positive
         determination is a semi-quantitative determination, and made by an experienced
   30    pathologist using semi-quantitiative methods and light microscopy.
         [00230]         For example, IHC can be scored in any of the following ways:       1. any
         staining vs no staining; 2. Strong vs weak staining; 3. None vs weak vs strong;         4.

         assisted quantitative scoring.
         [00231]         The cut points are initially defined by the variable drug sensitivity in
    5    vitro. Once drugs hit clinical trials, the sensitive vs not sensitive cut point will be
         further refined and validated.
         [00232]         In one example, in determining whether there is high (e.g., strong) or
         low (e.g., weak or absent) NMT2 tumour staining, the patient sample may be
         compared to one or more control samples. In one example, a control sample has had
   10    known and/or established level of NMT2 tumour staining. In one example, a control
         sample is a patient sample that has known and/or established levels of NMT2 tumour
         staining and/or known clinical outcome. In one example, a control is a cell line that
         has a known amount of NMT2 staining.
         [00233]         Continued treatment options for patients who are considered to be a
   15    poor candidate for NMT1 inhibitor treatment are known to the skilled worker.
         [00234]         It will be appreciated that in some circumstances, a patient who
         initially responds to NTM1 inhibitor treatment may relapse.         Such a relapse can
         manifest is several ways, including but not limited to, reoccurrence of the primary
         tumour and development of metastasis. In addition to, or alternatively, an additional
   20    distinct tumour can arise.

         provided a method comprising: a) obtaining a sample from a subject with, or
         suspected as having, cancer; b) contacting the sample with an antibody to NMT2 to
         form a complex between the antibody and NMT2 present in the sample; c) measuring
   25    the complex formed to determine an amount or a concentration of NMT2 in the

         [00238]          In some aspects, instrumentation having a detector set to detect the
         complex formed between the antibody and NMT2 in said sample is used to determine
   10    the amount of complex in the sample.      In some examples, the instrumentation is a
         spectrophotometer, spectrofluorometer, optical device, or electrochemical device. In
         some examples, the antibody to NMT2 is a monoclonal antibody, or a polyclonal
         antibody.
         [00239]          Other examples that may be used in the detection, analysis or
   15    measurement of NMT1 or NMT2 include, but are not limited to, immunoblotting,
         ELISA,       indirect    immuno-fluorescence,     multiplexing    bead     technology,
         immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry from sample obtain from the subject. In
         practice, in the example in which a patient sample is determined to have low or absent
         NMT2 staining, the subject is considered a good candidate for NMT-inhibitor
   20    therapy.
         [00240]          In one example the sample is analyzed by light mircorcopy by direct
         examination or by image capture and analysis, or by fluorescent microscopy using
         direct examination of by image capture and analysis.
         [00241]          In another example, a method of the present disclosure comprises
   25    qualitatively or quantitatively determining, analyzing or measuring the activity of
         NMT1 and/or NMT2 protein activity in biological sample from a subject with cancer
         patient for the presence or absence or amount of NMT1 and/or NMT2 activity. In this
         example, the uses of substrates (natural or synthetic) of NMT1 or NMT2 are used to
         identify a sample in which NMT1 or NMT2 activity is present, absent, or the amount
   30    thereof.

         [00247]         In another example, a method of the present disclosure comprises
         identifying a mutation, deletion, or the like, in the NMT 1 or NMT2 gene in a sample
         from a subject with cancer or suspect of having cancer.        Wherein, said mutation,
         deletion, or the like, in NMT1 or NMT2 gene results in a loss of diminishment of
   20    NMT1 or NMT2 protein activity in cancer cells within said sample.          Methods of
         identifying such mutations, deletions, or the like, in NMT 1 or NMT2 are known to the

         with a defect in NMT1 or NMT2, comprising administering to said subject an

         antibodies, peptide fragments, and/or nucleic acid molecules.

         [00253]         Specific examples of small molecules include Tris-DBA, HMA,
         DDD85646, DDD86481, and their derivatives. The term "derivatives" as used herein
         includes, but is not limited to, salts, coordination complexes, esters such as in vivo
         hydrolysable esters, free acids or bases, hydrates, prodrugs or lipids, coupling
    5    partners.
         [00254]         Peptide fragments may be prepared wholly or partly by chemical
         synthesis that active site of NMT1. Peptide fragments can be prepared according to
         established, standard liquid or solid-phase peptide synthesis methods, which will be
         known to the skilled worker.
   10    [00255]         Nucleic acid inhibitors, or the complements thereof, inhibit activity or
         function by down-regulating production of active polypeptide. This can be monitored
         using conventional methods well known in the art, for example by screening using
         real time PCR as described in the examples.
         [00256]         Examples of nucleic acid inhibitors include anti-sense or RNAi
   15    technology, the use of which is to down-regulate gene expression is well established
         in the art.     Anti-sense oligonucleotides may be designed to hybridize to the
         complementary sequence of nucleic acid, pre-mRNA or mature mRNA, interfering
         with the production of the base excision repair pathway component so that its
         expression is reduced or completely or substantially completely prevented. In addition
   20    to targeting coding sequence, anti- sense techniques may be used to target control
         sequences of a gene, e.g. in the 5' flanking sequence, whereby the anti-sense
         oligonucleotides can interfere with expression control sequences.
         [00257]         An alternative to anti-sense is to use a copy of all or part of the target
         gene inserted in sense, that is the same, orientation as the target gene, to achieve
   25    reduction in expression of the target gene by co-suppression.
         [00258]         Additionally, double stranded RNA (dsRNA) silencing may be used.
         dsRNA mediated silencing is gene specific and is often termed RNA interference
         (RNAi).
         [00259]         In another example, nucleic acid is used which on transcription
   30    produces a ribozyme, able to cut nucleic acid at a specific site and therefore also
         useful in influencing NMT.

         [00260]         In yet another example, small RNA molecules may be employed to
         regulate gene expression.     These include targeted degradation of mRNAs by small
         interfering    RNAs    (siRNAs),     post    transcriptional    gene   silencing  (PTGs),
         developmentally regulated sequence-specific translational repression of mRNA by
    5    micro-RNAs (miRNAs) and targeted transcriptional gene silencing.
         [00261]         In yet another example, the expression of a short hairpin RNA
         molecule (shRNA) in the cell may be used. A shRNA consists of short inverted
         repeats separated by a small loop sequence. One inverted repeat is complimentary to
         the gene target. In the cell the shRNA is processed by DICER into a siRNA which
   10    degrades the target NMT gene mRNA and suppresses expression. In a preferred
         embodiment the shRNA is produced endogenously (within a cell) by transcription
         from a vector.
         [00262]         A defect in NMT1 or NMT2, is a NMT1 or NMT2 deficient,
         respectively, phenotype which may be deficient in a component of a NMT1 or NMT2
   15    mediated pathway i.e., expression of activity of a component of the pathway may be
         reduced or abolished in the cancer cell relative             to control cells.   In some
         embodiments, the cancer cell may be deficient in NMT1 or NMT2 i.e., expression of
         activity of NMT1 or NMT2 may be reduced or abolished in the cancer cell relative to
         control cells.
   20    [00263]         Accordingly, there is provided the use of NMT2 as a marker for one or
         more of diagnosis, prognosis, classifying, or monitoring of cancer in a subject. In
         some examples, NMT2 is measured using an assay selected from immunoassays or
         nucleic acid detection, or protein activity.
         [00264]         The term "prognosis" as used herein refers to the prediction of the
   25    likelihood of cancer-attributable death or progression, including recurrence, metastatic
         spread, and drug resistance, of a neoplastic disease, such as breast cancer.
         [00265]         The term "prognostic marker" as used herein refers to a marker that
         informs about the outcome of a patient in the absence of systemic therapy or portends
         an outcome different from that of the patients without the marker, despite empiric (not
   30    targeted to the marker) systemic therapy.

    5    molecular and/or pathological state, disease or condition, such as the identification of
         breast cancer, or other type of cancer.

         one or more of diagnosis, prognosis, classifying or monitoring cancer in a subject.

         [00290]          Mutation of caspase cleavage sites in V5-NMT by site-directed
         mutagenesis
         [00291]          The NMT1 and NMT2 caspase cleavage sites identified by Edman
         degradation sequencing (Alphalyse) were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis.
    5    Therefore, we used previously cloned V5-NMT1 and V5-NMT2 gateway vectors to
         mutate the identified caspase cleavage sites. Hence, the Asp-72 residue of V5-NMT1
         and Asp-25, Asp-67 and both Asp-25,67 (double mutant) residues of V5-NMT2 were
         mutated     using    the   Quickchange       site-directed   mutagenesis  kit  (Agilent
         Technologies) according to manufacturer's instructions.
   10    [00292]          Briefly, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using 5 to 50 ng of
         dsDNA (vector), 5 gL of 1Ox reaction buffer, 125 ng of primers dissolved in
         nuclease-free water and was brought up to a final reaction volume of 50 gL with
         nuclease-free water. 2.5 U of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies) was
         added to the mix prior to starting the reaction, which was performed for 18 cycles in
   15    the Eppendorf Mastercycler 1 thermocycler. Subsequently, the parental dsDNA was
         digested by adding 10 U of Dpn I restriction enzyme to each reaction and incubating
         for 1 h at 37 0 C. Additionally, the primers for site-directed mutagenesis were designed
         using the PrimerX program (http://www.bioinformatics.org/primerx/) (listed in table
         2.6). Importantly, the aspartate (D) residues of the caspase cleavage sites were
   20    mutated into glutamate (E) residues to generate the following vectors; V5-NMT1
         (D72E), V5-NMT2 (D25E), V5-NMT2 (D67E) and V5-NMT2 (D25,67E). The
         mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Eurofins MWG Operon).

   25    molecular cloning; His-73NMT1, His-26NMT2 and His-68NMT2. The truncated
         DNA sequences were cloned into the pET-19b (Novagen@) vector, which has an N

         [00322]         Metabolic labeling of cells using bio-orthogonal o-alkynyl myristic
         acid and click chemistry
         [00323]         Metabolic labeling of cells using o -alkynyl myristic acid
         [00324]         Cells were labeled with 100 to 25 gM o-alkynyl myristic acid 30 min
    5    prior to harvesting the cells and lysed in 0. 1%SDS-RIPA-HEPES buffer. Protein (50
         30 gg) from the resulting cell lysates were reacted with 100 gM azido-biotin using
         click chemistry and processed as described previously (Yap et al., 2010). Briefly, cells
         were starved of fatty acids by incubating in media (RPMI or DMEM) which were
         supplemented with 5% dextran-coated charcoal-treated FBS (DCC-FBS) for 1 h prior
   10    to labeling. Next, o-alkynyl-myristic acid was dissolved in DMSO to generate 25 or
          100 mM stock solutions. Typically, the cellular uptake of co-alkynyl myristic acid
         typically was improved with saponification and conjugation to BSA. Therefore, prior
         to labeling, o-alkynyl myristic acid was saponified with 20% molar excess of
         potassium hydroxide at 65 C for 15 min. Next, serum-free culture media (pre
   15    warmed) containing 20% fatty acid-free BSA at 37 0 C was added to the saponified co
         alkynyl myristic acid and incubated for an additional 15 min at 37 0 C.
         [00325]         Subsequently, cells deprived of fatty acids were washed once with
         warm PBS and incubated in fresh RPMI or DMEM without any supplements. Next,
         the appropriate volume of 20X fatty acid-BSA conjugate in serum-free media was
   20    added to the cells, to ensure that the final concentration of BSA was 1% and I
         alkynyl myristic acid was at the indicated concentration (25 gM or 100 gM) for each
         respective experiment. DMSO or unlabeled fatty acids conjugated to BSA were used
         as controls for the experiments performed. Cells were labeled with co-alkynyl myristic
         acid for 30 min at 37 0 C in a 5% C02 humidified incubator prior to harvesting. Cells
   25    were harvested in 0.1% SDS-RIPA-HEPES buffer that was supplemented with IX
         complete protease inhibitor (EDTA-free).
         [00326]         Click chemistry
         [00327]         After labeling cells with o -alkynyl myristic acid, the resulting lysates
         were subjected to click chemistry with azido-biotin to enable the detection of the
   30    myristoylated proteins by ECL as described previously (Yap et al., 2010). Typically,
         cell lysates (30 - 50 gg of protein) were adjusted to contain 1% SDS and incubated
         with 100 gM Tris-(benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine (TBTA), 1 mM CuSO4, 1 mM Tris

         carboxyethylphosphine (TCEP), and 100 gM azido-biotin at 37 0 C for 30 min in
         darkness, in order for the click reaction to proceed. Next, 10 volumes of ice-cold
         acetone was added to stop the click reaction and proteins were precipitated at -20'C
         overnight. Subsequently, the acetone precipitated proteins were centrifuged at 16,000
    5    g for 10 min, resuspended in IX SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 20 mM DTT.
         Samples were then heated at 95oC for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and
         transferred on to PVDF membranes for western blot analysis.
         [00328]         Treatment of PVDF membranes with neutral Tris-HCI or KOH
         [00329]         Protein samples were loaded on duplicate SDS-PAGE gels for the
   10    experiments where PVDF membranes were treated with KOH or neutral Tris-HCl.
         After electrophoresis, the KOH treated PVDF membranes were incubated in 100 ml
         of 0.1 N KOH in methanol [1 N KOH in H20: methanol 1:9 (v/v)], whereas the other
         was incubated in 0.1 N Tris-HCl pH 7.0 in methanol [1 N Tris-HCl, pH 7.0:methanol
          1:9 (v/v)] at room temperature for 45 min with gentle shaking. Subsequently, the
   15    treated membranes were washed thoroughly with PBS, probed with Streptavidin-HRP
         or Neutravidin-HRP and detected with ECL.
         [00330]         Radioactive NMT activity assay in cells undergoing apoptosis
         [00331]         NMT activity was measured by adapting a protocol developed by the
         Sharma laboratory (King and Sharma, 1991; Raju and Sharma, 1999). A stock
   20    solution of [3H]-myristoyl-CoA was prepared freshly and synthesized as described
         previously (Towler and Glaser, 1986). To make a 200 pL stock solution of [3H]
         myristoyl-CoA, 97 pL of myristoyl-CoA generation buffer was combined with 20 E L
         of 50 mM ATP, 101 DL of 20 mM LiCoA, 60 pL of pseudomonas acyl-CoA
         synthetase and 13 pL of [9,10 - 3H]-myristic acid. The solution was mixed gently and
   25    incubated at 37 0 C for 30 min.
         [00332]         For this assay, COS-7 cells transiently transfected with plasmids
         encoding for V5-NMT1 and V5-NMT2 were induced to undergo apoptosis with STS
         (2.5 pM) and cycloheximide (5 gg/ml) or not, and, harvested at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h time
         points. The cells were sonicated using a Branson sonifier 450 and ~20 pg of lysate
   30    (lysed in 50 mM NaH2PO4 pH 7.4, 0.25M sucrose buffer) was used for each reaction.
         For each NMT assay reaction, 3.85 pL of NMT assay buffer, 1.25 pL 20% Triton X

         myristoylatable (BID A: ANRSSHSRLG) decapeptide (purchased from Peptide 2.0
         Inc.) corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of ct-Bid (1mM stock in ethanol) was
         added to a microcentrifuge tube and kept on ice before the start of the reaction. At the
         start of the reaction, 7.4 gL (10 pMol) of freshly synthesized of [3H] myristoyl-CoA
    5    was added to each microcentrifuge tube containing the NMT assay mixture at 15
         second intervals and 25 gL reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30oC. The reaction
         was terminated by spotting 15 gL of the reaction mixture onto a P81 phosphocellulose
         paper disc (Whatman) at 15 second intervals and dried with a hair dryer for 30
         seconds.
   10    [00333]         Next, the p81 phosphocellulose paper discs were transferred to the
         washing unit and washed 3 times, 30 min each, with NMT assay wash buffer for a
         total  period   of 90     min.  Subsequently,   the radioactivity  remaining    on   the
         phosphocellulose (which corresponds to the myristoylated peptide) was quantified in
         5 mL of liquid scintillation mixture using a Beckman Coulter LS6500 scintillation
   15    counter. The NMT activity was calculated as fmol/min/gg of protein.

         [00335]         The NMT activity of full length and truncated His-tagged NMTs were
         measured using the same protocol as described above. However, only 1 gg of purified
   20    protein (volume was brought up to 10 gL in NMT assay buffer) was used in this
         assay.

         [00337]         The in vitro NMT cleavage assay was performed by incubating 10 E g
         of purified His-NMT1 and His-NMT2 with 1 gg of recombinant human active
   25    caspase-3 or -8 in caspase cleavage assay buffer in 100 gL reactions for 1 hour at 37
         oC. Reaction was terminated with the addition of 10 gM general caspase inhibitor z
         VAD-FMK and subsequently 5X sample loading buffer were added. Reacted samples
         were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a PVDF membrane.
         The bands were visualized by Coomassie blue staining and cleavage fragments were
   30    excised from the membrane and sent for Edman degradation to Alphalyse in Palo
         Alto, CA.

         transformed with His-NMT1 and His-NMT2 vectors according to manufacturer's
         protocol. NMT1 and NMT2 proteins were prepared as follows: a 3 mL starter culture
    5    was grown in LB broth (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 100 gg/mL
         ampicillin and 34 gg/mL Chloramphenicol) for 4 h at 37oC, while shaking at 225
         rpm. The entire culture was used to inoculate a 50 mL culture which was grown at
         37oC for 16 h. Next, the bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 x g for
          10 min at room temperature. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 10 mL LB and 5
   10    mL of the resuspension was used to inoculate 500 mL of LB that was incubated at
         37oC with vigorous shaking (225 rpm) until an OD600 of 0.5-0.6 was reached.
         [00340]         Next, protein expression was induced by 0.5 mM Isopropyl $-D-1
         thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) addition at 30oC with vigorous shaking (225 rpm) for 4
         h. The suspension was centrifuged at 6000 x g at 4oC for 20 min and the bacterial
   15    pellet  was frozen      overnight. Subsequently,    the  thawed bacterial pellet    was
         resuspended in 25 mL bacterial lysis buffer supplemented with complete protease
         inhibitor (CPI) from Roche and incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were then
         sonicated 3 times for 1 min with 1 min intervals in between at an output of 5.0
         (Branson Sonfier 450) and incubated at 37oC for 30 min prior to centrifugation at
   20     15,000 x g for 1 h at 4oC.
         [00341]         Meanwhile, Ni-NTA agarose beads (His-Pure Ni-NTA resin from
         Thermo Fisher Scientific) were packed into columns according to manufacturer's

         obtained from the previous centrifugation was then loaded into the column and
   25    incubated with gentle shaking at 4oC for 1 h. The sample was then eluted from the
         column by gravity flow and the column was washed twice with 5 mL wash buffer

         [00342]         Since samples from the first four elutions had the highest protein

         normal cells and various B cell lymphomas and T cell leukemias.       This figure shows

         [00356]         While not wishing to be bound by theory, those cells which express
         only one NMT isozyme, for example Burkitt's lymphoma cells which shows the near
         complete absence of NMT2, are likely to have altered myristoylated protein profiles.
   20    [00357]         A sample which has a reduced amount myristoylated protein in a
         sample (optionally as compared to a control) is indicative of an NMT deficient

         tris-dibenzylideneacetone-dipalladium (Tris-DBA).
         [00362]          NMT activity was assayed using a peptide myristoylation assay with
    5    purified recombinant NMT1 and NMT2. NMT activity was calculated from the
         amount of radiolabeled myristoylpeptide produced and detected on phosphocellulose
         paper (adapted from King et al. 1991, Anal Biochem.).
         [00363]          This figure shows that tris-dibenzylideneacetone-dipalladium       (Tris

         (Invitrogen) following the recommended protocol for Ramos cell line (1,350 Volt, 30
   30    ms). Transfected cells were centrifuged 5 minutes at 1200rpm to remove dead cells and
         cellular debris. Cells in the supernatant were allowed to recover for 6 hours in complete

    5    [00371]              In this example, qRT-PCR was performed with Taqman NMT1 and
         NMT2 probes using an 18S probe as an internal control. The difference in the number of
         cycle times (Act) was calculated by subtracting the cycle time (ct) at which we see an
         exponential increase in the expression of the 18S internal control for each cell type from
         the NMT cycle time, again at a point where exponential increase of the signal is seen. As
   10    shown in Table 1, below, the ratio of NMT2 to NMT1 expression is decreased (up to 60
         fold) in B lymphoma cell lines. While not wishing to be bound by theory, these results
         may suggest that that a reduction in mRNA encoding for NMT2 may be responsible for
         the reduction of NMT 2 protein levels assessed by Western blotting.

    5    mouse monoclonal anti-NMT2 (1:2500). It is shown that numerous tumour samples
         of each type fall under the average of NMT2 expression level (0.392 +/      0.30).
         [00375]         In Panel A, it is shown that Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines BL-2, Daudi,

         immuno-histochemistry:
   15    [00379]         B cell lymphoma tumors were fixed in formalin and embedded in
         paraffin and cut on a microtome to desired thickness (~5 microns or gm) and affixed
         onto a Superfrost plus positively charged slide (Fisher Scientific). Before staining
         the slides containing tumor tissues were deparaffinized by dipping in xylene 3 times
         for 10 min each, a series of washes in ethanol [20 dips in 100% ethanol (repeat 4
   20    times), 20 dips in80% ethanol, and 20 dips in 50% ethanol] and a final wash in
         running cold water for 10 min.
         [00380]         For antigen retrieval, slides were loaded in a slide holder and placed in
         a Nordicware microwave pressure cooker and 800 mL of 10 mM citrate buffer pH
         6.0 was added to it. The pressure cooker was tightly closed, placed in a microwave
   25    and microwaved on high for 20 min. Next, slides were washed in cold running water
         for 10 min. Peroxidase blocking was performed by soaking slides in 3% H202 in
         methanol for 10 min and washing with warm running water for 10 min before
         washing in PBS for 3 min.

         [00401]         In Figure 9C, DDD73226, was used to treat BL cell lines (BL-2 and
    5    Ramos) along with the relevant controls [IM9 ("normal" B lymphocyte) and KMH2
         (HL cell line) that expresses both NMTs)].         The cytotoxity of DDD73226 was
         measured using a trypan blue exclusion assay at 72h. No significant changes to cell
         viability were observed at 24 and 48h (data not shown).           Also, there was no
         significant change to the viability of IM9, KMH2 and Ramos cells when cells were
   10    treated with DDD73226 at concentrations as high as 100 gM at the 72h time point.
         There was, however, a slight decrease in cell viability observed in BL2 cells treated
         with 100 gM DDD73226 at 72 h, when compared to other cells. While not wishing to
         be bound by theory, this may be because in addition to having severely decreased
         NMT2 levels, BL2 also has lower NMT1 levels when compared to Ramos and other
   15    cell lines, and therefore may be more susceptible to the action of even less potent
         NMT inhibitors.
         [00402]         In Figure 9D (Panels i and ii), a time-course experiment is presented
         wherein IM-9 and BL2 cells were labeled with 100 gM         o>-alkynyl-myristate for 1h

         blotting with NeutrAvidinTm -HRP. The inhibitory action of DDD86481 was rapid,
         with nearly complete inhibition of myristoylation in the cells (both IM-9 and BL2)
    5    treated with 1 gM DDD86481 after one hour of treatment.
         [00403]         In Figure 9 E, the minimal dose of DDD86481 required to inhibit
         myristoylation in IM-9, BL2 and Ramos cell lines, was determined. Cells were treated
         with DDD86481 at 0, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 nM concentrations for 2h with
         metabolic cell labeling with alkynyl-myristate in the last 1h of treatment. DDD86481
   10    inhibited myristoylation in a concentration dependent manner in all cell lines tested.
         BL-2 and Ramos cell lines were more sensitive to the inhibitory action of DDD86481,
         as a decrease in the incorporation of the alkyne-myristate label into the myristoylated
         proteins was apparent starting at 50 nM for both BL cell lines when compared to IM-9
         where incorporation of alkyne-myristate label decreased starting at the 100 nM
   15    concentration.

         remain active. Panel A and B. The lysates of Jurkat cells induced to undergo anti-Fas
         or staurosporine mediated apoptosis were probed with anti-NMT1 and anti-NMT2 by
    5    western blotting and show a time dependent cleavage of both enzymes. Western
         blotting was performed on the same samples using antibodies against PAK2 and
         GAPDH. Panel C and D. Incorporation of o-alkynyl-myristate in Jurkat cells induced
         to undergo anti-Fas or staurosporine mediated apoptosis illustrates a change in
         myristoylation profiles as cells are starting to die and suggest that although the NMTs
   10    are cleaved they are still active. Jurkat cells were metabolically labelled with 25gM
         alkynyl-myristate    after induction of apoptosis with       anti-FAS (100ng/ml)     and
         cycloheximide (5 gg/ ml) (C) or staurosporine (2.5gM) and cycloheximide (5 gg/
         ml) (D). Protein samples were reacted with azido-biotin using click chemistry and
         visualized by western blotting with NeutrAvidinTM-HRP. Prior to assessment of
   15    label incorporation by western blotting membranes were incubated in 0.1 M KOH (B
         and D). Panel (E) At the various indicated times, NMT activity was assayed using ct
         Bid N-terminal decapeptide and [3H]-myristoyl-CoA. While both NMT enzymes are
         cleaved both remain catalytically active and only NMT1 exhibits a significant loss of
         activity. (F) Reconstitution of NMT1 cleavage by caspases-8 and -3, and, NMT2
   20    cleavage by caspase-3 in vitro (Coomassie stained gel). Purified His-NMT1 and His
         NMT2 (5 ug of each) was incubated with active Caspase 3 and 8 (500ng of each) for
          1 hour at 37 0 C.  A general caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) was added to stop the
         reaction from proceeding further at the end of the incubation. The samples were
         immediately boiled with 5x sample loading buffer with Beta-Mercaptoethanol and
   25    loaded on a 10% Acrylamide gel and transferred on to a PVDF membrane. The
         membrane was then stained with Coomassie blue to visualize proteins. The cleaved
         fragments, which were sent for Edman degradation are boxed and allowed the
         identification of caspase cleavage sites in NMT1 after D72 and NMT2 after D25 and
         D67.

         [00414]          In this example, in Figure 14, comparison of enzyme activities between
         purified recombinant full-length His6-NMT1 and recombinant "caspase-truncated" ct
         His6 -NMT1 is shown.        Full-length His 6-NMT1 (aa 73-496).      NMT activity was
         assayed using a peptide myristoylation assay adapted from King et al.          1999, Anal
   15    Biochem. Experiments in duplicate.
         [00415]          Example 16
         [00416]          In this example, in Figure 15, comparison of the EC50 and IC50 of
         various NMT inhibitors and different cell lines is shown. The graph shows the
         correlation between the biochemical potency of 8 NMT inhibitors in the biochemical
   20    enzymatic assay (IC50) and their potency in an alamar blue cell viability assay using
         7 cell lines (EC50). Regression analysis was conducted on each cell line and gave a
         mean R2 value of 0.9 (rangeO.82-0.96).        This high level of correlation between the
         various IC50 and EC50 is strong evidence that the activity of the molecules in the cell
         viability assay is due to their inhibitory activity at NMT.        Note that 2 pairs of
   25    molecules have similar potencies in the biochemical assay.

         [00419]          "Normal" immortalized B lymphocytes (IM9), KMH2 (Hodgkin's
   30    lymphoma) and BL (BL2 and Ramos) cells were                  incubated with increasing
         concentrations (nM) of DDD86481 and monitored the cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose

         performed on cell lysates to monitor the cleavage or PARP-1 and caspase-3 as well as
         the presence of GAPDH as loading control (composite gels).            Both PARP-1 and
         caspase-3 cleavage occurred in a dose-dependent fashion when BL cell lines were
         treated with the inhibitor, indicating that these cells undergo apoptosis. No PARP- 1 or
    5    caspase-3 cleavage was observed in the "normal" IM9 cells treated with the inhibitor.
         PARP-1 cleavage in KMH2 (HL) cells was observed at higher concentrations,
         although it was minimal when compared to PARP-1 cleavage observed in the BL
         cells.  Thus, we found that BL cells are more inclined to undergo apoptosis than
         "normal" B cells when treated with DDD86481.

         (DLBCL)
         [00422]           In Figure 17, Panel A, the indicated lymphoid cell lines were probed
         for the presence of NMT2 by western blotting. In Figure 17, Panel B, by comparing
         Panel A and Table 7, we demonstrate at a log 2(micro-array fluorescence intensity
    5    NMT2) = 5.64 observed in Toledo cells, there is no NMT2 detectable by western
         blotting. Although the actual threshold for the loss of NMT2 expression might be
         higher than 5.64, we are, in this example, using this number as a threshold to establish
         the approximate prevalence of the loss of NMT2 in human population (Panel B). The
         data indicate that the loss of NMT2 is not only prevalent in Burkitt and Diffuse Large
   10    B Cell Lymphomas but also in a large variety of other tumor types (see also Figure
          1 IC for a list of 50 cell line expressing the least NMT2 and table for the prevalence of
         the loss of NMT2 in various cancer types).
         [00423]           Accordingly, there is provided herein a method of identifying those
         NMT2-deficitent cancers suitable for treatment with one or more NMT1 inhibitors.
   15    In one example, a patient sample with mRNA levels or concentration below about a
         threshold value, indicates said patient is a good candidate for treatment with an NMT1
         inhibitor. In some examples, an mRNA level below about the threshold is referred to
         as low expression.         In one example, a patient sample with mRNA levels or
         concentration above about a threshold value, indicates that said patient is a poor
   20    candidate for treatment with an NMT1 inhibitor. In some examples, an mRNA level
         above about the threshold is referred to as high expression.
         [00424]           It will be appreciated that in addition to, or instead of, the threshold
         value established in respect of Toledo cells, alternate sources may serve as a suitable
         threshold values. In some example, the source or control used to obtain a threshold
   25    value is the same cell type as the cancer being tested for. In some examples, the
         source or control threshold values are stored or found in a database.

         [00426]         In this example, in Figure 18, the use of a desthiobiotin-PEG-azide
         probe to pull-down post-translationally   o-alkynyl-myristoylated proteins in leukemic
         Jurkat T cells using streptavidin-sepharose beads is shown.
    5    [00427]         Desthiobiotin (shown in I) is an analogue of biotin that reversibly bind
         to avidin and avidin-like proteins.       We designed and ordered the synthesis of
         desthiobiotin-PEG-azide (I.) and biotin-PEG-azide (II.).
         [00428]         In (B) Jurkat T cells were grown in the presence of o-alkynyl
         myristate and induced to undergo anti-Fas mediated apoptosis in the presence of
   10    cycloheximide.     Following cell lysis, lysates were reacted with desthiobiotin-PEG
         azide using click chemistry or not, mixed with neutravidin-sepharose beads, washed
         and eluted with 10mM biotin.         Panel B (i) shows that desthiobiotinylated-post
         translationally myristoylated protein can be pulled down and recovered efficiently
         from neutravidin beads lanes 5,6,7 and B (iii). In panel B (ii), a control in which the
   15    desthiobiotin-PEG-azide was omitted from the click reaction is shown. In that case,
         very few proteins bound to the neutravidin-beads and were eluted (only a faint band
         can be seen at 75kDa). These results indicate the development of a method to enable
         a proteomic analyses and assess the cellular contents of co- and post-translationally
         myristoylated proteins or myristoylomes.

         in leukemic Jurkat T cells using streptavidin-magnetic beads.        Jurkat Cells were
         induced to undergo apoptosis with 2.5 gM of staurosporine for 3 h then labelled with
   25     100 gM myristate (C14) (Panel A) or alkynyl-myristate (Alk C14) (Panel B) both
         conjugated to BSA for 1 h at 37 0 C.      Cells were collected, lysed and reacted with
         azido-desthiobiotin    using  click  chemistry.    Desthiobiotin-alkynyl-myristoylated
         proteins were bound to streptavidin magnetic beads, washed and eluted with 50 mM
         Biotin with 2% SDS at 37 0 C for 15 min. Elution 1 (B panel) contains the majority of
   30    desthiobiotin-myristoylated proteins while little are found in the elution 1 from cells
         labelled with myristate (A panel). Exposure time: 5 seconds.

         [00434]         In this example, in Figure 21, time and dose dependent cytotoxicity
         graphs from the combination        of DDD86481       and doxorubixin are shown. B
         lymphocytic cell lines IM-9 (A) and BL-2 (B) were treated with increasing
         concentrations of DDD86481 (0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10 and 100gM) at 0 (Blue) , 17
   15    (Red) and 86 nM (Green) hydroxydoxorubicin for 24, 48 or 72 hours (top to bottom).
         The MTS assays demonstrate cell kill induced by concentrations of doxorubicin and
         DDD86481 that individually are much less toxic; this effect is consistent with a
         synergistic interaction. This is characterized by a 6 fold lowering of the EC 5 o's when
         both compounds are used together in comparison to the EC5 o's for DDD86481 used
   20    alone at 24 and 48 hour time points.

         America.    We established a minimal cut-off value of 5.64 for the log 2 (microarray
   25    fluorescence intensity) that corresponds to cells with no NMT2 (Toledo, see Example
          18) and found that 114 of 967 cell lines fall under this threshold (~12%).         North
         American incidence rates for each tumor type, number of patients that indicate benefit
         from an NMT inhibitor therapy (incidence X % under the threshold) and rationale for
         the medical needs of selected cancers are also shown.

    5    [00438]                     In this example, in Figure 22, immunoblotting was conducted with
         cells incubated with DMSO, Staurosporine, a FAS, or carrier alone.                                                               The resulting
         immunoblotts were probed with anti-NMT1 antibody, anti-NMT2 antibody, anti
         PARP-1 antibody, and anti-GAPDH antibody.                                                  These data include at the NMT is
         cleaved upon induction of apoptosis.
   10    [00439]                     In particular, in this example, in Figure 22A, the role(s) of NMTs in
         living and dying cells was investigated.                                             Jurkat T cells induced to undergo
         programmed cell death with anti-Fas or STS were analyzed for their content in NMTs.
         Jurkat T cells were treated with DMSO, staurosporine (2.5 gM) or anti-Fas (300
         ng/ml) with cycloheximide (5 gg/mL) and samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h
   15    time points. Cells were lysed and the presence of NMT1, NMT2, PARP-1 and
         GAPDH was assessed by Western blotting using ECL.                                                         The treatment of Jurkat T
         cells with either anti-Fas or STS resulted in the time dependent cleavage of both
         NMT1 and NMT2 (Figure 22A). The cleavage of NMT1 began 2 h after the induction
         of cell death, while that of NMT2 was only detectable after 4 h of apoptosis.
   20    [00440]                     The cleavage of NMT1 migrating at an apparent 67 kDa protein
         (predicted M.W. = 56.8 kDa) resulted in an apparent -46 kDa fragment (Fig. 3.1).
                                                                                  -  74   -

         The cleavage of NMT2 migrating as an apparent 65 kDa protein (predicted M.W. =
         56.9) produced an apparent ~55 kDa fragment at early time points, which was
         converted into a shorter fragment migrating at or below ~46 kDa at later time points
         (4 and 8 h). This shorter NMT2 fragment was seen overlapping with a non-specific
    5    protein band. However, it was more visible in the Fas-treated Jurkat cell lysates in
         figures 3.2 (8h) and 3.4 A (4h and 8h). Thus, the cleavages of NMT1 and NMT2
         result primarily and initially in the loss of ~11 kDa and A10kDa fragments,
         respectively. The reason for the discrepancies between the apparent migrations and
         predicted molecular weights of NMTs is not known. The timing of the cleavage of
   10    NMTs paralleled that of the apoptotic marker PARP-1 suggesting it is due to the
         action of caspases
         [00441]         NMT1 is a substrate of caspases-3 or -8, and NMT2 is a substrate of
         caspase-3
         [00442]         In the experiment of Figure 22 Panel B, to investigate whether
   15    caspases are involved in the cleavage of NMTs, we induced anti-Fas mediated
         apoptosis in Jurkat T cells in the presence or absence of well-characterized
         irreversible inhibitors of caspases-3, -8, and -9 along with a general inhibitor of
         caspases and analyzed the cellular contents for both NMTs. Jurkat T cells were treated
         with 10 gM caspase inhibitors for one hour and then treated with anti-Fas (300
   20    ng/mL) and cycloheximide (5 gg/mL) to induce apoptosis. Samples were collected at
         0, 4, and 8 h time points. Cells were lysed and the presence of NMT1, NMT2 and
         PARP-1 was assessed by western blotting using ECL. The blots were then stripped
         and reprobed with antimtubulin (loading control) (Composite gels).
         [00443]         The cleavage of NMT1 was abrogated by the general and caspase-8
   25    specific inhibitors, whereas it was only partially blocked by the caspase-3-specific
         inhibitor (Figure 22B), which suggests that NMT1 is a substrate of caspases-3 or -8.
         In contrast, NMT2 cleavage was noticeably inhibited by all caspase inhibitors used
         (Figure 22B). This suggests that NMT2 is likely a substrate of caspase-3 since the
         inhibition of the initiator caspases-8 or -9, would in turn inhibit the cleavage and
   30    activation of the effector caspase-3. The progression of apoptosis induced by anti-Fas
         was verified by western blotting with anti-PARP-1 antibody Figure 22B). The extent

         [00444]         Example 25
         [00445]         In this example, in Figure 23, it is shown that caspase truncated NMT2
    5    is 3-4 times more active than full length NMT2. NMT activity of purified full length
         and    caspase-cleaved    hexahistidine(His)-NMTs       was  assayed   using   a peptide
         myristoylation assay. N-Myristoyltransferase activity was calculated from the amount
         of radiolabeled myristoylpeptide produced and detected on phosphocellulose paper
         (adapted from King et al.1991, Anal Biochem.). Each NMT assay was performed in
   10    triplicates. Control used is elution 5 from the His-NMTlpurification.             Caspase
         truncated NMT2 is 3-4 times more active than full length NMT2
         [00446]         Example 26
         [00447]         In this example, in Figure 24, it is shown that reduction of NMT2
         levels in BL cells involves the action of histone deacetylases.
   15    [00448]         In the experiments of Figure 24, we sought to assess the possible
         involvement of gene silencing at the NMT2 locus. The acetylation of the a-amino
         group of lysine residues on histones by histone acetylases (HATs) results in the
         reduction    of the   positive   charge  of histones,    which relaxes    the   chromatin
         conformation and allowing transcription machinery to have better access to DNA
   20    (Barneda-Zahonero, B., and M. Parra. 2012. Histone deacetylases and cancer. Mol
         Oncol. 6:579-589.). Therefore, histone acetylation is typically associated with gene
         activation. Conversely, the removal of acetyl groups from histones by histone
         deacetylases    (HDACs)      induces   chromatin     condensation  and   results   in  the
         transcriptional repression or silencing of genes.
   25    [00449]         To test whether the reduction in mRNA NMT2 was due to chromatin
         silencing, we treated "normal"        B cells     (IM9) and malignant BL cells        with
         suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (also named vorinostat), a class I and class
         II histone deacetylase inhibitor, for 24 hours and monitored the levels of NMT1 and
         NMT2 by western blot. In particular, "Normal" B cells (IM9) and malignant BL cells
   30    (Ramos, BL2) treated with 1 gM SAHA (HDAC class I/II inhibitor) for 24 h. Cells
         were then lysed, subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting was performed with
         NMT1, NMT2, p21/WAFI and GAPDH antibodies.

         [00450]         We found that use of SAHA increased NMT2 levels in BL cells where
         NMT2 levels are typically depleted, whereas NMT1 levels remained relatively
         unchanged. p21/WAFI, a protein binds to and inhibits the activity of cyclin dependent
         kinase    1 (CDK1) or CDK2 complexes, was used as a control to verify the
    5    effectiveness of SAHA, which is known to increase the p21/WAFI gene expression in
         cells. All cells treated with SAHA contained increased p21/WAFI levels. While not
         wishing to be bound by theory, these data suggest that a class I or class II HDAC
         silences the NMT2 gene by deacetylating histones and thereby compacting the NMT2
         locus in BL cells.
   10    [00451]          In one example, an HDAC inhibitor is used to treat NTM2 defficient
         cancer.
         [00452]          Example 27
         [00453]          In this example, in Figure 25, it is shown that NMT2 protein levels are
         reduced in various BL cell lines.        Lysates from various lymphocytic cell lines
   15    gathered from local investigators and analyzed for their NMT content.           The results
         demonstrate that NMT2 protein levels were reduced in all the Burkitt lymphoma
         (BL2, Daudi, Ramos and BJAB) cell lines tested when compared to the "normal",
         immortalized lymphoblastic B cell lines, IM9, LO and VDS.
         [00454]          Example 28
   20    [00455]          In this example, in Figure 26, it is shown that proteosomal degradation
         is not the cause of NMT2 depletion in BL cells.          In these experiments, "Normal"
         immortalized B lymphocytes (IM9) and malignant B lymphoma cells [Hodgkin's
         lymphoma (KMH2) and BL (Ramos, BL2)] treated with 10 gM of proteosomal
         inhibitor (MG-132) for 5h. Western blotting was performed on cell lysates to monitor
   25    levels of NMT1, NMT2, Mcl-I, and GAPDH.
         [00456]          To investigate whether NMT2's degradation was increased as a result
         of a destabilizing mutation or the presence of an unknown factor that could destabilize
         NMT2 in cancer cells, we treated normal and malignant lymphocytes with the
         proteosomal degradation inhibitor MG-132 for 5h.           Cell lysates were subjected to
   30    western blotting to analyze the presence of NMT1, NMT2 and myeloid cell leukemia
          1 protein (Mel-1), which was used as a control to check the effectiveness of MG-132
         since it is subject to proteosomal degradation.       The results indicate that the NMT2

         levels did not increase in BL cells upon treatment with MG-132, suggesting a
         destabilizing mutation or destabilizing factor present in malignant lymphocytes
         leading to the degradation of NMT2 is not present. The treatment of cells with MG
          132 lead to increased levels of Mcl-I in all cell types.
    5    [00457]          Example 29
         [00458]          In this Example, in Figure 27, it is shown NMT1 is cleaved by
         caspase-8, but not NMT2. Jurkat T cells (A) and Jurkat T cells expressing a caspase-8
         dominant negative mutant (B) were treated with DMSO or anti-Fas (150 ng/mL) and
         samples were collected at 0, 4 and 8 h time points. Cells were lysed and the presence
   10    of NMT1, PARP-1 and cleaved caspase-8 was assessed by western blotting using
         ECL. * denotes non-specific bands.
         [00459]          The cleavage of NMT1 was investigated in wild-type Jurkat T and
         Jurkat T cells expressing a caspase-8 dominant negative mutant (C8DN) (Juo et al.,
          1998). The expression of C8DN in apoptotic Jurkat T cells abrogated the cleavage of
   15    NMT1 when compared to levels seen in the wild-type Jurkat T cells (Figs. 27 A and
         B). A minimal amount of NMT2 cleavage was observed in Jurkat-C8DN cells after 8
         h of apoptosis induction (Fig. 27 B). The cleavage of PARP-1 and caspase-8 was also
         inhibited in the Jurkat T-C8DN cells.
         [00460]          Example 30
   20    [00461]          In this Example, in Figure 28, both NMT1 and NMT2 were cleaved by
         caspase-3. MCF7 (A) and MCF7 expressing caspase 3 (MCF7/caspase 3) (B) were
         treated with DMSO or STS (2.5 gM) with cycloheximide (5 gg/mL) and samples
         were collected at 0, 4 and 8 h time points. Cells were lysed and the presence of
         NMT2, PARP-1 and cleaved caspase 3 was assessed by western blotting using ECL.
   25    [00462]          It was found that both NMT1 and NMT2 were not cleaved in apoptotic
         MCF-7 cells at the 8 h time point (Fig. 28 A). In contrast, both enzymes were readily
         cleaved in apoptotic MCF-7 cells stably expressing caspase-3 (Kagawa et al., 2001)
         (Fig. 28 B). The cleavage of the known caspase-3/-7 substrate PARP-1 was also
         confirmed in both MCF-7 cell lines when apoptosis was induced (Figs. 27 A and B)
   30    (Walsh et al., 2008). Therefore, both NMTs appear to be substrates of caspase-3.

         NMT2 as identified by Edman degradation are shown in bold font and the positively
         charged lysine (K) box is highlighted on the NMT1 and NMT2 amino acid sequences
    5    (amino acids 1 to 80).
         [00465]          N-terminal sequencing revealed that NMT2 was cleaved at both D-25
         and D-67 sites (Fig. 29). The cleavage sites for both NMT1 and NMT2 were located
         in the N-terminus of the enzymes and not in the C-terminal catalytic domain, which
         suggests that the cleaved enzymes may still be active during apoptosis.
   10    [00466]          Example 32
         [00467]          In this Example, in Figure 30, depicts confirmation of NMT cleavage
         sites by site-directed mutagenesis. HeLa cells transiently expressing the wild-type and
         mutant V5-NMT constructs were incubated with STS (2.5 gM). Cells transfected with
         V5-NMT1       or V5-NMT2      constructs were lysed at 4 h and 5 h time points,
   15    respectively. Western blotting was performed on the samples using V5 and c-tubulin
         (loading control) antibodies.
         [00468]          To validate    the  NMT     cleavage   sites  revealed  by   N-terminal
         sequencing, we constructed N-terminally tagged V5-NMT vectors and used the
         Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to create point mutations at
   20    the NMT cleavage sites. The engineered D72E mutation in V5-NMT1 abrogated the
         caspase-cleavage of V5-NMT1 in appropriately transfected HeLa cells induced to
         undergo apoptosis with STS for 4 h while the WT V5-NMT1 levels were severely
         diminished in these cells (Fig. 30). This confirmed D72 as the caspase-cleavage site in
         NMT1.
   25    [00469]          Because N-terminal sequencing revealed two caspase cleavage sites
         (D25 and D67) for NMT2 (Fig. 30), we mutated both D25 and D67 residues into
         glutamate (E) residues independently [V5-NMT2 (D25E), V5- NMT2 (D67E)] and

         (D25,67E)     double mutant was severely        abrogated in appropriately    transfected
   30    apoptotic HeLa cells while the single mutants [V5-NMT2 (D25E), V5-NMT2
         (D67E)] had varying effects (Fig. 30) and the wild-type V5-NMT2 was mostly
         cleaved after 5 h after apoptosis induction (Fig. 3.8). When comparing the integrity of

         reproducibly slightly less cleaved than V5-NMT2 (D67E) (Fig. 30), suggesting that
         D25 might be the primary cleavage site of NMT2, whereas D67 may be a secondary
         cleavage site.

         [00471]          In this example, in Figure 31, depicts changes to the myristoylation
         profile as cells undergo apoptosis. Jurkat cells were metabolically labelled with 25
         gM alkynylhmyristate after induction of apoptosis with anti-Fas (150 ng/mL) and
         cycloheximide (5 gg/ mL). Protein samples were reacted with azido-biotin using click
   10    chemistry and visualized by western blotting with NeutrAvidinTM-HRP. Prior to the
         assessment of label incorporation by western blotting, membranes were incubated in
         0.1 M Tris-HCl or 0.1 M KOH.
         [00472]          Jurkat T cells were induced to undergo apoptosis using anti-Fas and
         metabolically labeled for 30 min with w-alkynyl-myristic acid prior to havesting cells
   15    at various time points (0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h). Cycloheximide was also added to cells to
         inhibit protein translation as part of the apoptotic stimulus, thereby blocking co
         translational myristoylation during apoptosis. Cellular lysates were reacted with
         azido-biotin using click chemistry and biotinylatedmmyristoylated proteins were
         visualized   by western blot analysis using NeutrAvidinTM-HRP,           as described
   20    previously (Yap et al., 2010).
         [00473]          The myristoylation profile at time 0 h correlated with the co
         translational myristoylation pattern observed previously in non-apoptotic cells (Fig.
         31) (Martin et al., 2008; Yap et al., 2010). The deliberately low exposure shows only
         a few myristoylated proteins in the cell lysates. Treatment of the membranes with
   25    0.iM KOH confirmed that c-alkynyl-myristic acid is incorporated into proteins via
         an alkali resistant amide bond, since the alkali treatment removed the label from only
         a few protein bands.This alkaline treatment hydrolyzes thioester bonds found in
         palmitoylated proteins (Armah and Mensa-Wilmot, 1999; Zhao et al., 2000; Vilas et
         al., 2006). After induction of apoptosis with anti-Fas and cycloheximide for lh, co
   30    translational myristoylation was reduced, presumably         as protein translation  is
         inhibited by cycloheximide. This was followed by a change in the cellular content of
         myristoylated proteins as illustrated by the major differences in electrophoretic

         myristate after induction of apoptosis with anti-Fas (150 ng/mL) and cycloheximide

   10    [00476]         These results shows that although NMTs are cleaved to various extents
         during apoptosis, myristoylation activity appears to remain in cells up to 8 h after
         induction of apoptosis.

   15    transiently   expressing   V5-NMT1     and V5-NMT2       to   undergo  apoptosis   with
         staurosporine and cycloheximide.        NMT activity was assayed using a peptide
         myristoylation assay and western blotting was performed on the sample using
         antibodies against v5 and alpha-tubulin (loading control).

         assayed using a peptide myristoylation assay as described in materials and methods.
         N-Myristoyltransferase activity was calculated from the amount of radiolabeled
         myristoylpeptide produced and detected on phosphocellulose paper (adapted from

         by (*) and show statistical significance (* < p=0.05, ** < p=0.005) when compared to

         [00481]         To assess whether cleaved NMTs were still catalytically active, we
         measured the V5-NMT enzymatic activity of transiently transfected cells expressing
   10    either V5 -NMTs using a filter based-peptide assay (King and Sharma, 1991; Raju and
         Sharma, 1999) during the onset of apoptosis. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with
         V5-NMT1, V5-NMT2 or empty vector were induced to undergo STS/cycloheximide
         mediated apoptosis and used as a source of enzyme. NMT activity was measured at
         different times of apoptosis using [3H]-myristoyl-CoA and myristoylatable- or non
   15    myristoylatable (G->A) truncated Bid decapeptides were used as substrates (King and
         Sharma, 1991; Raju and Sharma, 1999). NMT activity was calculated from the
         amount of radiolabeled peptide that remained bound to the phosphocellulose paper
         and detected by scintillation counting.
         [00482]         Although the transfected COS-7 cells expressed similar levels of
   20    chimeric NMTs (Fig. 32), those expressing V5-NMT1 showed nearly a 5-fold higher
         NMT activity than those expressing V5-NMT2 at t=Oh (Fig. 34). The amount of intact
         V5 -NMTs found in cell lysates decreased over time of apoptosis induction (Fig.33)
         and followed a similar trend as the endogenous NMTs (Fig. 32), although nearly all of
         the over-expressed NMT1 was cleaved after 4h and 8h of apoptosis and all of over
   25    expressed NMT2 after 8h (Fig. 3.33). Although greater than 90% of V5-NMT1 is
         cleaved (Fig. 3.33) at 4h after apoptotic induction, the NMT activity in those cells
         remained relatively unchanged up to 8 h after cell death was initiated. There was a
         slight trend towards the increase (although not significant) in NMT catalytic activity
         at t=2h and 4h, in the lysates of COS-7 cells over-expressing NMT1 when compared
   30    to activity at t=Oh (Fig. 3.35). This suggests that cleaved V5-NMT1 is catalytically
         active during apoptosis when post-translational myristoylation is initiated. However,
         we observed a significant decrease in NMT activity (20%, p<0.05) at 8h after
                                                   -82 -

         [00483]          The NMT activity of cells expressing V5-NMT2 was not significantly
         affected from Oh to 4h, until the caspase cleavage of V5-NMT2 resulted in a
    5    statistically significant (p<0.005) decrease (33% decrease when compared to activity
         to t=Oh) in enzymatic activity after 8 h of apoptosis induction (Fig. 35). Interestingly,
         although the NMT2 levels are drastically reduced due to caspase cleavage during
         apoptosis (Fig. 33), 66% of NMT2 activity still remains after 8h of apoptosis
         induction (Fig. 33), indicating that NMT2 also plays a role in post-translational
   10    myristoylation of proteins during apoptosis

         NMT1 and NMT2 were catalytically active when compared to the control in an in

         induction of apoptosis. After fractionation, protein samples were reacted with azido

         [00493]          The caspase cleavage of many proteins often results in change in
         cellular localization (Enari et al., 1998; Zha et al., 2000; Jakobi, 2004; Vilas et al.,
   30    2006); therefore, to delineate the localization of the cleaved NMTs during apoptosis
         we performed subcellular fractionation experiments (Fig. 39) in normal and apoptotic
         cells. We found that NMT1 was primarily found localized to the ribosomal/membrane

         fraction in untreated HeLa cells (63.9% in pellet) (Fig. 40). There was a discernible
         increase of cleaved caspase-truncated NMT1 in the cytosolic fractions of HeLa cells
         induced to undergo apoptosis with STS or anti-Fas together with cycloheximide (54%
         in cytosol in anti-Fas treated cells and 60% in cytosol in STS treated cells) (Figs. 39
    5    and 40). Conversely, the majority of NMT2 (61.7%) localized to the cytosol prior to
         apoptosis induction (Figs. 39 and 40). However, the larger caspase-cleaved NMT2
         fragment (~55 kDa) mainly localized to the membrane pellet (94.7% in Fas-treated
         and 80% in STS-treated) in apoptotic cells (Figs. 39 and 40). We did not observe the
         presence of the smaller NMT2 cleaved fragment (~46 kDa) during our fractionations,
   10    possibly because cells were induced to undergo apoptosis for a maximum of 5 h.
         [00494]        When cells were metabolically labeled with alkynyl-myristate prior to
         induction of apoptosis or not and subjected to subcellular fractionation, we observed a
         change in the myristoylation profile after the induction of apoptosis as seen in Figure
         31 and found out that the post-translationally myristoylated proteins mainly localized
   15    to membranes (P100) when compared to the cytosol (S100) (Fig. 40). This suggests
         that the addition of a myristoyl moiety to these post-translationally myristoylated
         proteins appear sufficient to provide stable membrane anchoring.

         collected at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h time points. Cells were lysed and samples were
         separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against PARP-1, PAK2,

         [00497]         Cleavage of PARP-1 occurred 2 h sooner in cells treated with 1mM
         HMA and anti-Fas as compared to cells treated with 1mM sodium myristate and anti
         Fas. A similar trend was also seen in cells exposed to HMA/STS but to a lesser extent
         than what was seen with anti-Fas, in the presence of HMA/STS cells which exhibited
   30    more PARP-1 and PAK2 cleavage at 2 h post incubation of apoptosis than cells
         treated with STS and 1mM sodium myristate (Fig. 42). A similar stimulation of the
         cleavage of NMT1 and NMT2 was also observed. This indicates that the inhibition of
