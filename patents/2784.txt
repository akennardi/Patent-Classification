                       CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]    The present application claims priority to United States Provisional Application Serial
No. 62/062,266, filed October 10, 2014, entitled "Syringe Labeling Device" and is a divisional
application of AU 2015330944 which is a national phase entry of PCT/US2015/054624. The
entire disclosures of each application referenced are hereby incorporated by reference.
                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1.        Field of the Disclosure
[0002]    The present disclosure relates generally to a labeling device for a syringe. More
particularly, the present disclosure relates to a labeling device for a syringe that prints a first
label having machine readable information and a second label having human readable
information.
2.        Description of the Related Art
[0003]    Syringes need to include information to help medical professionals identify the contents
of the syringes. Errors such as giving an incorrect medication or an incorrect dose can easily be
made if the contents of the syringe cannot be positively identified from the point of time that a
medication is transferred to a syringe up to the moment of its administration.
[0004]    The results of missed and unintended medication include adverse effects to patients and
significant costs to the healthcare industry. Potential causes for these errors include unclear
syringe contents due to unlabeled or poorly labeled syringes and poor record keeping of which
drugs were administered and the concentration and quantity of the administered drug.
[0005]    Identifying the content of a syringe based on the appearance of that content is
unreliable. Visual identification of the medication is very difficult since several of the
medications are identical or nearly identical in appearance.

[00611     Referring to Figs. 3-8 and 14, the syringe clamp assembly 106 includes a holding
element 110, a drive gear 112, an alignment disc 114, a carrier component 116 having a gear
118, a plurality of gripping components 120, a retaining ring 122, a stability ring 124, and a
syringe positioning and alignment component 126. The syringe clamp assembly 106 securely
holds the syringe 12 within the syringe receiving port 104 while the label print and apply
assembly 108 automatically applies a first label 100 to the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12.
[00621     The holding element 110 provides a gripping surface that allows a user to pick up the
clamp assembly 106 without having to place their hand within the syringe receiving port 104.
In this manner, with the syringe 12 received within the receiving port 104, a user can remove
the syringe 12 and/or clamp assembly 106, if needed, without having to place their hand within
the syringe receiving port 104 and without having to touch the syringe 12. In one embodiment,
the holding element 110 includes a lip portion 130 that extends beyond the periphery of the
other components of the clamp assembly 106. In this manner, a user can grasp the holding
element 110 at the lip portion 130 to remove the syringe 12 and/or clamp assembly 106. In
one embodiment, the outer diameter of the holding element 110 is greater than the outer
diameter of the other components of the clamp assembly 106. The holding element 110
includes a central aperture 132 adapted to receive the syringe 12 therethrough.
[00631     The drive gear 112 interfaces with a motor and is adapted to open and close the
gripping components 120 that are adapted to grip the syringe 12 with the gripping components
120 in the closed position. The motor provides a drive mechanism to rotate the drive gear 112.
                                               10

Additionally, the drive gear 112 is adapted to rotate the syringe 12 during the automatic
application of the first label 100 to the syringe 12. In one embodiment, the drive gear 112
includes teeth 134, a first cam slot 136 adapted to receive a first cam post 138, a second cam
slot 140 adapted to receive a second cam post 142, a third cam slot 144 adapted to receive a
third cam post 146, and a central aperture 148 adapted to receive the syringe 12 therethrough.
[00641     The alignment disc 114 is adapted to properly align and maintain the position of the
components of the clamp assembly 106. In one embodiment, the alignment disc 114 includes
a superior surface 150, an opposing inferior surface 152, a plurality of retaining posts 154
extending from the inferior surface 152, a bearing 156 disposed on each of the retaining posts
154, and a central aperture 158 adapted to receive the syringe 12 therethrough.          In one
embodiment, the alignment disc 114 includes three retaining posts 154 each having a bearing
156 thereon.
[00651     The alignment disc 114 is adapted to allow the components of the clamp assembly
106 to rotate independently of each other so that the gripping components 120 can be opened
and closed to grip the syringe 12 with the gripping components 120 in the closed position.
Once the gripping components 120 are moved to the closed position to grip the syringe 12, the
components of the clamp assembly 106 are then capable of rotating together to rotate the
syringe 12 during the automatic application of the first label 100 to the syringe 12. In one
embodiment, the syringe 12 is rotated during the automatic application of the first label 100 to
the syringe 12 while the first label 100 remains in a stationary position.
[00661     The carrier component 116 includes a gear 118 extending around the periphery of the
carrier component 116, protruding walls 170 each defining a rod aperture 172, and a central
aperture 174 adapted to receive the syringe 12 therethrough. The carrier component 116
provides a carrier that the other components of the clamp assembly 106 can be secured to. In
one embodiment, the carrier component 116 is formed of steel, although other materials of
similar strength may be used. The components of the clamp assembly 106 can be secured to
the carrier component 116 using methods known in the art. In one embodiment, any suitable
fastener can be used to secure the components of the clamp assembly 106 to the carrier
component 116 such as a bolt or a threaded fastener. The carrier component 116 includes
protruding walls 170 that define rod apertures 172 therethrough. The protruding walls 170
extend from the carrier component 116 inward to the central aperture 174. In one embodiment,
the carrier component 116 includes three protruding walls 170 each defining a rod aperture
172. The carrier component 116 also includes the central aperture 174 adapted to receive the
syringe 12 therethrough.
                                               11

[00671     The gripping components 120 are movable between an open position (Fig. 4) and a
closed position (Figs. 5 and 8). With the gripping components 120 in the closed position, the
gripping components 120 contact and grip the syringe 12 to secure the syringe 12 within the
syringe receiving port 104 of the first labeling subsystem 16 of the labeling device 10 as shown
in Fig. 8. Additionally, as the gripping components 120 move to the closed position to contact
and grip the syringe 12, the gripping components 120 also center the syringe 12 to the proper
orientation within the clamp assembly 106 for the automatic application of the first label 100
to the syringe 12. In one embodiment, the gripping component 120 includes a first jaw 160, a
second jaw 162, and a third jaw 164 that each include a gripping surface 166, a cam post
receiving aperture 168, and a rod receiving aperture 180. In one embodiment, the firstjaw 160,
the second jaw 162, and the third jaw 164 each include a grip element 182 to contact and grip
the syringe 12 to further secure the syringe 12 within the syringe receiving port 104 of the first
labeling subsystem 16 of the labeling device 10 as shown in Fig. 8.
[00681     In one embodiment, the gripping components 120 are adapted to securely hold any
size of syringe 12 within the syringe receiving port 104 while the label print and apply assembly
108 automatically applies a first label 100 to the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12.         In other
embodiments, the gripping components 120 are adapted to securely hold a syringe 12 having
any size from 1 mL to 60 mL within the syringe receiving port 104 while the label print and
apply assembly 108 automatically applies a first label 100 to the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12.
[00691     The retaining ring 122 includes a superior surface 186, an opposing inferior surface
188, a plurality of posts 190 extending from the inferior surface 188 and each defining a rod
receiving aperture 192, and a central aperture 194 adapted to receive the syringe 12
therethrough.
[00701     Referring to Figs. 3-8, the assembly of the syringe clamp assembly 106 of first
labeling subsystem 16 of labeling device 10 will now be described. The gripping components
120 are movable between an open position (Fig. 4) and a closed position (Figs. 5 and 8). The
gripping components 120 are pivotably connected to the carrier component 116 and retaining
ring 122 so that the gripping components 120 are movable between the open position and the
closed position. In one embodiment, connecting rods 196 are used to pivotably connect the
gripping components 120 to the carrier component 116 and retaining ring 122. Referring to
Fig. 3, the respective rod apertures 172 of the carrier component 116 are aligned with the rod
receiving apertures 180 of the respective jaws 160, 162, 164 and the respective rod receiving
apertures 192 of the retaining ring 122. In this manner, connecting rods 196 can be positioned
through the rod apertures 172 of the carrier component 116 and through the rod receiving
                                                12

apertures 180 of the respective jaws 160, 162, 164 and through the respective rod receiving
apertures 192 of the retaining ring 122 to pivotably connect the jaws 160, 162, 164 to the carrier
component 116 and retaining ring 122. In this manner, the jaws 160, 162, 164 are pivotably
connected to the carrier component 116 and retaining ring 122 so that the jaws 160, 162, 164
are movable between the open position and the closed position.
[00711     Movement of the jaws 160, 162, 164 between the open position and the closed
position is controlled by a movable cam connection between the jaws 160, 162, 164 and the
drive gear 112. In one embodiment, the respective cam slots 136, 140, 144 of the drive gear
112 are aligned with the cam post receiving apertures 168 of the respective jaws 160, 162, 164.
In this manner, cam posts 138, 142, 146 can be positioned through the respective cam slots
136, 140, 144 of the drive gear 112 and through the cam post receiving apertures 168 of the
respective jaws 160, 162, 164 to movably connect the jaws 160, 162, 164 to the drive gear 112.
In this manner, the drive gear 112 controls movement of the jaws 160, 162, 164 between the
open position and the closed position.
[00721     In one embodiment, the first cam slot 136, the second cam slot 140, and the third cam
slot 144 are positioned off-center so that rotation of the drive gear 112 with the carrier
component 116 in a stationary position moves the jaws 160, 162, 164 between the open position
and the closed position via the sliding movement of the cam posts 138, 142, 146 within the off
center cam slots 136, 140, 144.
[00731     Referring to Fig. 3, in one embodiment, the first labeling subsystem 16 includes a
stability ring 124 and a syringe positioning and alignment component 126. The stability ring
124 includes bent tabs 197 each defining an aperture 198 and a central aperture 199 adapted to
receive the syringe 12 therethrough. In one embodiment, the stability ring 124 includes three
bent tabs 197. The stability ring 124 is connected to the alignment disc 114. For example, in
one embodiment, the retaining posts 154 of the alignment disc 114 are connected to a respective
bent tab 197 through apertures 198. In one embodiment, the retaining posts 154 are threadingly
connected to the respective bent tabs 197 of the stability ring 124. In this manner, the stability
ring 124 provides stability to the components of the first labeling subsystem 16.
[00741     The syringe alignment component 126 is removably connected to the stability ring
124. The syringe alignment component 126 includes flexible arms 127, a wall 128 that extends
downwardly from the syringe alignment component 126, a luer tip receiving portion 129, an
alignment area 131, and a central aperture 133 adapted to receive the luer tip 42 of the syringe
12 therethrough. In one embodiment, the syringe alignment component 126 is removably
connected to the stability ring 124 via a snap fit engagement. For example, the flexible arms
                                               13

127 can be used to snap fit the syringe alignment component 126 to the stability ring 124. The
flexible arms 127 can be deformed to an open position so that the syringe alignment component
126 can be removed from the stability ring 124. With the syringe 12 positioned within the
syringe receiving port 104, the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12 extends beyond the central aperture
133 to the luer tip receiving portion 129 within the alignment area 131. In this manner, the luer
tip 42 of the syringe 12 is properly positioned within the first labeling subsystem 16 so that an
optical syringe alignment unit 250 (Fig. 12) can determine the precise position of the luer tip
42 of the syringe 12 for automatic application of the first label 100 to the luer tip 42 of the
syringe 12 as discussed below.
[00751     A syringe clamp assembly of the first labeling subsystem 16 may include other
embodiments to securely hold a syringe 12 within the syringe receiving port 104 while the label
print and apply assembly 108 automatically applies a first label 100 to the luer tip 42 of the
syringe 12.
[00761     Referring to Fig. 22, in another embodiment, a syringe clamp assembly 400 includes
an opposing V-shaped clamp assembly. In this embodiment, a syringe 12 is placed between
two spring loaded V-shaped jaws 402. Once the syringe 12 is properly placed within the jaws
402, an electromagnet would activate, locking the jaws 402 in a closed position to securely
hold a syringe 12 within the syringe clamp assembly 400 while the label print and apply
assembly 108 automatically applies a first label 100 to the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12. A
roller would then make contact with the syringe 12, rotating it about its axis. The roller would
be orientated at an angle to the rotation, forcing the syringe 12 to move axially until the luer
tip 42 of the syringe 12 rested against a reference surface. Once the luer tip 42 of the syringe
12 was in position, the label print and apply assembly 108 would automatically apply a first
label 100 to the luer tip 42 of the rotating syringe 12.
[00771     Referring to Fig. 23, in another embodiment, a syringe clamp assembly 410 includes
an oblique roller clamp assembly. In this embodiment, a syringe 12 is placed in a V-shaped
groove 412 of a syringe holding component 414 and a roller 416 rotatably connected to an arm
418 would be lowered until it contacted the syringe 12 and made the syringe 12 rotate about its
axis. In this embodiment, the arm 418 is movably connected to a base portion 420 via a pin
connection 422 at the base portion 420. The roller 416 would be orientated at an angle to the
rotation, forcing the syringe 12 to move axially until the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12 rested
against a reference surface. Simultaneously, the entire mechanism would move in a manner
such that the outer radius of the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12 would be tangent to the tip of the
label application mechanism. Once the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12 was in position, the label
                                                 14

print and apply assembly 108 would automatically apply a first label 100 to the luer tip 42 of
the rotating syringe 12.
[00781     In another embodiment, a syringe clamp assembly of the present disclosure includes
a cap clamp assembly. In this embodiment, the cap clamp assembly utilizes a collet to grab a
syringe cap and pull it against a datum surface for axial registration. The cap clamp assembly
would also rotate the syringe 12 similar to the opposing V-shaped clamp assembly and the
oblique roller clamp assembly for automatic application of a first label 100 to the luer tip 42 of
the rotating syringe 12.
[00791     Referring to Figs. 9-14, the label print and apply assembly 108 includes a first label
print assembly 200 and a label apply assembly 202. The first label print assembly 200 of the
label print and apply assembly 108 is activated during the printing of a first label 100 and the
label apply assembly 202 of the label print and apply assembly 108 is activated during the
automatic application of the first label 100 to a syringe 12. The label print and apply assembly
108 includes the first label print assembly 200, the label apply assembly 202, a sensor
component 210, a print and apply state controller 218, a first printer device 229 having a label
printer head 230, a mounting plate 232, a first motor 234, a second motor 236, a third motor
238, a fourth motor 240, an optical syringe alignment unit 250, and a pinch roller mechanism
260. In one embodiment, the first printer device 229 allows for thermal printing of the first
label 100 for the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12.
[00801     The label print and apply assembly 108 includes a sensor component 210 having a
sensor arm 212 that is used as a photo interrupter and a cam element 214.             The sensor
component 210 is rotatable between a first position and a second position. In one embodiment,
the sensor component 210 interfaces with a motor. The motor provides a drive mechanism to
rotate the sensor component 210 between the first position and the second position. In one
embodiment, with the sensor component 210 rotated to the second position, the sensor arm 212
breaks an optical beam. In this manner, the position of the sensor component 210 is determined
and the label print and apply assembly 108 can be activated in accordance with the position of
the sensor component 210. In one embodiment, rotation of the sensor component 210 moves
the cam element 214 between a first position and a second position.
[00811     The label print and apply assembly 108 includes a print and apply state controller
218 that activates the first label print assembly 200 to print a first label 100 and activates the
label apply assembly 202 to automatically apply the first label 100 to a syringe 12. In one
embodiment, the print and apply state controller 218 includes a first flipper arm 220 and a
second flipper arm 222 which are spring loaded. In one embodiment, the first flipper arm 220
                                                 15

and the second flipper arm 222 are spring loaded by spring 224. The first flipper arm 220 and
the second flipper arm 222 are movable between a first position, in which the first label print
assembly 200 is activated to print a first label 100, and a second position, in which the label
apply assembly 202 is activated to automatically apply the first label 100 to a syringe 12. In
one embodiment, the first flipper arm 220 and the second flipper arm 222 interface with the
cam element 214. Thus, rotation of the cam element 214 between a first position and a second
position moves the first flipper arm 220 and the second flipper arm 222 between the first
position and the second position.
[00821     The first flipper arm 220 and the second flipper arm 222 control pressure rollers on
the label path that allow the first label 100 to be printed via the first label print assembly 200
or applied via the label apply assembly 202. For example, in one embodiment, with the first
flipper arm 220 and the second flipper arm 222 in a first position, the flipper arms 220, 222
control a first pressure roller to force a cartridge, spool, or reel containing a label up against a
label printer head 230 and feeds the label through the label printer head 230 for the printing of
machine readable information on a first label 100. Referring to Fig. 13, in one embodiment,
label material 109 for the printing of machine readable information 102 thereon to create first
labels 100 may be contained in a cartridge 107 that allows for simple loading.               In one
embodiment, the cartridge 107 includes a removal device adapted to automatically remove the
backing material of the first label 100. In one embodiment, the removal device comprises a
knife edge portion to contact and remove the backing material of the first label 100.
[00831     After printing, the first flipper arm 220 and the second flipper arm 222 can be rotated
to a second position so that the first pressure roller is disconnected from the label path and a
second pressure roller clamps down and feeds the first label 100 containing machine readable
information forward for the peeling off of the first label 100 from a backing material for the
automatic application of the first label 100 to a syringe 12.
[00841     The label print and apply assembly 108 includes a mounting plate 232 for controlling
the position and securing the components of the label print and apply assembly 108. In one
embodiment, the components of the label print and apply assembly 108 can be secured to the
mounting plate 232 using fasteners and methods known in the art.
[00851     The label print and apply assembly 108 includes a first motor 234, a second motor
236, a third motor 238, and a fourth motor 240 to operate the label print and apply assembly
108. In one embodiment, the first motor 234 and the second motor 236 are stepper motors
which allow for the indexing and controlling of the position of the first label 100 so that the
                                                  16

printing of the machine readable information onto the first label 100 is printed and applied
properly.
[00861     In one embodiment, the third motor 238 and the fourth motor 240 provide tension to
the reel of labels so that the labels are held tightly and do not wrinkle, tangle, and/or crease. In
this manner, the printing of the machine readable information onto the first label 100 is printed
and applied properly to the first label 100.
[00871     Referring to Figs. 12 and 13, the label print and apply assembly 108 includes an
optical syringe alignment unit 250 having a first camera 252, a second camera 254, and a
mounting bracket 256. The optical syringe alignment unit 250 is positioned so that the first
camera 252 and the second camera 254 are positioned adjacent the alignment area 131 of the
syringe positioning and alignment component 126 as shown in Fig. 13. In this manner, with
the syringe 12 positioned within the syringe receiving port 104 and the luer tip 42 of the syringe
12 extending into the alignment area 131 of the syringe positioning and alignment component
126, the first camera 252 and the second camera 254 are able to locate the luer tip 42 of the
syringe 12. For example, the first camera 252 is able to locate the precise position of the syringe
12 and luer tip 42 for automatic application of the first label 100 to the luer tip 42 of the syringe
12. In one embodiment, the second camera 254 is able to inspect the machine readable
information 102 on the first label 100 as the first label 100 is automatically being applied to
the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12. In another embodiment, the second camera 254 is able to
inspect the machine readable information 102 on the first label 100 after the first label 100 is
automatically applied to the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12.
[00881     The mounting bracket 256 is adapted to connect the optical syringe alignment unit
250 so that the first camera 252 and the second camera 254 are positioned adjacent the
alignment area 131 of the syringe positioning and alignment component 126.                    In one
embodiment, the mounting bracket 256 is connectable to an interior wall portion of the housing
14 of the labeling device 10.
[00891     Referring to Figs. 11 and 14, the label print and apply assembly 108 includes a pinch
roller mechanism 260 for exerting a force on the first label 100 as the first label 100 is
automatically being applied to the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12 to ensure that the first label 100
is securely applied to the syringe 12.
[00901     The pinch roller mechanism 260 includes a roller contact portion 262, a pivotable
frame member 264, and a solenoid 266 including an actuation member 268. The solenoid 266
is adapted to move the actuation member 268 forward and backward. The pivotable frame
member 264 is movably connected to the actuation member 268 of the solenoid 266.
                                                  17

Movement of the actuation member 268 of the solenoid 266 forward causes the frame member
264 to pivot such that the roller contact portion 262 can be positioned to contact a portion of
the first label 100 as the first label 100 is automatically being applied to the luer tip 42 of the
syringe 12 to ensure that the first label 100 is securely applied to the syringe 12. In one
embodiment, the frame member 264 includes a receiving aperture 270 and the roller contact
portion 262 includes a rod 272 that is received within the receiving aperture 270 so that the
roller contact portion 262 is rotatably connected to the frame member 264.
[00911     Referring to Figs. 15-21, in one embodiment, a tensioning control device or second
labeling subsystem 18 is adapted to print a second label 300 including human readable
information 302 and includes a first or supply label roll 310, a first label actuator 312, a first
motor 314, a first gear system 316, a first mounting portion 318, a second or windup label roll
320, a second label actuator 322, a second motor 324, a second gear system 326, a second
mounting portion 328, a substrate or movable label portion 330 between the first label roll 310
and the second label roll 320, a removal device 332 adapted to automatically remove a backing
material 304 from the second label 300, an actuator or index control system 334, a mounting
plate 336, a cover 338, and a second printer device 340 having a label printer head 341.
Referring to Figs. 1 and 15, the cover 338 provides for protection of the components of the
second labeling subsystem 18.
[00921     In one embodiment, the second labeling subsystem 18 includes components that
allow the second labeling subsystem 18 to automatically apply a second label 300 to a portion
of the syringe 12. In one embodiment, the second labeling subsystem 18 automatically applies
a second label 300 to a portion of the syringe 12 simultaneously with the first labeling
subsystem 16 automatically applying a first label 100 to a portion of the syringe 12.
[00931     The human readable information 302 may be in full color and conforms to all
applicable standards regarding layout and information contained on a label for a syringe. In
this manner, the labeling device 10 provides a first label 100 having machine readable
information 102 and a second label 300 having human readable information 302 so that a user
and/or a machine can easily obtain the desired information regarding the syringe 12 and the
contents therein. In one embodiment, the second label 300 may be printed using an inkjet
printer so that the human readable information 302 may be in full color.
[00941     Referring to Figs. 15-19, the first label roll 310 and the second label roll 320 provide
label rolls that allow the movable label portion 330 between the first label roll 310 and the
second label roll 320 to be controlled. In one embodiment, the first label roll 310 is rotatably
connected to the first label actuator 312 and the second label roll 320 is rotatably connected to
                                                 18

the second label actuator 322. The first label actuator 312 is drivingly connected to the first
gear system 316 and the first motor 314. The second label actuator 322 is drivingly connected
to the second gear system 326 and the second motor 324. The first label actuator 312, the first
gear system 316, and the first motor 314 are movably secured to the first mounting portion 318.
The first mounting portion 318 is adapted to secure the gears of the first gear system 316 to the
first mounting portion 318 to control the position of the gears of the first gear system 316. In
one embodiment, the first mounting portion 318 is formed of sheet metal.
[00951       The second label actuator 322, the second gear system 326, and the second motor
324 are movably secured to the second mounting portion 328. The second mounting portion
328 is adapted to secure the gears of the second gear system 326 to the second mounting portion
328 to control the position of the gears of the second gear system 326. In one embodiment, the
second mounting portion 328 is formed of sheet metal.
[00961     In one embodiment, the first gear system 316 is adapted to provide an arrangement
that can be used to increase the strength of the first motor 314. For example, the first gear
system 316 is adapted to provide an arrangement that can be used to increase the power, e.g.,
torque, and/or speed of the first motor 314. In one embodiment, the second gear system 326 is
adapted to provide an arrangement that can be used to increase the strength of the second motor
324. For example, the second gear system 326 is adapted to provide an arrangement that can
be used to increase the power, e.g., torque, and/or speed of the second motor 324.
[00971     In one embodiment, the mounting plate 336 is adapted to secure the components of
the second labeling subsystem 18 to the mounting plate 336 to control the position of the
components of the second labeling subsystem 18. In one embodiment, the mounting plate 336
is formed of sheet metal.
[00981     The first motor 314 provides a mechanism to control the torque applied to the first
label roll 310 in a first direction generally along arrow A (Fig. 17) and the second motor 324
provides a mechanism to control the torque applied to the second label roll 320 in a second
direction generally along arrow B (Fig. 17). The second direction is generally opposite the
first direction. In this manner, the first motor 314 and the second motor 324 apply torque to
the respective first label roll 310 and the second label roll 320 in opposing directions, thereby
placing the movable label portion 330 in tension. In one embodiment, the first motor 314
applies an equal torque force to the first label roll 310 as the second motor 324 applies to the
second label roll 320 so that there is no bias in the tensioning force applied to the movable label
portion 330. For example, an equal amount of forward tension and rearward tension is applied
                                                 19

to the movable label portion 330 so that the net tension force applied to the movable label
portion 330 is zero.
[00991     By placing the substrate or movable label portion 330 in tension in the manner
described above, an actuator or index control system 334 is able to incrementally move the
movable label portion 330 back and forth independent of the tension applied to the movable
label portion 330. For example, the index control system 334 is adapted to move the label
portion 330 in a forward direction and a backward direction. The second labeling subsystem
18 allows for precise control of the movement of the movable label portion 330. For example,
the second labeling subsystem 18 allows for independent control of the tension applied to the
movable label portion 330, the position of a given point on the movable label portion 330, and
the speed at which the movable label portion 330 travels. The second labeling subsystem 18
allows for the precise control of the movement of the movable label portion 330 to control the
application of a secondary material to the movable label portion 330, the printing of the human
readable information on the movable label portion 330 to form a second label 300, and the
cutting of the second label 300 from the movable label portion 330 using a cutting mechanism.
The cutting mechanism may include a knife, laser, or water jet printing cutting mechanism.
[001001     In one embodiment, the first motor 314 and the second motor 324 are servomotors
with closed loop feedback to maintain the proper tension applied to the movable label portion
330. In another embodiment, the first motor 314 and the second motor 324 are brushed DC
motors driven by a PWM signal in a torque control mode. In other embodiments, other motors
are used to apply tension to the movable label portion 330. For example, the first motor 314
and the second motor 324 may be servo or stepper motors with a closed or open loop feedback
to maintain the proper tension applied to the movable label portion 330.
[001011     The index control system 334 can include any drive mechanism adapted to move
the movable label portion 330 back and forth. In one embodiment, the index control system
334 is a printing mechanism. In other embodiments, other drive mechanisms may be used. In
some embodiments, a laser cut printing mechanism, a water jet printing mechanism, or a knife
cut printing mechanism may be used.
[001021     After the human readable information 302 is printed onto a second label 300, the
second label 300 is moved towards an exit area 344 for automatic removal of the backing
material 304 of the second label 300. In one embodiment, the second labeling subsystem 18
includes a removal device 332 adapted to automatically remove the backing material 304 of
the second label 300. In one embodiment, the removal device 332 comprises a wall that
contacts the backing material 304 of the second label 300 as the second label 300 is advanced
                                              20

towards the exit area 344 for removal of the second label 300 from the labeling device 10. In
this manner, as the second label 300 advances towards the exit area 344, the removal device
332 contacts the backing material 304 and provides a physical barrier that removes the backing
material 304 from the second label 300 as the second label 300 is able to advance beyond the
removal device 332. The removal device 332 is dimensioned so that the wall of the removal
device 332 contacts the backing material 304 but does not contact the second label 300 so that
the second label 300 advances past the removal device 332 while the removal device 332
automatically removes the backing material 304. In one embodiment, the removal device is a
wall or edge of sheet metal.
[001031     After the second label 300 advances past the removal device 332 and the backing
material 304 is removed, the second label 300 advances past the label slot 76 at the front portion
54 of the housing 14 of the labeling device 10 as shown in Fig. 1. In this manner, a user is then
able to pick up the second label 300 with one hand and apply the second label 300 having
human readable information 302 to the syringe 12 as shown in Fig. 2C. In one embodiment, a
cutting mechanism is adapted to automatically cut a portion of the second label 300 for removal
of the second label 300 from the labeling device 10.
[001041     The user does not have to remove the backing material 304 from the second label
300 because the second labeling subsystem 18 has already automatically removed the backing
material 304. Requiring a user such as a medical practitioner to manually remove the backing
material 304 from the second label 300 can be a difficult and time consuming process,
especially considering the user will be wearing gloves. Also, the user would have to dispose
of the backing material 304 every time a second label 300 was printed. Further, the user would
have to put down the syringe 12 the second label 300 was meant for, potentially causing
confusion if placed near other, similar syringes on a table top or tray.
[001051     Referring to Figs. 1-21, the use of labeling device 10 to print a first label 100 having
machine readable information 102 and a second label 300 having human readable information
302 for a syringe will now be described.
[001061     Referring to Fig. 2A, a needle 44 is attached to syringe barrel 24 and the needle 44
is used to fill the syringe barrel 24 with a medication from a separate container, such as a vial,
prior to use. Once the syringe barrel 24 is filled with a desired medication, the protective cap
46 is attached to the syringe barrel 24 to surround and cover the needle 44 to prevent accidental
needle stick injuries. Next, the syringe barrel 24 and protective cap 46 can be placed within
the syringe receiving port 104 of the first labeling subsystem 16 of labeling device 10. The
syringe 12 is placed within the syringe clamp assembly 106 of the first labeling subsystem 16
                                                21

with the gripping components 120 in the open position (Fig. 4). The top door 66 can be opened
to place the syringe 12 within the labeling device 10 and closed once the syringe 12 is properly
placed within the syringe receiving port 104 of the first labeling subsystem 16 of labeling
device 10.
[001071      Next, the gripping components 120 are moved to the closed position to contact and
grip the syringe 12. As the gripping components 120 are moved to the closed position, the
gripping components 120 also center the syringe 12 to the proper orientation within the clamp
assembly 106 for the automatic application of the first label 100 to the syringe 12. In one
embodiment, the drive gear 112 controls the movement of the gripping components 120
between the open position and the closed position via the movable cam connection between
the drive gear 112 and the gripping components 120, e.g., cam posts 138, 142, 146 connecting
the gripping components 120 and the drive gear at the cam slots 136, 140, 144. In this manner,
the syringe clamp assembly 106 securely holds syringe 12 while the label print and apply
assembly 108 automatically applies a first label 100 to the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12.
Advantageously, the automatic application of the first label 100 to the syringe 12 using labeling
device 10 eliminates the potential for misapplication of the first label 100 or human error.
[001081      Next, the print and apply state controller 218 of the label print and apply assembly
108 activates the first label print assembly 200 to print a first label 100. After printing of the
first label 100, the print and apply state controller 218 activates the label apply assembly 202
to automatically apply the first label 100 to the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12. To facilitate the
automatic application of the first label 100 to the syringe 12, the components of the clamp
assembly 106 rotate together to rotate the syringe 12 during the automatic application of the
first label 100 to the syringe 12. In one embodiment, the syringe 12 is rotated during the
automatic application of the first label 100 to the syringe 12 while the first label 100 remains
in a stationary position. To ensure the first label 100 is securely applied to the syringe 12,
outward movement of the actuation member 268 of the solenoid 266 causes the frame member
264 to pivot such that the roller contact portion 262 can be positioned to contact a portion of
the first label 100 as the first label 100 is automatically being applied to the luer tip 42 of the
syringe 12. In one embodiment, the first label 100 is of a sufficient length so that as the first
label 100 is applied to the luer tip 42 of the syringe 12, the first label 100 wraps around the luer
tip 42 and a portion of the first label 100 overlaps itself. In this manner, the first label 100 is
securely attached to a luer tip 42 that may have a lubricant or other fluid on it.
                                                 22

[001091     As the operation of the printing and automatic application of the first label 100 to
the syringe 12 is occurring, the second labeling subsystem 18 can print the second label 300
including human readable information 302 as described above.
[001101     As described above, the first motor 314 and the second motor 324 apply torque to
the respective first label roll 310 and the second label roll 320 in opposing directions, thereby
placing the movable label portion 330 in tension. By placing the movable label portion 330 in
tension, an index control system 334 is able to incrementally move the movable label portion
330 back and forth independent of the tension applied to the movable label portion 330. The
second labeling subsystem 18 allows for independent control of the tension applied to the
movable label portion 330, the position of a given point on the movable label portion 330, and
the speed at which the movable label portion 330 travels.
[001111     After the human readable information 302 is printed onto a second label 300, the
second label 300 is moved towards the exit area 344 for automatic removal of the backing
material 304 of the second label 300 via the removal device 332.
[001121     After the first label 100 is printed and automatically applied to the luer tip 42 of the
syringe 12, a user is able to remove the syringe 12 from the labeling device 10. Next, the user
can easily remove the second label 300 from the label slot 76 and position the second label 300
on the syringe 12. Advantageously, the user does not have to remove the backing material 304
from the second label 300 as the second labeling subsystem 18 has already automatically
removed the backing material 304.          Next, the syringe 12 may be used to administer a
medication, as is known in the art.
[001131     The labeling device 10 provides for a syringe 12 having a first label 100 including
machine readable information 102 and a second label 300 including human readable
information 302 as shown in Fig. 2C. In this manner, the labeling device 10 provides a first
label 100 having machine readable information 102 and a second label 300 having human
readable information 302 so that a user and/or a machine can easily obtain the desired
information regarding the syringe 12 and the contents therein.            The machine readable
information 102 on the first label 100 may be scanned to determine the contents of the syringe
12 at any time using the same scanner used to scan drug vials.              For example, in one
embodiment, the scanner 20 located on the front portion 54 of the housing 14 of the labeling
device 10 can be used to scan the machine readable information 102 on the first label 100 to
determine the contents of the syringe 12 at any time.
[001141     A syringe 12 having a first label 100 including machine readable information 102
and a second label 300 including human readable information 302 provides encoded syringes
                                                 23

that can be utilized along with the EMR system of a hospital to track drug administration, check
for potential allergies or drug interactions, and/or other important information, all without the
need for human intervention.
[001151     The labeling device 10 is envisioned to be a part of a larger system solution to
combat medication errors.       For example, the labeling device 10 works to eliminate the
following adverse effects that can be caused by medication errors: (1) unclear syringe contents
from unlabeled or poorly labeled syringes; (2) allergic reactions; (3) drug interactions; and (4)
poor record keeping, e.g., which drugs were administered, concentration, and/or quantity of
drug.
[001161     It is envisioned that other potential methods may be used with the labeling device
10 of the present disclosure for linking each syringe to specific information regarding the drugs
contained within the syringe and patient information. For example, the machine readable
information 102 on the first label 100 may comprise any mechanism for transmitting specific
information regarding the drugs contained within the syringe and patient information. In one
embodiment, a radio-frequency identification (RFID) system may be used. Empty syringes
may come preloaded with an RFID or an RFID label would be applied. The labeling device
10 would read the code and add that information to a database, tying the syringe to the drug
and concentration the syringe contains as well as for which patient it was intended. In such a
system, it would also be possible to add information to the unique RFID from a database.
[001171     In one embodiment, a near field communication system may be used. Such a system
would include similar implementation to the RFID system discussed above.
[001181     In one embodiment, a laser marking system may be used. The labeling device 10
may contain a laser capable of marking the syringe directly, or a blank label on the syringe,
with the necessary barcode information. Such a system may or may not require custom
formulation of syringe material to incorporate photosensitive materials for use with the laser.
[001191     While this disclosure has been described as having exemplary designs, the present
disclosure can be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure.            This
application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the disclosure
using its general principles. Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from
the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this
disclosure pertains and which fall within the limits of the appended claims.
