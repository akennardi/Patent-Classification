         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         Dimethylacetic acid is mainly used for the raw materials of perfume and perfume
   esters, it is also used as a textile auxiliaries in the form of salts and as a solvent for a
10 variety of chemical reactions. However, most of the existing synthetic methods are
   using hydrolysis of isobutyronitrile, it is complicated and the final yield is not very
   high. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new synthetic method for further
   improving the quality and yield of the product and reducing the byproduct content, it
