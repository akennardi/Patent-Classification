Description of Embodiments
[0031] Vascular access for hemodialysis treatment of kidney failure patients is the lifeline of the
patient. Hemodialysis treatment requires access to a patient's vasculature three times a week.
Vascular access types include arterio-venous fistula (AVF), arterio-venous graft (AVG) and
center venous hemodialysis catheter. The AVF may be beneficial in many instances as it
utilizes autogenous vessels. However, the AVF is not suitable for every patient and creation of
an AVF requires a surgeon and anesthesia. The AVG is a synthetic graft connecting an artery
to a vein. The AVG is normally implanted by a surgeon. However, percutaneous techniques
and devices allow for non-surgeons, such as interventionalists, to implant the AVG, reducing the
invasiveness of the procedure and potentially reducing procedural costs.
[0032] The present disclosure describes access devices and methods for providing a second
entry point to a vessel, the second entry point remote from a first entry point. The access devices
and methods of the present disclosure may be used to create a vascular access for hemodialysis
by percutaneous implantation of a graft. In some embodiments, access devices within the scope
of this disclosure include systems comprising: a vascular catheter having first and second
lumens, the first lumen being adapted to receive a vascular guidewire; a guide tube disposed in
the second lumen, the guide tube having a distal end with a preformed curve; a stylet disposed in
the guide tube, the stylet having a sharp distal tip configured to pierce tissue; a guide tube
actuator operatively connected to the guide tube or vascular catheter, the guide tube actuator
configured to produce relative movement between the guide tube and the vascular catheter; and

                                                   5
a stylet actuator operatively connected to the stylet, the stylet actuator having a stylet
advancement mechanism. Access devices within the scope of this disclosure may provide a
system for accessing an artery and a vein at second sites beyond initial entry sites into the artery
and vein and forming a blood flow lumen through subcutaneous space along between the second
access sites of the artery and vein.
[0033] Embodiments may be understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are
designated by like numerals throughout. It will be readily understood by one of ordinary skill in
the art having the benefit of this disclosure that the components of the embodiments, as
generally described and illustrated in the figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a
wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of
various embodiments, as represented in the figures, is not intended to limit the scope of the
disclosure, but is merely representative of various embodiments. While the various aspects of
the embodiments are presented in drawings, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale
unless specifically indicated.
[0034] In the following disclosure, various features are sometimes grouped together in a single
embodiment, figure, or description thereof, for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. Many
of these features may be used alone and/or in combination with one another. The phrases
"coupled to" and "in communication with" refer to any form of interaction between two or more
entities, including mechanical, electrical, magnetic, electromagnetic, fluid, and thermal
interaction. Two components may be coupled to or in communication with each other even
though they are not in direct contact with each other. For example, two components may be
coupled to or in communication with each other through an intermediate component.
[0035] The directional terms "distal" and "proximal" are given their ordinary meaning in the art.
That is, the distal end of a medical device means the end of the device furthest from the
practitioner during normal use. The proximal end refers to the opposite end, or the end nearest
the practitioner during use. As specifically applied to the access device of the present
disclosure, the proximal end of the access device refers to the end nearest the handle and the
distal end refers to the opposite end, the end nearest the tip of the catheter. Further, if at one or
more points in a procedure a physician changes the orientation of an access device, as used
herein, the term "proximal end" always refers to the handle end of the access device (even if the
distal end is temporarily closer to the physician).

                                                   6
[0036] References to approximations are made throughout this specification, such as by use of
the term "substantially." For each such reference, it is to be understood that, in some
embodiments, the value, feature, or characteristic may be specified without approximation. For
example, where qualifiers such as "about" and "substantially" are used, these terms include
within their scope the qualified words in the absence of their qualifiers. For example, where the
term "substantially perpendicular" is recited with respect to a feature, it is understood that in
further embodiments, the feature can have a precisely perpendicular configuration.
[0037] Figures 1-5C show various embodiments of devices for percutaneously implanting a
graft. For example, the devices disclosed in Figures 1-5C may be used in implanting an artereo
venous graft for hemodialysis. The devices shown in Figures 1-5C and described in the present
disclosure include certain features of those shown in U.S. Patent No. 9,220,874, the disclosure
of which is incorporated herein by reference. As indicated above, Figures 1-5C are not
necessarily drawn to scale.
[0038] Referring to Figure 1, an access device 10 may comprise a vascular access catheter or
first catheter 42, a handle or an actuator 44, a guide tube or cover tube 60, and a stylet 58. The
access catheter 42 may be coupled to and extend from the handle 44. The length and diameter
of the access catheter 42 may depend on a treatment or anatomy for which the access catheter 42
is intended for use. For example the length of the access catheter 42 may be configured to
traverse the distance between a desired entry point into an artery and the location of an occluded
portion of the artery. In some embodiments, the length of the access catheter 42 may range from
20 cm to 150 cm, including from 50 cm to 100 cm. The diameter of the access catheter 42 may
range from 5 Fr to 9 Fr, including from 6 Fr to 8 Fr.
[0039] Referring to Figures 2A-3B, which illustrate a portion of the access device 10
comprising a distal portion of the access catheter 42 in Figures 2A and 2B and an analogous
portion of an alternative embodiment of an access catheter 63 in Figures 3A and 3B. The access
catheters 42 and 63 are shown in cross-section, while the elements disposed within the access
catheters 42 and 63 are not in cross-section for clarity. The access catheter 63 of Figures 3A and
3B is identical to access the catheter 42 of Figures 2A and 2B except that access catheter 63
does not comprise a ramped surface as further detailed below. Accordingly, other elements of
the access device 10 of Figure 1 as shown in Figures 3A and 3B (such as a guidewire 30) retain
the same numerals as the embodiment of Figures 1, 2A and 2B. Disclosure recited in

                                                   7
connection with the access catheter 42 of Figures 2A and 2B may be analogously applied to the
access catheter 63 of Figures 3A and 3B.
[0040] With continued reference to Figures 2A-3B as well as the access device 10 of Figure 1,
the access catheter 42 may comprise a guidewire lumen 46 and a stylet lumen 50. In some
embodiments, the guidewire lumen 46 and the stylet lumen 50 may be configured as a single
lumen. The guidewire lumen 46 may be sized to receive any suitably sized guidewire, such as
0.014 inch, 0.018 inch, 0.035 inch, etc. The guidewire lumen 46 may be configured as a rapid
exchange (RX) guidewire lumen for receiving the guidewire 30. For example, the guidewire
lumen 46 may comprise a port adjacent a proximal portion that is configured to receive the
guidewire 30. In other embodiments, a wall of the guidewire lumen 46 may be slit adjacent the
proximal portion such that the guidewire 30 can be slipped into the guidewire lumen 46 via the
slit. Further, in certain embodiments, the guidewire lumen 46 may extend to a proximal end of
the access catheter 42 and the guidewire 30 may be advanced through a port (not shown) of the
handle 44 into the guidewire lumen 46. Additionally, the guidewire 30 can be introduced into
the guidewire lumen 46 using an introducer kit (not shown).
[0041] The stylet lumen 50 may extend from the handle 44 to an opening 54 adjacent the distal
end of the access catheter 42. In some embodiments, the stylet lumen 50 curves or is ramped at
its distal end to form a camming surface 56 as shown in the embodiment of Figures 2A and 2B.
The camming surface 56 can provide additional structural support and curving guidance to the
guide tube 60 when the guide tube 60 is advanced into an extended position. In some
embodiments the stylet lumen 50 does not have a curved camming surface. For example, the
stylet lumen 50 can be substantially straight adjacent its distal end as illustrated in the
embodiment of Figures 3A and 3B.
[0042] The access catheter 42 comprises a catheter tip 47 at the distal end of the access catheter
42. The catheter tip 47 may be tapered, beveled, or conical, or comprise other shapes or
structures. In some embodiments the catheter tip 47 includes a radiopaque marker configured to
be visible under fluoroscopy. The radiopaque marker can be embedded in the catheter tip 47. In
some embodiments the shape of the radiopaque marker can be selected to facilitate fluoroscopic
identification of the location and orientation of the catheter tip 47. Examples of radiopaque
marker materials include gold, platinum, platinum-iridium, and other biocompatible radiopaque
materials.

                                                  8
[0043] The guide tube 60 may be concentrically disposed within the stylet lumen 50 of the
access catheter 42. The guide tube 60 may be operatively coupled to the handle 44 and extend
from the handle 44 toward the distal end of the access catheter 42. A distal end of the guide
tube 60 may be positioned adjacent the catheter tip 47 prior to actuation of the handle 44 as
illustrated in the configurations of Figures 2B and 3B. In some embodiments, the guide tube 60
may extend beyond the catheter tip 47 following actuation of the handle 44, such as in the
configurations shown in Figures 2A and 3A. In other embodiments, the guide tube 60 may not
extend beyond the catheter tip 47 following actuation of the handle 44, such as embodiments
wherein the stylet 58 extends beyond the catheter tip 47 (as further detailed below) but the guide
tube 60 remains within the stylet lumen 50 after actuation.
[0044] As illustrated in Figures 2A and 3A, in some embodiments, the guide tube 60 comprises
a preformed curve or bend of substantially 90 degrees at the distal end of the guide tube 60. The
range of the angle of the curve or bend may be from 15 degrees to 120 degrees, including 75
degrees to 105 degrees. In some embodiments, the camming surface 56 of the stylet lumen 50
(see the embodiment of Figures 2A and 2B) can promote the curvature of the guide tube 60.
[0045] The guide tube 60 may be formed of any suitable material such as nickel titanium, shape
memory metal, superelastic metal, stainless steel, thermal plastic, etc. The outside diameter of
the guide tube 60 may be configured such that the guide tube 60 can be slidably disposed within
the stylet lumen 50. The inside diameter of the guide tube 60 may be configured such that the
stylet 58 can be slidably disposed within the guide tube 60. For example, the guide tube 60 may
be a nitinol hypotube having an outer diameter of 0.025 inch and an inside diameter greater than
0.0 14 inch such that an 0.0 14 inch diameter stylet can be disposed with the guide tube 60.
[0046] In some embodiments, the stylet 58 may be concentrically disposed within the guide
tube 60. The stylet 58 may be operatively coupled to the handle 44 and extend from the handle
44 toward the distal end of the access catheter 42. A distal end of the stylet 58 may be
positioned adjacent the distal end of the guide tube 60 prior to actuation of the handle 44 as
illustrated in Figures 2B and 3B. In some embodiments, the stylet 58 may extend beyond the
distal end of the guide tube 60 following actuation of the handle 44 as illustrated in Figures 2A
and 3A.

                                                   9
[0047] The stylet 58 may comprise a sharp distal point 62 adapted to penetrate tissue and other
material, such as blood vessel walls and occlusions. The sharp distal point 62 may comprise any
suitable design, such as faceted, pencil point, etc. The stylet 58 may be formed of any suitable
material such as nickel titanium, shape memory metal, superelastic metal, stainless steel,
thermal plastic, etc. The outside diameter of the stylet 58 may be configured such that the stylet
58 can be slidably disposed within the guide tube 60. For example, the stylet 58 may be a
nitinol wire having an outer diameter of 0.014 inch.
[0048] Referring to Figures 4A-4C, in some embodiments the handle 44 can comprise a top
portion 45A, a bottom portion 45B, a slide button 51, and a stylet actuator 59. Figure 4A is a
bottom view of the handle 44 with the bottom portion 45B removed to show internal
components and the inside of the top portion 45A. Figure 4B illustrates top view of the handle
44 configured with the guide tube 60 and stylet 58 advanced. Figure 4C illustrates the bottom
portion 45B of the handle 44.
[0049] The top portion 45A and bottom portion 45B can engage to form the handle 44. The
handle 44 may comprise wings 48 on opposing sides of the handle 44. The wings 48 can be
used to apply a distal force to the access catheter 42 from the handle 44 and/or to otherwise
manipulate the device.
[0050] In some embodiments, a proximal end of the access catheter 42 may be operatively
coupled to the slide button 51 via a catheter slide 57. In use, the slide button 51 and catheter
slide 57 may be displaced proximally causing the access catheter 42 to be displaced proximally
such that the distal end of the guide tube 60 extends from the distal end of the access catheter 42
and assumes a curved shape. (As noted above, the guide tube 60 may be shape-set or otherwise
biased to form a curved shape and assume that curved shape when unconstrained by the access
catheter 42.) In other embodiments, a proximal end of the guide tube 60 may be operatively
coupled to the slide button 51. In such embodiments, the slide button 51 may be displaced
distally causing the guide tube 60 to be displaced distally such that the distal end of the guide
tube 60 extends from the distal end of the access catheter 42 and assumes its curved shape as
illustrated in Figure 4B.
[0051] Referring to Figures 5A-5C as well as the components shown in Figure 4, in certain
embodiments, a proximal portion of the stylet 58 may be operatively coupled to the stylet

                                                   10
actuator 59. The stylet actuator 59 may comprise a spring release button 53, a spring loading
mechanism 52, and a spring 55 as illustrated in Figure 4A. The stylet actuator 59 may be
configured to displace the stylet 58 such that the distal end of the stylet 58 is displaced through
vessel wall tissue and into a vessel lumen. In use, the stylet actuator 59 can be loaded by
displacing the spring loading mechanism 52 proximally such that the spring 55 is compressed
and the spring loading mechanism 52 is releasably locked in a proximal position. The slide
button 51 may cover the spring release button 53 when the access device 10 is in a pre-ready
configuration as illustrated in Figure 5A. The slide button 51 may be displaced proximally, as
described previously, such that the spring release button 53 is exposed, such as the configuration
shown in Figure 5B. The spring release button 53 may be positioned either proximal to or distal
to the slide button 51. Displacement of the spring release button 53 causes the spring 55 to
decompress. The spring loading mechanism 52 is displaced distally as the spring 55 is
decompressed. The stylet 58, which is coupled to the spring loading mechanism 52, is displaced
distally such that the distal end of the stylet 58 extends from the distal end of the guide tube 60
as illustrated in Figure 5C.
[0052] The access device 10 may be used to perform a variety of vascular procedures, such as
transjugular vein carotid artery access, retrograde jugular vein access, bypass graft placement,
subintimal angioplasty, hemodialysis graft implantation, etc.
[0053] Figures 6A-6C illustrate an arterio-venous (AV) graft 80. The AV graft 80 may be
configured as a self-expanding, covered stent graft as shown in Figures 6A-6C. The access
device 10 describe previously may be used to percutaneously implant the AV graft 80 using a
method described below. The AV graft 80 may comprise a body 81 and a plurality of anchors
91. The body 81 may be cylindrical in shape and may comprise a frame 87, an internal cover
89, an external cover 88, and a bore 83. The frame 87 may be composed of any suitable
memory material, such as nickel titanium alloy (nitinol). The frame 87 may be formed by any
suitable technique, such as laser cutting, etching, welding, etc. The structure of the frame 87
may be any suitable structure that allows for radial compression of the frame 87, expansion of
the frame 87 upon release of the radial compression, and resistance to radial compression by
surrounding tissue.
[0054] The covers 88, 89 may be formed of any suitable material such that a lumenal surface is
hemocompatable and resistant to thrombus formation. An outer surface may promote tissue

                                                  11
ingrowth such that the AV graft 80 is anchored within surrounding subcutaneous tissue when
implanted. Examples of suitable materials for the covers 88, 89 are expanded
polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), serially deposited PTFE fibers, polyurethane, etc. In some
embodiments, the covers 88, 89 may be composed of the same material. In other embodiments,
the covers 88, 89 may be composed of different materials to facilitate selected functionality with
blood or tissue. In certain, embodiments, the covers 88, 89, may be composed of a combination
of materials. In some embodiments, the AV graft may comprise only one cover.
[0055] The plurality of the anchors 91 are also shown in Figure 6B. The anchors 91 may be
disposed at either a distal end or proximal end of the body 81. In some embodiments, the
anchors 91 are disposed at both the distal and the proximal ends of the body 81. The anchors 91
may comprise at least one strut 84, an apex 85, and a hook 86. The anchors 91 may be coupled
to a ring (not shown) that is coupled to an end of the frame 87 and covered by the internal cover
89 and/or the external cover 88. The covers 88, 89 may be coupled to the ring using any
suitable technique, such as stitching, gluing, welding, etc. In other embodiments, the anchors 91
may be integral to the frame 87 such that the anchors 91 may be formed as the frame 87 is
formed.
[0056] The struts 84 may extend radially outward from the end of the body 81. As shown in
Figure 6B, the anchors 91 have two struts 84 configured with a 90 degree angle between the
struts 84. In other embodiments, the number of the struts 84 may be 1, 3, 4, or any other
suitable number. The struts 84 may merge at the apex 85. The hook 86 may extend along a
longitudinal axis of the body 81 toward an opposite end.
[0057] Figure 6C depicts a cross-sectional view of a portion of the covered stent graft 80 in an
expanded configuration. The AV graft 80 is shown to be coupled to a vessel 90 forming an
anastomosis with the vessel 90. The body 81 of the AV graft 80 is shown to be expanded and
extending through an opening in a wall of the vessel 90 such that a seal around the body 81 by
the vessel wall is formed to restrict leakage of blood from the vessel. An end of the body 81 is
shown to be within the opening such that the bore 83 of the body 81 is in fluid communication
with a lumen of the vessel. The hooks 86 of the anchors 91 are shown to be embedded into the
vessel wall such that the AV graft 80 is secured to the vessel and axial movement of the AV
graft 80 is restricted or prevented.

[0058] One exemplary procedure, illustrated in Figures 7-13B, is a procedure to percutaneously
implant an AV graft to create a vascular access for hemodialysis. The AV graft may be
implanted in any suitable location in the patient's body, such as an upper arm, a lower arm, an
upper leg, etc. Specific examples include an upper arm loop connecting the brachial artery to an
auxiliary vein, a thigh loop graft connecting the femoral artery to the femoral vein, a forearm
loop graft, and other locations. Various locations wherein a stent graft may be used
percutaneously to connect an artery and a vein are within the scope of this disclosure. Figures
7-13B depict the AV graft being implanted in the right upper arm such that the AV graft is
coupled to the brachial artery at one end and the axillary vein at the opposite end. The access
sites for the access devices used in the procedure are a femoral vein and a femoral artery. Other
access sites, such as contralateral brachial artery and basilic vein, are contemplated within the
scope of this application. The exemplary procedure may be performed by an interventionalist in
a intervention suite. General sedation of the patient and use of a local anesthetic may be
administered to the patient for anesthesia.
[0059] Figures 7-13B show arterial and venous vessels of the patient in cross-section with the
elements of the access devices and AV graft implantation elements disposed in various locations
during the procedure. The implements are not shown in cross-section for clarity. The cross
sectional plane for Figures 7-13B is a plane that includes the longitudinal axis of the vessels.
[0060] As shown in Figure 7, a first guidewire 30' is inserted into a femoral artery 22 at an
arterial access site 17 using an insertion technique such as a Seldinger technique or a modified
Seldinger technique with a micropuncture needle and dilator. The access may be performed
under an imaging technique such as fluoroscopy or ultrasound. The guidewire 30' is advanced
through the arterial vasculature, such as a descending aorta 24, an aortic arch 26, a subclavian
artery 28, and a brachial artery 14. A distal end is A distal portion of the guidewire 30' is
positioned within a distal portion of the right brachial artery 14 of a right upper arm 11.
Advancement of the guidewire 30' may be facilitated by use of fluoroscopy or other suitable
imaging technique. Using a similar access technique, a second guidewire 30 is inserted into a
femoral vein 16 at a venous access site 19. The guidewire 30' is advanced through the venous
vasculature, such as an inferior vena cava 18, a superior vena cava 21, a subclavian vein 23, and
an axillary vein 12. A distal portion of the guidewire 30' is positioned in the axillary vein 12 of
the right upper arm 11.

                                                   13
[0061] Figures 8A and 8B illustrate insertion and positioning of the access device 10'. A first
access catheter 42' of the access device 10' is threaded over a proximal end of the guidewire 30'
and advanced over the guidewire 30' through the arterial vasculature until a distal end of the
access catheter 42' is positioned in the brachial artery 14. The access catheter 42' may be
advanced over the guidewire 30' and properly positioned using fluoroscopy or any other suitable
imaging technique. The distal end of the access catheter 42' is oriented such that a first guide
tube 60' is directed toward a wall of the brachial artery 14. Manipulation of the guide tube 60'
orientation may be facilitated by rotation of a handle 44' of the access device 10' such that a
slider 51' aligns with the desired orientation of the guide tube 60'. The guide tube 60' is
extended from the distal end of the access catheter 42' by displacing the slider 51' proximally.
The guidewire 30' is removed from the access catheter 42'.
[0062] A second access catheter 42 is positioned in the axillary vein 12 using a similar
technique as described above. The second access catheter 42 is threaded over a proximal end of
a guidewire 30 and advanced over the guidewire 30 through the venous vasculature until a distal
end of the second access catheter 42 is positioned within the axillary vein 12. A second guide
tube 60 is oriented, as described above, such that the second guide tube 60 is directed toward a
wall of the axillary vein 12. The second guide tube 60 is extended from the distal end of the
second access catheter 42 by proximal displacement of a slider 51 of handle 44. The guidewire
30 is removed from the second access catheter 42.
[0063] Figures 9A and 9B depict deployment of the stylets 58, 58' from the guide tubes 60, 60'.
Stylets 58, 58' are deployed by depression of buttons 53, 53' of the access devices 10, 10'
respectively. When deployed, the distal end of the stylet 58' extends from guide tube 60' and
penetrates a wall of the brachial artery 14 forming an arterial exit site 34. Additionally, the
stylet 58' may penetrate and pass through subcutaneous tissue and skin adjacent the brachial
artery 14 such that the distal end of the stylet 58' is disposed outside of the right upper arm 11.
When deployed, the distal end of the stylet 58 penetrates extends from guide tube 60 and passes
through a wall of the axillary vein 12 forming a venous exit site 32. Additionally, the stylet 58
may penetrate and pass through subcutaneous tissue and skin adjacent the axillary vein 12 such
that the distal end of the stylet 58 is disposed outside the right upper arm 11.
[0064] Referring to Figures 1OA and 1OB, the stylet 58' is depicted with the access catheter 42'
removed. The proximal end of the stylet 58' is disposed outside an upper leg 13 of the patient.

                                                   14
The stylet 58' passes through skin and subcutaneous tissue adjacent the femoral artery 22 and
into the femoral artery 22 through the arterial access site 17. The stylet 58' passes through the
arterial vasculature and exits the brachial artery 14 at the arterial exit site 34. The stylet 58' may
pass through subcutaneous tissue and skin adjacent the brachial artery 14 such that the distal end
of the stylet 58' is disposed outside right upper arm 11.
[0065] With continued reference to Figures 10A and 1OB, the stylet 58 is illustrated with the
access catheter 42 removed. The proximal end of the stylet 58 is disposed outside the upper leg
13 of the patient. The stylet 58 passes through skin and subcutaneous tissue adjacent the
femoral vein 16 and into the femoral vein 16 through the venous access site 19. The stylet 58
passes through the venous vasculature and exits the axillary vein 12 at the venous exit site 32
and passes through subcutaneous tissue and skin adjacent to the axillary vein 12 such that the
distal end of stylet 58 is disposed outside right upper arm 11.
[0066] Figures 11 A and 11 B depict the stylets 58, 58' as illustrated in Figures IA and 10B.
Figures 11 A and 11 B show a subcutaneous tunnel 38 formed in the right upper arm 11. The
tunnel 38 extends from the venous exit site 32 in the axillary vein 12 to the arterial exit site 34 in
the brachial artery 14. The tunnel 38 is configured such that a middle portion of the tunnel 38 is
more superficial than end portions of the tunnel 38 to facilitate access of the AV graft during
hemodialysis treatments as will be described below. The tunnel 38 can be formed by making a
small incision adjacent the venous exit site 32. A straight or curved subcutaneous tunneling
device (not shown) is inserted through the incision into the subcutaneous tissue and directed
toward the arterial exit site 34. The tunneling device is forced through the subcutaneous tissue
until a tunnel 38 is formed from the venous exit site 32 to the arterial exit site 34. The tunneling
device is removed from the subcutaneous tissue. In some embodiments, the incision is made at
the arterial exit site 34 and the tunneling device is directed toward the venous exit site 32.
[0067] Figures 12A and 12B show a configuration of the stylet 58' following passage of a guide
catheter (not shown) over the stylet 58 and through the tunnel 38 such that a distal end of the
guide catheter is disposed adjacent the arterial exit site 34. The stylet 58' is partially retracted
such that the distal end of the stylet 58' can be directed into a lumen of the guide catheter. The
stylet 58 is retracted and removed from the guide catheter. The stylet 58' is advanced through
the guide catheter until the distal end of the stylet 58' exits a proximal end of the guide catheter.
The guide catheter is removed from the stylet 58'. As shown in Figures 12A and 12B, the stylet

                                                  15
58' is depicted to enter the femoral artery 22 at the arterial access site 17, pass through the
arterial vasculature to the brachial artery 14, and exit the brachial artery 14 at the arterial exit
site 34. The stylet 58' continues to pass through the tunnel 38, enter the axillary vein 12 at the
venous exit site 32, pass through the venous vasculature into the femoral vein 16, and exit the
femoral vein 16 at the venous access site 19. As shown in Figures 12A and 12B, the stylet 58'
is configured to form a loop comprising an arterial leg 36 through the arterial vasculature, a
tunnel leg 37 through the tunnel 38, and a venous leg 39 through the venous vasculature.
[0068] Figures 13A and 13B depict implantation of the AV graft 80. The stylet 58' is shown as
depicted in Figures 12A and 12B. A graft delivery catheter 41, configured with the AV graft 80
at a distal end portion, is threaded over an end of the stylet 58' extending from the femoral vein
16 and over the venous leg 39 and tunnel leg 37 of the stylet 58'. A distal end of the delivery
catheter 41 and a distal end of the AV graft 80 are advanced through the arterial exit site 34 into
the brachial artery 14. A proximal end of the AV graft 80 is disposed through the venous exit
site 32 and within the axillary vein 12. The AV graft 80 is released from the delivery catheter
41 and radially expanded within the tunnel 38. The distal end of the AV graft 80 is displaced
proximally such that the hooks 86 of the anchors 91 penetrate the wall of the brachial artery 14
to form an arterial sutureless anastomosis 43. The proximal end of the AV graft 80 is displaced
distally such that the hooks 86 of the anchors 91 penetrate the wall of the axillary vein 12 to
form a venous sutureless anastomosis 49. The stylet 58' and the delivery catheter 41 are
retracted and removed from the patient. The bore 83 of the AV graft 80 is fluidly coupled to the
brachial artery 14 and the axillary vein 12 such that blood flows from the brachial artery 14
through the AV graft 80 and into the axillary vein 12. Implantation of other types of grafts, such
as balloon expandable grafts, non-stent grafts, tissue engineered grafts, bovine grafts, allografts,
etc., is contemplated within the scope of this application.
[0069] Subsequent to implantation of the AV graft 80, the AV graft 80 can be used to treat the
renal failure patient with hemodialysis. The AV graft 80 can be palpated through the skin of the
patient by a healthcare worker and accessed with hemodialysis needles. The needles can be
fluidly coupled to a hemodialysis set including a filter. The set can be coupled to a dialysis
machine. Blood can be withdrawn from the AV graft 80 through an arterial dialysis needle,
passed through the filter to remove toxins, and returned to the AV graft 80 and the patient.
Hemodialysis treatments may be delivered three to five times a week.
