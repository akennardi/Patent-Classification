                               Onboard-Installation for a Vehicle
             The     present         invention            relates         to    an      onboard          unit       for      a
   traffic         telematics           system.          The      invention        further          relates         to an
 5 onboard system for a vehicle comprising such an onboard unit.
             Onboard units              (OBUs) are used in a large number of differ
   ent      applications              of    traffic           telematics            systems,           whether           for
   electronic           identification of                   a vehicle or             for payment of road,
   access,         area      or    city       tolls,         for     payment        of    parking           fees,       for
10 access         control        (for      example           barrier        systems),             for     electronic
   vehicle         registration              (EVR),         etc.,        etc.    For      this        purpose,          on
   board units are often equipped with a short-range communication
   module,          for      example         in      accordance            with      the       DSRC        (dedicated
   short range communication) standard, so that they can be local
15 ised to the             local      radio coverage range of an                            interrogating ra
   dio      beacon.         Here,       the       communication              module         is      supplied          with
   power together with the                         rest of the            electronics of the onboard
   unit by a battery installed in the onboard unit.
             In    order      to    save      power       and to         achieve        a   long service              life
20 of      the     battery,           onboard           units        or    the       communication                module
   thereof          generally            have        a    power-supplied                 or     power-consuming
   working and communication mode and a power-saving rest mode. By
   addressing the               onboard unit by means                       of an external                communica
   tion      device,         for    example          a   radio beacon            of a      road toll            system,
25 an     access       barrier,          a    control          device       or   the      like,         the     onboard
   unit      can be awakened from its rest mode and shifted temporarily
   into       its     working         or    communication                 mode;      it     then        lapses        back
   into       the    rest       mode     until         the     next      communication.               Commercially
   obtainable           onboard         units         can     currently         achieve          a    battery         ser
30 vice life of up to                   seven years in this way.
             The    object       of     the       invention           is   to   equip        onboard          units        of
   the      aforementioned              type        with      further        functionalities,                  in     par
   ticular         without        impairing             the     battery       service          life       of   the      on
   board unit.

   dio     communication               with a    second        external      communication            device,
   and
             a   non-volatile             memory,      which      can    be    accessed       both     by   the
10 first and the second communication module,
             wherein         each       communication            module      has     a   power-supplied
   communication              mode      and   a  powerless          or   power-saving           rest     mode,
   and
             wherein        the      power     supply        of   the   memory       during       an    access
15 thereto is           effected by the accessing communication module.
             In   accordance            with the      invention         the onboard          unit,     in   ad
   dition to the short-range communication module mentioned in the
   introduction,               is     also    equipped          with    a    further      communication
   module        which      is     designed      for      an    even   shorter       radio      range,      re
20 ferred to here as "near-range                          radio communication".                In the pre
   sent      description,              near-range        radio     communication          is     understood
   to mean communication over a radio range of at most                                          a few cen
   timetres          or    a     few    tens    of    centimetres,           as   is    implemented           in
   particular           by    the NFC        (near     field      communication)          standard.         For
25 distinction,             the      conventional          short-range         communication           module
   of the onboard unit                    will be referred to hereinafter                       as a "far
   range communication module".                         In the present description, such a
   far-range radio communication will be understood to mean commu
   nication         over       a   far    range     of    at most      a   few metres,          a    few tens
30 of metres,           or a few hundred metres, as is                        implemented for exam

              In accordance with the invention the near-range communica
   tion        module         and       the       far-range           communication                module       access         a
   common non-volatile memory, for example a flash memory, wherein
   the      near-range               communication                module,          during        use      thereof,         ef
 5 fects         the      power         supply       of      the      memory,         such       that      there      is     no

   module.           Additional             near-range             functionalities                can thus        be     cre
   ated without                increasing             the      power       demand         of    the     onboard        unit,
   that       is to say without significantly impairing the battery ser
10 vice       life       of the         onboard         unit.        For     example,          configuration             data
   for the onboard unit can thus be input via the near-range radio
   interface,              or     arbitrary           data       can     be     read      out     from the         onboard
   unit,         for      example          logfiles           for     inspection            by     the     user     or     au
   thorities,              without          "waking        up"       the main-           or    far-range         communi
15 cation components of the onboard unit and thus                                                  loading the bat
   tery.
             Here, the power supply to the memory during the memory ac
   cess can be effected in two ways.                                     On the one hand the power can
   be    supplied           directly            by    the      communication module                      accessing the
20 memory           if     the      communication                 module         for      example          has    its      own
   power         supply         (battery)           or     can      be    supplied          with       power     directly
   via      radio          ("passive            transponder"),                 such       as    a     passive       NFC      or
   RFID       tag.       It    is     particularly               favourable           if    the      near-range          com
   munication              module         is      a  passive          NFC     tag,       that      is     to   say     func
25 tions         in    accordance              with      the      NFC     standard          and     can     be   supplied
   with power via radio. NFC requires a close proximity of the ex
   ternal communication device to the onboard unit in order to es
   tablish           communication,                 which         gives       the      user       assurance         of     ad
   dressing            precisely             this       onboard         unit.       Due       to    the     radio      power
30 supply           of   the      NFC      tag,      it     is      ensured        that       the     battery       of     the
   onboard unit is                   in no way used during this process.
             The       second         communication                module        may      optionally          be    a    pas
   sive       RFID       tag,       which         can     be     supplied          with       power       via   radio        in
   order to            save battery power.

         On    the     other      hand,         the     power     supply     to      the memory           during
   access     to     the      memory          can      be     effected       by      an    activation             or
   switching-on of a separate power supply, for example a battery,
   to  the memory. For example, the onboard unit has                                        its     own     or an
 5 external     battery         for power             supply,      and    the respective              communi
   cation    module        accessing            the     memory,       said    communication              module
   being fed by this battery in the communication mode, actuates a
   switch    during       the     memory          access,        said    switch       switching          on    the
   power supply to the memory at least and preferably only for the
10 duration of the memory access.                           This also includes the                   case that
   the   switch       detects           ("feels")           the    memory      access,         for      example
   over the memory            access bus              of the communication                 module,       in     or
   der  to    then      apply      the       power       supply     to    the    memory         in    a   timely
   manner.      These      embodiments                are     favourable        for      those       types        of
15 communication modules                   and memories            in which a power                supply via
   radio would not be              sufficient to supply sufficient power to the
   communication          module          and/or        the     memory     during         the     memory        ac
   cess.
         The     far-range           communication              module      could       in    principle           be
20 of any    type      known      in      the     art     for    onboard      units,        for     example          a
   mobile radio         module        for      a   cellular        mobile      network         (public land
   mobile     network,         PLMN).          The      far-range        communication              module        is
   preferably       a    DSRC     or WAVE           module       or   an   active       RFID       tag,     which
   is  supplied with power by the battery of the onboard unit. Al
25 ternatively, the second communication module could also be                                                 sup
   plied exclusively via radio power, for example in the form of a
   passive RFID tag.
         The    onboard         unit        or    the     memory      is   preferably           designed          to
   prioritise       a memory access                   of the      far-range        communication mod
30 ule  over     a   memory        access          of the       near-range        communication               mod
   ule.   Alternatively              the       far-range          communication            module,         if     in
   the  communication mode, can                        deactivate the first                  communication
   module.     Collisions            in     the     event       of  memory       access        can      be    pre
   vented     by    these       measures:              The     far-range        radio        communication
35 thus   always        enjoys        higher         priority        than    the      near-range            radio

                                                             -    5

   system.
            As      already          mentioned          briefly,          the      memory         preferably          con

   far-range             communication               module.           Here,      the      configuration              data
   may     be      in     particular            one      or     more      of    the      following           elements:
   user       identification,                  vehicle            identification,                tolling         account

   of the onboard unit, cryptographic keys,                                          or timestamps, in par
   ticular concerning vehicle use. If                                    the external near-range com

   electronic purse of the onboard unit can be charged in this way
   or the        onboard           unit      can     thus       be     configured          in     general        for     op

20          Alternatively                  or     additionally,                the      memory          may      contain
   transaction data                    of the traffic telematics system which can be
   written          into      the memory           via the           far-range         communication               module
   and can be read out from the memory via the first communication
   module.          Here,        the     transaction              data     may      be    one       or more       of     the

30 read      out       via     the      near-range           radio       interface,             for     example        into
   an NFC-enabled                  mobile telephone                  or smartphone              belonging          to the
   user or a controller.
            In     a    further         aspect        the      invention         creates          an    onboard        sys
   tem     for       a   vehicle          which       on    the       one    hand      comprises           an    onboard
35 unit      of     the      type       presented          here,        of which         the      memory        contains

                                                        -    6
   an identification of the onboard unit which can be read out via
   the first          communication module, and on the other hand a further
   NFC      tag,      separate        from      the       onboard          unit,       which        contains        an
   identification              of    the    separate            further          NFC    tag      which        can   be
 5 read out via radio.
             The     onboard       system according to                    the     invention          enables the
   control of the vehicle linking of an onboard unit to a vehicle.
   Onboard units of the type mentioned here are generally attached
   releasably to             the vehicle due to                   their autonomous power                       supply
10 and      therefore          the    need       for       an     occasional            battery          exchange,
   which in itself runs the risk of manipulations if a clear asso
   ciation between the                 onboard unit on the                     one hand and vehicle on
   the     other      hand      is   required,          for      example          for   vehicle          registra
   tion or charging purposes.                       Due to the use of a separate further
15 NFC      tag,      which      can   be    read        out      together          with      the      near-range
   communication module of the onboard unit by the external commu
   nication          device,       the   identification                of the       onboard         unit       on the
   one hand read out                in such a way and the                      characterisation of the
   separate tag on the                 other hand can be checked for correct asso
20 ciation.
             It    is   particularly            favourable             if     the    further          NFC     tag   is
   formed as an adhesive label, which, once adhered, can no longer
   be    detached without being destroyed. The                                    separate NFC tag thus
   produces          a permanent vehicle linking between the                                     tag identifi
25 cation         and   vehicle,        whereas           the      associated           identification              of
   the     onboard unit            can be      used for the               corresponding purposes                    in
   the     traffic       telematics         system,           for     example       for toll           or parking
   fee purposes, EVR purposes, access purposes, etc.
             In    accordance         with     a   preferred             variant       the      memory        of   the
30 onboard unit            may      also    contain          the     identification               of the         sepa
   rate further NFC tag, which facilitates                                     the checking of the NFC
   tag identification.
             In    yet   a   further       aspect         the     invention         creates          an external
   near-range          communication             device          for      an     onboard        system        of   the
35 type       presented          here,      which         is     characterised               in     that        it  is

   formed as an NFC reader and is designed to read out the identi
   fication of the                 onboard unit from the onboard unit and to read
   out the identification of the separate further NFC tag from the
   separate further NFC tag and to check against a database of on
 5 board       unit      identifications              and      NFC tag        identifications                associ
   ated with one another, or in that it is                                    formed as an NFC reader
   and is        designed to read out the                        identification of the separate
   further NFC tag from the memory of the onboard unit on the one
   hand      and      from      the     separate        further         NFC     tag     on      the      other    hand
10 and to check              these       against      one another.              The vehicle              linking       of
   an     onboard         unit      attached        (in      fact      releasably)              in     the   vehicle
   can thus be checked using a single device, more specifically by
   jointly          reading        out     the   identification                of    the      permanently             at
   tached NFC tag.
15           In     yet    a    further        aspect       the      invention           lastly          creates       an
   onboard unit of the type presented here, which is                                                characterised
   by     a    third        communication             module         which       is     formed           as   an     NFC
   reader and is designed to read out the                                   identification of a fur
   ther NFC tag, separate from the onboard unit,                                           and to write this
20 identification                into     the   memory,         wherein         the     far-range           communi
   cation module               of     the   onboard        unit      is   formed         as      a   DSRC,     ITS-G5
   or WAVE module and is                     designed to transmit the NFC tag identi
   fication read out in such a way to a second external communica
   tion      device.         The      vehicle      linking          of   the     onboard           unit     can   also
25 be     verified          with       these     embodiments.             The       separate            NFC   tag      is
   preferably           again        formed     for this           purpose       as    an adhesive             label,
   which,        once       adhered,         can    no    longer        be     detached            without       being
   destroyed.
            The first communication module and the third communication
30 module        are     preferably           formed       by     a  common        NFC module             which       can
   be    switched          over between           an operating             mode       as    first        communica
   tion      module        and      an    operating        mode       as   third       communication              mod

            So as not           to    impair this                energy-saving function                       and so as
   not    to     reduce        the     service          life       of the        battery          12,      the   onboard
25 unit       4,     for      near-range             radio         communications                  9,     comprises          a
   separate near-range communication module 16,                                            which, via the ra

   external          communication               device           10,    for      example           a   mobile       tele
   phone       belonging          to    the      user         (arrow       17) .     For    this        purpose,          the
30 communication              device        10     has        a   reader/writer              (transceiver)                18,

   transceiver 18             (arrow 17).
          A   near-range           communication            module        16      of    this       type       can    be
 5 produced       for     example       as    a    passive         NFC     tag,        wherein           "passive"
   means that it           is    supplied with power via a radio                                 communication
   9.   Passive       NFC      tags     can      also      be    considered               as      passive          RFID
   transponders for extremely short radio ranges from a few centi
   metres to a few tens of centimetres.
10        As    soon      as    the    near-range           communication                module          16    is    in
   the   radio power-supplied communication mode,                                      it     can access the
   memory     13    (arrow        19)   and     in     so   doing       can       supply          power       to    the
   memory 13       (arrow 20).          This is         independent of whether or not the
   far-range       communication             module        11     is    in       the     communication               or
15 rest   mode     and in        turn    supplies         power       (14)       to    the memory             13,    or
   whether or not the entire rest of the                               onboard unit 4 is                      in the
   rest   or     operating         mode.     The     content         of the          memory         13    can      thus
   be read and/or written via the near-range radio communication 9
   and    the      passive          communication              module           16,       irrespective               of
20 whether      the     onboard       unit      4   and/or       the      far-range              communication
   module 11       thereof is working or sleeping.
          For example, configuration data of the onboard unit 4 con
   tained     in   the memory          13    can      thus      be   input          from the           communica
   tion    device       10     or   changed,        for      example          a     user       identification
25 can   be    input,       an    axle     number        of    the    vehicle           can       be    set,       etc.
   The near-range communication device 10                               serves here as an "input
   arrangement"          so to       speak     for      the     onboard          unit      4.     To    this       end,
   it needs merely to be held in the                            immediate vicinity of the                           on
   board     unit     4    in     order     to     input       data      into         the      memory         13    via
30 near-range        radio       communications             9,     even       if     the      onboard         unit     4
   or the      communication           module        11    thereof         is      in    the      powerless          or
   power-saving          rest     mode.     The communication                    device         10 may have            a
   physical keypad 21 or virtual keys                            on a touchscreen 22                       for this
   purpose.

           Similarly,             transaction             data      can also be            read out          from the
   memory 13          into the communication device 10 via near-range radio
   communications 9, for example logfiles concerning past location
   uses,       toll       and     parking          fee      transactions,             debit        transactions,
 5 account         balances,           etc.     In    this       sense,        the communication                 device
   10  can       be     used     as     an    "output         arrangement"            so to       speak        for the
   onboard unit 4 and can display data thereof,                                           for example on the
   display 22,            without the need for the onboard unit                                    4 to have its
   own     display          for      this      purpose.           The      aforementioned              transaction
10 data       (logfiles,             protocols)             may      also        describe,          for      example,
   loads carried               by lorries,            that       is to       say any       loaded freight is
   declared          in    the      onboard         unit       4   and,      where       necessary,           is     also
   signed electronically by the onboard unit 4 if this constitutes
   a  trustworthy              environment             by     means       of physical           and      electronic

   mented for example by means of a special write command from the
   near-range            communication              module         16    or     by   addressing            a   special
   memory        region          of     the     memory          13,      which      initiates            subsequent
   processing            by    the     far-range          communication              module       11.      The     proc

   vehicle telematics system 6 is passed.
             The       NFC     transceiver               26    can      also      be     provided          jointly          with

         Fig.        3   shows      a   variant         of    the   embodiment       of    Fig.     2,     in
   which    the       far-range         communication            module     11   can    also    be     sup
   plied with power via radio, more specifically via the far-range
L0 radio    communication             8   (arrow       27) .    The   far-range      radio     communi
   cation 8 can be implemented here for example in accordance with
   the RFID standard, and the far-range communication module 11 is
   then   a     passive        transponder,             for     example     a   passive      RFID      tag.
   This,     if     in    the     power-supplied               communication       mode,      can      also
15 supply power via the                 (symbolic) path 14 to the memory 13 during
   memory access 15.
         The      other       components         illustrated          in   Fig.    3   correspond          to
   the  structure of Fig. 2. As can be seen, the                                separate NFC tag 5
   or the      adhesive        label      24    can     also be      omitted,      as   can   the      bat
20 tery 12 for the far-range communication module 11;                                    further com
   ponents       (not illustrated) of the onboard unit 4 may also use a
   battery 12, where appropriate.
         Fig.       4 shows a variant of the embodiments of Fig. 2 and 3,
   in which the near-range and/or the                            far-range communication mod
25 ule  16,      11    do not      supply power directly                  (for example via their
   own radio power supply) to the memory 13,                               but merely effect the
   switching-on of the power supply or battery 12 to the memory 13
    (or the part of the memory 13 used for this purpose) during the
   memory access 19,              15. For this purpose, a switch is shown at 28
30 which    is     controlled          by    the     communication          module      16   and/or        by
   the communication module 11 and effects the switching-on of the
   battery 12 to the memory 13 at least                            (and preferably also only)
   for the duration of a memory access 19 or 15.
         Of      course,       the      switch       28    is    only    symbolic;      for   example,

   the     communication          mode  by   the      battery         12.    It     is    also      possible
   for the        switch      28  to detect       itself         the memory            access       19   or   15

   access interface of the respective communication module 16,                                               11,
   in    order      to   then    switch    on the        battery        12   to the         memory       13   in
   good time for the memory access 19                          or 15. All of these variants
   of the       power      supply    of the    memory          13    during        the    memory       access
