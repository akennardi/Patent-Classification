         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         Phenidone drugs are mainly used for anti-amoebic dysentery, dysentery drugs,
10 the existing synthesis methods are mostly using the process that o-acetamid anisole
   generated 2,5-diamino anisole sulfate after nitration, reduction and hydrolysis, and
   then reacts with glycerol, concentrated sulfuric acid in the presence of iodine and
   potassium iodide, then 6-methoxy-4,7-diazepine after cyclization, and then gets the
   finished product after further oxidation. This synthesis method requires the use of
15 nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid as reactants, due to the strong oxidation and
   corrosion of concentrated sulfuric acid, it is necessary that the equipmen requires high
   corrosion resistance ability, the production costs also increased, and the synthesis
   method is complicated and the final yield is not very high. Therefore, it is necessary to
   propose a new synthesis method.
