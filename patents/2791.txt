      [0001]     This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10
2017-0002099, filed on January 5, 2017, which is hereby incorporated by reference as if
fully set forth herein.
                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
      [0002]     The present invention relates to a drawer rail and a home appliance
including the same.
Discussion of the Related Art
      [0003]     Generally, a home appliance, such as a refrigerator, a dishwasher, etc.,
includes a drawer, a shelf or a basket in order to accommodate items therein. Such an item
accommodation unit is provided so as to be movable forwards and backwards. For example,
the item accommodation unit of a dishwasher is a basket. A user may draw out the basket
by pulling the same to put or take dishes in or out of the basket. Thereafter, the user may
push the basket into the dishwasher.
      [0004]     The movement of an item accommodation unit in the forward-and-backward
direction may be realized by various structures. For example, a rail groove may be formed
in a cabinet, and a roller, which is configured to move forwards and backwards along the
rail groove, may be mounted to the item accommodation unit.              Accordingly, the item
accommodation unit is capable of moving forwards and backwards along the rail groove.
However, this structure has a shortcoming in that the distance that the item accommodation
unit can move forwards and backwards is relatively short and in that, when the weight of
the item accommodation unit increases, the movement of the item accommodation unit may
not be realized smoothly and stably.
      [0005]     In particular, in the case of a basket of a dishwasher, very heavy dishes are
accommodated in the basket. Therefore, in order to stably move the basket forwards and
backwards, a very firm support structure is needed for the basket.          Further, in order to
minimize the movement path of a user when the user puts heavy dishes in the basket or
removes the same, the basket needs to be drawn as far as possible out of the main body, the
cabinet or the tub of the dishwasher. In particular, dishes accommodated in the basket need
to be arranged at a regular interval. The reason for this is to effectively and evenly wash the
entire area of the dishes. In the case in which the basket is disposed in the tub, it is more
                                                  1)

                                                                       OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
difficult to arrange the dishes in the basket. For this reason, it is desirable to draw the entire
basket out of the tub of the dishwasher.
       [0006]     Therefore, a very firm support structure is required in consideration of a
relatively long movement distance, a relatively distant withdrawal position, and a relatively
heavy weight of the basket and the dishes accommodated therein.
       [0007]     U.S. Patent Publication No. US2010/0108109A1 (hereinafter, referred to as
a "prior art") discloses a drawer rail of a dishwasher.
       [0008]     The disclosed drawer rail includes an outer rail (a first rail), which is
mounted to a tub, and an outer rail (a second rail), to which a basket is mounted. An inner
rail (a third rail) is provided between the above outer rails. The inner rail slides relative to
the outer rails using ball bearings, which are provided in a retainer.
       [0009]     When the basket is withdrawn, the second rail first slides relative to the third
rail. When the second rail, moving relative to the third rail, reaches the end position, the
third rail slides relative to the first rail until it reaches the end position. Therefore, the
process of withdrawing the basket is performed in two stages, making it possible to increase
the withdrawal distance of the basket and to securely support the weight of the basket.
       [0010]     The first rail, the second rail, and the third rail are coupled to one another
from the left to the right in such a way as to be spaced apart from one another. In order to
allow the relative movement among the first rail, the second rail, and the third rail, these
rails are designed to have sufficient gaps therebetween.
       [0011]     For this reason, as the number of times that the basket is pushed in and
drawn out increases or when a very large amount of force is applied to withdraw the basket,
the possibility of the rails becoming separated from one another may also increase. This is
because the gap between the rails may increase when the second rail moves to the end
position from the third rail or when the third rail moves to the end position from the first rail.
That is, when the length from a stopper for limiting the maximum movement of each rail to
the distal end of each rail increases, the gap between the rails in the lateral direction may
increase beyond an allowable range.
       [0012]     Further, the basket is mounted to the second rail and is separated from the
second rail as needed. However, it is not easy to mount or separate the basket to or from the
second rail because the position of the second rail is not fixed.
       [0013]     Furthermore, the drawer rail is mounted to the tub and is separated from the
tub as needed. However, it is not easy to mount or separate the drawer rail to or from the
tub because the drawer rail is mounted inside the tub.

                                                                    OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00

                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
       [0083]   Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to
refer to the same or like parts.
       [0084]   Hereinafter, a drawer rail will be described in brief with reference to FIG. 1.
For convenience of explanation, a home appliance to which the drawer rail according to the
embodiment is mounted will be described as being a dishwasher by way of example.
However, the disclosure is not limited thereto.
       [0085]   The drawer rail 100 may include a first rail 200, a second rail 300, and a
third rail 400.
       [0086]   The first rail 200 may be a fixed rail, which is fixed to a side wall of a
storage chamber, for example, a side wall of a tub of the dishwasher. The second rail 300
may be a movable rail, which is coupled to an item accommodation unit, for example, a
basket of the dishwasher.     That is, the first rail 200 is fixed with respect to the storage
chamber, and the second rail 300 is movable with respect to the storage chamber.
       [0087]   The third rail 400 is provided between the first rail 200 and the second rail
300. The third rail 400 is provided so as to be slidable with respect to the first rail 200 and
the second rail 300.

                                                                     OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
      [0088]     FIG. 1 shows the state in which the basket is maximally introduced into the
tub. In FIG. 1, the left side denotes a front side of the tub, and the right side denotes a rear
side of the tub.
      [0089]     The second rail 300 is provided with a holder, to which a basket 10 (refer to
FIG. 10) is coupled. The holder may include a front holder 600 and a rear holder 700 in
order to stably support the basket. The holder is mounted to the second rail 300, and the
basket is mounted to the holder. Therefore, when the second rail 300 moves, the basket also
moves together therewith.
      [0090]     The drawer rail shown in FIG. 1 may be a left drawer rail. Each of the left
drawer rail and the right drawer rail is provided at a corresponding one of the left side and
the right side of the basket so as to stably support the basket and allow the basket to move
forwards and backwards. It is desirable for the left drawer rail and the right drawer rail to
be formed so as to be symmetrical with each other.
      [0091]     The rear holder 700 may be provided at the rear end of the second rail 300.
The rear holder 700 serves to prevent the rear end of the second rail 300 from being
exposed outside.
      [0092]     The second rail 300 is provided at the front end thereof with a cap 800.
When the drawer rail is maximally extended, the front end of the second rail 300 is located
at the foremost position. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent exposure of the front end of
the second rail 300, because it is very sharp. The cap 800 may prevent direct exposure of
the front end of the second rail 300, thereby ensuring safety.
      [0093]     The drawer rail 100 further includes a retainer 500 (refer to FIG. 4). The
retainer 500 serves to facilitate sliding movement between the first rail 200 and the third rail
400. The retainer 500 also serves to facilitate sliding movement between the second rail
300 and the third rail 400.
      [0094]     The retainer 500 includes a left retainer 500a (refer to FIG. 6) and a right
retainer 500b. The left retainer 500a is accommodated in a left third rail 400a (refer to FIG.
6), and the right retainer 500b is accommodated in a right third rail 400b. Specifically, the
left retainer 500a is disposed between the first rail 200 and the left third rail 400a, and the
right retainer 500b is disposed between the second rail 300 and the right third rail 400b.
The third rail 400 forms a unitary rail body through the engagement of the left retainer and
the right retainer, which are formed symmetrically with each other.
      [0095]     Hereinafter, the configuration of the respective components that constitute
the drawer rail 100 will be described in detail.
                                                I1I

                                                                      OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
       [0096]    The first rail 200 and the second rail 300 will now be described with
reference to FIGs. 2 and 3.
       [0097]    Each of the left drawer rail and the right drawer rail, which constitute the
drawer rail 100, is provided at a corresponding one of the left side and the right side of the
basket. Therefore, if the components constituting the left drawer rail and the components
constituting the right drawer rail are different from each other, the number of parts that are
manufactured and maintained increases, and accordingly, manufacturing costs increase.
       [0098]    It is desirable for the first rail 200 and the second rail 300 to have the same
shape and the same size as each other. The reason for this is to reduce the processes of
manufacturing and maintaining the components and consequently to reduce manufacturing
costs.
       [0099]    The first rail 200 and the second rail 300 may have a plurality of perforated
portions 211 and 311 formed therein. The respective perforated portions have specific
functions and purposes in accordance with the shapes and the locations thereof.
     [00100]     The first rail 200 and the second rail 300 may be formed of stainless steel in
order to ensure rigidity and durability. The first rail 200 and the second rail 300 may
include vertical surfaces 210 and 310 and bent surfaces 220 and 320, which are bent
laterally from the upper ends and the lower ends of the vertical surfaces. The bent surfaces
may be oriented toward the third rail 400.
     [00101]     In other words, the first rail 200 and the second rail 300 are manufactured in
a manner such that the bent surfaces are formed by bending the upper ends and the lower
ends of the long plates and such that the perforated portions are formed in the vertical
surfaces.
     [00102]     As described above, it is desirable for the first rail 200 and the second rail
300 to have the same size and the same shape as each other. In addition, it is desirable for
the perforated portions formed in the first rail 200 and the perforated portions formed in the
second rail 300 to have the same position and the same shape as each other. That is, it is
desirable for the first rail 200 and the second rail 300 to be the same as each other when the
perforated portions are completely formed. However, the first rail 200 and the second rail
300 differ from each other with respect to the positions of the stopper flanges 216 and 316.
     [00103]     The perforated portions may include bending-perforated portions 213 for
forming the stopper flanges.        The bending-perforated portions 213 may be perforated
portions having a channel shape.        The stopper flanges 216 and 316 may be formed by
bending the portions of the vertical surfaces 210 and 310 in which the perforated portions
                                                   11)

                                                                      OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
are not formed. The stopper flanges constitute a first stopper and a second stopper, which
will be described later.
     [00104]      The stopper flanges are bent substantially perpendicular to the vertical
surfaces 210 and 310 and extend toward the third rail 400.
     [00105]      As shown in FIGs. 2 and 3, each of the first rail 200 and the second rail 300
may have two bending-perforated portions 213 formed in each of the left portion and the
right portion thereof. In the first rail 200, the stopper flanges may be formed at the first
bending-perforated portion from the left and the second bending-perforated portion from the
right.    Vertical surfaces 216a, which are formed at the remaining bending-perforated
portions, may not be bent. In the second rail 300, the stopper flanges may be formed at the
second bending-perforated portion from the left and the first bending-perforated portion
from the right.     Vertical surfaces 316a, which are formed at the remaining bending
perforated portions, may not be bent. Therefore, the positions of the stopper flanges in the
first rail and the positions of the stopper flanges in the second rail may have an inversely
symmetrical relationship therebetween.
     [00106]      The bending process for forming the stopper flanges at the first rail 200 and
the bending process for forming the stopper flanges at the second rail 300 may be
performed at the same time. That is, the stopper flanges may be formed in a manner such
that the first rail 200 is introduced into a bending mold in the forward direction and the
second rail 300 is introduced into the same bending mold in the backward direction. The
forward direction and the backward direction may be easily distinguished from each other
by jigs for fixing the first rail and the second rail to the bending mold. Therefore, it is very
convenient to manufacture and maintain the first rail 200 and the second rail 300.
     [00107]      In addition to     the   aforementioned     bending-perforated portions, the
perforated portions 211 and 311 may further include holder-perforated portions 215 and 217
and cap-perforated portions 218. The perforated portions 211 and 311 may further include
bracket-perforated portions 211 and 212. The perforated portions 211 and 311 may further
include washing-perforated portions 214 for preventing foreign substances from adhering to
the rails. The washing-perforated portions may be provided in a plural number and may use
wash water flowing thereinto to remove foreign substances.
     [00108]      As described above, the holders 600 and 700 and the cap 800 are coupled to
the first rail 200. Therefore, the holders and the cap are fixedly inserted into the holder
perforated portions 215 and 217 and the cap-perforated portion 218, which are formed in
the first rail. However, these perforated portions are also formed in the second rail. The

                                                                       OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
holder-perforated portions and the cap perforated portion, which are formed in the second
rail, are not associated with the coupling of the holders and the cap to the rail, but are
dummy perforated portions, which are formed for convenience of manufacturing processes.
     [00109]    The first rail 200 is mounted to the tub via rail brackets. To this end, the
bracket-perforated portions 211 and 212 are formed in the first rail 200. However, these
perforated portions are also formed in the second rail. The bracket-perforated portions,
which are formed in the second rail, are not associated with the coupling of the rail to the
rail brackets, but are dummy perforated portions, which are formed for convenience of
manufacturing processes.
     [00110]    However, these dummy perforated portions function as the washing
perforated portions so that wash water can smoothly flow into the drawer rail in the
longitudinal direction of the first rail and the second rail. Therefore, it is possible to easily
clean the drawer rail and to prevent foreign substances from being accumulated on the
drawer rail.
     [00111]    Hereinafter, the retainer will be described in detail with reference to FIGs. 4
and 5.
     [00112]    The retainer may be a housing for accommodating balls.               That is, the
retainer may be configured such that ball bearings are mounted in the longitudinal direction
so that the drawer rail, to which a load is applied in the downward direction, can slide
forwards and backwards.
     [00113]    To this end, ball accommodation portions 510 are formed at the retainer 500,
and a plurality of ball accommodation holes 520 is formed in the ball accommodation
portions 510 in the longitudinal direction of the retainer 500.         The ball accommodation
portions 510 are disposed at the upper end and the lower end of the retainer 500. The
retainer 500 further includes connecting portions 530 and 540 for connecting the upper ball
accommodation portion and the lower ball accommodation portion to each other.
     [00114]    The ball accommodation holes 520, in which the balls are accommodated,
communicate with the regions above and below the holes. Therefore, the upper regions of
the balls contact the bent surface of the first rail or the second rail, and the lower regions of
the balls contact the bent surface of the third rail. Therefore, the first rail or the second rail
may be slidably supported by the balls provided in the retainer 500.
     [00115]    The connecting portions 530 and 540 may be formed in a rib shape. The
connecting portions 530 and 540 may include end-connecting ribs 530, which are formed at
the left side and the right side of the retainer 500, and middle-connecting ribs 540, which
                                                 I /

                                                                        OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
are formed between the end-connecting ribs 530. Four connecting portions are illustrated in
FIGs. 4 and 5. Among the four connecting portions, the number of middle-connecting ribs
540 is two. It is desirable for the connecting portions to be arranged at regular intervals.
     [00116]      Any one of the middle-connecting ribs 540 may be provided with a stopper
protrusion 545. The stopper protrusion 545 may constitute the first stopper, which serves to
limit the allowable relative sliding distance between the first rail and the third rail.       The
stopper protrusion 545 may also constitute the second stopper, which serves to limit the
allowable relative sliding distance between the second rail and the third rail.
     [00117]      The stopper protrusion 545 is configured to contact the aforementioned
stopper flanges 216. When the stopper protrusion 545 and the stopper flanges 216 come
into contact with each other, relative sliding movement between the first rail and the third
rail is no longer possible. At this time, the combination of the stopper protrusion 545 and
the stopper flanges 216 may be referred to as the first stopper.
     [00118]      In the same manner, when the stopper protrusion 545 and the stopper
flanges 316 come into contact with each other, relative sliding movement between the
second rail and the third rail is no longer possible. At this time, the combination of the
stopper protrusion 545 and the stopper flanges 316 may be referred to as the second stopper.
     [00119]      The retainer 500 does not escape from the first rail. In the same manner, the
retainer 500 does not escape from the third rail. In order to maximize the movable distance
of the first rail with respect to the third rail, the retainer 500 is allowed to move from one
end of the first rail to the opposite end of the first rail. Further, the retainer 500 needs to be
prevented from escaping from the one end or the opposite end of the first rail. To this end,
the first stopper is required.     That is, the first stopper prevents the retainer 500 from
escaping from the first rail and consequently prevents the first rail from moving further with
respect to the third rail. In the same manner, the second stopper prevents the retainer 500
from escaping from the second rail and consequently prevents the second rail from moving
further with respect to the third rail.
     [00120]      The position of the first stopper is very important. The stopper protrusion
545 is not formed at each end of the retainer 500 but is formed at the middle-connecting rib
540, whereby the stopper protrusion 545 may be moved in the inward direction of the
retainer. Due to the position of the stopper protrusion 545 and the positions of the stopper
flanges that correspond to the position of the stopper protrusion 545, it is possible to
effectively prevent the first rail from being separated from the third rail. In addition, it is

                                                                      OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
possible to effectively prevent the second rail from being separated from the third rail. A
description thereof will be made later.
     [00121]     FIG. 6 illustrates the cross-section of the drawer rail 100.
     [00122]    As shown in FIG. 6, the third rail 400 includes the left rail 400a and the right
rail 400b, which are formed symmetrically to each other.          The left rail 400a is slidably
coupled to the first rail 200 through the left retainer 500a, and the right rail 400b is slidably
coupled to the second rail 300 through the right retainer 500b.
     [00123]     The movement of the first rail 200 is limited by contact between the stopper
flanges 216 thereof and the stopper protrusion 545 of the left retainer 500a. The movement
of the second rail 300 is limited by contact between the stopper flanges 316 thereof and the
stopper protrusion 545 of the right retainer 500b.
     [00124]     The first stopper or the second stopper, which includes the stopper
protrusion and the stopper flanges, is formed at the middle of the retainer in the vertical
direction.   Therefore, the stopper flanges are capable of freely passing by the end
connecting ribs of the retainer and are also capable of freely passing by the middle
connecting rib having no stopper protrusion.
     [00125]     The third rail 400 is provided with stoppers 900 for limiting the movement
distance of the retainer 500 in the forward-and-backward direction. The left rail 400a may
be provided with two stoppers 900, and the right rail 400b may be provided with two
stoppers 900. Therefore, the retainer 500 may move only between two stoppers 900. When
the retainer 500 contacts the stoppers 900, further movement of the retainer 500 is
prevented.
     [00126]     The stoppers 900 are provided so as to contact the upper portion and the
lower portion of the retainer 500. That is, the front ends and the rear ends of the upper and
lower ball accommodation portions contact the stoppers 900. Therefore, contact between
the stopper flanges 316 and the stoppers 900 is prevented.
     [00127]     Each of the stoppers 900 includes a coupling portion 910 and a latching
portion 920. The coupling portion 910, which is formed at the middle of the stopper 900 in
the vertical direction, is fixedly inserted into the perforated portion of the third rail. The
latching portion 920 extends from the coupling portion 910 and contacts the front end or the
rear end of the retainer 500.
     [00128]     FIG. 7 illustrates the state in which the drawer rail is maximally extended.
In FIG. 7, the right side denotes a rear side of the tub, and the left side denotes a front side
of the tub. The third rail 400 is in the state of being maximally extended from the first rail

                                                                       OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
200, and the second rail 300 is in the state of being maximally extended from the third rail
400.
     [00129]     Hereinafter, the position of the retainer when the drawer rail is in the state of
being maximally contracted and in the state of being maximally extended will be described
with reference to FIGs. 8 and 9. In the drawings, the right side denotes a front side of the
tub, and the left side denotes a rear side of the tub.
     [00130]     When the drawer rail is maximally contracted, the front end of the left
retainer 500a contacts the stopper 800a, and the stopper protrusion of the left retainer 500a
contacts the stopper flanges of the first rail. Therefore, the backward movement of the left
retainer 500a and the third rail 400 is prevented.
     [00131]     In the same manner, when the drawer rail 100 is maximally contracted, the
rear end of the right retainer 500b contacts the stopper 800b, and the stopper protrusion of
the right retainer 500b contacts the stopper flanges of the second rail 300. Therefore, the
backward movement of the right retainer 500b and the second rail 300 is prevented.
     [00132]     When the drawer rail is maximally contracted, as shown in FIG. 8, the
section in which all of the first rail, the second rail and the third rail overlap one another is
very long. Therefore, the amount of engagement force thereamong is very large in the
vertical and horizontal directions. As a result, although predetermined gaps are present
among the rails, the gaps are prevented from being increased by external force and therefore
the rails are prevented from being separated from one another.
     [00133]     However, as shown in FIG. 9, when the drawer rail is maximally extended,
there is no section in which all of the first rail, the second rail and the third rail overlap one
another.    Only an overlapping section between the first rail and the third rail and an
overlapping section between the second rail and the third rail are present. Further, these
overlapping sections are very short. Therefore, there may occur a problem in which the
sizes of the gaps between the rails are increased by external force and consequently the rails
are separated from one another.
     [00134]     In order to prevent this problem, the first stopper may be disposed at a
position further inward than the distal end of the first rail 200 and the distal end of the left
retainer 500a.
     [00135]     In FIG. 9, if the first stopper is positioned at the distal end of the first rail
200 and the distal end (point B) of the left retainer 500a, deformation of the rails may occur
over a section indicated by the distance D. That is, a section in which the first rail 200 and
the third rail 400 are spaced further apart from each other may become very long. This
                                                 1  -7

                                                                       OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
principle is the same as that of a cantilever in which one end is a fixed end and the opposite
end is a free end. In other words, under the condition in which the amount of load applied
to the cantilever is constant, the longer the cantilever, the larger the displacement of the free
end of the cantilever.
     [00136]     If the first stopper is positioned at the position A in FIG. 9, deformation of
the rails may occur over a section indicated by the distance d. This means a reduction in the
length of a cantilever. That is, it is possible to minimize the displacement by which the first
rail 200 and the third rail 400 are spaced further apart from each other.
     [00137]     This principle may also be applied to the second stopper. It is possible to
minimize the displacement by which the second rail 300 and the third rail 400 are spaced
further apart from each other by adjusting the position of the second stopper.
     [00138]     The adjustment in the positions of the first stopper and the second stopper
may be realized as a change in the direction in which the stopper flanges are bent. If the
stopper flanges are formed at the distal end of the first rail or the distal end of the second
rail, the stopper flanges may be bent inwards of the first rail and the second rail. When the
retainer contacts the stopper flanges, the first rail and the second rail are pushed in the
outward direction thereof. That is, the direction in which the pushing force is applied is
opposite the direction in which the stopper flanges are bent. Therefore, there is a risk that
the function of the stopper may be deteriorated due to continuous usage.
     [00139]     However, if the stopper flanges are formed at a position further inward than
the distal end of the first rail or the distal end of the second rail, it is possible to bend the
stopper flanges in the reverse direction. That is, the stopper flanges may be bent in the
outward direction of the first rail and the second rail. Therefore, the direction in which the
force is applied through the retainer is the same as the direction in which the stopper flanges
are bent. According to the intensity characteristics of the metal bending structure, it is more
effective to support force that is applied in the bending direction than to support force that is
applied in the direction opposite the bending direction.           Therefore, it is possible to
effectively maintain the function of the stopper in spite of continuous usage.
     [00140]     Hereinafter, the engagement/disengagement structure of the drawer rail 100
and the basket 10 will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 10. FIG. 10 illustrates
the state in which the basket 10 is maximally introduced into the tub.
     [00141]     The basket 10 may include at least two support points, which are provided at
a portion of the basket 10, for example, the left side or the right side of the basket 10. The
two support points may be points at which the basket 10 and the drawer rail 100 are

                                                                      OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
engaged with each other. A portion of the basket 10 may be seated on and supported by the
drawer rail 100, specifically, the second rail 300. However, these support points on which
the basket is seated support only the load applied in the downward direction, but do not
withstand force applied in the forward-and-backward direction or in the upward direction.
     [00142]     The support points may include a support point, which is formed by the rear
holder 700 and a first protrusion 11, and a support point, which is formed by the front
holder 600 and a second protrusion 12.
     [00143]     The first protrusion 11 and the second protrusion 12 may protrude from the
basket 10 in the lateral direction, i.e., toward the drawer rail. The first protrusion 11 may be
engaged with the rear holder 700, and the second protrusion 12 may be engaged with the
front holder.
     [00144]     The rear holder 700 may be configured to support the basket 10 in the
forward-and-backward direction and in the upward-and-downward direction. In order to
allow the first protrusion 11 to be inserted into the rear holder 700, the allowable limit on
the support of the first protrusion 11 in the insertion direction may be set to be larger than
the allowable limit on the support of the first protrusion 11 in the direction opposite the
insertion direction. It is desirable for the first protrusion 11 to be inserted into the rear
holder 700 from the rear to the front. That is, it is desirable to insert the first protrusion 11
into the rear holder 700 by pulling the basket 10. Accordingly, the basket 10 may be more
securely supported in the direction in which the basket 10 is withdrawn by the rear holder
700.
     [00145]     The front holder 600 may be configured to support the basket 10 in the
forward-and-backward direction and in the upward-and-downward direction. In order to
allow the second protrusion 12 to be inserted into the front holder 600, the allowable limit
on the support of the second protrusion 12 in the insertion direction may be set to be larger
than the allowable limit on the support of the second protrusion 12 in the direction opposite
the insertion direction. It is desirable for the second protrusion 12 to be inserted into the
front holder 600 from the top to the bottom. That is, it is desirable to insert the second
protrusion 12 into the front holder 600 by lowering the basket 10. Accordingly, the basket
10 may be more securely supported in the forward-and-backward direction by the front
holder 600.
     [00146]     Because the direction in which the first protrusion 11 is engaged with the
rear holder 700 and the direction in which the second protrusion 12 is engaged with the
front holder 600 are different from each other, it is very easy to assemble and disassemble
                                                  ' 10

                                                                     OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
the drawer rail 100 and the basket 10. That is, the first protrusion 11 is engaged with the
rear holder 700 by pulling the basket 10 in the state of placing the rear portion of the basket
10 at a relatively low position and the front portion of the basket 10 at a relatively high
position. Subsequently, the second protrusion 12 is engaged with the front holder 600 by
lowering the front portion of the basket. When the basket 10 is pulled, the drawer rail 100
is maximally withdrawn. Therefore, it is possible to easily assemble the basket 10 with the
drawer rail 100 outside the tub.     The processes of disassembling the basket 10 from the
drawer rail 100 may be performed reversely to the above-described assembly processes.
     [00147]     Hereinafter, the configuration of the rear holder 700 will be described in
detail with reference to FIG. 11.
     [00148]     The rear holder 700 includes a vertical surface 710 and bent surfaces 730,
which are formed at the upper end and the lower end of the vertical surface. The vertical
surface 710 is configured to contact the vertical surface of the second rail 300, and the bent
surfaces 730 are configured to cover the upper bent surface and the lower bent surface of
the second rail 300. Because the rear holder 700 is coupled to the rear end of the second rail
300, the rear holder 700 needs to be prevented from being separated backwards from the
rear end of the second rail 300 or from being moved forwards from the rear end of the
second rail 300.
     [00149]     To this end, the vertical surface 710 may be provided with a protrusion 720.
The protrusion 720 is inserted into the rear-holder-perforated portion 217 formed in the
second rail 300.
     [00150]     The rear holder 700 includes an insertion portion 740, into which the first
protrusion 11 is inserted. The insertion portion 740 may be formed such that the vertical
width thereof gradually decreases in the direction in which the first protrusion 11 is inserted.
The rear holder 700 may further include an upper rib 741 and a lower rib 742, and the
insertion portion 740 may be formed between the upper rib 741 and the lower rib 742.
     [00151]     The first protrusion 11 is interference-fitted into the insertion portion 740.
The insertion portion 740 may be provided with a locking portion 744 for preventing the
first protrusion 11 from being separated from the insertion portion 740.
     [00152]     The lower rib 742 has therein a latching recess 743. The distal end of the
second rail contacts the latching recess 743, whereby the rear holder 700 is prevented from
being moved further forwards along the second rail. In particular, when the basket 10 is
pulled, the latching recess 743 may prevent the rear holder 700 from being moved forwards.
                                                 1)n

                                                                      OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
     [00153]     An additional insertion portion, which has the same configuration as the
aforementioned insertion portion 740, may be formed. At this time, it is desirable for the
two insertion portions to be vertically symmetrical to each other. The reason for this is to
use the rear holder 700 in common for both the left drawer rail and the right drawer rail.
     [00154]     Hereinafter, the configuration of the front holder 600 will be described in
detail with reference to FIG. 12.
     [00155]     The front holder 600 includes a vertical surface 610 and a bent surface 630,
which is formed at the upper end of the vertical surface.          The vertical surface 610 is
configured to contact the vertical surface of the second rail 300, and the bent surface 630 is
configured to cover the upper bent surface of the second rail 300. Because the front holder
600 is coupled to the middle portion of the second rail 300, the front holder 600 needs to be
prevented from being moved forwards and backwards along the second rail 300. To this
end, the vertical surface 610 may be provided with a protrusion 620. The protrusion 620 is
inserted into the front-holder-perforated portion 215 formed in the second rail 300.
     [00156]     The front holder 600 includes an insertion portion 650, into which the
second protrusion 12 is inserted.      The insertion portion 650 may be formed such that a
lateral width thereof gradually decreases in the direction in which the second protrusion 12
is inserted (in the downward direction). The front holder 600 may further include left and
right ribs 653, and the insertion portion 650 may be formed between the left and right ribs
653.
     [00157]     The insertion portion 650 is provided at the lower portion thereof with a
seating portion 652, in which the second protrusion 12 is seated.             When the second
protrusion 12 is inserted into the insertion portion 650, the left and right ribs may be
elastically deformed so as to increase the lateral width thereof. When the second protrusion
12 is inserted into and seated in the seating portion 652, the left and right ribs may be
elastically restored. Therefore, even when the second protrusion 12 moves upwards, the
second protrusion 12 is caught by the left and right ribs and is prevented from being
separated therefrom. When it is intended to forcibly separate the second protrusion 12 from
the insertion portion 650, the distance between the left and right ribs may be increased using
a separate tool.
     [00158]     The front holder 600 may further include reinforcement ribs 640, which are
formed at the left side and the right side of the insertion portion 650 in order to reinforce the
rigidity of the insertion portion 650.
                                                 0I

                                                                      OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
     [00159]     It is desirable for the reinforcement ribs 640 to be horizontally symmetrical
to each other. The reason for this is to use the front holder 600 in common for both the left
drawer rail and the right drawer rail.
     [00160]     The front holder 600 and the rear holder 700 are formed through plastic
injection molding. Therefore, the front holder 600 and the rear holder 700 have their own
specific elastic properties. Therefore, the front holder 600 and the rear holder 700 may be
securely fixed to the second rail due to their specific configurations and the perforated
portions and the configuration of the second rail, which mesh with the configurations of the
holders, without a separate fastening tool.
     [00161]     Hereinafter, the configuration for mounting the drawer rail 100 to the tub
will be described with reference to FIGs. 13 and 14.
     [00162]     FIG. 13 illustrates a rail bracket 20 for mounting the drawer rail 100 to the
tub. The rail bracket 20 is fixed to the side surface of the tub, and the drawer rail 100 is
coupled to the rail bracket 20. Specifically, as shown in FIG. 14, the drawer rail 100 is
coupled to the rail bracket 20 by the coupling of the first rail 200 to the rail bracket 20.
     [00163]     The rail bracket 20 may be fixed to the side surface of the tub in various
ways. However, it is desirable to fix the rail bracket 20 to the side surface of the tub
through welding in order to realize a reliable assembly. To this end, the rail bracket 20 may
be provided with welded portions 51.
     [00164]     The rail bracket 20 includes a body 30. The body 30 may include a contact
portion 50, which is configured to closely contact the side wall of the storage chamber, and
a raised portion 40, which protrudes relative to the contact portion 50 so as to be spaced
apart from the side wall of the storage chamber. The contact portion 50 may be formed at
each of the front side and the rear side of the raised portion 40. The welded portions 51
may be formed at the contact portion 50.
     [00165]     The rail bracket 20 may include openings, which are formed in the front
portion and the rear portion of the body, and bracket hooks 42, each of which is provided at
a respective one of the openings.
     [00166]     The bracket hook 42 may include a latching portion 44, which is provided at
the front end of the opening in order to limit the forward movement of the drawer rail, and a
cover portion 43, which extends backwards from the latching portion 44 in order to limit the
lateral movement of the drawer rail. The cover portion 43 is bent from the latching portion
44, and thus the cover portion 43 may be elastically deformed.
                                                 991

                                                                      OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
      [00167]    The bracket hook 42 may be formed through a hook-perforated portion 41.
That is, the bracket hook 42 may be formed in a manner such that a portion of the raised
portion 40 is bent through the hook-perforated portion 41. Therefore, it is desirable for the
bracket hook 42 to be formed at the raised portion 40.
      [00168]    The raised portion 40 may include a stopper 46, which is provided in front
of the bracket hook 42 in order to limit the backward movement of the drawer rail. The
raised portion 40 may have therein a stopper-perforated portion 45 in order to form the
stopper. The stopper may be formed by bending a portion of the raised portion.
      [00169]    The raised portion 40 may include an upper portion 48 and a lower portion
47. The raised portion 40 may further include a connection portion 49 for connecting the
upper portion 48 and the lower portion 47 to each other in the vertical direction. The hook
perforated portion 41 and the stopper-perforated portion 45 may be spaced laterally apart
from each other, with the connection portion 49 interposed therebetween.
      [00170]    A load may be applied to the bracket hook 42 in the downward direction via
the drawer rail 100. Thus, there may occur a problem in which the upper portion 48 and the
lower portion 47 are deformed. In order to solve this problem, the upper portion 48 and the
lower portion 47 may be provided with beads 49a. The beads may extend in the forward
and-backward direction and may be formed so as to be concave or convex in the lateral
direction. These beads serve to increase the torsion resistance of the rail bracket 20.
      [00171]    The rail bracket 20 may be formed to be vertically and horizontally
symmetrical. Therefore, it is possible to use the rail bracket 20 in common for both the left
drawer rail and the right drawer rail.
      [00172]    FIG. 14 illustrates the state in which the first rail 200, among the
components of the drawer rail 100, is engaged with the rail bracket 20.
      [00173]    The first rail 200 has therein the hook-perforated portions 211 and 212, into
which the bracket hooks 42 are inserted. The size of the hook-perforated portions is larger
than that of the bracket hooks 42 so that the bracket hooks 42 are easily inserted into the
hook-perforated portions.
      [00174]    If the first rail 200 is pulled after the bracket hooks 42 are inserted into the
hook-perforated portions, the cover portion 43 covers the vertical surface 210 of the first
rail.   At this time, the latching portion 44 is caught by ends 211 d, 212d of the hook
perforated portions. Therefore, the first rail is prevented from being pulled further.

                                                                    OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
     [00175]      When the first rail is moved backwards, the opposite ends 211 c and 212c of
the hook-perforated portions are caught by the stoppers 46.        Therefore, the first rail is
prevented from being separated from the rail bracket.
     [00176]      After the first rail is completely engaged with the rail bracket, a certain
degree of relative movement therebetween may be allowed. That is, a certain degree of
movement of the opposite ends of the hook-perforated portions and the stoppers 46 relative
to each other may be allowed. The reason for this is to make it possible to separate the first
rail and the rail bracket from each other as needed.      However, this allowance of relative
movement may result in noise due to collision between the opposite ends of the hook
perforated portions and the stoppers when the basket is withdrawn.
     [00177]      In order to solve this problem, configuration may be made such that the
relative movement between the opposite end of any one of the hook-perforated portions and
the corresponding stopper is allowed and such that the opposite end of the other one of the
hook-perforated portions and the corresponding stopper are maintained in contact with each
other. The contact between the opposite end of the hook-perforated portion and the stopper
prevents movement of the first rail, and consequently reduces the occurrence of noise.
Therefore, any one of the hook-perforated portions is formed to be larger than the other one
of the hook-perforated portions.
     [00178]      In order to release the contact between the stopper and the opposite end of
the hook-perforated portion, the first rail needs to be moved in the direction away from the
side wall of the storage chamber. This movement is realized by a user who applies force for
separating the components.       Therefore, for user's convenience, this moving operation is
performed in front of the first rail. Out of the hook-perforated portions, the front hook
perforated portion may be provided at the opposite end thereof with a stepped portion 212e
in order to receive the user's force. Due to the stepped portion, a portion of the hook
perforated portion is in contact with the stopper, and a remaining portion of the hook
perforated portion is spaced apart from the stopper. The first rail may be moved laterally by
inserting a tool into the space between the hook-perforated portion and the stopper. In this
state, if the first rail is moved backwards, the bracket hook may be separated from the rear
hook-perforated portion.
     [00179]      In order to be separated from the stopper, the rear hook-perforated portion
needs to be moved laterally. Therefore, in order to ensure this movement distance, it is
desirable for the opposite end of the rear hook-perforated portion to be provided so as to be
spaced apart from the stopper.
                                                 1)A

                                                                      OPP-AZ-2017-0103-US-00
     [00180]     In conclusion, it is desirable for the rear hook-perforated portion to have a
larger size than the front hook-perforated portion.
     [00181]     Each of the hook-perforated portions includes a front inclined portion 212a
and a rear horizontal portion 212b.       The inclined portion may be formed such that the
vertical width thereof gradually decreases toward the rear end thereof, and the horizontal
portion may be formed such that the vertical width thereof is constant.         Therefore, the
bracket hook easily slides along the inclined portion of the hook-perforated portion and
subsequently moves to the horizontal portion.
     [00182]     As is apparent from the above description, the present invention provides a
drawer rail, which has improved reliability by preventing the separation of sub-rails
constituting the drawer rail, and a home appliance including the same.
     [00183]     In addition, the present invention provides a drawer rail, which is capable of
being easily engaged with or disengaged from an item accommodation unit, and a home
appliance including the same.
     [00184]     In addition, the present invention provides a drawer rail, which is capable of
being easily engaged with or disengaged from a home appliance, and a home appliance
including the same.
     [00185]     In addition, the present invention provides a drawer rail, which is capable of
being more securely fixed to a home appliance, and a home appliance including the same.
     [00186]     In addition, the present invention provides a drawer rail, which is capable of
preventing noise from occurring between the drawer rail and a home appliance, and a home
appliance including the same. In particular, the present invention provides a drawer rail and
a home appliance that is capable of preventing noise from occurring between a bracket
mounted to the home appliance and the drawer rail.
     [00187]     It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and
variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of
the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and
variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and
their equivalents.
     [00188]     Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the
context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and
