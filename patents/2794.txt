                     The tool comprises an inner combustion engine (2), in
                     a housing (1), for propelling a piston for driving a
                     fastening member, a casing (11) for receiving a fuel
                     cell as a source of energy of the engine, a handle (8)
                     for handling the tool, with a trigger (9) for actuating the
                     tool and a casing for receiving a battery as the
                     electrical supply source of the tool, the handle (8)
                     being connected to the housing (1) of the engine, and
                     extending substantially perpendicular to an axis (5) of
                     the housing. On the side opposed to the housing (1)
                     of the engine, the handle (8) is connected to an arm
                     (13) for receiving the fuel cell and the electrical supply
                     battery.

                                            A balanced gas fastening tool
                 This application is a divisional application derived from Australian
   Patent Application No. <removed-apn> which was itself derived from Australian
   Patent Application No. 2012245897, the entire contents of which, as
 5 originally filed, are incorporated herein by reference.
                  This invention relates to a so-called gas fastening tool, i.e. comprising,
   in a housing, an inner combustion engine for propelling a piston for driving a
   fastening member, the engine being associated with a source of energy
   consisting in a combustible gas (fuel) cell. Such a tool further comprises an
10 electric supply battery as well as a gripping, handling and shooting handle on
   which an actuating trigger for the tool is mounted.
                  For a long time, the problem has existed of the balancing of such
   tools, being imperfectly balanced. Indeed, when an operator holds a tool,
   tightening with one hand the handle, he finds it difficult to handle the tool and
15 to stabilize it in a shooting position. This applies for tools wherein the cell
   casing extends parallel to the axis of the housing, between the housing and
   the handle, or for tools wherein the fuel cell is located inside the handle. For
   a tool to be correctly balanced, its centre of gravity should be substantially
   positioned in a point of the handle onto which the operator applies his
20 forefinger, that is the trigger.
                 The Applicant had already proposed in FR 2,774,934, a tool having its
   centre of gravity closer to the ideal balancing point being the trigger, with a
   cell casing extending parallel to the handle and offset along the axis of the
   housing with respect to such a handle.

                             As       the        Applicant              has       tried          to       go      even
         further          in     overcoming               such      a     balancing           problem,            they
         propose to-day a novel improved tool in this respect.
                             Thus,        the       present           application               relates          to    a
         gas       fastening              tool         comprising               an     inner          combustion
         engine,           in      a    housing,             for      propelling              a     piston         for
         driving          a    fastening             member,          a    casing        for       receiving           a
         fuel       cell        as     a     source          of     energy          for      the      engine,          a
         handle          for       handling             the       tool,         with       a      trigger          for
         actuating              the       tool         and       a     casing          for        receiving            a
         battery         as      the     electrical              supply         source        for       the    tool,
         the      handle           being         connected               to     the      housing            of     the
         engine,          and        extending             substantially               perpendicular                 to
         an    axis       of the         housing,            said tool            being        characterized
         in    that,          on     the      side        opposed           to    the      housing            of   the
         engine,            the        handle           is       connected              to       an       arm      for
         receiving              the      fuel         cell        and       the      electrical               supply
         battery.
                             Otherwise             stated,          the       casings         for       receiving
         the      cell        and      the       battery            are       arranged           in      this      arm
         connected             to     the      handle,          but       on     the     side        opposed         to

         the engine.
                             Thus,        when        an     operator           has     engaged           the     cell

         for      being          able       to      use       the       tool,        the      cell         and     the
         battery          act       as    a     ballast          for       shifting          the       centre        of
         gravity         outside          the       housing          of     the     engine,          in     an    area
         even      closer          to the         trigger          than       the     centre          of gravity
         of the prior art tools.
                             Through           some        minor       adaptations,                the      area     of
         the     trigger           and      the      centre         of     gravity          should         be     able

         the     arm 13,    they     are    used       as    a    ballast         for moving            the
