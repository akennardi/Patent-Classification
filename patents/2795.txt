                Diazepam drug intermediates phenylacetic acid synthesis method
         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention relates to a method for preparing a pharmaceutical
 5 intermediate which belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates
   to diazepam drug intermediates phenylacetic acid synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         Phenylacetic acid is a synthesis intermediate of pharmaceutical, pesticide, spices
10 and other organic. In the pharmaceutical industry, it is used for penicillin, dibenzazole
   and other drugs production. By chlorination and esterification, phenylacetic acid
   generates ct-chlorobenzene ethyl acetate, it is used for the production of phenthoate
   and phenthoate ethyl, the pesticides are broad-spectrum organophosphorus pesticides.
   Phenylacetic acid itself is also a kind of growth hormone that attributes to pesticide.
15 Phenylacetic acid is widely found in grapes, strawberries, cocoa, green tea, honey and
   so on. Phenylacetic acid is with sweet honey flavor at low concentrations, in lppm or
   less still taste sweet, it is an important spice ingredients. Phenylacetic acid also has a
   strong bactericidal effect. Most of the existing synthetic methods are using the method
   that phenylacetonitrile is subjected to acid hydrolysis. 70% sulfuric acid is put into the
20 reaction kettle, and then phenylacetonitrile is added dropwise under stirring. The
   reaction is carried out at 130   0 C for 2 hours and diluted with water. After the liquid is
   layered, the ammonium sulfate solution is separated at 120-130 'C, get the dehydrated
   product. This method of production uses sulfuric acid as the reactant, the risk
   coefficient is high, and the reaction temperature reaches 130 "C , the energy
25 consumption is higher, and the synthetic method complicated. Therefore, it is
   necessary to propose a new synthetic method.

20       Compared with the synthetic method disclosed in the background art, the
   invention provides diazepam drug intermediates phenylacetic acid synthesis method, it
   is unnecessary to use sulfuric acid as reactant, reduce the risk of the reaction coefficient,
   and the reaction temperature is low, it needs less energy consumption, reducing
   intermediate links reaction, decreasing the reaction time and improving the reaction
25 yield, at the same time, the present invention provides a new synthetic route which has
