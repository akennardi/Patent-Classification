PROPYZAMIDE FORMULATIONS
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]         The present invention relates to granular formulations of the herbicide
propyzamide. In particular, this invention relates to water-dispersible granular formulations
of propyzamide that contain a high level of propyzamide as active agent and to methods of
preparing said formulations.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]         The herbicide propyzamide, belongs to the benzamide category of
herbicides. Propyzamide has the nomenclature 3, 5-dichloro-N-(1, 1-dimethylprop-2-ynyl)
benzamide, and has also been referred to as "pronamide". Propyzamide is a group D
herbicide, with a mode of action based on inhibition of microtubule assembly. The water
solubility ofpropyzamide in 15 mg/L at 25'C, and the melting point is 155'C.
[0003]         Propyzamide is the active agent in Kerb herbicide, sold by Dow
AgroSciences and has also been sold under the trade name Clanex. In Australia, water
dispersible granular formulations of propyzamide containing 500 g/kg propyzamide have
been sold by 4Farmers under the trade name 4Farmers Propyzamide 500 WG, and by
Imtrade under the trade name Edge 500 WG herbicide. Water-dispersible granular
formulations of 500 g/kg propyzamide have also been sold by Titan Ag Pty Ltd under the
trade name Titan Propyzamide 500 WG.
Granulation
[0004]         Patent literature such as Kurita and Misumi (EP 1382244), entitled
"Granular Compositions and Process for Producing Same", published in Japanese on 7
November 2002 as WO 2002/087324 and in English on 21 April 2004 as EP 1382244,
teaches methods of use and compositions for a pesticide-containing wettable granule or
granular wettable powder. Such wettable granules are said to diminish problems associated
with dosing, dusting and bulkiness of a non-granulated wettable powder, and to diminish

                                                2
problems associated with high viscosity in a flowable (suspension concentrate)
formulation of a finely divided active agent. Water-dispersible granular formulations are
designed to disintegrate in water and to form a fine dispersion in the water for subsequent
application to areas to be treated by spraying through nozzles.
[0005]          In particular Kurita and Misumi teaches that the granule may be prepared by
mixing a pesticidal active ingredient, a binder, and, if necessary other ingredients such as
surfactants, followed by granulation of these ingredients into granules.
[0006]          Kurita and Misumi also teaches that the granulation method may involve
extrusion granulation, spray drying granulation, fluidised bed granulation, tumbling
granulation (e.g., pan granulation), compression granulation, or coating granulation.
Kneading granulation is said to be useful for making a granular wettable powder. This
involves kneading of fine powder components into a dough (for example, with the addition
of water to the powder prior to, or during, kneading). Surfactant, carrier and binder can be
added during kneading. After dough formation, an extrusion process can be used to form
the granules, which are subsequently dried. Granulation by kneading and extrusion is said
to have the merit that installation and operating costs are relatively low. However, a
disadvantage is that that the nature of the kneaded product is substantially influenced by
the content and character of the pesticidal active ingredient. The higher the pesticidal
active ingredient content, the more difficult it is to form the granules. This factor is
considered to be a significant problem in the art by Kurita and Misumi.
[0007]          Kurita and Misumi teaches that highly pure quartz powder may be added to
such a kneaded material prior to extrusion granulation. Preferably the highly pure quartz
powder is added in an amount from 15 - 95 wt%.
Surfactants
[0008]          Kurita and Misumi teaches further that a surfactant or combination of
surfactants may be included in a kneaded material prior to extrusion granulation. The
content of such a surfactant or surfactants is preferably from 0.1 - 15% by weight of the
granules. Suitable non-ionic surfactants are said to include polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers,

                                                   3
polyoxyethylene alkyl phenyl ethers, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene ethers,
polyoxyethylene alkyl esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan alkyl esters, polyoxyethylene
polyoxypropylene block copolymers, sorbitan alkyl esters or higher fatty acid
alkanolamides. Such nonionic surfactants may be used alone or in combination as a
mixture of two or more of them. Suitable cationic surfactants are said to include
alkylamine salts or quaternary ammonium salts. Such cationic surfactants may be used
alone or in combination as a mixture of two or more of them. Further, suitable anionic
surfactants may include naphthalenesulfonic acid polycondensate, alkenylsulfonate,
naphthalenesulfonate, formalin condensate of a naphthalenesulfonate, formalin condensate
of an alkylnaphthalenesulfonate, lignin sulfonate, alkylallylsulfonate, allylallyl sulfonate
sulfate, polystyrene sulfonate, polycarboxylate, polyoxyethylenealkyl ether sulfate,
polyoxyethylenealkylallyl ether sulfate, alkylsulfosuccinate, alkyl sulfate, alkyl ether
sulfonate, or a higher fatty acid alkali salt. Such anionic surfactants may be used alone or
in combination as a mixture of two or more of them.
Binders
[0009]          Kurita and Misumi also teaches that binders may be included in a kneaded
material prior to extrusion. The binders may include carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl
alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, dextrin, starch or a-modified starch, a physical property
improving agent such as sodium tripolyphosphate, an arginate or a polyacrylate and, if
necessary, other adjuvants such as a water soluble polymer, a solvent, an absorptive fine
powder, a binder, a pulverization assistant, a decomposition-preventing agent, a colorant, a
defoaming agent, an effect-improving agent, a perfume or a builder.
Carriers
[0010]          Kurita and Misumi also teaches that carriers (other than highly pure quartz
powder) may be included in a kneaded material prior to extrusion. The carrier may be a
mineral carrier, a water-soluble carrier or a vegetable carrier. A suitable mineral carrier
may, for example, be diatomaceous earth, talc, clay, calcium carbonate, acid clay,
attapulgite, zeolite, sericite, sepiolite or calcium silicate. A suitable water-soluble carrier
may, for example, be ammonium sulfate, urea, dextrin, lactose, fructose, sucrose glucose,

                                                4
sodium chloride, Glaubers salt, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, maleic acid, citric
acid, fumaric acid, malic acid or polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight
of from 6000 to 20000. A suitable vegetable carrier may, for example, be wheat flour,
wood powder, starch, bran, soy flour or a pulverized product of fiber plant. The content of
such a carrier in the composition of the present invention usually may be from 0.1 to 90
wt%, preferably fi-om 0.5 to 75 wt%.
[0011]          One typical method for making water-dispersible granular formulations
involves combining pesticidal active ingredient, a binder, a physical property-improving
agent, and a component-stabilizer, etc., and if necessary, pulverizing by e.g. an impact
pulverizer, whereupon a mineral powder is mixed, water is added, and the mixture is
kneaded and then granulated usually by an extrusion granulator employing a screen for a
particle size of from 0.1 to 5 mm, preferably from 0.2 to 2 mm, and the granulated product
is dried and sieved by a suitable screen for a predetermined grain size, to obtain the
composition of Kurita and Misumi.
[0012]          Further, Kurita and Misumi teaches that it is also possible that a proper
amount of water, a pesticidal active ingredient, a surfactant and if necessary, other
components such as a carrier, are added in necessary amounts, followed by pulverization
by means of a wet type pulverizer such as a ball mill, a Dyno-mill or a sand grinder. To the
resultant aqueous suspension, other components such as a surfactant, a carrier, etc., may be
mixed in a suitable amount, as the case requires, obtaining a kneaded product which can be
granulated by an extrusion granulator.
[0013]          Based upon the teaching of Kurita and Misumi it can be seen that, in
attempting to meet the need to include carriers, binders, surfactants, disintegrants and so
forth in a granular wettable powder, this frequently results in the commercially viable
product being made with a diminished weight of active pesticidal agent.
[0014]          Propyzamide active agent has been commercially available in water
dispersible granular formulation form for a considerable period of time in Australia. For all
this time the loading of active agent in the product granules has been 50% by weight of the

                                                  5
water-dispersible granular formulation or less. The composition of commercially available
propyzamide water-dispersible granules is typically as follows:
[0015]          Propyzamide 500 g/kg formulation:
  CAS Identification                      Component                      %w/w
  CAS# 23950-58-5                      Propyzamide tech                 52.0000
  CAS# 107-21-1                       Polyethylene glycol                2.0000
  CAS# 1332-58-7                             Kaolin                     42.0000
  CAS# 8061-51-6                    Sodium lignosulphonate               2.0000
                                       (e.g., Polyfon H)
  CAS# 9036-19-5                Octylphenol polyethoxy ethanol          2.0000
                                              Total                    100.0000
[0016]          Commercially available water-dispersible granules typically are in the size
range from about 30 microns up to 5,000 microns. In such typical prior art formulations,
kaolin acts as an inert filler, and the sodium lignosulphonate and octylphenol polyethoxy
ethanol are surface-active agents. Sodium lignosulphonate is a dispersant which may have
some function as a granule binder. Octylphenol polyethoxy ethanol (sometimes sold under
the trade name Triton X 1 OOTM) is a nonionic surfactant which is an effective wetting
agent. The surface active agents facilitate disintegration of the water-dispersible granules
to a fine and relatively stable aqueous dispersion when the granules are added to the water
in a spray tank prior to spray application. The kaolin has no herbicidal properties, and no
surface-active effects.
[0017]          It is desirable to provide a water-dispersible granular formulation of
propyzamide with a loading of propyzamide at greater than 500 g/kg. The benefits of a
more highly loaded water-dispersible granular formulation would include:
                1.         A reduced amount of packaging material would be necessary to
                           carry a given amount of active ingredient to a cultivation zone.
                2.         The costs of disposing of used packaging material would be less.

                                                 6
                3.        A reduced weight of goods would need to be carried by a farm
                          worker in applying a given amount of propyzamide to a cultivation
                          zone.
                4.        The cost of freight (volume and weight basis) in transporting the
                          propyzamide formulation from factory to field would be reduced.
                5.        A higher loading propyzamide formulation would enable a
                          manufacturer to demonstrate superior formulation expertise to
                          farmers.
[0018]          In this specification and in the claims, the term "highly loaded" is to be
taken to refer to the concentration level of active agent ofpropyzamide herbicide in a
water-dispersible granular formulation on a weight by weight basis (g/kg) in the amount
from at least 600 g/kg.

the steps of:

                                                  8

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0028]          Preferably, the propyzamide in the water-dispersible granular formulation is
loaded to at least 600 g/kg based upon the total formulation.
[0029]          Even though the water-dispersible granular formulation active herbicide
agent is loaded to at least 600 g/kg, the water-dispersible granular formulation according to
the present invention can be highly loaded with propyzamide up to 900 g/kg.
[0030]          The propyzamide to be used in the preparation of water-dispersible granular
formulation is in the form of finely divided particles.
[0031]          The water-dispersible granular formulation, optionally, includes an inert
filler which has no herbicidal properties. The inert filler is in the form of a finely divided
material and constitutes no greater than 300 g/kg based upon the total water-dispersible
granular formulation. Preferably, the inert filler constitutes no greater than 200 g/kg based
upon the total water-dispersible granular formulation. More preferably, that amount is less
than 100 g/kg, and even more preferably, that amount is less than 50 g/kg based on the
total water-dispersible granular formulation.
[0032]          The water-dispersible granular formulation includes at least one, or at least
two, or at least three surface active agents. The at least one surface active agent is a

                                                  9
dispersant. It may have the ancillary function as a granular binder. One such example of a
dispersant is a lignosulphonate salt such as sodium lignosulphonate.
[0033]          The second surface active agent, if present, is a wetting agent and may be an
anionic surfactant.
[0034]          The dispersant, being the lignosulphonate salt or sodium lignosulphonate,
and the wetting agent have a combined amount in the water-dispersible granular
formulation of at least 30 g/kg based upon the total weight of the formulation. The amount
of lignosulphonate salt or sodium lignosulphonate may also range between 25 g/kg to 50
g/kg based upon the total weight of the formulation.
[0035]          Useful wetting agents are naphthalene sulphonate condensate salt or its
sodium salt. The amount of naphthalene sulphonate condensate salt or its sodium salt in the
water-dispersible granular formulation can range between 8 g/kg to 30 g/kg based upon the
weight of the total formulation, although the amount ranging between 12 g/kg to 18 g/kg is
the more preferred range.
[0036]          The water-dispersible granular formula also may include a third surface
active agent which is also an anionic surfactant. This second anionic surfactant may be an
alkyl naphthalene sulphonate blend or its sodium salt.
[0037]          The amount of alkyl naphthalene sulphonate blends or its sodium salt in the
water-dispersible granular formulation range between 10 g/kg to 30 g/kg, although the
preferred range lies between 15 g/kg to 25 g./kg based upon the total weight ofthe
formulation.
[0038]          The inert filler, in the form of finely divided material, when present, is
present in an amount desirably of no greater than 250 g/kg, based upon the total weight of
the formulation.
[0039]          In order to manufacture the wettable granular propyzamide formulation, a
preferred method involves the following steps.

                                                  10
 [0040]          First, a defined quantity of finely divided propyzamide particles are loaded
 into a normal industrial sized commercial blender and then blended to homogeneity in the
 presence of a water spray or something similar, in combination with all of the other
 components being: (i) a lignosulphonate salt or sodium lignosulphonate; (ii) a naphthalene
 sulphonate condensate salt or its sodium salt; (iii) an alkyl naphthalene sulphonate blend or
 its sodium salt; and, optionally, (iv) the finely divided inert filler.
 [0041]          Then the resultant homogenous propyzamide blend is then transferred to an
 extruder, which is a usual industrial type extruder, and the ensuring extrusion process
 forms moist granules of the propyzamide blend.
 [0042]          The third step of the method of manufacture is to pass the extruded moist
 wet granules through a sieve, which is, preferably, a 1 nm-n to 5 mm industrial type sieve.
 Once the moist granules pass through the sieve they are then dried to make the desired
 water-dispersible granular formulation. Temperatures in the order of up to about 80'C,
 even though lesser temperatures may be used, are used to dry the moist granules.
 [0043]          After the completion of the above described process, the water-dispersible
 granular formulation will be in the form of dried granules and will have a moisture content
 of less than about 1% by weight, based upon the total weight of the formulation.
 [0044]          The dried granules are designed to disintegrate in water in a spray tank, and
 to form a fine dispersion in the water, for subsequent application by spraying through
 nozzles.
 [0045]          According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a
 method of controlling weeds including the addition of wettable granular propyzamide
 formulation, wherein the propyzamide is highly loaded based on the total formulation, to
 spray water in a spray tank and spraying the resultant spray liquor on to a site containing
 weeds.
[0046]          According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a
water-dispersible granular formulation comprising:

                                                 11
             propyzamide, wherein the propyzamide is loaded to at least 600 g/kg based upon
the total formulation; and
             a surface active agent.
[0047]          In certain embodiments, the surface active agent is a single surface active
agent. That is, only one surface active agent is present in the formulation.
[0048]          According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a water
dispersible granular formulation comprising, consisting or consisting essentially of
propyzamide, wherein the propyzamide is loaded to at least 600 g/kg based upon the total
formulation;
             a single surface active agent; and, optionally,
             a binder.
[0049]           Suitably, the surface active agent is present in an amount of at least 30 g/kg.
Accordingly, the surface active agent of the present invention may be present in an amount of
between about 30 g/kg and about 150 g/kg, about 35 g/kg and about 120 g/kg, about 40 g/kg
and about 100 g/kg, or any range therein. In particular embodiments of the present invention,
the surface active agent is present in an amount of about 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39,
40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64,
65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89,
90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150
g/kg or any range therein. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the surface active
agent is present in an amount of between about 35 g/kg and about 100 g/kg. In one preferred

  [0055]            The advantages of highly loaded wettable granular propyzamide
  formulations include: reduced packaging requirements, reduced freight costs, reduced
  amounts of non-herbicidally active ingredients relative to the propyzamide in the
  formulations leading to reduced weight and volumes to be transported, and, where
  inert filler is not incorporated in the highly loaded formulations, the minimising or
  elimination of problems arising from the presence of inert filler particles.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS AND EXAMPLES OF
THE INVENTION
[0056]         In order that the present invention may be more readily comprehended, one
or more preferred embodiments are described hereinafter.
Example 1
[0057]         A water-dispersible granular formulation according to the present invention
was made by incorporating the following components.
 Components                                               Parts by Weight
 1. Propyzamide 98%                                            918.4kg
 2. Sodium salt of naphthalene sulphonate condensate            15.1kg
    (e.g., Morwet D 425, or Galoryl DT 505)
 3. Sodium lignosulphonate                                      38.4kg
    (e.g., Polyfon H).
 4. Sodium alkyl naphthalene sulphonate blend                   19.4kg
    (e.g., Morwet EFW)
[0058]         In Example 1, the formulation procedure for a 1000 kg batch, inclusive of
quality control measures, was as follows, with the steps being numerically as 1.1, 1.2, 1.3,
and so on.
[0059]          1.1      Ensure the blender, which is provided with water sprayers, is empty
and clean.
[0060]          1.2      Charge the blender with the components via a hopper.

                                                 14
[0061]           1.3      Seal the blender and switch on.
[0062]           1.4      Activate the sprayers to distribute water throughout the dry mix.
Set the water flow-rate to Ilt per minute, and spray until sufficient water is present to allow
a consistent mix to develop. Operate the blender for a minimum of one further hour to
ensure the mix is homogeneous.
[0063]           1.5      Transfer the mix to the extruder and switch the drying receiver on.
Extrude the mixture in the form of granules into the receiver and air dry at a temperature of
no greater than 80'C to a moisture content of approximately 1% weight based on the
weight of the formulation. Where the moisture content significantly exceeds 1% weight to
weight of the formulation, recycle the granules through the drying receiver (at the end of
the run) until the moisture content target is achieved.
[0064]           1.6      Sample approximately 1kg of product, ensuring it is representative.
[0065]           1.7      Sub-sample approximately 250g from the original 1kg sample and
subject it to the following testing regime.
                          1.7.1     Active constituent (Propyzamide) content (using validated
                                    method).
                          1.7.2     pH of a 1% aqueous solution (CIPAC MT75.3).
                          1.7.3     Wet sieve test (CIPAC MT185).
                          1.7.4     Wettability (CIPAC MT53.3).
                          1.7.5     Persistent foaming (CIPAC MT 47.2).
[0066]           1.8      If active constituent level is satisfactory, record results and proceed
to step 1.10 described below.

                                                 15
[0067]           1.9       If active constituent level is outside the bounds of the
acceptable range listed in the specification, adjust the level accordingly by recycling
granules through the blending process (Returning to step 1.4 described above) along
with additional excipients, being sodium alkyl naphthalene sulphonate, sodium
lignosulphonate and naphthalene sulphonate blend in the weight to weight ratio
15:38:19 (to adjust for a high active content) or along with additional propyzamide
(to adjust for a low active content).
[0068]           1.10      If the sample fail to meet a specification for any of the other
parameters, quarantine the batch for further investigation and possible rework.
Otherwise proceed to step 1.11 described below.
[0069]           1.11      Catalogue and store a retention sample of approximately 200g.
[0070]           1.12      Generate a certificate of analysis noting results of testing.

Bioefficacy Studies
[0072]           A number of trials were carried out to assess the weed control efficacy of a
highly loaded propyzamide water-dispersible granular formulation with that of a
conventionally loaded propyzamide water-dispersible granular formulation when applied
to sites containing grass weeds at the same active ingredient rate. The Reports of those
tests are set out below. It was found that there was no significant difference in the level of
weed control between the formulations.
DRAWINGS
[0073]           The drawings comprise bar graphs showing the effects of application of the
aforesaid formulations.
[0074]           Figure 1 is a bar graph showing the effect on annual ryegrass plants at 74
days after application of formulations;
[0075]           Figure 2 is a bar graph showing the effect on annual ryegrass panicles at 153
days after application of formulations; and
[0076]           Figure 3 is a bar graph showing the effect on annual ryegrass panicles at 137
days after application of formulations.
Example BE 1
[0077]           The reference formulation ofpropyzamide was Imtrade Edge 500WG. This
commercially available formulation contained 500 g ai/kg Propyzamide. The current
registration profile for this commercially available formulation includes use in various
legume pastures including clover, medic and Lucerne as well as Lettuce crops, turf and
lawns. It controls a range of annual grass weed species including annual ryegrass
(L.rigidum). The trial work in this example was undertaken to examine absolute control
and bioequivalence of Imtrade Edge 500 WG Herbicide and the new formulation of
propyzamide (900 g/kg active agent) which is designated Imtrade Edge 900 WG (see

                                               18
example 1 for formulation details). The example relates to the use of Imtrade Edge 900
WG in canola for the control of annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum).
Aims
[0078]          To prove that Imtrade Edge 500 WG Herbicide and the new formulation of
Imtrade Edge 900 WG Herbicide provide control of annual ryegrass at use rates of 500
and IOOg ai per hectare.
[0079]          To prove that both formulations provide equivalent level of control of
annual ryegrass when applied at equivalent rates (g ai/ha).
Main Conclusions
[0080]          Both formulations of Edge provided a high level of annual ryegrass control
(>85%) which was significantly different from the untreated control. There was no
significant difference in the weed control between the two formulations of the
Propyzamide when applied at the same rate (g ai) per hectare.
Treatments
[0081]          Both products were applied at 2 rates; 500 and 1000 g ai per hectare.

[0084]          Plant counts were taken using a 1/10m 2 quadrat and annual ryegrass was
counted 74 days after treatment. Annual ryegrass panicle counts were taken 153 days after

                                                21
treatment. Results were analysed using Analysis of Variance and treatment means were
separated at the 95% probability level (P 0.05) using Fishers least significant difference.
Results
[0085]           There was no visual effect of any treatment on the canola crop. The
application of Propyzamide significantly reduced annual ryegrass numbers in the crop.
There was a significant reduction in annual ryegrass in all treatments irrespective of
application rate or the formulation type of Edge applied. When applied at equivalent
g ai/ha, both formulations controlled weeds to an equivalent level. As well as significant
reduction in annual ryegrass number, surviving plants appeared stunted and less
competitive than those in the untreated plot based on visual observation. When carried
through to seed head formation, annual ryegrass panicle counts reflected the trends of the
plant counts undertaken earlier in the season. There was a significant reduction in panicle
counts in all treatments compared to the untreated control. There was no significant
difference between rates applied on a g ai/ ha basis. There was no significant difference
between panicle counts when comparing the different formulations when applied at the
same g ai/ ha.
[0086]           Figure 1 shows the effect on annual ryegrass numbers per square metre in
response to the application of lmtrade Edge 500 WG Herbicide and Imtrade Edge 900 WG

Discussion
[0090]          The use rates (g ai/ha) reflects the range of current registered rates of
Imtrade Edge 500WG herbicide for control of grass weeds in other use patterns including
legume pastures and Lucerne. There was a significant reduction in annual ryegrass
numbers and annual ryegrass panicle counts at all rates and with both the 500g and 900 g
ai formulations. There was no significant difference in herbicide efficacy between the
products at comparable g ai / ha application and this highlights the bioequivalence ofthe
two formulations.
Example BE 2
[0091]          The reference formulation of propyzamide was lmtrade Edge 500WG. This
commercially available formulation contained 500 g ai/kg Propyzamide. The current
registration profile for this commercially available formulation includes use in various
legume pastures including clover, medic and Lucerne as well as Lettuce crops, turf and
lawns. It controls a range of annual grass weed species including annual ryegrass
(L.rigidum). The trial work in this example was undertaken to examine absolute control
and bioequivalence of Imtrade Edge 500 WG Herbicide and the new formulation of
propyzamide (900 g/kg active agent) which is designated Imtrade Edge 900 WG (see
example 1 for formulation details). The example relates to the use of Imtrade Edge 900
WG in legume-based pasture control of annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum).
Aims
[0092]          To prove that Imtrade Edge 500 WG Herbicide and the new formulation of
Imtrade Edge 900 WG Herbicide provide control of annual ryegrass in pasture at use rates
of 500 and 1000 g ai per hectare.
[0093]          To prove that both formulations provide equivalent level of control of grass
weeds, in particular annual ryegrass, when applied at equivalent rates (g ai/ha).

                                               24
Main Conclusions
[0094]           Both formulations of Edge provided a level of grass weed control, which
was significantly different to the untreated control. This was assessed by reduction of
panicle counts of the annual ryegrass. There was no significant difference in the weed
control between the two formulations of the Propyzamide when applied at the same
rate (g ai) per hectare based on annual ryegrass panicle counts.
Treatments
[0095]           Both products were applied at 2 rates; 500 and 1000 g ai per hectare.
[0096]           Table 6 sets out the treatment types and application rate mL product
per hectare and g ai per hectare.

Experimental Details
[0097]           The trial was a non-replicated large plot trial consisting of 50m x 25m
plots for each treatment. The Edge treatments were applied across seeded pasture plots
using a hand boom. The annual ryegrass (L.rigidum) was not seeded and had established
from the residual seed bank from previous seasons across the seeded legume species. The
annual ryegrass weeds were varying sizes ranging from 2 leaf to well tillered stage, with
approximately 50% of the plants having multiple tillers. The legume pastures was well

                                                  25
established at spraying. The site was seeded approximately 5 weeks prior to spraying the
trial. Full application details are set out in Tables 7 and 8.

[0098]          Annual ryegrass panicle counts were taken 110 days after treatment. All data
from this trial was analysed using a confidence interval of 95% unless otherwise specified.
Means were compared using paired t-test and single factor Analysis of Variance. All
mention of significant differences contained within this report refer to statistically
significant differences.
Results
[0099]          There was no visual effect of any treatment on the legume pasture species.
Annual Ryegrass Biomass Reduction
[0100]          The application of Propyzamide resulted in a visual reduction the biomass
of the annual ryegrass in the sward. Annual ryegrass plants were discoloured and stunted
when compared with the untreated, which grew well throughout the season. The treated
areas exhibited symptoms of root pruning as would be expected from this herbicide mode
of action.

Annual Ryegrass Panicle Counts
[0101]           When carried through to seed head formation, annual ryegrass panicle
counts reflected the trends observed in biomass observations of earlier in the season.
There was a significant reduction in panicle number in all treatments compared to the
untreated control. There was a significant difference between rates applied on a g ai/
ha basis with higher rates resulting in greater reduction in the panicle numbers. There
was no significant difference between panicle counts when comparing the different
formulations when applied at the same g ai/ ha. At each rate of application, Edge 900
WG provided the same level control of annual ryegrass as Edge 500 WG as measured
by panicle counts.
[0102]           Figure 3 shows the effect on annual ryegrass panicles per square metre in
response to the application of Imtrade Edge 500 WG Herbicide and Imtrade Edge 900
WG Herbicide 137 days after application.

 Discussion
 [0104]         The use rates (g ai/ha) reflects the range of current registered rates of
 Imitrade Edge 500 WG Herbicide for control of grass weeds in legume pastures and
 Lucerne. The application timing of the herbicide fell outside the ideal timing, with many
 of the ryegrass plants tillered, resulting in more established plants which are more difficult
 to control with a root absorbed herbicide. This is reflected in the significant difference in
 rate response across the trial of the recommended range for this use pattern. The Imtrade
 Edge 500 WG Herbicide label also states "Rain or irrigation is necessary to thoroughly wet
 the top 3-4cm of soil. This is similar to 25mm rain". At this site, at the time of application
 the soil was moist and a soaking rain of approximately 28mm occurred within 4 days of
 application. This may or may not have washed the herbicide into the top 3-4cm and the
 next significant rainfall event was approximately 22mm some 4 days later. Despite the size
 of the annual ryegrass at spraying, where approximately 50% of plants were tillering, there
 was an extremely visual biomass reduction for all treatments. There was a significant
 reduction in annual ryegrass panicles at all rates with both the 500g and 900 g ai
 formulations. There was no significant difference in annual ryegrass panicle numbers
 between the Imtrade Edge 500 WG and Imtrade Edge 900 WG product when applied at
 comparable rates of grams active ingredient per hectare. As a result of the plant biomass
 observations and subsequent annual ryegrass panicle counts, Imtrade Edge 900 WG
 Herbicide should be considered at least equivalent in efficacy when compared to Imtrade
 Edge 500 WG Herbicide.
 Example 2
[0105]           The aim of the present example was to prove that formulations comprising
900g/kg propyzamide could be formulated using just a single surfactant. Accordingly, a
range of water dispersable granular formulations comprising 900g/kg propyzamide together
with a single surfactant were made and tested according to those methods provided in
Example 1.

                                                29
[0106]           It would be appreciated that many commercially available surfactants are
available as polydisperse mixtures rather than as homogeneous preparations of only one
surfactant. Accordingly, and for the purposes of the present invention, any such
commercially available surfactant is treated as a single surfactant rather than as a mixture.
Further, a single surfactant may also refer to one or more of a plurality of species contained
within a designated class of surfactant. For example, if the designated class of surfactant is
alkyl naphthalene sulphonate, wherein the alkyl group has 8 to 12 carbons, a surfactant
containing octyl naphthalene sulphonates or nonyl naphthalene sulphonates is considered
herein to constitute a single surfactant.

formulations containing 900g/kg propyzamide and a single surfactant.
