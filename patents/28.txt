    invention.
                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
  5 [0003]     The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as
    an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that such art forms part of the common
    general knowledge in Australia. Protein kinases represent one of the largest super-families of
    drug targets across all therapeutic areas. The central challenge in the development of kinase
    inhibitor drug candidates is in targeting the disregulated kinase while avoiding inhibition of
 '0 non-disease related kinases containing closely related ATP binding pockets. Imatinib, the
    first clinically approved kinase inhibitor provided a remarkable example of a highly selective
    inhibitor of the translocation product Bcr-Abl (SEQ ID NO: 1) (Capdeville et al., 2002, Nat
    Rev DrugDiscov 1:493-502; Sawyers, 2002, Cancer Cell 1:13-15). Imatinib potently
    inhibits Bcr-Abl, the oncogene which drives chronic myelogenous leukaemia, but does not
25  inhibit the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, c-Src (SEQ ID NO:2), despite the fact that the two
    kinases share almost completely identical amino acids lining the ATP binding pocket which
    Imatinib contacts (Figure 1A; Schindler et al., 2000, Science 289:1938-1942; Seeliger et al.,
    2007, Structure 15:299-311). Significant medicinal chemistry, structural biology, and
    computational modelling efforts have focussed on understanding the differential selectivity of
30  Imatinib for Bcr-Abl and c-Src.
    [0004]     The first insight into the basis for selectivity of Imatinib was revealed when Kuriyan
    and co-workers solved the Imatinib-Abl co-crystal structure (Nagar et al., 2002, Cancer
                                                       1

       WO 2010/045542                                                            PCT/US2009/060985
Research 62:4236-4243; Schindler et al., 2000, Id.). This structure revealed a not-previously
observed kinase conformation indicating that Imatinib binds Abl in a catalytically inactive
conformation defined by a crank shaft-like displacement of the N-terminal region of the
activation loop of the kinase effecting a dramatic change in the conformation of the Asp-Phe
Gly (DFG) triad. This conformational change has been subsequently observed in other
protein kinase-drug co-crystal structures (Irk, Kit, Flt3, p38 Mapk and B-Raf; Griffith et al.,
2004, Mol Cell 13:169-178; Hubbard et al., 1994, Nature 372:746-754; Mol et al., 2004, J
Biol Chem 279:31655-31663; Pargellis et al., 2002, Nat Struct Biol 9:268-272; Wan et al.,
2004, Cell 116:855-867) and has been termed the "type-II" or "DFG-out" conformation.
ATP competitive inhibitors which bind to kinases in the active conformation are termed
"type-I" or "DFG-in" binders; Figure 1B and C; Liu and Gray, 2006, Nat Chem Biol 2:358
364). The identification of an inactive conformation of Abl bound by the highly selective
inhibitor Imatinib has guided many successful medicinal chemistry campaigns in search of
selective kinase inhibitors (Angell et al., 2008, Bioorg Med Chem Lett 18:4433-4437;
Cumming et al., 2004, Bioorg Med Chem Lett 14:5389-5394; Gill et al., 2005, JMed Chem
48:414-426.; Heron et al., 2006, Bioorg Med Chem Lett 16:1320-1323; Okram et al., 2006,
Chem Biol 13:779-786).
[0005]     A wealth of data currently supports the view that the Imatinib bound conformation
(DFG-out) of Abl is thermodynamically stable in complex with Imatinib, but that such
conformations require energetically unfavourable interactions in c-Src complexes (Levinson
et al., 2006, PLoS Biol 4:e144; Nagar et al., 2002, Id.; Seeliger et al., 2007, Id.; Vajpai et al.,
2008, JBiol Chem 283:18292- 18302). Imatinib has been crystallized in both its potent
target Abl (Nagar et al., 2002, Id.; Schindler et al., 2000, Id.), as well as the poorly inhibited
target, c-Src (Seeliger et al., 2007, Id.). Surprisingly, the Imatinib/co-crystal structures are
virtually identical despite the significantly different affinities of Imatinib for the two protein
kinases. Efforts to construct mutant forms of c-Src with the ability to be potently inhibited by
Imatinib were only partially successful, which led Kuriyan and co-workers to suggest a
distributed thermodynamic penalty for c-Src to adopt the DFG-out conformation (Seeliger et
al., 2007, Id.). The importance of kinase conformational preference over precise amino acid
identity is highlighted by studies with the Imatinib target receptor kinase, c-Kit (SEQ ID
NO:3). Although c-Kit is more closely related to c-Src than Abl (SEQ ID NO: 11) in the
amino acids lining the ATP binding pocket, c-Kit is more potently inhibited by Imatinib
(Deininger et al., 2005, Blood 105:2640- 2653). Structural studies of c-Kit in the absence of
                                                  2

      WO 2010/045542                                                           PCT/US2009/060985
ligand (ATP or Imatinib) show the kinase adopts the DFG-out conformation, suggesting the
Imatinib bound conformation is stable and pre-formed in the absence of Imatinib, thereby
explaining its Imatinib sensitivity (Mol et al., 2004, Id.)
[0006]     Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is widely held that the explanation of
the discrepancy in affinity of Imatinib despite the close similarity in structure of the two
drug-protein complexes is based on the relative propensity of the two kinases to adopt the
relevant drug-bound (DFG-out/type II) conformation: Abl is predicted to prefer the DFG out
conformation relative to c-Src, and since Imatinib binds to the type-II conformation of the
kinase, its affinity is higher to Abl than to c-Src.

[0023]    The abbreviations used herein have their conventional meaning within the chemical
and biological arts.
[0024]    Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae,
written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that
would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., -CH 20- is equivalent to
-OCH 2 -.
[0025]    The term "alkyl," by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise
stated, a straight (i.e. unbranched) or branched carbon chain, or combination thereof, which
may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent
radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. C 1-Cio means one to ten
carbons). Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups
such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, cyclohexyl,
(cyclohexyl)methyl, cyclopropylmethyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n
hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more
double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not
limited to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4
pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers.
[0026]    The term "alkylene" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent
radical derived from an alkyl, as exemplified, but not limited, by -CH 2CH 2CH 2 CH 2 -.
Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, with those
groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the present invention. A "lower
alkyl" or "lower alkylene" is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or
fewer carbon atoms.
[00271     The term "heteroalkyl," by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless
otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or
                                                  7

       WO 2010/045542                                                         PCT/US2009/060985
combinations thereof, consisting of at least one carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom
selected from the group consisting of 0, N, P, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur
atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be
quaternized. The heteroatom(s) 0, N, P and S and Si may be placed at any interior position
of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the
remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to, -CH 2-CH 2-0-CH3 ,
CH 2 -CH2 -NH-CH 3, -CH 2 -CH 2-N(CH3 )-CH 3 , -CH 2-S-CH 2 -CH 3 , -CH2-CH 2 ,-S(O)-CH 3, -CH 2
CH 2 -S(O) 2 -CH 3 , -CH=CH-0-CH 3 , -Si(CH 3) 3, -CH 2 -CH=N-OCH 3, -CH=CH-N(CH 3 )-CH 3,
O-CH 3 , -O-CH 2-CH 3, and -CN.     Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for
example, -CH 2-NH-OCH 3 and -CH 2 -0-Si(CH3)3. Similarly, the term "heteroalkylene" by
itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as
exemplified, but not limited by, -CH 2 -CH 2 -S-CH 2-CH 2 - and -CH 2-S-CH 2-CH 2 -NH-CH 2-.
For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini
(e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still
further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is
implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example,
the formula -C(O) 2R'- represents both -C(O) 2R'- and -R'C(O) 2 -. As described above,
heteroalkyl groups, as used herein, include those groups that are attached to the remainder of
the molecule through a heteroatom, such as -C(O)R', -C(O)NR', -NR'R, -OR', -SR, and/or
SO2 R'. Where "heteroalkyl" is recited, followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups,
such as -NR'R or the like, it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and -NR'R" are not
redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather, the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add
clarity. Thus, the term "heteroalkyl" should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific
heteroalkyl groups, such as -NR'R or the like.
 [00281    The terms "cycloalkyl" and "heterocycloalkyl", by themselves or in combination
with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of "alkyl" and
"heteroalkyl", respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the
position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of
cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3
cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not
limited to, 1 -(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4
morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl,
tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like. A "cycloalkylene" and
                                                  8

        WO 2010/045542                                                            PCT/US2009/060985
   "heterocycloalkylene" refer to a divalent radical derived from cycloalkyl and
  heterocycloalkyl, respectively.
   [00291   The terms "halo" or "halogen," by themselves or as part of another substituent,
  mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally,
  terms such as "haloalkyl," are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For
  example, the term "halo(C 1 -C4)alkyl" is mean to include, but not be limited to,
  trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.
   [00301   The term "aryl" means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic,
  hydrocarbon substituent which can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 to 3
  rings) which are fused together or linked covalently. The term "heteroaryl" refers to aryl
  groups (or rings) that contain from one to four heteroatoms selected from N, 0, and S,
  wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are
  optionally quaternized. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule
  through a carbon or heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups
  include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3
  pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4
  oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5
  thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4
  pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5
  isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, and 6-quinolyl. Substituents for each
  of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable
  substituents described below. "Arylene" and "heteroarylene" refers to a divalent radical
  derived from a aryl and heteroaryl, respectively. A "fused ring " refers a ring system with
  two or more rings having at least one bond and two atoms in common. Thus, a "fused ring
  aryl" and a "fused ring heteroaryl" refer to ring systems having at least one aryl and
  heteroaryl, respectively, that share at least one bond and two atoms in common with another
  ring.
   [0031]   For brevity, the term "aryl" when used in combination with other terms (e.g.,
  aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above.
) Thus, the term "arylalkyl" is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is
  attached to an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including
  those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (e.g., a methylene group) has been replaced by, for
                                                     9

example, an oxygen atom (e.g., phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(l
naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like).
[00321      The term "oxo" as used herein means an oxygen that is double bonded to a carbon
atom.
[00331     The term "alkylsulfonyl" as used herein means a moiety having the formula -S(0       2 )
R', where R' is an alkyl group as defined above. R' may have a specified number of carbons
(e.g. "CI-C 4 alkylsulfonyl").
[00341      Each of the above terms (e.g., "alkyl," "heteroalkyl," "aryl" and "heteroaryl") are
meant to include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred
substituents for each type of radical are provided below.
[00351      Substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (including those groups often
referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl,
heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) can be one or more of a variety of
groups selected from, but not limited to: -OR', =0, =NR', =N-OR', -NR'R", -SR', halogen,
-SiR'R"R"', -OC(O)R', -C(O)R', -CO 2R', -CONR'R", -OC(O)NR'R", -NR"C(O)R',
-NR'-C(O)NR"R"', -NR"C(O) 2R', -NR-C(NR'R"R"')=NR"", -NR-C(NR'R")=NR"', -S(O)R',
-S(O) 2 R', -S(O) 2NR'R", -NRSO 2 R', -CN and -NO     2 in a number ranging from zero to (2m'+1),
where m' is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical. R', R", R"' and R"" each
preferably independently refer to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl,
substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl,
substituted or unsubstituted aryl (e.g., aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens), substituted or
unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. When a compound of
the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is
independently selected as are each R', R", R"' and R"" groups when more than one of these
groups is present. When R' and R" are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be
combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example,
-NR'R" is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1 -pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From
the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term
"alkyl" is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than
hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., -CF 3 and -CH 2 CF 3) and acyl (e.g., -C(O)CH 3,
-C(O)CF 3 , -C(O)CH 2OCH 3, and the like).

 [00361    Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl
and heteroaryl groups are varied and are selected from, for example: halogen, -OR', -NR'R",
-SR', halogen, -SiR'R"R"', -OC(O)R', -C(O)R', -CO 2 R', -CONR'R", -OC(O)NR'R",
-NR"C(O)R', -NR'-C(O)NR"R"', -NR"C(O) 2R', -NR-C(NR'R"R"')=NR"",
-NR-C(NR'R")=NR"', -S(O)R', -S(O) 2 R', -S(O) 2NR'R", -NRSO 2 R', -CN and -NO 2 , -R', -N 3 ,
-CH(Ph) 2 , fluoro(C1-C 4)alkoxy, and fluoro(CI-C 4 )alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to the
total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where R', R", R"' and R"" are
preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl,
substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or
unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl and substituted or
unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R
group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R', R", R"' and
R"" groups when more than one of these groups is present.
[00371    Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may
optionally form a ring of the formula -T-C(O)-(CRR')qU-, wherein T and U are
independently -NR-, -0-, -CRR'- or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 3.
Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may
optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -A-(CH 2),-B-, wherein A and B are
independently -CRR'-, -0-, -NR-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S(0) 2 -, -S(O) 2NR'- or a single bond, and r is
an integer of from 1 to 4. One of the single bonds of the new ring so formed may optionally
be replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of
the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula
-(CRR')s-X'-(C"R"')d-, where s and d are independently integers of from 0 to 3, and X' is -0-,
-NR'-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S(0)2-, or -S(O) 2 NR'-. The substituents R, R', R" and R"' are preferably
independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or
unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or
unsubstituted aryl, and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl.
[0038]    As used herein, the term "heteroatom" or "ring heteroatom" is meant to include
oxygen (0), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), and silicon (Si).

   compounds of the present invention do not include those which are known in the art to be too
   unstable to synthesize and/or isolate.
 0 [0049]    The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of
   atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example,
   the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium
   ('H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (1C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the
   present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the
25 present invention.
   [0050]    Throughout this specification and the claims, unless the context requires otherwise,
   the word "comprise" and its variations, such as "comprises" and "comprising," will be
   understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but
   not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps. The terms "a" or
30 "an," as used in herein means one or more. In addition, the phrase "substituted with a[n]," as
   used herein, means the specified group may be substituted with one or more of any or all of
   the named substituents. For example, where a group, such as an alkyl or heteroaryl group, is
   "substituted with an unsubstituted C1-C 20 alkyl, or unsubstituted 2 to 20 membered
                                                    14

Methods of Reducing Kinase Activity
 [0124]    In another aspect, a method of reducing the activity of a Src tyrosine kinase is
provided. The method includes contacting the Src tyrosine kinase with an effective amount
of the compound of Formula I, II, III, IV or V. In some embodiments, the compound is the
compound of Formula 1, 11 or IV. In other embodiments, the compounds are the compound
of Formula I.
 [0125]    A Src tyrosine kinase, as used herein, refers to any one of the family of Src proto
oncogenic tyrosine kinases and oncogene tyrosine kinases. In some embodiments, the Src
tyrosine kinase is the cellular Src tyrosine kinase (c-Src), such as the human c-Src (also
referred to in the art MGC1 17393) (SEQ ID NO:6) or oncogenic derivatives thereof. See also
Mather et al., JBiol Chem. 2008 Aug 15;283(33):22709-22.
 [0126]    The contacting may occur in vitro, in situ, or in vivo. For example, the compound
may be exposed to a cell containing the Src tyrosine kinase, allowed to enter into the cell, and
contact the Src tyrosine kinase thereby reducing the activity of the Src tyrosine kinase. The
cell may be any appropriate cell, such as a mammalian cell (e.g. a human cell). The cell may
also form part of a tissue, organ or organism.
 [01271    In some related embodiments, the compound may also be capable of reducing the
activity of an Abl tyrosine kinase. An Abl tyrosine kinase refers to any one of the family of
Abl proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinases. In some embodiments, the Abl tyrosine kinase is the
cellular Abl tyrosine kinase (c-Abl) or oncogenic derivatives thereof such as Ber-Abl. See,
e.g. Shaul Y (2000), Cell Death Differ. 7 (1): 10-6; Era T (2002) Int. J. Hematol. 76 (1): 35
43; and Pendergast AM (2003) Adv. CancerRes. 85: 5 1-100. Thus, in some embodiments
the Abl kinase is a Bcr-Abl kinase or a T3151 Bcr-Abl kinase. The method may further
include contacting an Abl tyrosine kinase with the compound thereby reducing the activity of
the Abl tyrosine kinase. Where the method further includes contacting an Abl tyrosine kinase
with the compound, it is understood that more than one compound is typically required to
contact both an Abl and a Src tyrosine kinase. Therefore, a plurality of compounds having
the same chemical structure are used.
 [0128]    As described above, the contacting of the Abl and Src tyrosine kinases may occur in
vitro, in situ, or in vivo. Thus, in some embodiments, a plurality of the compound is

contacted with a cell or vessel containing the Abi and Src tyrosine kinases. Once contacted
by the compound, the Abl and Src tyrosine kinase activities are reduced.
[0129]     In another aspect, a method of reducing the activity of an Abl tyrosine kinase is
provided. The method includes contacting the Abl tyrosine kinase with an effective amount
of a compound of Formula I, II, III, IV or V. In some embodiments, the compound is the
compound of Formula I, II or IV. In other embodiments, the compounds is the compound of
Formula I. In some embodiments, the Abi kinase is a Bcr-Abl kinase or a T3151 Bcr-Abl
kinase. As described above, the contacting of the Abl tyrosine kinases may occur in vitro, in
situ, or in vivo. Thus, the compound may be exposed to a cell containing the Abl tyrosine
kinase, allowed to enter into the cell, and contact the Abl tyrosine kinase thereby reducing the
activity of the Src tyrosine kinase.
[0130]     In some related embodiments, the compound may also be capable of reducing the
activity of a Src kinase. Thus, the method may further include contacting a Src tyrosine
kinase with the compound thereby reducing the activity of the Src tyrosine kinase. As
explained above, where the method further includes contacting a Src tyrosine kinase with the
compound, it is understood that more than one compound is typically required to contact both
an Abl and a Src tyrosine kinase. Therefore, a plurality of compounds having the same
chemical structure are used. Thus, in some embodiments, a plurality of the compound is
contacted with a cell or vessel containing the Abl and Src tyrosine kinases. Once contacted
by the compound, the AbI and Src tyrosine kinase activities are reduced.
[01311     In another aspect, a method of reducing the activity of a T3151 Bcr-Abl kinase is
provided. The method includes contacting the T3151 Ber-Abl Kinase with an effective
amount of a compound having Fonnula I, II, III, IV or V. In some embodiments, the
compound had the Fonnula I, II or IV. In another embodiment, the compound had the
Fornula I.
[0132]     In some related embodiments, the compound may also be capable of reducing the
activity of a Src kinase. Thus, the method may further include contacting a Src tyrosine
kinase with the compound thereby reducing the activity of the Src tyrosine kinase. As
explained above, where the method further includes contacting a Src tyrosine kinase with the
compound, it is understood that more than one compound is typically required to contact both
a T315I Bcr-Abl kinase and a Src tyrosine kinase. Therefore, a plurality of compounds
having the same chemical structure are used. Thus, in some embodiments, a plurality of the

 compound is contacted with a cell or vessel containing the T3151 Bcr-Abl kinase and Src
tyrosine kinases. Once contacted by the compound, the T3151 Bcr-Abl kinase and Src
tyrosine kinase activities are reduced.
Methods of Treatment
 [01331    In another aspect, a method of treating a disease mediated by a T3151 Bcr-Abl
kinase in a subject in need thereof is provided. The method includes administering to a
subject an effective amount of a compound of Formula I, II, III, IV or V. In some
embodiments, the compound is the compound of Formula I, II or IV. The disease mediated
by a T3151 Bcr-Abl kinase may be hypereosinophilic syndrome, dermatofibrosarcoma
protuberans, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The
compound may also be co-administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.
 [0134]    In another aspect, a method is provided for treating liver cancer, colon cancer,
breast cancer, melanoma, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, non
small-cell lung cancer, a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, Philadelphia chromosome-positive
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma,
hypereosinophilic syndrome, or dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. The method includes
administering an effective amount of the compound of Formula I, II, III, IV or V to a subject
in need thereof. In some embodiments, the compound is of Formula I, II or IV. The
compound may also be co-administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.
[01351     Thus, the present invention provides methods of reducing Src (e.g. c-Src) and or
Abl (e.g. Bcr-Abl or T3151 Bcr-Abl) kinase activity in a cell. The method includes
contacting the cell with a fused ring heteroaryl inhibitor described above (e.g. a compound of
Formula I, II, III, IV or V). The cell may be isolated or form part of an organ or organism.
[0136]     The inhibitors provided herein find therapeutic utility via reduction of Src (e.g. c
Src) and or AbI (e.g. Bcr-Abl or T3151 Bcr-Abl) kinase activity in the treatment of diseases
or conditions. The inhibitor may have an ICso or Ki against the Src and/or Abi kinase of less
than 10 ptM, 5 ptM, 1 [tM, 500 nM, 100 nM, 50 nM, 25 nM, 10 nM, 5 nM, 1 nM, 0.5 nM, or
0.1 nM.
[01371     In therapeutic use for the treatment of disease states recited above, the fused ring

0.1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg is more typical. The dosages, however, may be varied
depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated,
and the modulator being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular
situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller
dosages, which are less than the optimum dose of the modulator. Thereafter, the dosage is
increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached.
For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during
the day.

Examples
Example 1: Protein Expression and Purification.
 [01611     6xHIS (SEQ ID NO:7) fusions of c-Src or Abl were expressed in bacteria in the
presence of the YopH phosphatase and GroEL chaperone based on a recently developed
 strategy (Seeliger et al., 2005, Protein Sci 14:3135-3139). Briefly each kinase was purified
 in batch by Ni-NTA immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The 6X His was removed
by TEV cleavage to yield the liberated kinase domain. Following cleavage, ion exchange
 chromatography was utilized to remove excess TEV and minor contaminants. In the final
 step the proteins were applied to a gel filtration column in 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 5%
 glycerol, 2 mM DTT. Pooled fractions were concentrated and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen
                                                  52

      WO 2010/045542                                                          PCT/US2009/060985
for storage. Proteins were isolated in their unphosphorylated state as revealed by Western
blot analysis, as known in the art. Typical yields for either protein construct ranged from 1
10 mg of protein per 1 L of bacterial culture.
Example 2: In vitro Kinase Assays.
[0162]    Purified c-Src or Abl were diluted in kinase reaction buffer (10mM HEPES [pH
7.2], 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM DTT) to a concentration of approximately 10 nM and pre
incubated with lmg/mL BSA, 2.5% (v/v) DMSO, 133 [tM peptide (sequence
EAIYAAPFKKK (SEQ ID NO:8) for Abl and EIYGEFKKK (SEQ ID NO:9) for c-Src), and
varying concentrations of inhibitor. Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 100
mM cold ATP supplemented with 5 mCi 732P ATP and allowed to proceed at room
temperature (RT). At 10 minutes 1 mL of the reactions were spotted onto phosphocellulose
sheets (P81, Whatman) and subsequently soaked in wash buffer (1.0% (v/v) phosphoric acid).
The sheets were washed five times in buffer, dried, and transferred radioactivity was
measured by phosphorimaging using a Typhoon T M scanner (Molecular Dynamics).
Radioactive counts were quantified using ImageQuant TM software, and titration data were fit
to a signoidal dose response to derive IC50 values using the Prism software package. Dose
responses were based on a 12 point inhibitor titration, using 1/3 dilutions starting from 100
mM. Experiments were completed 2-4 times to derive mean values.
Example 3: Crystallization and Structure Determination.
[0163]    Prior to crystallization, purified c-Src was applied to a S200 gel filtration column.
Pooled fractions were concentrated to 3-1Omg/mL and mixed with equimolar amounts of 3 or
5 in 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris [pH 7.8], 5% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 4% DMSO. Hanging
drops containing 1 tL of complexes were mixed with equal volume of well buffer containing
4% PEG 4K, 16% glycerol, 50 mM NaAc, 100 mM MES [pH 6.5] and grown at 14C to
yield both the c-Src-3 and c-Src-5 crystals. Crystals were cryoprotected in well buffer
supplemented with 20% glycerol and flash frozen. Diffraction data were collected at -170'C.
Data processing and reduction was carried out using HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor,
1997, MacromolecularCrystallography,Pt A 276:307- 326) for the c-Src-5 complex and
XDS (Kabsch, 1993, JournalofApplied Crystallography26:795-800) for the c-Src-3
complex. Both structures were solved by molecular replacement using the X-ray
crystallographic structure of the Src kinase domain (PDB ID:1YOJ) (SEQ ID NO:12) lacking
the activation segment, helix aC, and any ligands as the search model in the program

PHASER (Mccoy et al., 2007, Journal ofApplied Crystallography40:658-674). Molecular
replacement solutions were modified and refined with alternate cycles of manual fitting and
building into 2Fo-Fel and composite omit electron density maps using Coot (Emsley and
Cowtan, 2004, Acta CrystallographicaSection D-Biological Crystallography60:2126
2132). Refinement of the structures was conducted using simulated annealing and maximum
likelihood protocols using CNS (Brunger et al., 1998, Acta CrystallographicaSection D
Biological Crystallography54:905-921)and REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997, Acta
CrystallographicaSection D-BiologicalCrystallography53:240-255). Topology and
parameter files for the inhibitors were generated using PRODRG (Schuttelkopf and van
Aalten, 2004, Acta CrystallographicaSection D-BiologicalCrystallography60:1355-1363).
Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 2 below. A representative
composite omit simulated annealing electron density (12Fo-Fel) map from the Src-5 complex
is shown in Figure 6. All structural figures were prepared with PYMOL (Delano and Lam,
2005, Abstracts ofPapersof the American Chemical Society 230:U1371-U1372). Structures
have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under ID codes 3EL7 (Src-3) (SEQ ID NO:4)

Example 26. Cell based assays: Inhibition of Bcr-Abl and T3151 Bcr-Abl.
 [0212]    The ability of AD57 to inhibit Bcr-Abl and T3151 Bcr-Abl was examined in a cell
based assay. The Bcr-Abl oncogene was transduced into BaF3 cells, rendering them
IL-3-independent."IL-3" refers to interleukin 3 which in human maps to gene locus 5q3 1.1,
as known in the art. Recombinant IL-3 is available commercially. BaF3 is a hematopoietic
cell line that is normally dependent on IL-3 for growth and proliferation. However, through
expression of activated Bcr-Abl, the cells become transformed to an IL-3 independent state.
In this assay, cell proliferation is directly correlated to the activity of Bcr-Abl. Wild-type
Bcr-Abl, T3151 Bcr-Abl, and parental BaF3 cells were treated with AD57 (Cmpd 5) at the
indicated concentrations for two days. The parental BaF3 cells, but not the Bcr-Abl
transduced cells, were grown in the presence of recombinant IL-3 during the time course of
this experiment. After the two day treatment, cell proliferation was quantified using the dye
Resazurin, which is converted into a fluorescently detectable form only when metabolized by
living cells.
 [02131    Figure 7 A-C shows that AD57 (Cmpd 5) equally inhibits the growth of Bcr-Abl
 and T315I Bcr-Abl cells. According to the crystal structure of AD57 (Cmpd 5) in complex
with Src, the ability of AD57 (Cmpd 5) to equally inhibit WT and T3151 Bcr-Abl is likely
mediated through its unique ability to recognize the DFG-out conformation of the kinase, but
 in a manner that renders the drug insensitive to mutations at the Thr315 position. Notably,
the effects of AD57 (Cmpd 5) on WT and T3151 Bcr-Abl differ with respect to Imatinib,
 which effectively inhibits Bcr-Abl, but not the T3151 mutant. This result suggests that AD57
 (Cmpd 5) will be effective in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells that are dependent of Bcr
 Abl, and will not be rendered ineffective by the emergence of drug-resistant clones, including
 the highly prevalent T3151 Bcr-Abl mutant. Cancers that have been treated by Imatinib
 include CML, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, hypereoinophilic syndrome, and Ph-positive
 acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Resistance to Imatinib in these cancers has been linked to
 mutations at the position that is analogous T3151, including T6701 in c-Kit (SEQ ID NO:3)
 and T6741 in PDGFR (SEQ ID NO:10). Since AD57 (Cmpd 5) inhibits T3151 Bcr-Abl, it is
                                                   79

plausible that the inhibitor will be effective against Ber-Abl, c-Kit, PDGFR, and their
Imatinib-resistant forms in these cancers.
[02141     It is possible to inhibit the growth of BaF3 cells transduced with Bcr-Abl through
non-specific inhibition mediated toxicity. Therefore, the effects of the inhibitors on the
growth of parental BaF3 cells have also been measured. AD57 (Cmpd 5) preferentially
inhibits Bcr-Abl transformed BaF3 cells, but not parental BaF3 cells (especially comparing
the growth of cells at 1 mM inhibitor). This suggests that the primary target of AD57
(Cmpd 5) in the BaF3-Bcr-Abl cells is indeed Bcr-Abl. This result also suggests that the
effects of AD57 (Cmpd 5) on Bcr-Abl transduced BaF3 cells is not mediated through a
generally toxic mechanism.
Example 27. Developing a DFG-out binder for e-Src.
[02151     An approach pioneered by Liu, Gray, and co-workers was applied, whereby type II
(DFG-out) kinase inhibitors can be created by fusing a so-called hinge binding element of a
type-I kinase inhibitor to an element capable of binding in the pocket created by the
characteristic DFG movement in type II inhibitor bound structures (Liu and Gray, 2006, Id.;
Okram et al., 2006, Id..) The hinge-binding element from the well-characterized
pyrazolopyrimidine PP 1 was chosen for that purpose, because it has been examined at both
the structural and functional level and was first identified as a selective c-Src family tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (Hanke et al., 1996, JBiol Chem 271:695-701; Liu et al., 1999, Chem Biol
6:671-678; Schindler et al., 1999, Mol Cell 3:639-648). In order to select the DFG-out
binding element for the design, the co-crystal structures of Abl, Raf and p38 were examined
in complex with Imatinib, BAY43-9006, and BIRB796, respectively; three chemically
distinct type II inhibitors with three different kinase targets (Pargellis et al., 2002, Id.;
Schindler et al., 2000, Id.; Wan et al., 2004, Id.). Each inhibitor follows nearly the identical
path within the active site pocket, despite their chemical uniqueness (Figure 5). A key
feature of the observed binding modes is the interaction with a portion of the activation
segment termed the DFG motif and a highly conserved glutamic acid residue within helix
 cCC, which are mediated through the amide/urea linker and hydrophobic portions of the
inhibitors. Movement of the Asp residue out and the Phe residue in (hence 'DFG-out') by a
flip of approximately 180 degrees relative to their position in the active state creates the
cavity that is filled by these inhibitors. The extended portions of each inhibitor are
remarkably similar, and their interactions with the kinase are mediated through highly
                                                  80

      WO 2010/045542                                                            PCT/US2009/060985
conserved residues within the ATP pocket, suggesting that the general inhibitor features
could be applied to other kinases.
[0216]     It was hypothesized that derivatization on the phenyl ring in PPl with a
m-trifluoromethyl phenylurea group would create an inhibitor that could engage the DFG-out
pocket. The pyrazolopyrimidine core of PP1 occupies the portion of the active site within
which the adenosine ring of ATP normally sits, forming key hydrogen bonds with the
backbone of the kinase hinge region (Figure IB). A panel of molecules were synthesized
searching for an inhibitor with tight (nM) binding affinity for c-Src.
[02171     The modelling suggested that addition of a methylene group between the
pyrazolopyrimidine core and the phenyl ring would provide flexibility in guiding the m
trifluoromethyl phenyl urea substitution into the DFG pocket. Therefore, compounds 1-4
were synthesized, in which the phenyl group of PP1 has been replaced with a benzyl
functionality and the NI position of the pyrazole ring has been varied with different alkyl
groups (Figure 2 middle). Cmpd 5 was created to provide a direct link between the
pyrazolopyrimidine core and the derivatized phenyl (Figure 2 bottom). Each molecule was
prepared based on previously established routes for generating pyrazolopyrimidines (Bishop
et al., 1999, Id.; Bishop et al., 1998, Id.; Blethrow et al., 2004, Id.) with the exception that the
urea linker was appended through inclusion of a nitro group in the starting material, which in
the final synthetic steps was reduced and coupled to m-trifluoromethyl phenyl isocyanate to
generate the type II analogues.
Example 28. Inhibition of Src and Abl in vitro.
 [02181    To ascertain the potency of the designed compounds, their ability to inhibit kinase
domain fragments of c-Src and Abl that were expressed and purified identically from bacteria
in their unphosphorylated forms was examined. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations
(IC50 ) was measured utilizing an in vitro assay in which the kinase catalyses phosphorylation
of a synthetic peptide substrate in the presence of 100 mM ATP and varying amounts of
inhibitor (Figure 2). From this analysis, the IC 50 values for Imatinib were 24,370 and 11 nM
for c-Src and Abl, respectively. These values are in close agreement to published values and
highlight the inherent selectivity of Imatinib for Abl with respect to c-Src (Seeliger et al.,
2007, Id.).
 [02191     Cmpd 1 was found to inhibit c-Src with an ICso of approximately 6.2 pIM, whereas a
 control compound in which the urea linker was placed at the para position of the benzyl ring
                                                  81

      WO 2010/045542                                                           PCT/US2009/060985
lacked any detectable inhibitory activity (data not shown). In measuring the IC50 values for
1-4, an interesting correlation between the size of the alkyl group substitutions and selectivity
for c-Src and Abl was observed (Figure 2). The methyl derivative 1 was the weakest
inhibitor against both c-Src and Abl, followed by the isopropyl 2 and t-butyl 3 compounds
which gained moderate potency, with the optimal derivative appearing to be the cyclopentyl
substitution 4, with an IC 50 of 480 nM for c-Src (Figure 2). Curiously, while most
compounds in this set equally inhibited both c-Src and Abl, the cyclopentyl derivative
showed a reproducible selectivity towards c-Src over Abi of approximately 5 fold. Although
small, this modest degree of selectivity appeared significant in comparison to the yet smaller
IC50 value differences between c-Src and Abl for compounds 1, 2, and 4. Cmpd 5 was the
most potent inhibitor that we identified, with IC50 values of 25 and 41 nM for c-Src and Abl,
respectively (Figure2). Interestingly, the potency of 5 approaches that of Imatinib for Abl,
but without any significant discrimination against c-Src. In this test of compounds two
interesting features were identified: Cmpd 3 with unexpected selectivity for c-Src, and
Cmpd 5 with extremely high potency for both c-Src and Abl. In order to investigate whether
the designed mode of binding was achieved co-crystal structures of c-Src bound to inhibitors
3 and 5 were determined.
Example 29. Binding Mode Revealed by Co-crystallography.
 [0220]   Purified c-Src kinase domain in complex with 3 and 5 yielded crystals that
diffracted to 2.8 and 2.3 Angstrom, respectively. Both structures were determined by
molecular replacement, finding a single copy of c-Src within the asymmetric unit of the P2 1
crystal form for the c-Src-3 complex and two copies of c-Src in the P1 crystal form of the c
Src-5 complex. Interestingly, only one kinase molecule within the c-Src-5 complex appeared
to contain inhibitor. This feature was observed previously in the co-crystal structure of c-Src
with Imatinib, where only one kinase within the asymmetric unit was found to be in a drug
complex despite molar equivalents of the protein and inhibitor at a concentration well above
their binding constant (Seeliger et al., 2007, Id.). The structures of c-Src in complex with 3
and 5 are shown in Figure 3, with corresponding magnification of the active site.
 [02211   As shown, the pyrazolopyrimidine core for both inhibitors lie deep within the
adenosine pocket that is lined by the hinge region of the kinase. In comparison to PP 1, the
plane of the pyrazolopyrimidine rings of both 3 and 5 deviate slightly with respect to each
other. As a result of the altered geometry, both 3 and 5 only form a single hydrogen bond to
                                                 82

      WO 2010/045542                                                           PCT/US2009/060985
the main chain carbonyl of Glu339. Cmpd 3 is shifted away from the side chain hydroxyl of
the Thr338 gatekeeper, and as a result does not form the hydrogen bond seen in PP1 or in 5
with this residue. Both the benzyl group of 3 and the phenyl group in 5 lie juxtaposed to the
gatekeeper; both of which are twisted out of plane relative to the pyrazolopyrimidine ring. In
both 3 and 5, the urea extension forms the designed hydrogen bond with the side chain of
Glu3 10 within helix aC, while the m-trifluoromethyl phenyl portion of both compounds lie
within a pocket lined by residues Leu317, Leu322, Val402, Met314, His384. As a result of
occupying this space, Asp404 and Phe405 are flipped near 180 degrees relative to their active
state positions. In the c-Src-5 complex, the side chain carbonyl of Asp404 forms a hydrogen
bond to the main chain amide of Gly406 (Figure 3B). The precise configuration has not been
observed in crystal structures of DFG-out kinases, but has been hypothesized to occur during
the DFG flip as revealed in molecular dynamic simulations (Levinson et al., 2006, Id.).
Interestingly, the configuration of the aspartic acid side chain through to the glycine amide is
strikingly similar to the structure of a beta bend (Fersht, 1999, Structure and Mechanism in
ProteinScience: a guide to enzyme catalysis and proteinfolding, New York: W.H. Freeman
and Co.) In a classic beta bend, a nine atom turn along the main chain separates a carbonyl
acceptor from an amide donor, and often contains a -CH2- glycine between the donor
acceptor pairs. Here the side chain of Asp404 appears to supply both the carbonyl acceptor
and intervening -CH2- group. In both structures of c-Src described here, the configuration of
the DFG triad and the position of Glu3 10 of helix aC adopt conformations that deviate from
what was previously observed in either apo c-Src or the PP 1-bound form of the closely
related enzyme HCK (Schindler et al., 1999, Id.; Xu et al., 1997, Nature 385:595-602).
Rather 3 and 5 recognize the DFG-out configuration of c-Src that is similarly engaged by
Imatinib.
 [02221   In their hybrid design approach, the set of type II inhibitors that were successfully
developed for Abl by Liu, Gray, and co-workers started from four different type I scaffolds
(Okrarn et al., 2006, Id.). It is noteworthy to mention that each of the designed inhibitors was
tested against a panel of protein kinases including c-Src. Interestingly, each type II variant
 exhibited decreased affinity for c-Src relative to the starting scaffolds, whereas they gained
potency and selectivity for Abl. While these experiments suggested that a hybrid design
 approach is feasible, it also hinted at the restricted effectiveness of new type II inhibitors
towards certain kinases.

      WO 2010/045542                                                           PCT/US2009/060985
[0223]     One of the more significant differences between the c-Src complexes and the Abl
Imatinib structure is in the path of the P-loop (Figure 4A); the region defined by the
"GXGXXG motif' of kinases within the bl-b2 linker and that forms the top shelf of the ATP
pocket. Notably, in the Abl-Imatinib complex, the P-loop tightly encloses the drug binding
site in large part through residue Tyr253, which folds back onto the lip of the pyrimidine
core. In the c-Src-Imatinib complex, the region occupied by Tyr253 of Abl is left
unoccupied, whereas in the c-Src-3 complex, the cyclopentyl group of the inhibitor itself fills
this space. Since the overall binding conformation of compounds 1-4 are less sensitive to the
influence of substitutions at the R- 1 position on the pyrazole ring this series of inhibitors
could be a reliable measure of engaging the Tyr253 pocket through varying steric bulk of the
inhibitor. Indeed, the structure and activity of compounds 1-4 could be explained based on
the potential role of the Tyr253 region as an affinity pocket, since there is a distinct structure
activity relationship when this substituent is varied.
[0224]     Interestingly, one other distinguishing feature between the 3-, 5-, and Imatinib
complexes with c-Src is in the approach of these inhibitors towards the gatekeeper pocket
(Figure 4B). Notably, the benzyl group of 3 and the phenyl ring of 5 are rotated away from
Thr338 relative to o-methyl-phenylamino portion of Imatinib in a rank order that reflects the
relative affinity of the drugs for c-Src. This extra distance from the gatekeeper Thr suggests
compounds 1-5 may bind to mutant kinases such as the clinically relevant Imatinib resistant
Abl Thr3l5Ile kinase (Shah et al., 2002, Cancer Cell 2:117-125). It can be concluded that
the relative energy differences between favoured and disfavoured conformational states of
particular kinases can be overcome by small molecules.
