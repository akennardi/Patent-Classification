                    CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]     This application is related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/235,068, filed
September 30, 2015 and titled "Proximity Detection for an Input Mechanism of an Electronic
Device", U.S. Patent Application No. 14/936,421, filed on 9 November 2015, and Australian
Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, filed on 15 August 2016, the disclosures of which are
hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
                                                FIELD
[0002]     The described embodiments relate generally to proximity sensing. More particularly,
the described embodiments are directed to determining proximity of an object to an input
mechanism of a wearable electronic device.
                                          BACKGROUND
[0003]     Many electronic devices include one or more input devices for receiving input from a
user and one or more output devices for providing output to the user. These input devices may
include keyboards, mice, trackpads, buttons, knobs, microphones, and so on. Example output
devices include display screens, speakers, haptic devices, and so on.
 [0004]    As input is received on the input device, the output provided on the output device may
change. However, it may be difficult to determine when the input device is intentionally actuated
 such as, for example, by a finger of a user, or whether the input device is inadvertently actuated.
                                             SUMMARY
[0005]     Disclosed are various implementations for determining whether an object, such as a
user's finger, is in proximity to, and/or in contact with, an input mechanism for an electronic
device. When the object is in proximity to or contacting the input mechanism, a state of the input
mechanism, and/or the electronic device, may change. For example the state of the input
mechanism or the electronic device may change from an inactive state to an active state.

[0006]      Accordingly, disclosed herein is an electronic device that incorporates a proximity
sensor to detect when an object is in proximity to an input mechanism. More specifically, the
electronic device may be a wearable electronic device. The wearable electronic may include a
rotatable crown that is used to provide input for the wearable electronic device. The rotatable
crown may be electrically isolated from a housing of the wearable electronic device. The
wearable electronic device may also include a proximity sensing component that is operative to
determine when an object is in proximity to, or in contact with, the rotatable crown.
[0007]      Also disclosed is a wearable electronic device having a proximity sensor operative to
determine when an object is in proximity to at least a portion of the electronic device. The
electronic device includes an input mechanism that acts as a first component of the proximity
sensor and a housing that acts as a second component of the proximity sensor. The housing is
electrically isolated from the input mechanism.
[0008]      The present disclosure also describes a method for determining the proximity of an
object to an input mechanism of a wearable electronic device. This method includes causing the
input mechanism of the wearable electronic device to act as a first component of a proximity
sensor and causing a housing of the wearable electronic device to be electrically isolated from
the input mechanism and to act as a second component of the proximity sensor. The proximity
sensor then measures a change in an electrical signal between the input mechanism and the
housing.

                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0023]      Reference will now be made in detail to representative embodiments illustrated in the
accompanying drawings. It should be understood that the following descriptions are not intended
to limit the embodiments to one preferred embodiment. To the contrary, it is intended to cover
alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as can be included within the spirit and scope of the
described embodiments as defined by the appended claims.
                                               -3 -

1002138879
[0024]     The embodiments described herein are directed to determining whether an object is in
proximity to, or is in contact with, an input mechanism of an electronic device. More
specifically, the described embodiments are directed to a wearable electronic device that
incorporates a proximity sensor to determine whether an object, such as a user's finger, is in
proximity to or is in contact with the input mechanism.
[0025]     In one implementation, the proximity sensor is a resistive sensor operative to detect a
change in resistance between two components of the electronic device. In another
implementation, the proximity sensor is a capacitive sensor operative to detect a change in
capacitance as an object approaches or contacts the electronic device. In each of these
implementations, a first component of the electronic device may act as a first component of the
proximity sensor and a second component of the electronic device may act as a second
component of the proximity sensor.
[0026]     For example, an input mechanism of the electronic device may act as the first
component of the proximity sensor and the housing of the electronic device may act as the
second component of the proximity sensor. Thus, when an object, such as a user's finger,
approaches or contacts the input mechanism, the proximity sensor detects a change in an electric
signal between the input mechanism and the housing thereby signaling proximity and/or contact.
[0027]     In other embodiments described herein, proximity is detected by an optical sensor. For
example, an optical sensor is positioned within the housing of the electronic device and
determines, based on a sensed amount of light, when an object is approaching and/or contacting
the input mechanism.
[0028]     In still yet other embodiments, the electronic device incorporates one or more
movement sensors, such as, for example, an accelerometer, a gyroscope and the like. These
movement sensors detect when the electronic device moves in given direction. More specifically,
the movement sensors detect when the electronic device moves in a particular direction in
response to a user contacting the input mechanism of the electronic device. The electronic device
may also include one or more force sensors that detect whether an object is contacting the input
mechanism.
                                             -4-

1002138879
[0029]      These and other embodiments are discussed below with reference to FIGs. 1-9.
However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein
with respect to these Figures is for explanatory purposes only and should not be construed as
limiting.
[0030]      FIG. 1 illustrates an example electronic device 100 that incorporates a proximity
sensor. The electronic device 100 may include a housing 110, a display 120 a first input
mechanism 130 and a second input mechanism 140. The first input mechanism 130 may be a
rotatable crown. The second input mechanism 140 may be a button. Although a rotatable crown
and a button are mentioned, each of the first input mechanism 130 and the second input
mechanism 140 may be any type of input mechanism that provides input to the electronic device
100.
[0031]      As will be described below, the electronic device 100 may include one or more
proximity sensors operable to detect contact with or proximity to the first input mechanism 130,
the second input mechanism 140, the display 120 and/or the housing 110. More specifically, the
proximity sensor is operative to detect whether a user's finger (or other object) is in contact with
the first input mechanism 130 and/or whether the user's finger is in proximity to the first input
mechanism 130.
[0032]      In some embodiments, proximity to, or contact with, the first input mechanism 130
may alter an operating state of the electronic device 100. In another embodiment, proximity to,
or contact with, the first input mechanism 130 may alter an operating state of the first input
mechanism 130.
[0033]      For example, a user may operate the first input mechanism 130 to alter a graphical
user interface that is output on the display 120 of the electronic device 100. More specifically, a
displayed element on the graphical user interface may be alterable by manipulation of the first
input mechanism 130. As such, the displayed element may be changed using different
manipulations of the first input mechanism 130. These manipulations may include pressing
inward on the first input mechanism 130, rotating the first input mechanism 130 in a first
direction, rotating the first input mechanism 130 in a second direction and so on.
                                             -5 -

1002138879
[0034]      However, in order to prevent inadvertent actuation of the first input mechanism 130
(or the second input mechanism 140), the graphical user interface may not be alterable and/or
displayed unless the user's finger is in proximity to or in contact with the first input mechanism
 130. In another example, the graphical user interface may not be presented until the user's finger
is in contact with or in proximity to the first input mechanism 130. Continuing with the example,
the display 120, and more specifically the electronic device 100, may be in a sleep state or other
low power state. The display 120 and/or the electronic device 100 may change from a low power
state to an active state (e.g., show the graphical user interface) when contact or proximity is
detected.
[0035]      In another example embodiment, an operating state of the first input mechanism 130
may also be altered or changed based on contact or proximity to a user's finger or other object.
For example, if proximity or contact is not detected, rotation or actuation of the first input
mechanism 130 will not register a change on the graphical user interface. Thus, if the first input
mechanism 130 was inadvertently actuated, the electronic device 100 will not power up, register
the received input and/or change the user interface.
[0036]      In another example, the operating state of the first input mechanism 130 will not
change so long as proximity or contact is detected. Thus, as long as proximity or contact with the
first input mechanism 130 is detected, the first input mechanism 130, and more specifically the
electronic device 100, is ready to register received input.
[0037]      For example, if a user ceases to actuate the first input mechanism 130 for a period of
time, but keeps her finger in proximity to or in contact with the first input mechanism 130, the
state of the first input mechanism 130 and/or the electronic device 100 will not change (e.g., the
electronic device 100 will not enter a low power or sleep state). However, once contact or
proximity is no longer detected (or in embodiments when a change in an electrical signal falls
below a change threshold such as will be described below) the state of the first input mechanism
130 and/or the electronic device 100 may change. For example, the electronic device 100 may
enter a low power state or a sleep state.
                                              -6-

1002138879
[0038]      Although a finger is specifically mentioned in the examples above, the present
disclosure is not so limited. The proximity sensors described herein may be able to detect contact
or proximity of other objects including, for example, a stylus or other such input device.
[0039]      Although the electronic device 100 is illustrated and described as a wearable electronic
device, it is understood that this is an example. In various implementations, the electronic device
100 may be a laptop computing device, a desktop computing device, a fitness monitor, a digital
media player, a cellular telephone, a smart phone, a display, a printer, a mobile computing
device, a tablet computing device, and/or any other electronic device without departing from the
scope of the present disclosure.
[0040]      FIGs. 2A-6 illustrate various cross-section views taken along line A-A of the example
electronic device 100 shown and described above with respect to FIG. 1. Although different
reference numbers may be used to reference similar components in the description below, like
components in these figures may be configured to operate in a similar manner.
[0041]      FIG. 2A illustrates various components of an electronic device 200 arranged in a first
configuration. The electronic device 200 may include an input mechanism 210 such as, for
example, a rotatable crown. The input mechanism 210 may be moveable with respect to a
housing 220. In some embodiments, a portion of the input mechanism 210 (e.g., a shaft of the
input mechanism 210) extends through the housing 220.
[0042]      The electronic device 200 also includes a display 230. The display 230 may be used as
both an input device and an output device. For example, the display may include one or more
touch sensors that determine a location of a user's touch on a surface of the display 230. The
display 230 may also include or otherwise be associated with one or more force sensors 260
operative to determine an amount of force provided on the display 230.
[0043]      The electronic device 200 may also include at least one proximity sensor 240 such as
shown in FIG. 2B. The proximity sensor 240 is operative to determine whether an object, such as
a user's finger, is in proximity to or is in contact with the input mechanism 210.
[0044]      In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2B, the proximity sensor 240 is a resistive sensor
that detects a change in an electric signal between two components of the electronic device 200.
                                               -7-

1002138879
More specifically, the proximity sensor 240 is comprised of a resistance monitor 280 that is
electrically coupled to the input mechanism 210 and the housing 220.
[0045]      For example, one or more electrical contacts may be positioned in and/or on the input
mechanism 210. The electrical contacts extend through the shaft of the input mechanism 210 and
are connected to the resistance monitor 280. The resistance monitor 280 is also electrically
coupled to the housing 220. As such, the input mechanism 210 acts as a first component of the
proximity sensor 240 and the housing 220 acts as a second component of the proximity sensor
240.
[0046]      In some embodiments, the input mechanism 210 and the housing 220 are made from
metal, gold, aluminum, titanium or other such materials. In addition and as shown in FIG. 2A,
the input mechanism 210, or a portion of the input mechanism 210, may extend through the
housing 220. As such, and in order for the input mechanism 210 and the housing 220 to act as
components of the proximity sensor 240, the input mechanism 210 and the housing 220 may be
electrically isolated from one another. Accordingly, the electronic device 200 may also include
an insert 250 that electrically isolates the two components.
[0047]      The inserts 250 may be ceramic, rubber, plastic or other such suitable material. The
inserts 250 may be coupled to a portion of the housing 220 such as shown in FIG. 2A. The
inserts 250 may be integrated with or formed in the housing 220. In addition, the inserts 250 may
extend from an inner portion of the housing 220 to an outer surface of the housing 220. For
example, the inserts 250 may extend from the inner portion of the housing 220 to a bottom
surface of the housing 220 that contacts a user's arm and to a top surface of the housing 220 near
the display 230.
[0048]      As discussed above, the inserts 250 electrically isolate the components of the
electronic device 200. Therefore, even if contaminants (e.g., sweat, water, or other contaminants)
enter a gap that exists between the input mechanism 210 and the housing 220, the inserts 250
prevent these contaminants from shorting the path between the housing 220 and the input
mechanism 210.
[0049]      When the input mechanism 210 and the housing 220 act as components of the
proximity sensor 240 and are electrically isolated from one another, the proximity sensor 240,
                                              -8-

1002138879
and more specifically the resistance monitor 280, can more accurately determine proximity or
contact with the input mechanism 210 and/or the housing 220.
[0050]     For example, a user's finger or other object may act as a resistor 270 and close a path
between the input mechanism 210 and the housing 220. More specifically, as the resistor 270
approaches or contacts the input mechanism 210, the resistance monitor 280 of the proximity
sensor 240 detects a change in resistance between the input mechanism 210 and the housing 220.
Proximity or contact may then be determined based on the detected change.
[0051]     In some embodiments, the proximity sensor 240 will not register proximity or contact
until the detected change in resistance meets or exceeds a resistance change threshold. Further,
the proximity sensor 240 may not register proximity or contact until the detected change in
resistance meets or exceeds the resistance change threshold over a given time threshold. Using
these thresholds, the proximity sensor 240 may be able to better distinguish between deliberate
proximity and/or deliberate contact with the input mechanism 210 versus inadvertent proximity
and/or inadvertent contact with the input mechanism 210.
[0052]     When the proximity sensor 240 registers proximity or contact, an operating state of the
electronic device 200 may change. In another embodiment, detected proximity or contact with
the input mechanism 210 may change an operating state of the input mechanism 210.
[0053]     For example, if the electronic device 200 is in a sleep state and proximity or contact is
detected, the electronic device 200 may transition from the sleep state to an active state. In
another example, the electronic device 200 may be in an active state while the input mechanism
210 is in an inactive state (e.g., actuation of the input mechanism 210 does not register a change
on a user interface). Once proximity or contact is detected, the state of the input mechanism 210
may change.
[0054]     In another example, a state of the electronic device 200 and/or the input mechanism
210 may not change while proximity and/or contact is detected. For example, if the electronic
device 200 is an active state and proximity or contact is detected, the electronic device 200 will
remain in the active state. Likewise, if input mechanism 210 is in an active state and proximity or
contact is detected, the input mechanism 210 will remain in the active state. The electronic
device 200 and/or the input mechanism 210 will not change state until proximity or contact is no
                                              -9-

1002138879
longer detected (e.g., when the change in electric signal no longer exceeds the resistance change
threshold).
[0055]     As discussed above, the electronic device 200 may also include or otherwise
incorporate one or more force sensors 260. The force sensors 260 may also be used to determine
proximity and/or contact with the input mechanism 210 and/or the housing 220.
[0056]     For example, as a user's finger or other object contacts the input mechanism 210
and/or the housing 220, the force sensor 260 may also be actuated such as, for example, by a
periphery of the object or the finger. Although the actuation of the force sensor 260 may be
inadvertent as the user is intending to actuate the input mechanism 210, the sensed amount of
force may be used to determine that an object is contacting the input mechanism 210.
[0057]     FIG. 2C illustrates a cross-section view of the example electronic device of FIG. 1
taken along line A-A in which the input mechanism 210 has been actuated. The input mechanism
210 may be actuated in an inward direction (e.g., in a direction toward the housing 220). As the
input mechanism 210 moves toward the housing 220, the proximity sensor 240 may detect a
change in resistance that indicates that the input mechanism 210 has been inwardly actuated.
[0058]     FIG. 3A illustrates a cross-section view of a second configuration of components in an
example electronic device 300. The cross-section shown in FIG. 3 may be taken along line A-A
of FIG. 1.
[0059]     In this example embodiment, the electronic device 300 may include an input
mechanism 310, a housing 320 and a display 330. Each of these components may operate in
similar manner as described above. For example, the input mechanism 310 may be a rotatable
crown that extends, at least partially, into the housing 320. Actuation of the input mechanism 310
may alter output that is provided on the display 330.
[0060]     As shown in FIG. 3B, the electronic device 300 may also include a proximity sensor
340. However, in this embodiment, the proximity sensor 340 is a capacitive sensor. More
specifically, the proximity sensor 340 includes a capacitance monitor 380 that is operative to
detect a change in capacitance between the input mechanism 310 and the housing 320.
[0061]     In this implementation, the capacitance monitor 380 may be electrically coupled to the
input mechanism 310 and the housing 320. More specifically, the proximity sensor 340 may be
                                              - 10 -

1002138879
coupled to the input mechanism 310 such that the input mechanism 310 acts as an electrode of
the proximity sensor 340.
[0062]     For example, an inner portion of the input mechanism 310 and/or the outer portion of
the input mechanism may be conductive or made from a conductive material. As an object
approaches and/or contacts the input mechanism 310, the capacitance monitor 380 detects a
change in capacitance. In some embodiments, the measured change in capacitance may be self
capacitance or mutual capacitance.
[0063]     In another embodiment, the housing 320 may act as the electrode of the proximity
sensor 340. In yet other embodiments, both the input mechanism 310 and the housing 320 may
act as electrodes. In these embodiments, the housing 320 and/or the input mechanism 310 are
used to determine a change in capacitance such as described above.
[0064]     In response to the detected change in capacitance, an operating state of the electronic
device 300 and/or the input mechanism 310 may change such as described above. For example,
when the change in capacitance exceeds a capacitance change threshold, the state of the
electronic device 300 and/or the input mechanism 310 may change.
[0065]     Like the embodiment shown and described with respect to FIG. 2A, the embodiment
of FIG. 3A also includes one or more inserts 350. The inserts 350 provide electric isolation
between the input mechanism 310 and the housing 320. The inserts 350 may extend from the
inner portion of the housing 320 to the outer portion of the housing 320 such as described above.
[0066]     In another implementation, the inserts 350 and/or the housing 320 may act as both an
isolation component and a conductive component. For example, the inserts 350 may isolate the
input mechanism 310 from the housing 320. However, contact or proximity to the input
mechanism 310 modulates the housing 320 thereby eliminating any parasitic capacitance
between the housing 320 and the input mechanism 310. This helps prevent a change in
capacitance when liquid or other contaminants enter a gap or a space that may be present
between the input mechanism 310 and the housing 320. In embodiments in which the electronic
device 300 is a wearable electronic device, this configuration may prevent a change in
capacitance when the wearable electronic device is worn on a wrist of a user or when the user's
wrist inadvertently contacts the input mechanism 310.

[0067]     The electronic device 300 may also include a force sensor 360. The force sensor 360
may include one or more capacitive elements that cause a change in capacitance as the two
elements approach each other (e.g., in response to an applied force). In addition to determining
an the amount of received force, these capacitive elements may be used, either separately or in
combination with the proximity sensor 340, to detect a change in capacitance as an object
approaches or contacts the housing 320 or the input mechanism 310.
[0068]     For example, one or more capacitive elements of the force sensor 360 may be
capacitively coupled with the input mechanism 310. As a finger or other object approaches or
contacts the input mechanism 310, the force sensor 360 and/or the proximity sensor 340 may
detect the resulting change in capacitance. Thus a determination may be made that an object is
proximate to, or is in contact with, the input mechanism 310.
[0069]     In certain embodiments, the proximity sensor 340 may also determine a chance in
capacitance as the input mechanism 310 moves in an inward direction such as described above
with respect to FIG. 2C. For example, as the input mechanism 310 moves toward the housing
320 in response to being actuated, the proximity sensor 340 may detect a change in capacitance
caused by the components being moved closer together thereby signaling actuation of the input
mechanism.
[0070]     FIG. 4 illustrates a cross-section view of a third configuration of components in an
example electronic device 400. The cross-section shown in FIG. 4 may be taken along line A-A
of FIG. 1.
[0071]     In this example embodiment, the electronic device 400 may include an input
mechanism 410, a housing 420 and a display 430. Each of these components may operate in
similar manner as described above. The electronic device 400 also includes a display stack 440.
The display stack 440 may include one or more touch sensors to determine a location of input
received on the display 430.
[0072]     More specifically, the display stack 440 may include one or more capacitive elements
that detect a location of the user's finger on the display 430. However, one or more of the
capacitive elements disposed on an edge of the display stack 440 (e.g., an edge closest to the
input mechanism 410) may be boosted in order to detect proximity and/or contact of an object to
the input mechanism 410. For example, the edge pixels of the display stack may be operative to
                                             - 12 -

the input mechanism 410.
[0073]     FIG. 5 illustrates a cross-section view of a fourth configuration of components in an
example electronic device 500. The cross-section shown in FIG. 5 may be taken along line A-A
of FIG. 1.
[0074]     In this example embodiment, the electronic device 500 may include an input
mechanism 510, a housing 520 and a display 530. Each of these components may operate in
similar manner as described above.
[0075]     The proximity sensor in this particular implementation is an optical sensor 540. The
optical sensor 540 may include a light source and an optical window or lens. The optical sensor
540 may be positioned in a cavity 550 formed around an inner perimeter of the display 530. In
one particular embodiment, the optical sensor 540 may be positioned underneath the display 530
in the cavity 570 such as shown and oriented toward a surface of the display 530 and toward the
input mechanism 510.
[0076]     The light source of the optical sensor 540 may be an LED, an infrared light such as,
for example an infrared LED, a laser diode, a light bulb and any other such light source. The
light from the light source is transmitted though the (optional) optical window and through the
display 530. When an object, such as a user's finger, contacts or is in proximity to the input
mechanism 510, the optical sensor 540 detects an amount of light reflected by the user's finger
and, as a result, determines proximity or contact. In another implementation, the optical sensor
may be operative to sense an amount of ambient light received through the display 530. When an
amount of detected light changes (e.g., when a user's finger blocks light from being received by
the optical sensor as the finger moves toward the input mechanism 510), a determination may be
made that an object is in proximity to or contact with the input mechanism 510. When proximity
is detected, an operating state of the electronic device 500 and/or the input mechanism 510 may
change such as described above.
[0077]     In some embodiments, the optical sensor 540 may also be able to determine whether
the input mechanism 510 is actuated, either by being rotated or by moving in an inward direction
such as described above with respect to FIG. 2C. For example, the input mechanism 510 may
                                              - 13 -

include one or more patterns, ridges, scallops or other such surface features on an inner side. As
the input mechanism 510 rotates or is moved inwardly, the light that is reflected off of the
surface pattern may change thereby signaling actuation of the input mechanism 510.
[0078]      FIG. 6 illustrates a cross-section view of a fifth configuration of components in an
example electronic device 600. The cross-section shown in FIG. 6 may be taken along line A-A
of FIG. 1.
[0079]     In this example embodiment, the electronic device 600 may include an input
mechanism 610, a housing 620 and a display 630. Each of these components may operate in
similar manner as described above. The electronic device 600 may also include a proximity
sensor 640 disposed in a channel 650 of the display 630.
[0080]     The proximity sensor 640 may be a capacitive sensor operative to detect a change in
capacitance as an object, such as a user's finger, approaches and/or contacts the input mechanism
610. In this particular embodiment, the proximity sensor 640 may be comprised of a flexible
substrate having one or more capacitive sensing components arranged thereon. The flexible
substrate is oriented to face the input mechanism 610 (e.g., has a field a view that encompasses at
least a portion of the input mechanism 610) in order to better sense a change in capacitance as
the user's finger approaches or otherwise contacts the input mechanism 610.
[0081]     In some embodiments, the proximity sensor 640 may work in conjunction with the
capacitive sensors in a display stack, such as, for example, display stack 440 shown and
described above with respect to FIG. 4. More specifically, the change in capacitance sensed by
the proximity sensor 640 may be combined with a change in capacitance sensed by the display
stack in order to determine a location of an object in three-dimensional space. For example, if a
change in capacitance detected by the proximity sensor 640 and the change in capacitance
detected by the display stack exceed a threshold, a determination may be made that an object
may be near or contacting the input mechanism 610 as well as a current location of the object
with respect to the input mechanism 610 or a direction the object is approaching from. However,
if the change in capacitance detected by one or both of these components does not exceed a
threshold, the change in capacitance may be rejected.

1002138879
[0082]     In another embodiment, the proximity sensor 640 may be an extension from the
display stack. For example a substrate, plate or other material may extend from the display stack
and be coupled to the channel 650. The plate may have one or more capacitive sensors or
elements that are oriented to face the input mechanism 610. These capacitive elements are used
to detect proximity of a user's finger or other object to the input mechanism 610. In yet another
embodiment, the proximity sensor 640 may work in conjunction with the force sensor 360 to
detect a change in capacitance such as previously described.
[0083]     FIGs. 7A-7B illustrate an example electronic device 700 device having sensors for
detecting movement of the electronic device 700 in a first direction and in a second direction
respectively. The electronic device 700 includes an input mechanism 710 moveably coupled to a
housing 720 and a display (not shown).
[0084]     The electronic device 700 also includes a first movement sensor 730 and a second
movement sensor 740. The movement sensors 730 and 740 may be located within the housing
720 of the electronic device 700. The movement sensors 730 and 740 may be an accelerometer, a
gyroscope or any other suitable sensor that detects movement.
[0085]     As input is received on the input mechanism 710 (e.g., such as shown by arrow 750 in
FIG. 7A) the movement sensors 730 and 740 may detect movement of the housing 720 such as
shown by the arrows associated with each movement sensor 730 and 740. Likewise, when input
is received on the input mechanism 710 shown by arrow 750 in FIG. 7B, the housing 720 of the
electronic device 700 may move in the direction indicated by the arrows associated with the
movement sensors 730 and 740.
[0086]     When the housing 720 of the electronic device 700 moves in these directions (or other
similar directions) a determination may be made that an object, such as a user's finger, is
contacting the input mechanism 710.
[0087]     In additional embodiments, the movement sensors 730 and 740 may be configured to
detect movement of the housing 720 that is below a movement threshold. For example, when a
user contacts the input mechanism 710, the user's finger may have a natural tremor. The
movement sensors 730 and 740 may be operative to sense movement of the housing 720 caused
by the tremor and, as a result, determine that a user is contacting the input mechanism 710.
Because the movement caused by the tremor may be slight, the movement sensors 730 and 740
                                             - 15 -

may be able to distinguish movement associated with the tremor from movement caused by the
user walking, riding in a car, etc. and therefore make a determination that contact has been made.
[0088]      FIG. 8 illustrates a method 800 for determining whether an object is contacting or is in
proximity to an input mechanism of an electronic device. The method 800 may be used by an
electronic device, such as, for example, any of the electronic devices described herein.
[0089]       Method 800 begins at operation 810 in which an input mechanism of the electronic
device is operative to act as a first component of a force sensing device. In some embodiments,
the input mechanism is a rotatable crown or other such input mechanism of the electronic device.
The input mechanism may be electrically connected to a proximity sensor such as, for example, a
resistive sensor or a capacitive sensor. For example, in some implementations, the input
mechanism has one or more contacts disposed on a surface. In another implementation, the input
mechanism acts as an electrode for the proximity sensor.
[0090]      Flow then proceeds to operation 820 and a housing of the electronic device is
operative to act as a second component of the proximity sensor. Like the input mechanism
described above, the housing may also be electrically connected to the proximity sensor.
[0091]      Flow then proceeds to operation 830 and the housing and the input mechanism are
electrically isolated from one another. In some embodiments, this is accomplished by placing an
insert into the housing at a location where the input mechanism is coupled to (or through) the
housing. The insert may be made of plastic, rubber, ceramic or other suitable material.
[0092]      In operation 840, the proximity sensor detects a change in an electrical signal as an
object, such as, for example, a user's finger, approaches or contacts the input mechanism. For
example, if the proximity sensor is a resistive sensor, the electrical signal detected by the
proximity sensor may change when the user's finger contacts the input mechanism. If the
proximity sensor is a capacitive sensor, the capacitive sensor may detect a change in capacitance
when the user's finger is in proximity to or contacting the input mechanism.
[0093]      Although a resistive sensor and capacitive sensor are specifically described herein,
other proximity sensors, such as those described above, may also utilize method 800, or various
operations of the method 800, to determine proximity to or contact with the input mechanism of
the electronic device.
