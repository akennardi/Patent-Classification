                                             ABSTRACT
AZball is a game similar to the game lotto but instead of numbers it uses the whole alphabet
from letters A all the way to the letter z. The alphabetical balls are placed in a container and
randomly drawn from that container. This game has 5 containers with 5 lots of alphabetical
balls and one alphabetical ball is randomly drawn from each of the five containers the
players are to pick five selected alphabetical balls to enter if the players picked alphabetical
balls match the five balls drawn they win the jackpot pool. If the players pick 4 of the
alphabetical they get a lesser prize and for three correct alphabetical balls picked another
lesser amount would be won.
