Examiner Abstract
The innovation resides in fitting a filter and/or pre-separator element(s) of a small canister vacuum
cleaner onto a larger capacity vacuum, suitable for use in industrial applications. This will improve
dust retention and separation of dust particles from a vacuum cleaner, vacuum suction, and work
speeds, and extends operational life of vacuum cleaners

 Canister Vacuum Cleaner filter Technology Transfer to
          Larger Pre-Separator Container Innovation
                                           Description
   Cleaners and people who work in the concrete renovation, mining, asbestoses,
   construction, commercial, industrially, painting, wood working, flooring industry,
   commonly preform work tasks that involve environments and tools that produce
   lots of dust whereby they mostly use cheaply sourced Ryobi or Ozito vacuum
5  cleaner from Bunnings or other low cost options to remove dust from the work
   environment, whereby vacuum filters quickly clog up and in many cases are
   unable to handle concrete and drywall dust at all and expire in a matter of
   minutes. To solve this problem a few businesses have produced a couple of
   plastic and metal pre separator designs to remove the majority of the dust
10 before it enters a vacuum cleaner but due to the simple dust filter pre-separator
   designs and technology used does not allow for adequate dust separation to be
   achieved, resulting in destroyed machines or quickly blocked filters, which
   currently provide restrictions as to the quality and type of vacuum able to
   perform these work tasks.

   Abstract - Field of Invention
   This innovation patent involves an new and innovative step, and modification to
   a stand- alone pre separator apparatus greater than 1 - 3 litre in size, and
20 relates to retrofitting the filters and pre separator product ranges or technology
   contained within more advanced canister vac vacuum cleaners, that is intended
   to replace the much more simple and less effective filter pre-separator designs
   currently in use in these larger drum, container, vessel, pre-separator size
   product ranges, currently sold and used by the cleaning, mining, concrete
25 renovation, asbestoses, construction, commercial, industrially , flooring, wood
   working industry, this innovation makes a substantial difference, purpose,
   contribution, to the workings of the larger size pre-separator product ranges

  currently made and sold, and not only significantly improves dust retention and
  separation of dust particles from a vacuum cleaner, but improves vacuum
  suction, work speeds and extends operational life of vacuum cleaners, extends
  working life of people who work in dusty environments, that best ensures
  Individuals and business best comply with strict Australian WHS legislation ,
5 that best reduces operator and workers exposure to serious lung diseases such
  as black lung, silicosis and asbestosis, that are irreversible and invariably leads
  to premature death, that also significantly improves comfort and quality of life
  for workers who work in dusty environments.

   The claims defining the invention are as follows:
    1      An assembly as claimed in claim 1 whereby the innovation resides in a
    transfer, retro fit of the various dust pre separator, filter canister vacuum,
5   designs, manufactured products and technology, onto a stand alone, pre
    separator, vessel, apparatus, drum, receptacle, larger than 1 - 3 litre in
    capacity,
   2       An assembly as claimed in claim 2 that shares, retro fits, common inter
   related art and design features of filters and dust pre- separators of Canister
   Vacuums for purpose of creating a more efficient and effective larger stand
10 alone dust separator apparatus
    3     An assembly as claimed in claim 3 whereby the innovation resides in a
   modification or retro fit of various canister vacuum filters and designs into pre
   separator apparatus, vessel, apparatus, drum, receptacle, larger than 1 litre in
   capacity
   4     An assembly as claimed in claim 4 whereby the innovation resides in
15 transferring or retro fitting the canister vacuum filter designs into large
   commercial dust extraction vacuum cleaners with inbuilt pre-separators.
