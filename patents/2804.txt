                                           ABSTRACT
        A transcranial magnetic stimulation coil which is location-specific for medial brain
regions or lateral brain regions is designed with multiple spaced apart stimulating elements
having current flow in a first direction, and multiple return elements having current flow in a
second direction which is opposite the first direction. The multiple stimulating elements are
distributed around a central axis of the coil.

                                                  1
                                  TITLE OF THE INVENTION
    CENTRAL BASE COILS FOR DEEP TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION
                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         [001]   The present    application is a divisional application       of Australian    Patent
Application No. 2014220308, filed 20 February 2014. The present invention relates to a family
of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) coils for stimulating medial or lateral brain
regions.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
         [002]      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive technique used to
apply brief magnetic pulses to the brain, or to other human organs, and to thereby activate
neuronal structures.    The pulses are administered by passing high currents by a stimulator
through an electromagnetic coil externally placed upon the patient (for example, placed on the
scalp for brain treatment), inducing electrical currents in the underlying tissue, thereby producing
a localized axonal depolarization.    This technique has become a major tool in central nervous
system research, as well as a potentially promising treatment option for various neurobehavioral
and neurological disorders.
         [003]      Most known TMS coils stimulate superficial brain regions in the brain cortex,
but the rate of decay of the induced magnetic and electric field as a function of distance from the
coil is high. Hence the efficacy of affecting deeper neuronal structures is low.          Stimulating
deeper neuronal structures may be feasible if the intensity of the induced field is greatly
increased.     Yet operation at such increased intensity may increase the risk for seizures and for
physiological damage to the tissue.
         [004]      A method for deep brain TMS with minimal stimulation of superficial regions
is disclosed in US Patent Number 7,407,478, wherein deep brain stimulation is made possible
while minimizing side effects. The device described therein includes a base and an extension
portion, the base having individual windings for individual paths of current flow, and the
extension portion designed so as to minimize unwanted stimulation of other regions of the brain.
         [005]      However, there is a need for more specifically designed coils, which can
target particular areas of the brain including deep neuronal structures with minimal effect on
other brain regions. Examples of specific brain regions that may be desired to be stimulated are
medial brain regions including the anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, medial
14709411

                                                   2
motor cortex, the supplementary motor area (SMA), the premotor area (PMA), the posterior
cingulate cortex, and regions in the preconeus. Other examples may include lateral brain regions
such as the lateral prefrontal cortex, the insula, the entorhinal cortex, temporal cortex regions and
the fusiform face area (FFA).
         [006]      Thus, there is a need for specifically designed coils for deep TMS which are
location-specific for medial brain regions or lateral brain regions. The coils must induce the
desired distribution of the electric field in the brain, and simultaneously induce electric field
intensity in the relevant brain tissue which will be feasible for neuronal stimulation with
available TMS stimulators for most of the population. The stimulation intensity is routinely
calibrated individually for each subject based on his or her motor threshold. Hence the coil
efficiency must guarantee that the motor threshold and stimulation intensity for most of the
relevant population is within an acceptable range with respect to available stimulators power
outputs.
         [0071       The coils design must be efficient with respect to energy consumption, coil
heating rate, compact size and ease of operation.
                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
       [008]        There is provided, in accordance with one embodiment of the present
invention, a coil for transcranial magnetic stimulation. The coil includes a base portion having a
central axis defining a base portion right side on a right side of the central axis and a base portion
left side on a left side of the central axis, multiple right side stimulating elements positioned in
the base portion right side, configured to carry electrical current in a first direction, multiple left
side stimulating elements positioned in the base portion left side, configured to carry electrical
current in the same first direction. The coil further includes a return portion having multiple right
side return elements, wherein each of the right side return elements corresponds to one of the
multiple right side stimulating elements, and wherein each of the multiple right side return
elements is configured to carry electrical current in a second direction which is opposite the first
direction, and multiple left side return elements, wherein each of the left side return elements
corresponds to one of the multiple left side stimulating elements, and wherein each of the
multiple left side return elements is configured to carry electrical current in the second direction,
wherein the return portion is spaced a distance away from said base portion.

                                                   3
       [009]        In embodiments of the present invention, the base portion is complementary to
the human head or head portion, or to another body organ. The base has a flexibility that allows
it to conform to the relevant body organ (such as the human head or head portion).
       [0010]       The base includes individual elements carrying electric current in one or more
common directions, referred to herein as a "main direction." In this main direction, the main
physiologic effect (such as neuronal stimulation) is induced in the body organ. The elements are
not dense together at a narrow segment, but are rather distributed at various locations around the
body organ. In some embodiments the individual elements are evenly distributed across the base.
In other embodiments some or all the elements may be grouped in two or more groups with
certain distances between the groups. The spacing between adjacent elements may be uniform,
variable, periodic or other. In embodiments where some or all the elements are grouped in
groups, the spacing between adjacent groups or between a group and an adjacent element, and
the breadth of each group, may be uniform across the base, variable, periodic or other. Any
combination or arrangement of elements is included within the scope of the invention, with a
particular feature being that the elements are not crowded together in a narrow segment.
       [0011]       The individual elements in the base carrying current in the main direction are
all or mostly tangential to the relevant body organ (such as a portion of a human skull), at all or a
substantial part of their path. In order to optimize the efficacy of activation in deeper brain
regions, it is desirable to minimize the non-tangential components of the induced electric field.
Since the induced electric field orientation is in general parallel to the orientation of the elements
carrying alternating currents, it is desirable to minimize the portions of coil elements which are
non-tangential to the body organ (such as a human skull), especially in the base and its vicinity.
       [0012]       Coil elements carrying electric current in a direction opposite to the one or
more main directions, are placed remote from the base. These elements are referred to herein as
"return elements." In some embodiments, the return elements are located adjacent to other body
organs or other portions of a body organ (such as other head regions), relative to the base. These
return elements are termed "contacting return elements." In other embodiments, the return
elements are located at a certain distance from the body and are not configured to contact the
body. These return elements are termed "protruding return elements." In some embodiments,
some of the return elements are contacting and some of them are protruding.
       [00131       Return elements may be located on more than one side of the base. In some
embodiments, the coil includes return elements on two sides of the base. In other embodiments,
the coil includes return elements on three or more sides of the base. As an example, a certain
1470P411

                                                  4
embodiment may include a central medial base located over a human medial cortex, and two
groupings of return elements located to the left and to the right of the central base. In some
embodiments, these return elements are contacting and adjacent to lateral cortical regions. In
other embodiments these return elements are protruding and located at a distance from any brain
region. In yet other embodiments, some of the return elements are contacting and some are
protruding. In some embodiments all the return elements on one side of the base - i.e. left - are
contacting, while all the return elements on the other side are protruding. In yet other
embodiments, each side of the base - i.e. left and right- includes both contacting and protruding
return elements. In yet other embodiments, one side of the base - i.e. right-          includes both
contacting and protruding return elements, while the other side includes only contacting or only
protruding return elements.
       [0014]       The definition of the base relates to the functional elements of the coil
carrying electric currents. However, there is no limitation regarding other elements of the device,
such as mechanical components, cases and covers. Thus, certain elements of the base may be
encased in a case containing additional coil elements such as return elements and other elements.
As an example, in a central base coil with a base placed over a medial cortex region, and having
two lateral return portions to the left and to the right of the base, the base may include two
groupings -left and right- of elements leading current in a main direction. In some embodiments
the left group elements may be encased in a case together with the left return elements, and
similarly for the right group in some embodiments. Hence mechanically the coil may be
comprised of two portions - left and right- each of them having both central base elements and
return elements. Yet, functionally the coil is comprised of a central base including elements
leading currents in a main direction, and two return portions to the left and right of the base,
including return elements leading currents in an opposite direction.       Thus, the definitions of
stimulating elements, return elements and connecting elements are based on the functionality of
these elements or portions thereof.
         [0015]     The coil must induce the desired distribution of the electric field in the brain,
and simultaneously induce an electric field intensity in the relevant brain tissue which is high
enough to induce neuronal stimulation.
         [0016]     Several features of the coil are important in order to achieve the above goals.
These include:
         [0017]     1. Arrangement of the base portion elements. This arrangement must be
optimized for each coil design and each specific goal. An interplay between two competing
14709411

                                                    5
ideals may take place: Better depth penetration profile, namely higher relative electric field in the
deeper target brain region compared to superficial region, on one hand, and higher absolute
electric field intensity in the target brain region on the other hand. As a non-limiting example,
suppose a base portion contains two groups of elements with a certain distance d between them.
Increasing d will improve the depth penetration profile but may reduce the absolute field
intensity in the target brain region. The intensity must be such that it will enable induction of the
desired physiological effect in the target neural structures in the majority of the population with
stimulators available in the market. Hence the distance d - as well as other configuration
parameters - must be optimized for each coil design.
         [0018]      2. Location of the return portions relative to the base portion. The distance
between the portions must be optimized for each design: Too short a distance will lead to
reduction of the total induced electric field in the target brain region, due to the effect of the
return elements. Too long a distance will require long connecting coil elements and their effect
must be taken into account. Furthermore, the coil size must be optimized for easy location,
navigation and placement over the head.
         [0019]      3. Location of the return portions relative to the brain. The return elements
affect closer brain regions. The location of the return portions must consider their effect on any
brain structure and the design must lead to minimal undesired side effects such as motor
activation or pain.
         [0020]      4. The type of the return elements. Return elements may be either contacting
or protruding as defined above. The ratio between contacting and protruding return elements is
very important in various aspects and must be optimized for each specific coil design. In general,
protruding elements induce electrostatic charge accumulation on the brain surface. This leads to
reduction in the absolute electric field induced in the target brain regions, and also reduction in
the relative intensity of the electric field in deeper brain regions compared to superficial regions.
On the other hand, contacting elements may increase the effect in adjacent brain regions. Hence
a delicate optimization must be performed in each case.
         [0021]      5. The distance of protruding return elements from the head, in coils
containing protruding return elements. Longer distance reduces the direct effect of the return
elements on the brain, but increases the charge accumulation due to the presence of longer non
tangential coil elements which are connected to the return elements and move them away from
the head. A delicate optimization must be performed in each case to account for this effect.

         [0022]      6. The overall coil inductance. The number, length, configuration and packing
parameters of the coil windings must be planned to lead to coil inductance in the desired range.
Usually the desired range for TMS coils inductance is between 15 and 30 microHenri. Too high
inductance may reduce coil efficacy, increase pulse width and is often associated with increased
coil resistance, energy consumption and coil heating. Too small inductance may lead to fast rate
of change of the electric current which may damage stimulator components.

                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
         [0026]     In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in
order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be understood by
those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these
specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components and structures
may not have been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.
         [0027]     The present invention is directed to central base coils for deep TMS and
methods of use thereof. The principles and operation of systems and methods according to the
present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and accompanying
descriptions.
         [0028]     Before explaining at least one embodiment of the present invention in detail, it
is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction
and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the
14709411

                                                    9
drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in
various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein
are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.
         [0029]     Each of the examples below is a coil construction designed uniquely for
effective activation of specific deep brain regions. Each of these coils was constructed after a
complex development process including computer simulation of the electric field distribution
induced in the brain by various coil configurations, building and experimenting with various
prototypes, electric field measurements in a phantom head model filled with saline solution at
physiologic concentration, and iterations between computer simulations and phantom brain
measurements until obtaining the optimal solution for each specific target.
         [0030]     Reference is now made to FIG. 1, which is a schematic illustration showing
principles of stimulation for central base coils, in accordance with embodiments of the present
invention. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, a schematic illustration of a base coil depicts the
elements of a central base coil in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, but
does not depict the actual appearance of these elements. As shown in FIG. 1, central base coil 10
includes a base portion 12 and a return portion 32. A central axis 14 defines a mid-portion of
coil 10. It should be readily apparent that central axis 14 may be an imaginary axis and may be
straight or curved, and is used herein for descriptive purposes and for geometric orientation.
Base portion 12 includes a base portion right side 16 to the right of central axis 14 and a base
portion left side 18 to the left of central axis 14. Directions of right side and left side are defined
in accordance with anatomical definitions. Thus, in the illustration, base portion right side 16 is
on the left side of the figure and base portion left side 18 is on the right side of the figure. Base
portion right side 16 includes multiple right side stimulating elements 20, depicted in FIG. 1 with
arrows to illustrate the direction of electrical flow. Right side stimulating elements 20 are spaced
apart from one another by distances D1. Base portion left side 18 includes multiple left side
stimulating elements 22, depicted in FIG. 1 with arrows to illustrate the direction of electrical
flow. The direction of electrical stimulation of left side stimulating elements 22 with respect to
central axis 14 is substantially the same as the direction of electrical stimulation of right side
stimulating elements 20. Left side stimulating elements 22 are spaced apart from one another by
a distance D2.
         [0031]     Return portion 32 includes a return portion right side 36 and a return portion
left side 38. Return portion right side 36 includes multiple right side return elements 40, and
return portion left side 38 includes multiple left side return elements 42. Right side and left side
14709411

                                                 10
return elements 40 and 42 are depicted in FIG. 1 with arrows to illustrate the direction of
electrical flow. It should be readily apparent from FIG. 1 that the direction of electrical flow for
right side and left side return elements 40 and 42 is opposite the direction of electrical flow for
right side and left side stimulating elements 20 and 22, taken with respect to central axis 14.
Right side return elements 40 are connected to right side stimulating elements 20 and left side
return elements 42 are connected to left side stimulating elements 22 via connecting elements 44.
Thus, in one embodiment, current flows through a right side return element 20 in one direction,
referred to as a stimulating direction, then through a connecting element 44 in a transverse
direction which is transverse to the stimulating direction, and afterwards through a return
element 40 in an opposite direction which is opposite the stimulating direction and is referred to
as a returning direction.   In some embodiments, all or some of stimulating elements, connecting
elements and return elements are comprised of a single continuous piece of coil, wherein
different portions of the single piece of coil are designated as either stimulating, connecting or
return elements depending on their positions and directions of current flow.
         [0032]     Right side return elements 40 are spaced apart from one another by a distance
D3. Left side return elements 42 are spaced apart from one another by a distance D4. Right side
base portion 16 and right side return portion 36 are spaced apart from one another by a distance
D5. Left side base portion 18 and left side return portion 38 are spaced apart from one another
by a distance D6. By having distances D5 and D6 which are sufficiently large, it is possible to
minimize effects of return current on the stimulated area. In some embodiments, distances D5
and D6 are in the range of 4 to 10 cm. In other embodiments distances D5 and D6 are in the
range of 6 to 8 cm. Distances D5 and D6 can be either the same or different.
         [0033]     Reference is now made to FIGS. 2A-2F, which are schematic illustrations of
base portion 12 in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.                   In some
embodiments, as shown in FIG. 2A, the same number of right side stimulating elements 20 and
left side stimulating elements 22 are used. In other embodiments, as shown in FIG. 2B, right
side stimulating elements 20 may include a greater or lesser number of stimulating elements than
left side stimulating elements 22. In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 2C, distances D1
between right side stimulating elements 20 may be variable. In some embodiments, distances D2
between left side stimulating elements 22 may be variable. Distances D1 and/or D2 between
stimulating elements may be uniform, variable or periodic. In some embodiments, distances D1
may be variable while distances D2 may be uniform, as shown in FIG. 2C, or vice versa. In

         [0036]      Reference is now made to FIG. 4, which is an illustration of anatomical
sections of a head 100. For the purposes of illustrating the present invention, head 100 has four
sections: a frontal section 102 at a front portion of head 100, a parietal section 104 to the rear of
frontal section 102 and at a top portion of head 100, a temporal section 106 on the side of head
100 and an occipital section 108 at a rear portion of head 100. Central base coil 10 is configured
such that central axis 14 may be positioned at a mid-point of head 100 with right side stimulating
elements on one side of head 100 and left side stimulating elements on another side of head 100.
In other embodiments, central axis 14 is positioned at a different location of head 100, such as a
temporal section 106, and right and left side stimulating elements 20 and 22 may also be
positioned on temporal section 106 or may be positioned at different locations on head 100.
Thus, for example, base portion 12 may be positioned on frontal section 102, with central axis 14
running along an anterior-posterior central line. In another embodiment, base portion 12 may be
positioned on temporal section 106, with central axis 14 running along a posterior-anterior
central line. In yet another embodiment, base portion 12 may be positioned on parietal section
104, with central axis 14 running along a posterior-anterior central line. In yet another
embodiment, base portion 12 may be positioned on frontal section 102, with central axis 14
running along a lateral-medial line. In this way, base portion 12 stimulates a section of the brain
on two side of central axis 14, while return portion brings returning current back at a section
which is remote from the stimulated section of the brain.        In some embodiments, both base
portion 12 and return portion 32 are adjacent to the head, and in some embodiments, base portion
12 is adjacent to the head while return portion 32 is remote from the head. In some embodiments
base portion 12 is adjacent to the head while some of return portion 32 elements are adjacent to
the head and some of return portion 32 elements are remote from the head. In some
embodiments, connecting elements 44 are adjacent to the head and in other embodiments,
connecting elements 44 are remote from the head. Yet in other embodiments some of connecting
elements 44 are adjacent to the head and some of them are remote from the head.             In some
embodiments, multiple base portions 12 are used with multiple central axes, as will be described
further hereinbelow.

EXAMPLES
         [0094]      In order for the designs of the central base coils described above to be
effective, the designs must be efficient with respect to energy consumption, coil heating rate,
compact size and ease of operation, and must guarantee that the motor threshold and stimulation
intensity for most of the relevant population is within an acceptable range with respect to
available stimulators power outputs.       In order to test these parameters and the efficacy of each
coil for the particular indication, the following experiments were carried out.
         [0095]      Reference is now made to FIG. 18, which is an illustration of electric field
distribution maps of coil 110 of FIG. 5. The field distribution produced by coil 110 was
measured in a human head phantom model. The probe was moved in three directions inside the
phantom model using a displacement system with 1 mm resolution, and the field distribution of
coil 110 was measured in the whole head model volume in 1cm resolution. Axial and coronal
field maps were produced. The field maps were superimposed on anatomical TI-weighted MRI
coronal slices, to show the induced field in each anatomical brain region. The field maps are
shown for stimulator output set at 100% of leg threshold. The dark pixels indicate field
magnitude above the threshold for neuronal activation. The threshold was set to 100 V/m, which
is within the accepted range of thresholds required for motor activation. The intensity of
stimulator power output used for drawing the maps representing the distribution of the electric
field for each coil was set to the level required to obtain 100% of the neural motor threshold, at a
depth of 3 cm, according to the approximate depth of leg motor cortex sites.       It can be seen that
when placing the base portion of the coil over the prefrontal cortex, supra-threshold field is
induced bilaterally in medial prefrontal regions including the anterior cingulate.
         [0096]      Reference is now made to FIG. 19, which is an illustration of electric field
distribution maps of coil 210 of FIG. 6. The field distribution produced by coil 210 was
measured using the method described above with reference to FIG. 18. The field maps are shown
for stimulator output set at 110% of hand motor threshold. It can be seen that when placing the
base portion of the coil over the prefrontal cortex, supra-threshold field is induced bilaterally in
