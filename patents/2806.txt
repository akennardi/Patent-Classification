A DUST PROTECTOR FOR A WEIGHING BAR ASSEMBLY
ABSTRACT
       The present invention relates to a dust protector for a weighing bar assembly (10),
particularly usable under weighing platforms that comprises a structural body (1) defining two
longitudinal ends, which comprise the dust protector (20), which, when projected in a top view,
defines a C-shaped profile, comprising three plane rectangular plates (22, 23, 24) and three outer
flaps (25, 26, 27), each of the flaps (25, 26, 27) extending perpendicularly from each of the
plates (22, 23, 24), respectively, the flaps (25, 26, 27) being supported on the same support plane
of the profile (21), enabling reduction in the accumulation of residues/debris on support portions
of the weighing bar assembly (10), being easy to manufacture, mount and maintain, facilitating
the cleaning of the assembly (10).

A DUST PROTECTOR FOR A WEIGHING BAR ASSEMBLY
[0001] The present invention relates to a dust protector for a weighing bar assembly disclosed in
the patent application BR 10 2015 031525-2.
Description of the Prior Art
[0002] Weighing bars are employed to accommodate load cells and are usually positioned under
weighing platforms. Therefore, weighing bars must be robust in order to support the whole
weight of the load to be weighed, in addition to the weight of the weighing platform, without
any structural alteration. They further should house the load cells in safety, enabling their free
displacement, in order to make weight assessment feasible.
[0003] According to the different places where weighing bars can be applied, for example, in
open field, exposed to bad weather conditions such as rainwater and muds, there is a need to
have an easy-to-maintain-and-clean assembly.
[0004] One cannot observe, in the prior art, any weighing bar assembly comprising at least one
dust protector at each of its longitudinal ends, capable of reducing significantly the
accumulation of residues/debris on support portions of the assembly.
Objectives of the Invention
[0005] Thus, the objective of the invention is to provide a dust protector for a weighing bar
assembly that is arranged at the longitudinal ends of the assembly and enable reduction of the
accumulation of residues/debris on support portions of the weighing bar assembly, which is easy
to manufacture, mount and maintain, facilitating the cleaning of the assembly.
Brief Description of the Invention
[0006] The objectives of the present invention are achieved by means of a dust protector for a
weighing bar assembly, which comprises a structural body defining two longitudinal ends, each
of the body ends comprising the dust protector, which, when projected in a top view, defines a
C-shaped profile, the profile including three plane rectangular plates and three outer flaps, each

                                                   2
of the flaps extending perpendicularly from each of the respective plates, the flaps being on the
same support plane of the profile.
Brief Description of the Drawings
[0007] The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the drawings. The
figures show:
[0008] Figure 1 - a side view of the weighing bar assembly comprising the dust protector of the
invention arranged at one of its longitudinal ends;
[0009] Figure 2 - a perspective view of the dust protector of the invention;
[0010] Figure 3 - a top view of the dust protector of the invention;
[0011] Figure 4 - a top view of the weighing bar assembly comprising the dust protector of the
invention;
[0012] Figure 5 - a perspective view of the dust protector of the invention being mounted on the
weighing bar assembly; and
[0013] Figure 6 - another perspective view of the dust protector of the invention, mounted on
the weighing bar assembly.
Detailed Description of the Figures
[0014] With reference to the drawings, one observes in figure 1 a side view of a weighing bar
assembly 10 comprising a structural body 1 that defines two longitudinal ends, each of the ends
resting on an elastomeric cushion 2 supported by a support shoe 3 and at least one dust protector
3.
[0015] Each of the longitudinal ends of the body 1 of the weighing bar assembly 10 comprises
at least the elastomeric cushion 2, at least the support shoe 3 and at least one dust protector 20.

                                                    3
[0016] In figures 2 and 3, one observes the dust protector 20 of the present invention, which,
when projected in a top view, defines a C-shaped profile 21, which comprises a first plane
rectangular plate 22, arranged vertically with respect to a second plane rectangular plate 23, the
second plate 23 being arranged vertically with respect to a third plane rectangular plate 24, the
first and third plates 22, 24 being parallel to each other.
[0017] Further, the dust protector 20 comprises a first outer flap 25, arranged orthogonally to
the second outer flap 26, the second flap 26 being arranged orthogonally with respect to the
third outer flap 27, the first and third flaps 25, 27 being parallel to each other.
[0018] Each of the flaps 25, 26, 27 extends perpendicularly from each of the plates 22, 23, 24,
respectively, so that the flaps 25, 26, 27 are supported on the same support plane of the profile
21.
[0019] Figure 4 illustrates a top view of the dust protector 20, mounted at one of the
longitudinal ends of the weighing bar assembly 10.
[0020] Figures 5 and 6 illustrate perspective views of the dust protector 20 being mounted at
one of the longitudinal ends of the weighing bar assembly 10.
[0021] The dust protector 20 is manufactured from a metallic or polymeric material, according
to the need of the environment and design. The thicknesses, widths and Heights of the plates 22,
23, 24 and of the flaps 25, 26, 27 also vary according to the design of the weighing bar assembly
10.
[0022] The main objective of the dust protector 20 lies in not allowing residues/debris/dirt to
accumulate under the body 1 of the assembly 10, chiefly between the elastomeric cushion 2 and
the support shoe 3.
[0023] Thus, the dust protector 20 is associated to the longitudinal ends of the body 1, so that
the residues generated will be accumulated on the outer flaps 25, 26, 27 of the dust protector 20.
[0024] The dust protector 20 is easy to manufacture, by virtue of its simplified geometry,
besides being easy to mount and maintain, facilitating the cleaning of the assembly 10.
