 5 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            The present invention relates to protein scaffolds and scaffold libraries based on a
   fibronectin type III (FN3) repeat with alternative binding surface designs. More particularly, the
   present invention is directed to FN3 scaffolds and libraries having concave binding sites formed
   by select beta-strands and loops.
10
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            Monoclonal antibodies are the most widely used class of therapeutic proteins when high
   affinity and specificity for a target molecule are desired. However, non-antibody proteins having
   relatively defined three-dimensional structures that can be engineered to bind desired target
15 molecules, commonly referred to as protein scaffolds, may have advantages over traditional
   antibodies due to their small size, lack of disulphide bonds, high stability, and ability to be
   expressed in prokaryotic hosts. These scaffolds typically contain one or more regions which are
   amenable to specific or random sequence variation, and such sequence randomization is often
   carried out to produce libraries of proteins from which desired products may be selected. Novel
20 methods of purification are readily applied; scaffolds are easily conjugated to drugs/toxins,
   penetrate efficiently into tissues and can be formatted into multispecific binders (Binz and
   Pluckthun, Curr Opin Biotechnol, 16, 459-469, 2005; Skerra, JMol Recognit, 13, 167-187, 2000).
            One such protein scaffold is the fibronectin type III (FN3) domain identified in a
   multitude of proteins, having a characteristic tertiary structure with 6 loops connected by 7 beta
25 strands. Three loops in particular, the FG, BC, and DE loops are structurally analogous to the
   complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies. These loops have been randomized
   to generate libraries of the FN3 domain scaffolds to successfully select specific binders to a
   number of different targets while retaining important biophysical properties (Getmanova et al.,
   Chem Biol, 13, 549-556, 2006; Hackel et al., JMol Biol, 381, 1238-1252, 2008; Karatan et al.,
30 Chem Biol, 11, 835-844, 2004; Koide et al., JMol Biol, 284, 1141-1151, 1998; Koide et al.,
   ProcNatl Acad Sci U S A, 104, 6632-6637, 2007; Parker et al., Protein Eng Des Sel, 18, 435
   444, 2005; Xu et al., Chemistry & Biology, 9, 933-942, 2002). Libraries of the FN3 domains
   have been generated by randomizing also the AB, EF and CD loops (U.S. Pat. Pub. No.
   2011/0038866; Int. Pat. Pub. No. W02011/05133; U.S. Pat. Pub.

   No. W02012/016245 describes FN3 domain libraries using CD and FG loops together with
   surface exposed residues of the beta-sheet.
 5           It would be advantageous to obtain improved fibronectin domain scaffold proteins
   for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. The present disclosure provides such improved
   proteins.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
10         One embodiment of the invention is a method of making a library of fibronectin
   type III module (FN3) domains having a diversified C-CD-F-FG alternative surface

   providing a reference FN3 domain polypeptide having the amino acid sequence at least
   80% identical to that of SEQ ID NO: 27; introducing diversity into the reference FN3
15 domain polypeptide by mutating at least one C beta-strand residue and at least one F beta
   strand residue to form the FN3 domain library having the diversified C-CD-F-FG
   alternative surface.
           Another aspect of the invention is a library produced by the methods of the
   invention described herein.
20         Yet another aspect of the invention is a method of obtaining a protein scaffold

   the library of claim 11 with the target molecule and isolating a protein scaffold specifically
   binding to the target molecule with a predefined affinity.

25 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
            The term "fibronectin type III module (FN3) domain" or "FN3 domain" as used
   herein refers to a domain occurring frequently in proteins including fibronectins, tenascin,
   intracellular cytoskeletal proteins, cytokine receptors and prokaryotic enzymes (Bork and
   Doolittle, Proc Nat Acad Sci USA 89, 8990-8994, 1992; Meinke er al., JBacteriol 175,
30  1910-1918, 1993; Watanabe et al, JBiol Chem 265, 15659-15665, 1990). Exemplary
   FN3 domains (or modules) are the 15 different FN3 domains present in human tenascin C
   and the 15 different FN3 domains present in human fibronectin (FN). Individual FN3
   domains are referred to by domain number and protein name, e.g., the 3' FN3 domain of
   tenascin (TN3), or the 10 FN3 domain of fibronectin (FNI0).
                                                  3

            The term "reference FN3 domain" as used herein refers to a wild type or non
   naturally occurring FN3 domain that is used as a template into which substitutions are
   made to generate protein scaffolds specifically binding to a target molecule.
            The term "alternative surface" as used herein refers to a surface on a side of the
 5 FN3 domain comprising two or more beta strands, and at least one loop. Exemplary
   alternative surfaces are a C-CD-F-FG surface that is formed by amino acids in the C and
   the F beta-strands and the CD and the FG loops, and an A-AB-B-BC-E surface that is
   formed by amino acids in the A, B and E beta-strands and the BC loop.
            The term "substituting" or "substituted" or 'mutating" or "mutated" as used herein
10 refers to altering, deleting of inserting one or more amino acids or nucleotides in a
   polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence to generate a variant of that sequence.
            The term "randomizing" or "randomized" or "diversified" or "diversifying" as
   used herein refers to making at least one substitution, insertion or deletion in a
   polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence.
15          "Variant" as used herein refers to a polypeptide or a polynucleotide that differs
   from a reference polypeptide or a reference polynucleotide by one or more modifications
   for example, substitutions, insertions or deletions.
            The term "specifically binds" or "specific binding" as used herein refers to the
   ability of the FN3 domain of the invention to bind to a target molecule with an affinity
20 (Kd) of at least 1xl0-' M, and/or bind to a target molecule with an affinity that is at least
   ten fold greater than its affinity for a nonspecific antigen (for example BSA or casein) as
   measured by surface plasmon resonance.
            The term "target molecule" as used herein refers to a protein, peptide,
   carbohydrate, lipid, and the like having an antigen or an epitope that is recognized by the
25 FN3 domain of the invention. The target molecule may be naturally or non-naturally
   occurring.
            The term "library" refers to a collection of variants. The library may be composed
   of polypeptide or polyrrnucleotide variants.
            The term "tenascin C" as used herein refers to human tenascin C having a
30 sequence shown in GenBank Acc. No. NP_002151 and in SEQ ID NO: 57. Tenasein C
   has 15 tandem FN3 domains that have amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS: I
    15, respectively. The amino acid sequence of the P   3 FN3 domain of tenasein C (TN3) is
   shown in SEQ ID NO: 3.
                                                   4

             The term "stability" as used herein refers to the ability of a molecule to maintain a
   folded state under physiological conditions such that it retains at least one of its normal
   functional activities, for example, binding to a target molecule.
             The present invention provides FN3 domains that specifically bind to a target
 5 molecule, and thus can be widely used in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. The
   invention is based on a discovery that an alternative surface on a side of the FN3 domain
   comprising two or more beta-strands and at least one loop can be randomized to generate
   and select for protein scaffolds specifically binding a target molecule with high affinity.
   Published FN3-based domain libraries have been generated by diversifying either the top
10 or the bottom loops, areas that structurally resemble CDRs in antibody variable chains,
   providing curved binding surfaces. In this invention, high affinity binding molecules are
   selected from FN3 domain libraries displaying concave interaction surfaces generated by
   randomizing an alternative surface; thus likely increasing the number of epitopes and
   targets against which high affinity binding protein scaffolds can be selected. The present
15 invention provides polynucleotides encoding the protein domains or complementary
   nucleic acids thereof, vectors, host cells, and methods of making and using them. The
   present invention provides methods of making libraries of FN3 domains, and libraries
   made by methods of the invention.
20 Fibronectin Type II domain
             The Fibronectin Type III (FN3) domain (or module) is a prototypic repeat domain
   initially identified in fibronectin and now known to be present in various animal protein
   families including cell surface receptors, extracellular matrix proteins, enzymes, and
   muscle proteins. Structurally the FN3 domains have a topology very similar to that of
25 inmaunoglobulin-like domains, except for the lack of disulfide bonds. As is known in the
   art, naturally occurring FN3 domains have a beta-sandwich structure having seven beta
   strands, referred to as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, linked by six loops, referred to as AB, BC,
   CD, DE, EF, and FG loops (Bork and Doolittle, Proc Nod Acad Sci USA 89, 8990-8992,
    1992; U.S. Pat. No. 6,673,901), Three loops, the BC, DE and FG loops are at the top of
30 the FN3 domain, and three, the AB, CD and EF loops at the bottom of the domain (Figure
    1). Table I shows several FN3 domain containing proteins, and the number of different
   FN3 domains associated with each protein. While FN3 domain conformations are highly
   conserved, the similarity between different domains at the amino acid level is quite low.
             FN3 domains may be naturally or non-naturally occurring. Exemplary non
35 naturally occurring FN3 domains are a consensus FN3 domain designed based on an
                                                   5

   alignment of select FN3 domains present in a certain protein and incorporating the most
   conserved (frequent) amino acid at each position to generate the non-naturally occurring
   FN3 domain. For example, a non-naturally occurring FN3 domain is designed based on a
   consensus sequence of the 15 FN3 domains from human tenascin C, or based on a
 5 consensus sequence of the 15 FN3 domains from human fibronectin. These non-naturally
   occurring FN3 domains retain the typical topology of the FN3 domains, and can exhibit
   improved properties such as improved stability when compared to the wild type FN3
   domains. Exemplary non-naturally occurring FN3 domains are the Tencon and the Fibcon
   domains shown in SEQ ID NOS: 16 and 58, respectively, and described in U.S. Pat. Pub.
10 No.2010/0216708 and U.S. Pat. Pub. No.2010/0255056.

   identical to that of Tencon27. Beta-strand residues can be identified using well known
   methods, for example, by analysis of 3-dimensional structures generated by x-ray
   diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance, or molecular modeling. Where models are not
   available, analysis of sequence alignments with other known FN3 molecules can be used
 5 to predict the boundaries of strand and loop regions. Finally, computer algorithms can be
   used to predict the presence of beta strands from protein primary sequences.

   Alternative surfaces on FN3 domains
            The top (BC, DE, and FG) and the bottom (AB, CD, and EF) loops, e.g., the
15 reported binding surfaces in the FN3 domains are separated by the beta-strands that form
   the center of the FN3 structure (Figures 1, 2A). Alternative surfaces residing on the two
   "sides" of the FN3 domains having different shapes than the surfaces formed by loops
   only can be visualized by rotating the FN3 domain structure by 90 degrees (Figures 2B,
   2C). A slightly concave surface is formed at one side of the FN3 domain by two anti
20 parallel beta-strands, the C and the F beta-strands, and the CD and FG loops, and is herein
   called the C-CD-F-FG surface. An alternative surface is also formed at the opposite side
   of the C-CD-F-FG surface    by the A, B and E beta-strands and the AB and BC loops,
   herein called the A-AB-B-BC-E surface.
                                                  7

             The alternative surfaces in the FN3 domains are encoded by non-contiguous
   stretches of amino acids in each FN3 domain. For example, Tencon27 C-CD-F-FG
   surface is formed by amino acid residues 29-43 and 65-81 of SEQ ID NO: 27, and the
   Tencon27 A-AB-B-BC-E surface is formed by amino acid residues 1-28 and 55-59 of
 5 SEQ ID NO: 27, as shown in Table 2.

           In another embodiment, the protein scaffold of the invention comprises an FN3
   domain comprising an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 28.
          In another embodiment, the protein scaffold of the invention comprises a
   fibronectin module of type III (FN3) domain comprising:
 5        an A beta-stand, an AB loop, a B beta-strand, a BC loop, a D beta-strand, a DE
          loop, an E beta-strand, an EF loop and a 0 beta-strand having amino acid
          sequences identical to SEQ ID NO: 27 at residues 1-12, 13-16, 17-21, 22-28, 44
          50, 51-54, 55-59, 60-64, and 82-89, respectively;

10        identical to SEQ ID NO: 42; and
          a F beta-strand and an FG loop having an amino acid sequence at least 65%
          identical to SEQ ID NO: 43, optionally having at least one substitution at amino
          acid positions corresponding to amino acid residues 11, 14, 17, 37, 46, 73, or 86 of
          SEQ ID NO: 27, wherein the protein scaffold specifically binds to a target
15        molecule not specifically bound by a reference FN3 domain.
          In another embodiment, the protein scaffold of the invention comprises an FN3
   domain comprising an amino acid sequence at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%,
   94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to the amino acid sequences shown
   in SEQ ID NO: 27.
20        In another embodiment, the protein scaffold of the invention comprises an A-AB
   B-BC-E alternative surface formed by an A beta-strand, an AB loop, a B beta-strand, a BC
   loop, and an E beta-strand.
           In another embodiment, the A beta-strand, the AB loop, the B beta-strand, and the
   BC loop forming the A-AB-B-BC-E alternative surface comprise certain amino acid
25 sequences as shown in Tables 4 and 5 and in SEQ ID NOS: 49 and 50.
           In another embodiment, the A beta-strand, the AB loop, the B beta-strand and the
   BC loop comprise an amino acid sequence that is at least 59% identical to SEQ ID NO:44,
   and the E beta-strand comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least 60% identical to
   SEQ ID NO: 37.
30         In another embodiment, the protein scaffold of the invention comprises an FN3
   domain comprising an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 61.
           In another embodiment, an isolated protein scaffold of the invention comprises an
   FN3 domain comprising:
          a C beta-strand, a CD loop, a D beta-strand, a DE loop, an EF loop, an F beta
35        strand, an FG loop, and a G beta-strand having amino acid sequences identical to
                                                9

           SEQ ID NO: 27 at residues 29-37, 38-43, 44-50, 51-54, 60-64, 65-74, 75-81, and
           82-89, respectively;
           an A beta-strand, an AB loop, a B beta-strand, and a BC loop having an amino acid
           sequence that is at least 59% identical to SEQ ID NO: 44; and
 5         an E beta-strand having an amino acid sequence that is at least 60% identical to
           SEQ ID NO: 37, optionally having at least one substitution at amino acid positions
           corresponding to amino acid residues 11, 14, 17, 37, 46, 73, or 86 of
           SEQ ID NO: 27, wherein the protein scaffold specifically binds to a target
           molecule not specifically bound by a reference FN3 domain.
10         The FN3 domains specifically binding to a target molecule can be generated by
   randomizing a subset of the residues that form the alternative surface. For example, at
   least one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten residues can be randomized
   in each beta-strand and each loop contributing to the alternative surface. Additional
   residues can be randomized to increase diversity of the library. For example, 20%, 30%,
15 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% of the residues in each beta-strand
   and each loop forming the alternative surface may be randomized. Alternatively, FN3
   domains specifically binding to a target molecule can be generated by randomizing a
   subset of the residues in the beta-strands contributing to the alternative surface, without
   randomizing any of the loops. For example, at least one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
20 eight, nine, or ten residues in each strand contributing to the alternative surface can be
   randomized. Library diversity can be increased by randomizing additional residues
   residing in the beta-strands. For example, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%,
   85%, 90%, or 95%, of the residues in each beta-strand forming the alternative surface may
   be randomized.
25          Beta-strands have a repeating structure with the side-chain of every other residue
   exposed to the surface of the protein. Surface exposed side-chains are determined by
   examination of three dimensional structures or by comparison to sequences of FN3
   domains with known structure by multiple sequence alignment. All or a subset of surface
   exposed residues in the beta-strands contributing to the alternative surface may be chosen
30 to be randomized. For example, Tencon27 (SEQ ID NO: 27) C-CD-F-FG alternative
   surface has four surface exposed residues in the C beta-strand (S30, L32, Q34, and Q36)
   and five surface exposed residues in the F beta-strand (E66, T68, S70, Y72, and V74),
   residue numbering based on SEQ ID NO: 27. One or more of these residues may be
   randomized to generate a library. Residues at thejunction of the alternative surface, such
35 as S30, E66 and V74 may or may not be randomized. Randomization of the buried
                                                    10

   residues of the beta-strands may result in the destabilization of the scaffold due to the loss
   of hydrophobic contacts in the core of the structure. The buried residues may be
   randomized so that only a subset of amino acids is used, for example only hydrophobic
   amino acids.
 5           A subset or all residues in the loop regions contributing to the alternative surface
   may be randomized. For example, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13 positions
   may be substituted in the CD and/or FG loops contributing to the alternative surface.
   Glycine residues in the loops, such as G42, G76 and/or G77 in Tencon27, can provide
   flexibility and may or may not be randomized. Residues at the beta-strand/loop
10 boundaries, such as E43 in Tencon27, may or may not be randomized. Additional
   residues in the beta-strand or loop regions may be included or excluded from
   randomization. For example, residues that appear to be required for stabilization identified
   based on, for example, analysis of crystal structures of the FN3 domains, may or may not
   be randomized. For example, 380 in Tencon27 makes contacts with the FN3 domain core
15 to potentially stabilize the FG loop, and K75 partially faces away from the alternative
   surface. Thus, both these residues may be excluded from initial library design. In an
   exemplary FN3 domain library having randomized C-CD-F-FG surface, residues that can
   be randomized include residues at positions 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 66, 68,
   70, 72, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, or 81 of SEQ ID NO: 27. In an exemplary FN3 domain
20 library having randomized A-AB-B-BC-E surface, residues that can be randomized
   include residues at positions 6, 8, 10,11, 12, 13,14,15, 16,18, 20,22,23, 24,25, 26, 27,
   55, and 57.
             Diversity at loops contributing to alternative surfaces may be achieved by
   insertion and/or deletions of residues at loops. For example, the FG and/or CD loops may
25 be extended by 1-22 amino acids, or decreased by 1-3 amino acids. The FG loop in
   Tencon27 is 7 amino acids long, whereas the corresponding loop in antibody heavy chains
   ranges from 4-28 residues. To provide maximum diversity, the loops contributing to
   alternative surfaces, for example, the FG loop, may be diversified in sequence as well as in
   length to correspond to the antibody CDR3 length range of 4-28 residues.
30           The resulting FN3 domains specifically binding to a target molecule can be further
   modified at residues residing outside of or within the alternative surface for the purpose of
   for example improving stability, reducing immunogenicity, enhancing binding affinity, on
   rate, off-rate, half life, solubility, or any other suitable characteristics. In one way to
   achieve this goal, the scaffold proteins can be optionally prepared by a process of analysis
35 of the parental sequences and various conceptual engineered products using three
                                                     II

   dimensional models of the parental and engineered sequences. Three-dimensional models
   are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs
   are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational
   structures of selected candidate sequences and can measure possible immunogenicity (e.g.,
 5 Immunofilter program of Xencor, Inc. of Monrovia, CA). Inspection of these displays
   permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate
   sequence, for example, residues that influence stability of the scaffold protein or the ability
   of the candidate scaffold protein to bind its target molecule. In this way, residues can be
   selected and combined from the parent and reference sequences so that the desired
10 characteristics, such as improved scaffold stability is achieved. Alternatively, or in
   addition to the above procedures, other suitable methods of engineering can be used as
   known in the art.
            Desirable physical properties of FN3 domains of the invention include high
   thermal stability and reversibility of thermal folding and unfolding. Several methods have
15 been applied to increase the apparent thermal stability of proteins and enzymes, including
   rational design based on comparison to highly similar thermostable sequences, design of
   stabilizing disulfide bridges, mutations to increase alpha-helix propensity, engineering of
   salt bridges, alteration of the surface charge of the protein, directed evolution, and
   composition of consensus sequences (Lehmann and Wyss, Curr Opin Biotechnol, 12, 371
20 375, 2001). High thermal stability may increase the yield of the expressed protein,
   improve solubility or activity, decrease immunogenicity, and minimize the need of a cold
   chain in manufacturing.
            Residues that can be substituted to improve any characteristics of the FN3
   domains of the invention can be determined by making the substitution and assaying for
25 the desired characteristics of the scaffold. Exemplary FN3 domain-based scaffold with
   improved characteristics are the Tencon scaffold (SEQ ID NO: 16) or the Tencon27
   scaffold (SEQ ID NO: 27) that is modified at one or more amino acid residue positions 11,
    14, 17, 37, 46, 73, or 86.
            In terms of loss of stability, i.e., "denaturing or "denaturation" of a protein, is
30 meant the process where some or all of the three-dimensional conformation imparting the
   functional properties of the protein has been lost with an attendant loss of activity and/or
   solubility. Forces disrupted during denaturation include intramolecular bonds, for
   example, electrostatic, hydrophobic, Van cr Waals forces, hydrogen bonds, and
   disutfides. Protein denaturation can be caused by forces applied to the protein or a
35 solution comprising the protein, such as mechanical force (for example, compressive or
                                                    12

   shear-force), thermal, osmotic stress, change in pH, electrical or magnetic fields, ionizing
   radiation, ultraviolet radiation and dehydration, and by chemical denaturants.
            Measurement of protein stability and protein lability can be viewed as the same or
   different aspects of protein integrity. Proteins are sensitive or "labile" to denaturation
 5 caused by heat, by ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, changes in the ambient osmolarity and
   pH if in liquid solution, mechanical shear force imposed by small pore-size filtration,
   ultraviolet radiation, ionizing radiation, such as by gamma radiation, chemical or heat
   dehydration, or any other action or force that may cause protein structure disruption. The
   stability of the molecule can be determined using standard methods. For example, the
10 stability of a molecule can be determined by measuring the thermal melting ("TM')
   temperature, the temperature in 0 Celsius (*C) at which Mof the molecules become
   unfolded, using standard methods. Typically, the higher the TM, the more stable the
   molecule. In addition to heat, the chemical environment also changes the ability of the
   protein to maintain a particularthree dimensional structure,
15          In one embodiment, the FN3 domains of the invention exhibit increased stability
   by at least 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%,25%, 30%,35%,40%,45%, 50%,55%,60%. 65%, 70%,
   75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% or more compared to the same domain prior to engineering
   measured by the increase in the TM.
            Chemical denaturation can likewise be measured by a variety of methods.
20 Chemical denaturants include guanidinium hydrochloride, guanidinium thiocyanate, urea,
   acetone, organic solvents (DMF, benzene, acetonitrile), salts (ammonium sulfate lithium
   bromide, lithium chloride, sodium bromide, calcium chloride, sodium chloride); reducing
   agents (e.g. dithiothreitol, beta-mercaptoethanol, dinitrothiobenzene, and bydrides, such as
   sodium borohydride), non-ionic and ionic detergents, acids (e.g. hydrochloric acid (HC1),
25 acetic acid (CH 3COOH), halogenated acetic acids), hydrophobic molecules (e.g.
   phosopholipids), and targeted denaturants. Quantitation of the extent of denaturation can
   rely on loss of a functional property, such as ability to bind a target molecule, or by
   physiochemical properties, such as tendency to aggregation, exposure of formerly solvent
   inaccessible residues, or disruption or formation of disulfide bonds.
30          In one embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention exhibit increased stability by at
   least 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%,40%,45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%,70%, 75%,
   80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% or more compared to the same scaffold prior to engineering
   measured by using guanidinium hydrochloride as a chemical denaturant. Increased
   stability can be measured as a function of decreased tryptophan fluorescence upon
                                                  13

   treatment with increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride using well known
   methods.
             The FN3 domains specifically binding to a target molecule of the invention can be
   generated using any FN3 domain as a template for substitutions according to methods
 5 provided within. Exemplary FN3 domains having randomized alternative surfaces are the
   3rd FN3 domain of tenascin C (TN3) (SEQ ID NO: 3), Tencon (SEQ ID NO: 16),
   Tencon27 (SEQ ID NO: 27), Fibcon (SEQ ID NO: 58), and the 10a FN3 domain of
   fibronectin (EN 10) (SEQ ID NO: 97). The amino acid positions delineating the alternative
   surfaces in Tencon27 are shown in Table 2 and Figure 8, and are identical in Tencon,
10 TN3, and Fibcon linear sequence. The amino acid positions delineating the alternative
   surface in FN 10 is shown in Figure 8. The residues forming the alternative surfaces in
   other FN3 domains can be identified by examination of three dimensional structures where
   available or by analysis of sequence alignments of FN3 domains by well known methods.
             The FN3 domains of the invention may be generated as monomers, dimers, or
15 multimers, for example, as a means to increase the valency and thus the avidity of target
   molecule binding, or to generate bi- or multispecific scaffolds simultaneously binding two
   or more different target molecules. The diners and multimers may be generated by
   linking monospecific, bi- or multispecific protein scaffolds, for example, by the inclusion
   of an amino acid linker, for example a linker containing poly-glycine, glycine and serine,
20 or alanine and praline. The use of naturally occurring as well as artificial peptide linkers
   to connect polypeptides into novel linked fusion polypeptides is well known in the
   literature (Hallewell et al, ,lBiol Chem 264, 5260-5268, 1989; Alfithan el aL, ProteinEng.
   8, 725-731, 1995; Robinson & Sauer, Biochemistry 35, 109-116, 1996; U.S. Pat. No.
   5,856,456).
25           The FN3 domains of the present invention may be used as bispecific molecules
   wherein the first alternative surface in a domain has specificity for a first target molecule
   and the second alternative surface in the same domain has specificity for a second target
   molecule. An exemplary bispecific protein domain is a variant of Tencon27 which binds a
   first target molecule at the C-CD-F-FG surface, and a second target molecule at the A-AB
30 B-BC-E surface.
             The FN3 domains of the present invention may incorporate other subunits for
   example via covalent interaction. All or a portion of an antibody constant region may be
   attached to the FN3 domain to impart antibody-like properties, especially those properties
   associated with the Fc region, e.g., complement activity, half-life, etc. For example, Fe
35 effector functions such as Clq binding, complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), Fc
                                                 14

   receptor binding, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis,
   down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g., B cell receptor; BCR), etc. can be provided
   and/or controlled by modifying residues in the Fc responsible for these activities (for
   review; see Strohl, Curr Opin Biotechmol. 20, 685-691, 2009).
 5          Additional moieties may be incorporated into the FN3 domains of the invention
   such as toxin conjugates, albumin or albumin binders, polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   molecules, such as PEG5000 or PEG20,000, fatty acids and fatty acid esters of different
   chain lengths, for example laurate, myristate, stearate, arnchidate, behenate, oleate,
   arachidonate, octanedioic acid, tetradecanedinic acid, octadecanedioic acid, docosanedioic
10 acid, and the like, polylysine, octane, carbohydrates (dextran, cellulose, oligo- or
   polysaccharides) for desired properties. These moieties may be direct fusions with the
   protein scaffold coding sequences and may be generated by standard cloning and
   expression techniques. Alternatively, well known chemical coupling methods may be
   used to attach the moieties to recombinantly produced FN3 domains of the invention.
15          FN3 domains incorporating additional moieties may be compared for functionality
   by several well known assays. For example, altered FN3 domain properties due to
   incorporation of Fc domains and/or Fe domain variants may be assayed in Fe receptor
   binding assays using soluble forms of the receptors, such as the FeyRI, FeyRll, FeyRI or
   FeRn receptors, or using well known cell-based assays measuring for example ADCC or
20 CDC, or evaluating protein scaffold pharmacokinetic properties in in vivo models.
   Generation and Production of FN3 domain Proteins
            One embodiment of the invention is a method of making a library of FN3 domains
   comprising an alternative surface, wherein the alternative surface has at least one amino
25 acid substitution when compared to a reference FN3 domain, comprising: providing a
   polynucleotide encoding a reference FN3 domain; generating a library of polynucleotide
   sequences of the reference FN3 domain by randomizing the alternative surface; translating
   the library in vitro or expressing the library in a host.
           Another embodiment of the invention is a method of making a library of FN3
30 domains having a diversified C-CD-F-FG alternative surface formed by a C beta-strand, a
   CD loop, an F beta-strand, and an FG loop, comprising providing a reference FN3 domain
   polypeptide having the amino acid sequence at least 80% identical to that of SEQ ID NO:
   27; introducing diversity into the reference FN3 domain polypeptide by mutating at least
   one C beta-strand residue and at least one F beta-strand residue to form the FN3 domain
35 library having the diversified C-CD-F-FG alternative surface.
                                                   15

           In the methods of making the library of the invention, 1, 2, 3 or 4 residues in the C
   beta-strand can be mutated with the proviso that S30 is not mutated (residue numbering
   according to SEQ ID NO: 27).
           In the methods of making the library of the invention, the C beta-strand residues
 5 L32, Q34 and Q36 can be mutated (residue numbering according to SEQ ID NO: 27).
           In the methods of making the library of the invention, 1,2, 3 or 4 residues in the F
   beta-strand can be mutated with the proviso that E66 is not mutated (residue numbering
   according to SEQ ID NO: 27).
           In the methods of making the library of the invention, the F-beta strand residues
10 T68, S70 and Y72 can be mutated (residue numbering according to SEQ ID NO: 27).
           In the methods of making the library of the invention, 1, 2, 3 or 4 residues in the
   CD loop residues can be mutated with the proviso that G42 and E43 are not mutated
   (residues numbering according to SEQ ID NO: 27).
           In the methods of making the library of the invention, the residues S38, E39, K40
15 and V41 in the CD loop can be mutated.
           In the methods of making the library of the invention, 1, 2, 3 or 4 residues in the
   FG loop can be mutated with the proviso that the residues K75, G76, G77 and S80 are not
   mutated (residue numbering according to SEQ ED NO: 27).
           In the methods of making the library of the invention, the residues H78, R79 and
20 N81 in the FG loop can be mutated (residue numbering according to SEQ ID NO: 27).
           In the methods of making the library of the invention, the reference FN3 domain
   comprises an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 27, optionally comprising at least one
   substitution at amino acid positions 11, 14, 17, 37, 46, 73, or 86.
           Other reference FN3 domains may be used in the methods of the invention, such as
25 Tencon (SEQ ID NO: 16) or variants thereof as shown in SEQ ID NOS: 17-26 and in
   Table 3.
           Another embodiment of the invention is a library produced by the methods of the
   invention.
           Generation of the scaffold proteins, FN3 domains (or modules) of the invention, is
30 typically achieved at the nucleic acid level. The libraries of the FN3 domains of the
   invention having substituted codons at one or more specific residues can be synthesized
   for example using standard PCR cloning methods, or chemical gene synthesis according to
   methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,521,427 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,670,127. Codons can be
   randomized using well known methods, for example degenerate oligonucleotides matching
                                                 16

   the designed diversity, or using Kunkel mutagenesis Kunkel et al, Afethods Enzymnol. 154,
   367-382, 1987).
            Libraries can be randomized at chosen codons using a random or defined set of
   amino acids. For example, variants in the library having random substitutions can be
 5 generated using NNK codons, which encode all 20 naturally occurring amino acids. In
   other diversification schemes, DVK codons can be used to encode amino acids Ala, Trp,
   Tyr, Lys, Thr, Asn, Lys, Ser, Arg, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Cys. Alternatively, NNS codons
   can be used to give rise to all 20 amino acid residues and simultaneously reducing the
   frequency of stop codons. The codon designations are according to the well known IUB
10 code.
             The FN3 domains of the invention as any other proteins are prone to a variety of
   physical and/or chemical instabilities, resulting in adverse effects on the downstream
   processing. For instance, physical and chemical instability may lead to aggregation,
   degradation, reduced product yield, loss of potency, increased potential for
15 immunogenicity, molecular heterogeneity, and loss of activity. Thus, presence of possible
   instability-inducing residues and recognition sequences may be minimize during the
   design of the libraries. For example, surface exposed methionine and tryptophan may be
   oxidized in stomge conditions, possibly leading to loss in the protein scaffold potency.
   Presence of asparagine, in addition to contributing to well known N-glycosylation
20 recognition sites (NXS/T) may be deamidated when followed by glycine, possibly
   generating heterogeneicity (Robinson, Proc Nall AcadSci USA, 99, 5283-5288, 2002).
   Some or all of these amino acids thus may or may not be omitted from the mix used to
   randomize selected position. Furthermore, cysteine and praline may be omitted to
   minimize disulphide bridge formation and disruption of beta sheets.
25           Libraries of FN3 domains with biased amino acid distribution at positions to be
   diversified can be synthesized for example using Slonomics@ technology
   (http:_//www_slonfing com). This technology uses a library of pre-made double stranded
   triplets that act as universal building blocks sufficient for thousands of gene synthesis
   processes. The triplet library represents all possible sequence combinations necessary to
30 build any desired DNA molecule.
             Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide "degeneracy" at certain
   positions is well known in that art, for example the TRIM approach (Knappek el al., JMol
   Bio 296, 57-86, 1999; Garrard& Henner, Gene 128,103-109, 1993). Such sets of
   nucleotides having certain codon sets can be synthesized using commercially available
35 nucleotide or nucleoside reagents and apparatus.
                                                   17

            In an exemplary diversification scheme, Tencon27 FN3 domain (SEQ ID NO: 27)
   residues L32, Q34 and Q36 in the C beta-strand, S38, E39, K40 and V41 in the CD loop,
   T68, S70 and Y72 in the F beta-strand, and H78, R79, and N81 in the FG loop are
   randomized with NNS codons.
 5           Standard cloning and expression techniques are used to clone the libraries into a
   vector or synthesize double stranded cDNA cassettes of the library, to express, or to translate
   the libraries in vitro. For example, cis-display can be used to ligate DNA fragments
   encoding the scaffold proteins to a DNA fragment encoding RepA to generate a pool of
   protein-DNA complexes formed after in vitro translation wherein each protein is stably
10 associated with the DNA that encodes it (U.S. Pat. No. 7,842,476; Odegrip el al., Proc
   Nat/ Acad Sci U S A 101, 2806-2810, 2004). Other methods can be used, for example
   ribosome display (Hanes and Pluckthun, PrcNatlAcad Sci USA. 94,4937-4942, 1997),
   mRNA display (Roberts and Szostak, Proc NatlAcad Sci USA, 94, 12297-12302, 1997), or
   other cell-free systems (U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,768). The libraries of protein scaffolds may be
15 expressed as fusion proteins displayed on the surface for example of any suitable
   bacteriophage. Methods for displaying fusion polypeptides on the surface of a bacteriophage
   are well known (U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2011/0118144; Int. Pat. Pub, No. W02009/085462;
   U.S. Pat. No. 6,969,108; U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,197; U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; U.S. Pat. No.
   6,582,915; U.S. Pat. No. 6,472,147).

   Screening
             Screening engineered protein FN3 domains or libraries of FN3 domain variants for
   specific binding to target molecules can be achieved for example by producing the library
   using cis display as described in Examples and in Odegrip et aL, ProcNatl Acad Sci U S A
25  101, 2806-2810, 2004, and assaying the library for specific binding to a target molecule by
   any method known in the at. Exemplary well known methods which can be used are
   ELISA, sandwich imnmunoassays, and competitive and non-competitive assays (see, e.g.,
   Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &
   Sons, Inc., New York).
30          The FN3 domains of the invention can bind human or other mammalian proteins
   with a wide range of affinities (KD). Typically a FN3 domain of the present invention can
   bind to a target protein with a K equal to or less than about 10' M, 104 M, 10 M, 10-0
   M, 10 IM, 10-"1M, 101 3 M, 10- 4 M, or 10        M as determined by surface plasmon
   resonance or the Kinexa method, as practiced by those of skill in the art. The affinity of a
35 FN3 domain for an antigen can be determined experimentally using any suitable method.
                                                   18

   (See, for example, Berzofsky, et al., "Antibody-Antigen Interactions," In Fundamental
     nimmunology, Paul, W. E., Ed, Raven Press: New York, NY (1984); Kuby, Janis
   Immunology, W. H. Freeman and Company: New York, NY (1992); and methods
   described herein). The measured affinity of a particular FN3 domain-antigen interaction
 5 can vary if measured under different conditions (e.g., osmolarity, pH). Thus,
   measurements of affinity and other antigen-binding parameters (e.g., KD, Kc_ Korg) are
   preferably made with standardized solutions of protein scaffold and antigen, and a
   standardized buffer, such as the buffer described herein.
10 Nucleic Acid Molecules and Vectors
            The invention provides for nucleic acids encoding the FN3 domains of the
   invention as isolated polynucleotides or as portions of expression vectors or as portions of
   linear DNA sequences, including linear DNA sequences used for in vitro
   transcription/translation, vectors compatible with prokaryotic, eukaryotic or filamentous
15 phage expression, secretion and/or display of the compositions or directed mutagens
   thereof. Certain exemplary polyrucleotides are disclosed herein, however, other
   polynucleotides which, given the degeneracy of the genetic code or codon preferences in a
   given expression system, encode the protein scaffolds and libraries of the protein scaffolds
   of the invention are also within the scope of the invention.
20          The polynucleotides of the invention may be produced by chemical synthesis such
   as solid phase polynucleotide synthesis on an automated polynucleotide synthesizer and
   assembled into complete single or double stranded molecules. Alternatively, the
   polynucleotides of the invention may be produced by other techniques such a PCR
   followed by routine cloning. Techniques for producing or obtaining polynucleotides of a
25 given known sequence are well known in the art.
            The polynucleotides of the invention may comprise at least one non-coding
   sequence, such as a promoter or enhancer sequence, intron, polyadenylation signal, a cis
   sequence facilitating RepA binding, and the like. The polynucleotide sequences may also
   comprise additional sequences encoding additional amino acids that encode for example a
30 marker or a tag sequence such as a histidine tag or an HA tag to facilitate purification or
   detection of the protein, a signal sequence, a fusion protein partner such as RepA, Fe or
   bacteriophage coat protein such as pIX or pill.
            An exemplary polynucleotide comprises sequences for a Tac promoter, sequences
   encoding the FN3 domain library and repA, cis element, and a bacterial origin of
35 replication (ori). Another exemplary polynucleotide comprises a pelB or ompA signal
                                                 19

   sequence, pIII or pIX bacteriophage coat protein, FN3 domain, and a polyA site.
   Exemplary polynucleotides encoding the TCL14 library and Tencon27 are shown in SEQ
   ID NOs: 100 and 101, respectively.
            Another embodiment of the invention is a vector comprising at least one
 5 polynucleotide of the invention. Such vectors may be plasmid vectors, viral vectors,
   vectors for baculovirus expression, transposon based vectors or any other vector suitable
   for introduction of the polynucleotides of the invention into a given organism or genetic
   background by any means. Such vectors may be expression vectors comprising nucleic
   acid sequence elements that can control, regulate, cause or permit expression of a
10 polypeptide encoded by such a vector. Such elements may comprise transcriptional
   enhancer binding sites, RNA polymerase initiation sites, ribosome binding sites, and other
   sites that facilitate the expression of encoded polypeptides in a given expression system.
   Such expression systems may be cell-based, or cell-free systems well known in the art.
15 Host Cell Selection or Host Cell Engineering
            An FN3 domain of the present invention can be optionally produced by a cell line,
   a mixed cell line, an immortalized cell or clonal population of imniortalized cells, as well
   known in the art. See, e.g., Ausubel, et al., ed., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology,
   John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY, NY (1987-200 1); Sambrook, et al., Molecular Cloning: A
20 Laboratory Manual, 2 " Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989); Harlow and Lane,
   Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989); Colligan, el al., eds.,
   Current Protocols in Immunology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY (1994-200 1); Colligan et
   al., Current Protocols in Protein Science, John Wiley & Sons, NY. NY, (1997-200 1).
            The host cell chosen for expression may be of mammalian origin or may be

   HeLa, myeloma, lymphoma, yeast, insect or plant cells, or any derivative, immortalized or
   transformed cell thereof. Alternatively, the host cell may be selected from a species or
   organism incapable of glycosylating polypeptides, e.g. a prokaryotic cell or organism,
   such as BL2 1. BL21(DE3), BL21-GOLD(DE3), XLI -Blue, IM            109. HMS 174,
30 HMSI74(DE3), and any of the natural or engineered E. coli spp, Klebsiella spp., or
   Pseudomonasspp strains.
   Uses of FN3 Domains of the Invention
            The compositions of the FN3 domain (module)-based molecules described herein
35 and generated by any of the above described methods may be used to diagnose, monitor,
                                                  20

   modulate, treat, alleviate, help prevent the incidence of, or reduce the symptoms of human
   disease or specific pathologies in cells, tissues, organs, fluid, or, generally, a host. A FN3
   domain engineered for a specific purpose may be used to treat an immune-mediated or
   immune-deficiency disease, a metabolic disease, a cardiovascular disorder or disease; a
 5 malignant disease; a neurologic disorder or disease; an infection such as a bacterial, viral
   or parasitic infection; or other known or specified related condition including swelling,
   pain, and tissue necrosis or fibrosis.
             Such a method can comprise administering an effective amount of a composition
   or a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one FN3 domain specifically binding
10 a target molecule to a cell, tissue, organ, animal or patient in need of such modulation,
   treatment, alleviation, prevention, or reduction in symptoms, effects or mechanisms. The
   effective amount can comprise an amount of about 0.001 to 500 mg/kg per single (e.g.,
   bolus), multiple or continuous administration, or to achieve a serum concentration of 0.01
   5000 pg/ml serum concentration per single, multiple, or continuous administration, or any
15 effective range or value therein, as done and determined using known methods, as
   described herein or known in the relevant arts.
   Pharmaceutical Compositions Comprising FN3 domain-based Proteins
            The FN3 domains specifically binding target molecules which are modified or
20 unmodified, monomers, diners, or multimers, mono-, bi- or multi-specific, can be isolated
   using separation procedures well known in the art for capture, immobilization,
   partitioning, or sedimentation, and purified to the extent necessary for commercial
   applicability.
            For therapeutic use, the FN3 domains specifically binding a target molecule may
25 be prepared as pharmaceutical compositions containing an effective amount of the FN3
   domain as an active ingredient in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term
   "carrier" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the active
   compound is administered. Such vehicles can be liquids, such as water and oils, including
   those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil,
30 mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. For example, 0.4% saline and 0.3% glycine can be
   used. These solutions are sterile and generally free of particulate matter. They may be
   sterilized by conventional, well-known sterilization techniques (e.g., filtration). The
   compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to
   approximate physiological conditions such as pH adjusting and buffering agents,
35 stabilizing, thickening, lubricating and coloring agents, etc. The concentration of the agent
                                                   21

   of the invention in such pharmaceutical formulation can vary widely, i.e., from less than
   about 0.5%, usually at or at least about 1%to as much as 15 or 20% by weight and will be
   selected primarily based on required dose, fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., according to the
   particular mode of administration selected. Suitable vehicles and formulations, inclusive
 5 of other human proteins, e.g., human serum albumin, are described, for example, in e.g.
   Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21" Edition, Troy, D.B. ed., Lipincott
   Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA 2006, Part 5, Pharmaceutical Manufacturing pp
   691-1092, See especially pp. 958-989.
            The mode of administration for therapeutic use of the FN3 domains specifically
10 binding a target molecule may be any suitable route that delivers the agent to the host,
   such as parenteral administration, e.g., intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal,
   [ntavenous or subcutaneous, pulmonary; transmucosal (oral, intranasal, intravaginal,
   rectal); using a formulation in a tablet, capsule, solution, powder, gel, particle; and
   contained in a syringe, an implanted device, osmotic pump, cartridge, micropump; or other
15 means appreciated by the skilled artisan, as well known in the art. Site specific
   administration may be achieved by for example intrarticular, intrabronchial,
   intraabdominal, intracapsular, intracartilaginous, intracavitary, intracelial, intracerebellar,
   intracerebroventricular, intracolic, intracervical, intragastric, intrahepatic, intracardial,
   intraosteal, intrapelvic, intrapericardiac, intraperitoneal, intrapleural, intraprostatic,
20 intrapulmonary, intrarectal, intrarenal, intraretinal, intraspinal, intrasynovial, intrathoracic,
   intrauterine, intravascular, intravesical, intralesional, vaginal, rectal, buccal, sublingual,
   intranasal, or transdermal delivery,
            While having described the invention in general terms, the embodiments of the
   invention will be further disclosed in the following examples that should not be construed
25 as limiting the scope of the claims.
   EXAMPLE 1. Tencon scaffold
   Tencon design
            The third fibronectin module of type III (Fn3) domain from human tenascin C (SEQ
30 ID NO: 3) can be used as a protein scaffold that can be engineered to bind to specific target
   molecules. The melting temperature of this domain is 54C in PBS in its native form.
            In order to produce a protein scaffold with a similar structure and improved physical
   properties, such as an improved thermal stability, a consensus sequence was designed based
   on an alignment of 15 FN3 domains from human tenascin C (shown in SEQ ID NOS: 1-15).
35 The 15 selected FN3 domains have sequence identities to each other ranging from 13 to 80%,
                                                   22

   with an average sequence identity among pairs of 29%. A consensus sequence designated as
   Tencon (SEQ ID NO: 16) was designed by incorporating the most conserved (frequent)
   amino acid at each position (see U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2010/0216708). In pairwise alignments,
   Tencon is identical to the FN3 domains from tenascin C at 34 - 59% of positions with an
 5 average sequence identity of 43%.
   Tencon expression and purification
            The amino acid sequence of Tencon was back translated, resulting in the cDNA
   sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 59. The cDNA was amplified and cloned into modified
10 pETI 5 vector using routine methods. The protein was expressed as a C-terminal His 6
   fusion protein in soluble form in E. coli, and purified using standard Ni-NTA agarose
   using elution in 500 mM imidazole. The desired fractions were pooled and dialyzed into
   PBS pH 7.4. As a second purification step the protein was loaded onto a Superdex-75
   HiLoad 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in PBS. The fractions containing
15 Tencon were pooled and concentrated using a Cenuiprep UhraCel YM-3 concentrator
   (Amicon). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that Tencon migrates between 6 and 14 kDa, in
   agreement with the expected mass of 10.7 kDa for the monomeric protein. A yield of>50
   mg of pure Tencon protein per liter of culture was obtained.
20 Tencon Biophysical Characterization
            The structure and stability of Tencon was characterized by circular dichroism
   spectroscopy (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). CD measurements were
   made on an AVIV spectrometer at 20*C in PBS and a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. The
   spectrum showed a minimum at 218 pm, suggestive of beta-sheet structure as expected for
25 a protein belonging to the FN3 family. DSC data was obtained by heating 0.5 mg/mL
   solutions of the 3" FN3 domain from tenascin C (TN3) or Tencon in PBS from 350 C to
   95*C at a rate of I*C/minute in an N-DSCII calorimeter (Applied Thermodynamics).
   From this data, melting temperatures of 54*C and 780 C were calculated forTN3 and
   Tencon, respectively, using CpCalc (Applied Thermodynamics) software. The folding
30 and unfolding of both domains is reversible at these temperatures. Thus, the generated
   Tencon scaffold demonstrates an improved thermal stability when compared to that of the
   TN3. Based on this stability increase, the Tencon scaffold is likely to be more amenable
   to amino acid substitution and easier to manufacture. Mutations that decrease protein
   stability are likely to be better tolerated in the context of a more stable scaffold and thus a
                                                    23

   scaffold with enhanced stability is likely to yield more functional, well folded binders
   from a library of scaffold variants.
   Tencon display on M13 phage
 5         The cDNA (SEQ ID NO: 59) encoding the Tencon amino acid sequence was
   subcloned into the phagemid expression vector pPep9 (Int. Pat. Pub. No.
   W02008/079973) by standard PCR and restriction digest cloning, resulting in the vector
   pTencon-pIX. This vector expresses N-terminally Myc-tagged Tencon as a C-terminal
   fusion to the N-terminus of the bacteriophage M13 pIX protein under Lac promoter
10 (allowing for lower levels of expression without IPTG and increased expression after the
   addition of IPTG) utilizing the OmpA signal sequence. A short TSGGS linker (SEQ
   ID NO: 60) was inserted between Tencon and pIX to prevent steric interactions between
   these proteins.
           For confirmation of display on the surface of the M13 phage particle, single
15 colony transformants of pTencon-pIX in XL 1-Blue E coli were grown at 370 C until
   reaching mid-log phase and rescued with 6" pfu of VCSM13 helper phage. Supernatants
   were collected from the rescued cultures after 16 how expansion in 2YT media
   supplemented with ampicillin followed by 1 mM IPTG induction, centrifuged at 4000 X g
   for 20 minutes and stored at 4*C for analysis.
20         Binding of the phage particles to an anti-Myc antibody (Life Technologies,
   Carlsbad, CA) was used to confirm the display of the Myc-Tencon construct on the M13
   phage surface. A Maxisorp plate was coated ovemight at a concentration of 2.5 gg/mL
   with anti-Myc or an anti-av antibody (negative control) and blocked with SuperBlock T20
   (Thermo Scientific, Rockford IL). Two-fold serial dilutions of the phagemid culture
25 supernatant described above were made in PBS and added to the wells of the coated plate.
   After I hour, the plate was washed with TBST and an anti-M13 HRP antibody was added
   to each well and washed with TBST following a 1-hour incubation. The Roche BD
   ELISA POD substrate was added and luminescence detected on a Tecan plate reader
30 EXAMPLE 2: Stabilizing Mutations in Tencon
           Tencon libraries, FG7 and BC6/FG7, designed to introduce diversity into the FG and
   FG and BC loops simultaneously have been described (U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2010/0255056;
   U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2010/0216708).
35
                                                  24

   Design of variants
            Mutants were designed to improve the folding stability of Tencon (SEQ ID NO: 16).
   Several point mutations were made to produce substitution of individual residues of SEQ ID
   NO: 16, such as N46V (Tenconl7; SEQ ID NO: 17), EI4P (Tenconl 8; SEQ ID NO:18),
 5 E IIN (Tencoul9; SEQ ID NO:19), E37P (Tencon20; SEQ ID NO:20), and G73Y
   (Tencon21; SEQ ID NO:2l) which were predicted to improve the scaffold stability by the
   program PoPMuSiC v2.0 (Dehouck etal., Bioinfornaticv, 25, 2537-2543, 2009). The
   mutant E861 (Tencon22; SEQ ID NO:22) had been previously found to stabilize a
   homologous protein, the 3' FN3 domain from human tenascin C (W02009/086116). The
10 L I7A mutation (Tencon26; SEQ ID NO: 26) was found to significantly stabilize Tencon
   during alanine scanning experiments in which all loop residues of Tencon were replaced with
   alanine independently (data not shown). Following an initial round of stability assays, the
   combinatorial mutants N46V/E86 (Tencon23; SEQ ID NO:23), E14P/N46V/E861
   (Tencon24; SEQ ID NO:24), and Ll7AIN46V/E861 (Tencon25; SEQ ID NO:25) were
15 produced to further increase stability.
   Expression and Purification
            Mutations in the Tencon coding sequence were made using a QuikChange
   mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the mutant proteins were expressed and purified using
20 standard protocols as HIS6 fusion proteins. The proteins were eluted from Ni-NTA
   (Novagen) columns in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, and 250 mM
   imidazole. After elation, the proteins were dialyzed into PBS pH 7.4.
   Characterization of Thermal Stability
25          The thermal stabilities of Tencon and each mutant protein in pBS pH 7.4 (2-3
   mg/mL) were measured by capillary differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Melting
   temperatures were measured for these samples using a VP-DSC instrument equipped with
   an autosampler (MicroCal, LLC) Samples were heated from I0C to 95*C or I 00C at a
   rate of P*C per minute. A buffer only scan was completed between each sample scan in
30 order to calculate a baseline for integration. Data were fit to a two state unfolding model
   following subtraction of the buffer only signal. Reversibility of thermal denaturation was
   determined by repeating the scan for each sample without removing it from the cell.
   Reversibility was calculated by comparing the area under the curve from the I' scan with
   the 2 scan. Results of the DSC experiments are presented in Table 3 as the values
35 derived from complete melting curves (Tm (Kcal)). Single mutants Tenconl7, Tencon18,
                                                  25

   Tencon 19, and Tencon22 had improved thermal stability compared to the parent Tencon
   sequence. Only Tencon21 was significantly destabilizing. Combinatorial mutants
   Tencon23, Tencon24, and Tencon25 and all had a significantly larger enhancement of the
   stability, indicating that the designed mutations are additive with respect to improving
 5 thermal stability.
   Denaturation by Guanidine Hydrochloride
             The abilities of Tencon and each mutant to remain folded upon treatment with
   increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdmCl) as measured by tryptophan
10 fluorescence were used to assess stability. Tencon contains only one tryptophan residue.
   The tryptophan residue is buried within the hydrophobic core and thus fluorescence
   emission at 360 nm is a sensitive measure of the folded state of this protein. 200 pL of a
   solution containing 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, and variable
   concentrations of GdmCl from 0.48 to 6.63 M were pipetted into black, non-binding, 96
15 well plates (Greiner) in order to produce a 17 point titration. 10 piL of a solution
   containing the Tencon mutants were added to each well across the plate to make a final
   protein concentration of 23 pM and mixed by pipetting up and down gently. After
   incubation at room temperature for 24 hours, fluorescence was read using a Spectramax
   M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with excitation at 280 nm and
20 emission at 360 nm. Fluorescence signal was converted to fraction unfolded using the

   f.   = (YF     Y)/(YF- YU)
   Where yF is the fluorescence signal of the folded sample and yn of the unfolded sample.
25 The mid-points of the unfolding transition and slope of the transition were determined by
   fitting to the equation below (Clarke et al, 1997):
                   (aN +fiN[D])      (aD PD [D])exp(m([D] - [D] so)/RT)
                                  1 + exp(m([D] - [D] 5 %)/RT)
   Where F is the fluorescence at the given denaturant concentration, aN and aD are the y
   intercepts of the native and denatured state, ON  and fD are the slopes of the baselines for
30 the native and denatured state, [D] is the concentration of GdmCl, [D] o the GdmCl
   concentration at which point 50% of the sample is denatured, m the slope of the transition,
   R the gas constant, and T the temperature. The free energy of folding for each sample was
                                                 26

   estimated using the equation (Pace 1986 supra; Clarke et al., JMol Biol 270, 771-778,
   1997): AG = m[D],
            It is often difficult to accurately measure the slope of the transition, m, for such
   curves. Additionally, the mutations described here are not expected to alter the folding
 5 mechanism of tencon. Thus, the m value for each mutant was measured and the values
   averaged (Pace 1986 supra)to produce an m = 3544 cal/mol/M used for all free energy
   calculations. The results of these calculations are presented in Table 3. The results for
   GdmCl unfolding experiments demonstrate that the same mutants that stabilize Tencon
   with respect to thermal stability also stabilize the protein against GdmCl induced
10 denaturation.

   Size Exclusion Chromatography
            Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to assess the aggregation state of
   Tencon and each Tencon variant. 5 pL of each sample were injected onto a Superdex 75
   5/150 column (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min with a PBS mobile phase.
20 Elution from the column was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. In order to assess the
   aggregation state, the column was previously calibrated with globular molecular weight
   standards (Sigma). All of the samples tested, with the exception of Tencon21, eluted in
   one peak at an elution volume consistent with that of a monomeric sample. Tencon21
   eluted with 2 peaks, indicating the presence of aggregates.

   EXAMPLE 3: Generation of Tencon libraries having alternative binding surfaces
   Design of the TCL14 library
            The choice of residues to be randomized in a particular library design governs the
   overall shape of the interaction surface created. X-ray crystallographic analysis of an FN3
 5 domain containing scaffold protein selected to bind maltose binding protein (MBP) from a
   library in which the BC, DE, and FG loops were randomized was shown to have a largely
   curved interface that fits into the active site of MBP (Koide et al., ProcNat/A cad Sci U S
   A, 104, 6632-6637, 2007). In contrast, an ankyrin repeat scaffold protein that was selected
   to bind to MBP was found to have a much more planar interaction surface and to bind to
10 the outer surface of MBP distant from the active site (Binz et al., Nat Biotechnol, 22, 575
   58, 2004). These results suggest that the shape of the binding surface of a scaffold
   molecule (curved vs. flat) may dictate what target proteins or specific epitopes on those
   target proteins are able to be bound effectively by the scaffold. Published efforts around
   engineering protein scaffolds containing FN3 domains for protein binding has relied on
15 engineering adjacent loops (Figure 1) for target binding, thus producing curved binding
   surfaces. This approach may limit the number of targets and epitopes accessible by such
   scaffolds.
            Tencon and other FN3 domains contain two sets of CDR-like loops lying on the
   opposite faces of the molecule, the first set formed by the BC, DE, and FG loops, and the
20 second set formed by the AB, CD, and EF loops. The two sets of loops are separated by
   the beta-strands that form the center of the FN3 structure (Figures 1, 2A). If the image of
   the Tencon structure presented in Figure I is rotated by 90 degrees, an alternative surface
   can be visualized (Figure 2B). This slightly concave surface is formed by the CD and FG
   loops and two antiparallel beta- strands, the C and the F beta-strands, and is herein called
25 the C-CD-F-FG surface (Figure 2B). The C-CD-F-FG surface can be used as a template to
   design libraries of protein scaffold interaction surfaces by randomizing a subset of residues
   that form the surface. Beta-strands have a repeating structure with the side chain of every
   other residue exposed to the surface of the protein. Thus, a library can be made by
   randomizing some or all surface exposed residues in the beta strands. By choosing the
30 appropriate residues in the beta-strands, the inherent stability of the Tencon scaffold
   should be minimally compromised while providing a unique scaffold surface for
   interaction with other proteins.
            A new library, herein called TCLI4 (SEQ ID NO: 28), was designed into
   Tencon25 scaffold (SEQ ID NO: 25) having an additional El 11 substitution (Tencon27,
35 SEQ ID NO: 27) (Figures 2B, 3). Positions of the loops and strands and their sequences
                                                   28

   are shown in Table 4 and Table 5 for Tencon27 (SEQ ID NO: 27) and TCL14 (SEQ ID
   NO: 28), respectively. In Table 5, "X" indicates any amino acid.

            The two beta strands forming the C-CD-F-FG surface in Tencon27 have a total of
   9 surface exposed residues that could be randomized; C-strand: S30, L32, Q34, Q36; F
15 strand: E66, T68, S70, Y72, and V74, while the CD loop has 6 potential residues: S38,
   E39, K40, V41, G42, and E43 and the FG loop has 7 potential residues: K75, G76, G77,
   H78, R79, S80, and N8 I (Figure 5). Select residues were chosen for inclusion in the
   TCL14 design due to the larger theoretical size of the library if all 22 residues were
   randomized.
20          Thirteen positions in Tencon27 (SEQ ID NO: 27) were chosen for randomizing:
   L32, Q34 and Q36 in C-strand, S38, E39, K40 and V41 in CD-loop, T68, S70 and Y72 in
   F-strand, H78, R79, and N81 in FG-loop. In the C and F strands S30 and E66 were not
   randomized as they lie just beyond the CD and FG loops and do not appear to be as
   apparently a part of the C-CD-F-FG surface. For the CD loop, G42 and E43 were not
25 randomized as glycine, providing flexibility, can be valuable in loop regions, and E43lies
   at the junction of the surface. The FG loop had K75, 076, G77, and S80 excluded. The
   glycines were excluded for the reasons above while careful inspection of the crystal
   structures revealed 580 making key contacts with the core to help form the stable FG loop.
   K75 faces away from the surface of the C-CD-F-FG surface and was a less appealing
30 candidate for randomization. Although the above mentioned residues were not
   randomized in the original TCL14 design, they could be included in subsequent library
   designs to provide additional diversity for de novo selection or for example for an affinity
   maturation library on a select TCL 14 target specific hit.

   randomize long stretches of consecutive amino acids, it may produce FN3 binding
   molecules that are more soluble and stable than previously described libraries. The
10 TCL 14 library described produces a flat or concave interaction surface in comparison to
   the curved surface of previous libraries. Thus, FN3 molecules selected from TCL14 are
   likely to bind to distinct antigens and epitopes as those found from previous FN3 library
   designs. The TCL14 library design may also allow for the production of two distinct
   binding surfaces on the same molecule to achieve bi-specificity.

   Generation of the TCL14 library
            The TCL 14 library described above was expressed using the cis-display system
   (Odegrip et aL, ProcNatl Acad Sci USA 101: 2806-2810, 2004). In this system, the
   library is ligated to DNA fragments encoding the RepA coding sequence, cis and on
20 elements, and a Tac promoter, and the resulting ligation product is in vitro
   transcribed/translated. The produced TCLI4-RepA fusionproteins are bound in cisto the
   DNA by which the fusion proteins are encoded. The library is screened for scaffold
   molecules binding specifically to proteins of interest, the molecules are isolated and the
   bound DNA amplified to identify the coding sequences of the bound scaffold molecules.
25          TCL 14 library was generated by randomizing positions L32, Q34, Q36 (C-strand),
   S38, E39, K40, V41 (CD-loop), T68, S70, Y72 (F-strand), H78, R79, and N81 (FG-loop)

   and the C:D loop and the primer F-FG-Sf E861-R (SEQ ID No. 52) was used to randomize
 5 the F strand and the FG loop. The final ligation was amplified with the primers
   RIReeFor (SEQ ID NO: 53) and DigLigRev (SEQ ID NO: 54) to generate The TCL14
   library for in vitro transcription/translation. Table 6 shows the sequences of the primers

   Characterization of the TCL14 library
            The generated TCLI4 library was PCR cloned into a modified pET 15 vector
   (EMD Biosciences) containing a ligase independent cloning site (pETI54-LIC) using
   TCON6 (SEQ ID NO: 55) and TCONS E861 short (SEQ ID NO: 56) primers, and the
20 proteins were expressed as C-terminal His6-tagged proteins after transformations and
                                                   32

   IPTG induction (1 mM final, 30*C for 16 hours) using standard protocols. The cells were
   harvested by centrifugation and subsequently lysed with Bugbuster HT (EMD Chemicals,
   Gibbstown, NJ) supplemented with 0.2 mg/mL Chicken Egg White Lysozyme (Sigma
   Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The bacterial lysates were clarified by centrifugation and the
 5 supernatants were transferred to new 96 deepwell plates. The proteins were purified using
   a 96 well Ni-NTA Multitmp Plate (GE Lifescienices, Piscataway, NJ).
            A random selection of clones was picked and sequences to evaluate obtained
   distribution in the library. The observed diversity in the library was well in accordance to
   the expected (Figure 7). To calculate the observed diversity in the full length library
10 clones, the total number of times a given amino acid appeared in the diversified library
   regions was counted in all clones and divided by the total number of random positions (13
   random library positions * 69 full length clones) and multiplied by 100 to yield %
   Frequency. The Expected Diversity is based on the NNS degenerate codon with the
   following amino acid distribution: Phe=1, Leu=3, lle=1, Met=1, Val=2, Ser=3, Pro=2,
15 Thi2, Ala=2, Cys=t, Arg=3, Gly=2, Tyrl, His=1, Gln=l, Asn=t, Lys=1, Asp=l,
   Glu=1, Trp=l codon(s) divided by the total number of codons (32) multiplied by 100 to
   yield %Frequency.
            Purified proteins were subjected to size exclusion chromatography to determine
   the aggregation propensity of individual library members. The elation profiles of select
20 clones were determined by injecting 10 pL of the purified proteins onto a Superdex 75
   5/150 column using an Agilent 1200 HPLC with absorbance read at 280 nm. -80% of the
   non-cysteine containing clones eluted as a single, monomeric peak, thus signifying that the
   majority individual library members have retained the intrinsic solubility and structure of
   the parent molecule. Some molecules containing free cysteine were found to oxidize after
25 purification and thus elute as dimeric molecules.
            Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to further characterize clones
   that had a monodispersed profile as determined by SEC analysis. DSC data was obtained
   by heating 0.5 mg/mL solutions for each clone in PBS from 350C to 95"C at a rate of
    I"C/min in a VP-DSC capillary cell microcalorimeter (Microcal, LLC, Piscataway, NJ).
30 Melting temperatures were calculated for each clone using CpCalc (Microcal, LLC,
   Piscataway, NJ) software with a summary of the data shown in Table 7. The average
   melting temperature of the tested molecules was 70 9"C. The obtained data
   demonstrates that the TCL14 library design produces scaffold molecules that have retained
   a significant amount of the thermal stability of the parent molecule Tencon25 (93*C) and
35 are themselves inherently thermally stable and well folded.

   Selection of TCL14 library molecules specifically binding to target molecules of
   interest
            The TCLI4 library was screened against various target proteins of different
10 protein classes consisting of cell surface receptor extracellular domains, cytokines,
   kinases, phosphatases, heat shock proteins and immunoglobulins and their fragments to
   identify scaffold molecules specifically binding to these proteins and/or protein domains.
   Purified soluble proteins expressed in HEK293 or E. coli cells were biotinylated using the
   EZ-Link No-Weigh Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin Microtubes (Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL)
15 followed by extensive dialysis into PBS. For selections, 3 pg of TCL14 library was in
   vitro transcribed and translated (IVTT) in E. Coli S30 Linear Extract (Promega, Madison,
   WI) and the expressed library blocked with Cis Block (2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
   Louis, MO), 100 pg/ml Herring Sperm DNA (Promega, Madison, WI), I mg/mL heparin
   (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For selection, each biotinylated target protein was added
20 at concentrations of 400 nM (Round 1), 200 nM (Rounds 2 and 3) and 100 nM (Rounds 4
   and 5). Bound library members were recovered using neutravidin magnetic beads
   (Thenno Fisher, Rockford, IL) (Rounds 1. 3, and 5) or streptavidin magnetic beads
   (Promega, Madison, WI) (Rounds 2 and 4) and unbound library members were removed
   by washing the beads 5-14 times with 500 PL PBST followed by 2 washes with 500 pL
25 PBS.
                                                  34

            Following rounds of selection, the DNA output was amplified by PCR and
   subeloned into pET1 54-LIC using standard protocols.
            Additional selection rounds were performed in order to identify scaffold
   molecules with improved affinities for two target proteins. Briefly, outputs from round 5
 5 were prepared as described above and subjected to additional iterative rounds of selection
   with the following changes: incubation with biotinylated target protein was decreased
   from 1 hour to 15 minutes and bead capture was decreased from 20 minutes to 15 minutes,
   biotinylated target protein decreased to 25 nM (Rounds 6 and 7) or 2.5 nM (Rounds 8 and
   9), and an additional I hour wash was performed in the presence of an excess of non
10 biotinylated target protein. The goal of these changes was to simultaneously select for
   binders with a potentially faster on-rate and a slower off-rate yielding a substantially lower
   Ko. The 9" round output was PCR amplified, cloned and expressed as described above.
   In vitro characterization of scaffold molecules binding to proteins and/or protein
15 domains of interest
   Binding
            Enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) was performed on 188 individual
   clones from the round 5 panning outputs. Maxisorp plates (Nune, Rochester, NY) were
   coated with 0.1 pg anti-His antibody (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) overnight, washed with Tris
20 Buffered Saline, pH 7.4 with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) and blocked using Starting Block
   T20 (Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL). Clarified bacterial lysates containing I pg/ml His
   tagged TCL I4-RepA fusions or a control protein (human serum albumin) were applied
   onto the wells of the coated plates. The plates were incubated for 1 hour, washed with
   TBST and the biotinylated protein detected with streptavidin-HRP (Jackson
25 Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) and POD chemilniescent substrate (Roche,
   Indianapolis, TN) using Molecular Devices M5 plate reader. Performance of the library
   was assessed by a hit rate. The hit rate was defined as the percent (%)of scaffold
   molecules having 10-fold luminescence signal above the control signal divided by the total
   number of clones screened (188). As shown in Table 8, the TLC14 library yielded
30 scaffold molecules with hit rates ranging between 8%to 45% for eight distinct proteins.
   Cytokine 2 is mouse IL-1 7A.

 5 Characterization of mouse IL-I 7A binders
   IL-17A Receptor Inhibition
            An inhibition assay was performed to determine if the round 5 and 9 panning
   outputs against mouse IL-17A (miL-17A) inhibited binding of mlL-17A to the mIL-17A
   receptor. Maxisorp plates were coated with 0.2 g/ml m1L-17A receptor Fe fusion (R&D
10 Systems, Minneapolis, MN) overnight, washed with Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS), pH
   7.4 with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) and blocked with 2% BSA, 5% Sucrose in PBS. 10
   ng/ml biotinylated-mIL17A (b-mIL-17A) was added into the clarified bacterial lysates
   diluted 1:50 in 1% BSA in PBS, and the mixtures were incubated for 20 minutes. The
   blocked plates were washed and the bacterial lysates/b-mIL- I7A incubations were
15 transferred onto the plates. The plates were incubated for an additional hour, washed with
   PBST, and the biotinylated protein detected with streptavidin-HRP (Jackson
   Immmoresearch, West Grove, PA) and OPD colorimetric substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
   Louis, MO). Absorbance at 490 nmr was read using an M5 plate reader (Molecular
   Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and the data converted to %inhibition. Percent inhibition for
20 mIL-17A:mlL-1 7 receptor binding was defined as 100..(sample/negalive control x 100).
            Select bacterial lysates containing the scaffold molecules inhibiting the mIL
    I 7A:mIL- 17 receptor interaction were further characterized in a dose response inhibition
   assay using the protocol described above, except that 100 M1 of purified TCL 14-His (Ni
   NTA) fusion proteins were used in the assays between concentrations of 10 pM to 56 pM.
25 IC50 values were calculated from the dose response curves using a sigmoidal dose
                                                  36

   response fit. As summarized in Table 9, the mIL-17A specific inhibitors have a range of
   IC50s from -9 to -428 pM.

   Affinity Measurements
            The affinities of select molecules binding to mIL-1 7A were measured using
10 surface Plasmon resonance using a ProteOn XPR-36 instrument (Bio-Rad). Purified
   molecules were directly immobilized on the chip via amine coupling with varying
   densities (100-300 Rus) at pH 5.0 and a flow rate of 30 pL/min for 5 minutes. mIL-17A
   at 100 nM diluted in a 3-fold concentration series was tested for their binding to different
   molecules on the chip surface. The dissociation phases for all concentrations of all
15 samples was monitored for 1 - 2 hours at a flow rate of 100 pL/min depending on their
   off-rate. A buffer sample was injected to monitor the baseline stability and the surface
   was not regenerated for further use, The response data for all concentration series for each
   of the different surfaces of the scaffold molecules selected from the TLC14 library were
   globally fit to a 1:1 simple langmuir binding model to extract estimates of the kinetic  0k-,

   molecules specifically binding mIL-17A were at a subnanomolar range.
   Sequences of select mIL-17A binders are shown in SEQ ID NOS: 85-96, and the
   sequences of the C and F beta-strands and the CD and the FG loops in Table 10.

   EXAMPLE 4; Tencon27 libraries randomized at a second alternative surface
           A second alternative surface on Tencon27 resides on the opposite side of the C
   CD-F-FG surface as visualized in Figure 2C, herein called the A-AB-B-BC-E surface,
10 formed by the A beta-strand, the AB loop, the B beta-strand, the BC loop, and the E beta
                                               38

   strand. The A-AB-B-BC-E surface is also slightly concave, and can be used as a template
   to design libraries of protein scaffold interaction surfaces by randomizing a subset of
   residues that form the surface. Beta-strands have a repeating structure with the side chain
   of every other residue exposed to the surface of the protein. Thus, a library can be made
 5 by randomizing some or all surface exposed residues in the beta-strands. By choosing the
   appropriate residues in the beta-strands, the inherent stability of the Tencon27 scaffold
   should be minimally compromised while providing a unique scaffold surface for
   interaction with other proteins. Randomizing the A-AB-B-BC-E surface will produce a
   binding surface on the opposite side of the Tencon27 structure when compared to the
10 TCL 14 library design. The library design on Tencon27 with randomized A-AB-B-BC-E
   surface is shown in SEQ ID NO: 61 (the TCL15 library) and in Figure 6.

   EXAMPLE 5: Other FN3 domains: generation of libraries by randomizing
   alternative surfaces
            The library designs utilizing alternative surfaces described in the examples for the
   Tencon27 scaffold can be applied to other FN3 domains of various proteins due to the
25 structural similarity among the FN3 domains. Such FN3 domains may be naturally
   occurring or synthetic, and are for example a Fibcon consensus scaffold (SEQ ID NO: 58)
   based on a consensus sequence of fibronectin domains (U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2010/0255056),
   the 10' FN3 domain of liuman fibronectin (FNI0) (SEQ ID NO: 97), or the 3" FN3
   domain from human tenascin (TN3) (SEQ ID NO: 3), or any FN3 domain present in
30 proteins listed in Table 1.
            Library designs for Fibcon, FN 10 and TN3 libraries with randomized C-CD-F-FG
   alternative surfaces are shown in Figure 8 and in SEQ ID NOS: 62, 98, and 99,
   respectively. Designed libraries are synthesized, expressed and selected for specific
   binders using protocols described within.

            Similarly to as described for the Tencon27 scaffold, some or all of the residues
