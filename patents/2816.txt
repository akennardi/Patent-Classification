       APPARATUS AND METHODS FOR SETTING A GRIND COARSENESS
                                   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001] The present invention is directed generally to the preparation of beverages from
ground plant material. In particular, but not exclusively, the invention is directed to defining
coarseness of a coffee bean grounds in the preparation of a coffee-based beverage.
                               BACKGROUD TO THE INVENTION
[0002] The coffee bean has been used as the basis of a beverage for more than one thousand
years, having its origins in North Africa about the   1 0 th century. The beverage was introduced
to Europeans in the     1 7 th century, and today is consumed virtually worldwide and in large
quantities.
[0003] Coffee beverages can be prepared by many different means, however all rely on
disruption of the physical integrity of the coffee bean, with the extraction of important
flavour and bioactive compounds from the interior of the bean into water.            Many coffee
beverages are produced by firstly roasting the green bean, followed by grinding the bean into
a plurality of particles. The particles are contacted with water (typically hot water) such that
the coffee compounds are extracted. The solid and liquid phases are separated and the liquid
phase consumed.
[0004] One example of an extraction method is the well-known espresso extraction process.
This process operates by forcing heated water through a prepared bed of coffee particles. The
coffee particles are penetrated by the water causing them swell as the sugars and resins within
are solubilised allowing them to be carried out of the solid particles by the water. Typically,
the ground coffee is placed into a shallow filter basket, and then tamped (compressed) to
reduce the volume of the void space between the particles.            The reduction in void space
volume limits the ability of water to pass through the particle bed unimpeded, and instead
forces the water to contact the particles so as to increase the amount of coffee compounds
extracted. After tamping, the basket is manually engaged with the espresso machine which
                                                  1

pushes heated water through the particle bed, through the filter in the basket, to form a liquor
which flows into a coffee cup below.
[0005] In a retail environment, coffee beverages a best prepared from whole coffee beans
which have been ground immediately before brewing. Control of the grinding conditions is of
utmost importance, as incorrect milling can negatively affect the properties of the ground
material and therefore, the flavour of the resultant beverage. During grinding, the surface area
of the coffee bean material increases, thereby increasing the attack surface area available for
the water to contact, which in turn, enables the more efficient transfer of the coffee
compounds into the water. In the espresso grind, single bean is broken into several thousand
particles. The grind (i.e. the number and size of the particles into which a bean has been
ground) is directly related to the extraction time. The extraction time is the time taken for the
water to release the desired contents from the ground particles; with 25 to 30 seconds being
considered optimal.      Over extraction is to be avoided given the propensity for bitter
compounds to be drawn from the bean.
[0006] Furthermore, very fine grinds pack together too closely thereby increasing the
resistance to water flow through the coffee mass. This resistance can deny water access
through the grind during brewing to again affecting the taste of the final beverage.
[0007] Given the importance of particle size, the prior art provides apparatus and methods for
directly or indirectly determining the distribution of particles sizes, and therefore instructs as
to the coarseness of fineness of the grind. One commonly used indirect method relies on
measuring the length of time taken to perform an extraction of a given volume of coffee
liquor. A larger grind size typically results in a shorter time given the larger void volume of a
coarse grind.    This method is however fraught with unreliability given the potential for
extraneous variables such as the tamping force used, basket geometry and the like. Even if
all variables are removed, any time period determined as optimum is only relevant to the
particular espresso machine, coffee, and the grinder used.
[0008] A more direct method of determining particle is based on a sieving method such as
that devised by the United States Department of Commerce in the 1940's. The procedure
utilizes a contrivance termed a "RoTap" which consists of four wire screens having
decreasing mesh size stacked one on top of the other. When attached to a vibrating machine,
                                                 2

coffee particles fall through the various size screens to create a particle distribution.    The
procedure involves placing a set mass of ground coffee on the uppermost screen and allowing
the machine to shake for a set time. Upon completion, all screens are removed and the coffee
remaining in each sieve is weighed. By this method a particle distribution curve can be
generated.
[0009] Whilst the use of a RoTap and similar apparatus allows for a grinding process to be
optimised so as to produce a desired particle size distribution, such means are clearly labour
and time intensive, wasteful of coffee, and require complex hardware.              In any event,
unreliable results may be provided, especially at particle sizes preferred for the espresso
extraction process (typically a median particle size of around 200 pim).
[0010] Given the problems associated with sieving techniques, laser diffraction methods have
become widely accepted for the characterization of ground coffee. While these methods
provide unprecedented accuracy in the determination of particle size distribution, the
instrumentation required is complex, expensive and not suited to use in a retail environment.
[0011] While particle size is undoubtedly important, the shape of the particles has a further
effect on coffee flavour. Different grinder types (for example, burr versus blade grinders),
and different types of grinding surfaces (such as use of a conical burr versus a flat burr)
provide a further variable in the general aim of providing a grind which reproducibly
provides a superior coffee taste and aroma.
[0012] It is an aspect of the present invention to provide improved methods and apparatus for
determining an appropriate grind setting for a particular extraction process.        In a further
aspect, the present invention provides a useful alternative to prior art apparatus and methods.
[0013] The discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like is included
in this specification solely for the purpose of providing a context for the present invention. It
is not suggested or represented that any or all of these matters formed part of the prior art
base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present invention as it

                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0069] The present invention is described herein mainly by reference to ground coffee beans
as the mass of particulate coffee beans, and particularly with regard to the use of ground
coffee beans in an espresso extraction method. This is for the sake of clarity and brevity, and
should not be taken as any restriction on the ambit of the present invention.
[0070] The present invention is predicated at least in part on the Applicant's finding that
characteristics of ground coffee may be better considered where the mass of ground coffee is
considered as a whole by way of density measurement.           This is in contrast to prior art
methods which rely on the measurement of the sizes of individual coffee bean particles to
generate a particle size distribution curve.     Even where the present invention does not
provide any advantage in terms of superior characterisation of the ground coffee, advantage
may be provided in that the present methods, apparatus and systems are more simple or
economical as compared with the prior art.
[0071] Accordingly, in a first aspect the present invention provides a method for determining
a characteristic of a mass of particulate plant material, the method comprising the step of
determining the density of a mass of particulate plant material. As applied to the espresso
extraction of ground coffee beans at least, the skilled person is entirely familiar with the
various means by which coffee beans (which are in fact seeds of the coffee plant) may be
roasted and ground for use in the preparation a coffee liquor for consumption. The skilled
person understands that the ground coffee may be placed in a filter basket and compressed to
some degree with a tamp or similar contrivance in preparation for heated water from the
coffee machine to be forced through the compressed ground coffee mass so as to form a
liquor.  These well-known means of preparing a liquor are utilized in the context of the
present invention given the general aim of reproducing so far as possible the conditions under
which ground coffee is prepared.      Given that the present invention in the first aspect is
directed to methods for determining a characteristic of a ground coffee bean mass, the
characteristics so determined should be reflective of and relevant to methods used in the real
world to prepare coffee. In this way, any characteristic so determined by the method may be
applied to the actual production of a coffee liquor for consumption using a retail or a
domestic coffee machine.
                                               11

[0072] As will become clear from considering this specification in its entirety, preferred
forms of the invention require various items of hardware that mimic those used in the retail
and domestic preparation of coffee beverages.        Furthermore, various method steps are
configured to mirror the actions of a person preparing coffee beverage.
[0073] As is clear form the Background section, the coffee liquor is the liquid phase resulting
from the water extraction of desirable (and sometimes undesirable) compounds from the
ground coffee bean. It is proposed that determination of the density of the whole ground
coffee mass provides an indication of the propensity for the coffee compounds to be water
extracted from the mass of particulate plant seed material. This propensity for extraction is
applicable to both desirable and undesirable coffee compounds, and is therefore key in setting
a grind (with respect to coarseness or fineness) to extract the desirable compounds while
leaving the undesirable compounds in the bean material. As the skilled person understands,
undesirable compounds are typically extracted later in the brewing process, and so a grind
coarseness or fineness is chosen so as favour the extraction of desirable components over
undesirable components for a given extraction time (normally 25 to 30 seconds). Where the
propensity for water extraction is higher, then a more coarse grind may be used so as to
inhibit the extraction of undesirable compounds within the extraction time.       In a coarser
grind, the particles of coffee bean have a relatively low surface area to volume ratio, and
accordingly compounds are less rapidly extracted. This delays the extraction of undesirable
compounds and therefore provides a greater likelihood that such compounds do not enter the
liquor. A negative corollary is that desirable compounds may be extracted in lower amounts.
[0074] Conversely, in a finer grind the particles of coffee bean are smaller and have a
relatively high surface area to volume ratio, and accordingly compounds are more rapidly
extracted.  This increases the extraction of desirable compounds and therefore provides a
greater likelihood that such compounds enter the liquor.        A negative corollary is that
undesirable compounds may be extracted in higher amounts.
[0075] Thus, a balance must be arrived at in order to provide a coffee liquor with a full
flavour, but with limited amounts of bitter undesirable compounds.
                                                12

[0076] As provided by the present invention, a person seeking to prepare a coffee liquor in a
manner that favours the extraction of desirable over undesirable compounds may refer to a
target density of the coffee to decide an appropriate coarseness or fineness setting on a coffee
bean grinder.
[0077] Other parameters such as the force of compaction of the coffee particles, or the mass
of coffee particles, or the extraction time, or the water temperature or the water pressure may
be modified so as to achieve the general aim of favouring the extraction of desirable over
undesirable compounds, however setting of the grinder is preferred for reasons of simplicity
and reproducibility.
[0078] The propensity for a plant compound to be water-extracted from the ground coffee
bean mass may be measured by reference to: the time taken to extract one or more plant
compounds (a shorter time being indicative of a higher propensity), or a flow rate of water
flowing through the mass (a longer time being indicative of a higher propensity), or a time
taken to form a given volume of a liquid phase (a longer time being indicative of a higher
propensity), or a taste and/or aroma of a liquid phase formed from water flowing through the
mass (a stronger flavour or aroma being indicative of a higher propensity).            A highly
subjective method for determining the propensity for a plant compound to be water-extracted
from the ground coffee bean mass is by use of analytical techniques.              Tools such as
spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry, chromatography (such as TLC or GC) and the like
may be used to identify and quantitate water-extracted coffee compounds.
[0079] The density of a coffee ground mass may also reflect characteristics of the spaces (or
"galleries") between the coffee bean particles. Together, the spaces form the "void volume"
of the coffee bean particle mass. These spaces affect how the water passes through the mass.
Where the spaces are small, water must take a more tortuous path from the water entry point
(typically the upper face of the mass) to the water exit point, typically the bottom face of the
mass. A more tortuous path will generally increase the water residence time in the mass,
thereby increasing the opportunity for coffee compounds to be extracted.
[0080] Measuring the density of the coffee ground mass may be achieved by any means
deemed suitable by the skilled artisan. As is well known in the art, density is calculated by
                                                 13

reference to a weight per unit volume.        For example, Ig of water has a volume of lcm3 .
Accordingly, the density of water may be expressed as lg/cm3 .
[0081] As will be appreciated, means for density determination that is cost-effective and easy
to implement in a retail or a domestic environment is preferred.
[0082] In one aspect of the invention there is provided a system or an apparatus for
measuring the density of a mass of particulate plant material, the system or apparatus
comprising: an experimental vessel having a void configured to retain a mass of particulate
plant material therein, volume measurement means configured to measure the volume
occupied by a mass of particulate plant material that has been disposed within the void of the
experimental vessel. This aspect of the invention may be provided by way of a substantially
unitary apparatus having a number of components that function in a cooperating manner.
Alternatively the components may be discrete yet nevertheless form a system, in which case
the components may be operated substantially independently.
[0083] In order to faithfully reproduce the density of the coffee particles as would be
observed when used in an actual beverage making process, the experimental vessel is
preferably configured to reproduce the vessel in which the ground coffee mass is disposed in
the context of an extraction machine (in this case, a coffee making machine capable of
causing water, preferably heated water, through the coffee particle mass with or without the
assistance of pressure).    The experimental vessel typically comprises a void to receive the
ground coffee. The void is generally of fixed internal dimension, with at least one dimension
being consistent with a dimension of an extraction machine vessel.           Where the void is
cylindrical (which is typical for filter baskets) the diameter of void is consistent with that of
the filter basket of the extraction machine which is intended to produce the actual coffee
liquor for consumption. The diameter of the experimental vessel void may be about 50mm,
51mm, 52mm, 53mm, 54mm, 55mm, 56mm, 57mm, 58mm, 59mm or 60mm. Preferably the
diameter is about 53 mm or 58mm, and is more preferably 58 mm in diameter. Where the
void has two or more diameters, any of the aforementioned diameters may be the greatest of
the diameters, or the diameter in an uppermost region of the experimental vessel.
[0084] The void may be formed so as to have a profile similar to or substantially the same as
that of the filter basket for which it is intended to replicate. In some embodiments, there is a
                                                 14

lower region of the void which is of smaller diameter than the upper region so as to mimic a
particular type of filter basket that is often used in the making of coffee beverages.
[0085] The depth of the vessel will be at least the depth of the coffee machine filter basket
used to prepare the coffee liquor for consumption. Typically the void will be somewhat
deeper given the need to insert a tamp, and in some embodiments the tamp being required to
be disposed some way down inside the void such that a measurement may be read from a
scale engraved on the tamp against the vessel upper edge, as further described infra.
[0086] The experimental vessel is typically fabricated from a rigid and deformation-resistant
material such as a high impact plastic, or a metal such as stainless steel.            In some
embodiments, a tamp is used to compress the coffee particle mass and the void should
maintain its geometry and dimensions in the face of forces exerted.
[0087] In some embodiments, the experimental vessel has an upwardly extending wall
capable of retaining uncompressed coffee particles before tamping, and (ii) guide a
compression means downwardly and onto the coffee particles to mimic the tamping process.
The sidewall may serve the further function of ensuring that the lower surface of the
compression means is maintained parallel to the floor of the experimental vessel so as to
ensure the coffee is compressed evenly.
[0088] The present apparatus or system may comprise compression means, typically in the
form of piston-like contrivance having a planar lower face configured to contact and bear
against the coffee particles in the upper region of the mass.         The compression means is
typically configured to fit snugly within the void of the experimental vessel, and be capable
of sliding upwardly and downwardly therein in a piston-like manner.             The compression
means is generally used to mimic the process of tamping the coffee particles into a
compressed form, as is performed normally in the espresso extraction process.
[0089] At the end opposing the planar lower surface is typically a handle of some description
configured to allow a user to exert a downward force thereon, and also to remove the
compression means from the void. The planar face and handle are typically connected by a
member, stem or other suitable structure.
                                                  15

[0090] The compression means may comprise a mechanism allowing for a predetermined
force to be applied to the coffee particles disposed within the void.           This allows for
replication of the tamping process, whereby a force of about 10kg, 15kg or 20kg is applied by
a user to the tamp handle.
[0091] For example, the compression means may comprise a spring which when compressed
a predetermined distance exerts the predetermined force. In this embodiment, the spring is
connected to the compression means handle at one end and a head region having the planar
face at the other end. Thus, the handle can be pushed downwardly until the lower edge of the
handle contacts a ledge on the head region. At that juncture, the predetermined force has
been applied to the coffee particles, and the user permitted to release the handle and allow the
spring to recoil.
[0092] In order to calculate density, the volume of the compressed coffee particle mass is
measured.     In one embodiment of the system or apparatus the experimental vessel or
compression means has a scale applied thereto.        In one embodiment, the vessel may be
transparent and the upper edge of the compressed coffee particle mass readable against a
scale printed onto the vessel wall in much the same way the volume of a fluid in a burette is
read against a scale. Where the vessel is opaque, the compression means may have a scale
along its length. The scale may be read against the tope edge of the vessel so as to provide an
indication of the depth of the compressed coffee particle mass. The scale is read with the
planar face of the compression means resting on the upper surface of the compressed coffee
particle mass. The more shallow the depth of the compressed particle mass, the deeper the
compression means is allowed to sit within the void, and the lower the number read off the
scale on the compression means. As will be appreciated, the scale will therefore be gradated
with higher numbers toward the lower end of the scale (i.e. the end of the scale more
proximal to the planar surface) and lower number toward the upper end of the scale (i.e. the
end more proximal to the handle of the compression means). To improve accuracy, the scale
may be configured as a Vernier scale or similar.
[0093] The depth of the compressed coffee particle mass is recorded for use in the calculation
of density.
                                                16

[0094] Also required for the density calculation is the weight of coffee used to form the
coffee particle mass. Typically, a weight is used which is consistent with the actual espresso
extraction process to be mimicked. The weight may be about 1Og, 1 Ig, 12g, 13g, 14g, 15g,
16g, 17g, 18g, 19g, 20g, 21g, 22g, 23g, 24g, 25g, 26g, 27g, 28g, 29g, or 30g. Weights in the
range of about 15g to about 25g are commonly used in the preparation of a coffee liquor.
[0095] The coffee may be weighed in a separate vessel and then transferred to the
experimental vessel. More conveniently the coffee is weighed in situ by firstly placing the
experimental vessel on the platform of a weighing means (such as a balance), and then taring
the balance to zero. Coffee particles are then added to the vessel while the user reads the
balance until the required weight is reached.
[0096] The present invention may be extended further to characterization of plant material
(and preferably coffee beans) higher in the supply chain.          For example, the experimental
vessel of the present invention may be used to measure density of green and roasted beans.
Green bean is traditionally traded from green bean merchants with a bulk density reading,
usually expressed in hectolitres (1 hectolitre  = 100 litres). It is done this way to indicate how
dense the bean is as part of the product sheet. This and other information on the sheet helps
the coffee bean roaster to determine roasting profiles. The denser the bean, the higher the
hectolitre reading, and usually the more heat required to roast it. To correlate a hectolitre
reading to the bush and bush cup, hectolitres is converted to specific gravity. This reduces
100 litres to 1 litre, which is calculated by dividing the hectolitre reading by 100. In this way
the Applicant uses the bush and bush density cup to determine bulk density reading.
Bulk density verses density
[0097] The Applicant proposes that a bulk density measurement performed according to the
prior art is inherently flawed. Bulk density is a collection of beans, i.e. a "bulk amount" of
beans which is inclusive of air voids in the total measurement. These air spaces can provide
errors in calculation given that they are included in the total volume used to calculate density,
but have a density of essentially zero.     Larger or smaller beans have size different sized air
spaces which in turn will give different density readings based on the differential volumes of
the void airspaces. Smaller airspaces will naturally provide more beans per volume and
therefore give the indication of a denser bulk density, when in fact it may not be the case. It
has been found that a more accurate bean density reading may be provided by taking account
                                                 17

of the void spaces between beans. Reference is made to Example 2 herein detailing a method
of calculating true bean density using water to calculate the void volume of the airspaces
present between the bean and then to calculate a bean density in a manner that discounts the
confounding effect of void airspaces.
[0098] Not only does using the bush and bush density cup hold the advantage of determining
density of both green and the resulting roasted bean, but in conjunction with a moisture meter
readings and roasted weight loss information allow for roasting profiles to be customized to
achieve a resulting brew profile which may be accurately duplicated across various bean
densities.
Green Been to Roasted Bean to Brewed Coffee Beverage.
[0099] Because the Bush and Bush density cup is already used to create specific density
readings for espresso coffee, the present invention provides means to generate roast and brew
profiles covering the entire span from green bean, to roasted bean, to ground bean, by using
accurately determined whole bean density ground bean density as a means for characterizing
coffee in a cohesive manner from the green bean state used for roasting, through to the
ground state used for brewing coffee beverages.       Accordingly, in one aspect the present
invention provides a method for characterizing a plant bean material comprising the steps of
(i) measuring the density of the beans of the plant bean material in a manner which discounts
the presence of airspaces about the beans, and (ii) measuring the density of ground material
prepared from the plant bean material. Preferably the step of measuring at step (i) is by a
method as described herein. Preferably the step of measuring at step (ii) is by a method as
described herein.
[0100] Reference is now made to FIG. 1A shows an exemplary experimental vessel, and FIG.
1B which shows a compression means suitable for use with the vessel.
[0101] Turning firstly to the experimental vessel 10, the vessel is generally cup-shaped
having a cylindrical wall 20 defining an upper edge 25 which is circumferential to an opening
30. A large cylindrical void 35 is defined by the wall 20 and floor 40.
                                               18

[0102] The compression means matched to the vessel in this embodiment is a modified tamp
100, having a handle 110, with a handle member 115 slidingly engaged with a sleeve 120, the
sleeve 120 in turn attached to the head 125. The head 125 terminates in a planar surface 130.
[0103] The 110 handle and handle member 115 (being fixed together) are movable upwardly
and downwardly by a user. The handle 110 and handle member 115 are biased in the upward
direction (as drawn) by an internal spring (not shown).         When the handle 110 is urged
downwardly by the user, the downward force is transferred to the internal spring, and in turn
from the spring to head 125. The handle 110 is urged downwardly only to the point that the
lower edge 112 of the handle 110 collides with the upper edge 122 of the sleeve 120. At that
point, a predetermined force is applied to the head 125.
[0104] The method of use of the vessel 10 and tamp 100 to determine the density of an
amount of coffee particles now follows.
[0105] The following examples are provided to enable those skilled in the art to more clearly
understand and practice the invention. They should not be considered as limiting the scope of
the invention, but merely as being illustrated as representative thereof.
EXAMPLE 1: Method for the determination of the density of a coffee bean grind.
[0106] This exemplary method requires the experimental vessel 10 as shown in FIG. 1A, and
the matched tamp 100 as shown in FIG 1B.
[0107] Step 1: The vessel 10 is placed on a balance 200, and the balance 200 tared to zero,
as shown in FIG. 2A.
[0108] Step 2: The vessel 10 is loaded with an amount of ground coffee 300 which would
typically be used in a filter basket extraction. The weight of ground coffee is noted (in this
example, 18.6 g), and entered into the density calculation application software. Reference is
made to FIG. 2B.
                                                19

[0109] Step 3: The vessel 10 is removed from the balance 200 and placed on a firm surface
and gently oscillated in a side-to-side-manner so as to gently level the contained grounds.
The tamp head 125 is inserted into the vessel void 30, as shown in FIG 2C.
[0110] Step 4: The tamp handle 110 is pushed down until the lower edge 112 of the handle
110 just touches the upper edge 122 of the sleeve 120, as shown in FIG 2D. This indicates
that a predetermined compression force has been applied to the ground coffee (the downward
force indicted by the small arrows). The tamp 100 can be adjusted to exert a force of 10kg,
15kg or 20kg. Industry standard is typically 15kg, and in this example a tamp force value of
15kg was used.
[0111] Step 5: The tamp handle 110 is released, and the scale marked on the outside of the
tamp head 125 is read against the top edge 25 of the vessel 10, as shown in FIG. 2E. Firstly,
the user reads the whole numbers scale, i.e. the whole number above the top edge, and then
the 1/10th unit that is positioned level with the top edge. In this example the measurement
would be 6.1 mm. This is tamp length value, and is entered into the application software.
[0112] The Volumetric Density Formula D=M/V can now be satisfied (by software means)
according to the equation:
                                 D= M/(r       2 x TL)
Where:
                D is the density of the compressed ground coffee particles (at the tamp force
                used),
                M is the mass of ground coffee that was used for the test (in grams),
                r is the radius of the vessel void (in mm), and
                TL is the tamp length value read from the engraved scale after compression
                with the tamp at 15kg.
[0113] In this example, the aim was to reproduce conditions for a standard 58mm filter
basket, and so a vessel having a void diameter of 58mm (radius of 29mm) was used.
                                                  20

[0114] D is therefore solved for as follows:
                               D=18.6g/(7i x 29mm2 x 6.lmm)*0.001
                               D=18.6g/16.1136
                               D=1.154
[0115] Reference is now made to FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B which show in isolation an exemplary
experimental vessel 400, being generally cylindrical and having an opening 415 defined by a
wall 420. A void 430 is defined by the wall 420 and floor 425.
[0116] The vessel 400 is milled from solid stainless steel.
EXAMPLE 2: Method for the determination of coffee bean density.
[0117] This exemplary method requires the experimental vessel 10 as shown in FIG. 1A, and
a screen which fits within the vessel.
[0118] Step 1: An empty experimental vessel with screen is placed on balance which is then
tared to zero
[0119] Step 2: The screen is removed and the experimental vessel is filled with beans, and
the screen disposed on top of the beans. The weight of the beans is noted. In this example
the weight is 83.3 g.
[0120] Step 4: The experimental vessel is filled to the brim with water. The weight of the
beans plus the water is recorded. In this example, the weight is 144.7 g.
[0121] Step 5: Using the following Formula the density of the whole beans (which may be
green or roasted) is calculated.
        BD is Bean Density
        BW is Bean Weight
        WW is Wet Weight
                                               21

        Vessel volume is 131
        BD      = BW/(131-(WW-BW))
                =83.3/(131-(144.7-83.3))
                =83.3/(131-61.4)
                =83.3/69.6
                =1.19
[0122] Reference is now made to FIG. 4 which shows an exemplary tamp, configured to
snugly fit within the cylindrical void 430 of the experimental vessel 400 shown in FIG. 3.
The tamp 500 has a cylindrical head 505 milled form solid stainless steel, and having a
smooth external wall 510 and a lower tamping surface 515 which contacts coffee grounds
contained in the experimental vessel 400.       In use, the external wall 510 of the head 505
sliding engages with the internal wall of void 430 of the experimental vessel 400 of FIG. 3 so
as to ensure that the tamping surface 515 remains parallel with the vessel 400 floor 425,
which in turn ensures even tamping of the coffee grounds. The tamp 500 has a cylindrical
stem 520 which screws firmly into a thread 525 of the head 505.        The stem 520 has axial
cylindrical lumen into which a handle member 530 extends.            The handle member 530
slidingly engages and moves coaxially within the stem 520 lumen. The handle member 530
when in the most downward positon (as occurs when pushed downwardly by a user) exerts a
tamping pressure (by way of surface 515) on the coffee grounds below.
[0123] A mechanism may be incorporated into the tamp 500 to ensure that a predetermined
maximum tamping pressure is applied by way of surface 515 on the coffee grounds below.
For example, the mechanism may involve a spring connection which connects the handle
member 520 and cylindrical stem 530, and restricts the maximum pressure that can be
applied by the user pushing downwardly. In certain embodiments, the mechanism is
adjustable to allow the user to select a predetermined maximum tamping pressure. Of course,
the present invention is not restricted to any particular mechanism.
[0124] Given the benefit of the present specification, the skilled artisan will be enabled to
design vessels to mimic and vessel used in the producing of a beverage or indeed any other
liquid phase derived from the extraction of a plant material.       The skilled artisan will be
further enabled to design tamps matched to any such vessel.
                                                 22
