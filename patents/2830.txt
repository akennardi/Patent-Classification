                   STATEMENT CONCERNING GOVERNMENT INTEREST
   [0002]          The instant invention was made with U.S. government funding pursuant to US

                                          BACKGROUND
   [0003]          Existing nasal drug delivery devices do a poor job of penetrating the nasal
   cavity to deposit drug onto the medial turbinates for systemic delivery. Such existing devices
15 are also lacking in delivering drug to the upper nasal cavity for direct nose-to-brain delivery.
   Existing nasal drug delivery devices generate a wide plume which inadequately delivers a
   compound deep into the nasal cavity.

 5                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [000601         Described herein are nozzles that deliver a compound into the posterior
   regions of the nasal cavity. Current nasal delivery systems do not adequately deposit drug in
   posterior regions of the nasal cavity such as the respiratory epithelium and olfactory region.
   Described herein are nozzles that enhance drug deposition into these regions of the nasal
10 cavity.
   [000611         The nozzles disclosed herein consistently deposit at least a majority fraction of
   dose into the distal parts of the nasal cavity such as the respiratory epithelium and olfactory
   region. A drug product (also referred to as drug formulation, nasal dosage form and other
   like terms used in the art) is propelled with a velocity via the nozzle into the nasal cavity.
15 [000621         The nozzle may be used to deliver a compound to the upper olfactory region
   of a mammal or other animal. For instance, the user may be a human or non-human primate.
   The nozzle may have adult or pediatric users. In some aspects, the nozzle may be used in
   veterinary medicine. In some aspects, the nozzle may be used to deliver a therapeutic or
   palliative care compound.
20 [000631         Like named structures in the various embodiments function in the similar or
   same manner, are structurally the same or similar, and may be used in for the same or similar
   purpose.
   [000641         A nozzle is disclosed with a plurality of outlet orifices for delivery of a
   compound. The nozzle has a central longitudinal axis.          The nozzle houses a plurality of

                                                     7
   channels. The channels have a proximal end at which the compound to be delivered enters
   the channel and a distal end at which the compound exits the channel via an outlet orifice. In
   certain embodiments, the channels run parallel to the central axis of the nozzle. In other
   embodiments, the channels run substantially parallel to the central axis of the nozzle in that a
 5 line drawn thru a point on the outlet orifice is of equal distance to the central axis of the
   nozzle.
    [000651         The outlet orifices are arranged in parallel alignment with the central axis of
   the nozzle. In one aspect, the outlet orifices are arranged where a line drawn through the
   orifice has an equal distance from a line drawn through the center of the nozzle.            In yet
10 another aspect, the arrangement of the outlet orifices of the nozzle provides a narrow plume.
   In yet a further aspect, the outlet orifices are arranged so that the initial path of the compound
   as it exits the nozzle is substantially parallel to the central axis of the nozzle. In yet another
   aspect, the outlet orifices are arranged in parallel alignment, in a line of equal distance from a
   center of the nozzle, in an arrangement that provides for the delivery of a narrow plume, in an
15 arrangement that provides an initial path of the compound as it exits the nozzle substantially
   parallel to the central axis, or combinations thereof.
    1000661         In an embodiment, the angle of the plume delivered from the nozzle is about 5
   degrees, about 4 degrees, about 3 degrees, about 2 degrees, about I degree,. inclusive of
   endpoints. In an embodiment, the angle of the plume delivered from the nozzle is about 5
20 degrees. In yet another embodiment, the angle of the plume is 5 degrees, is 4 degrees, is 3
   degrees, is 2 degrees, or is     1 degree.   In a further embodiment, the angle of the plume
   delivered from the nozzle is 5 degrees.
    [000671         In embodiments of the nozzle, the impact force delivered by the nozzle having
   more than one outlet orifice is decreased.

   [000681         In embodiments of the nozzle, the delivery time is decreased for delivery of a
   compound by a nozzle having more than one outlet orifice.
   [000691         In another embodiment of the nozzle, the delivery time and the impact force is
   decreased by a nozzle having more than one outlet orifice.
 5 [000701         In embodiments of the nozzle, the outlet orifices are arranged so that the
   propellant entrains the compound to be delivered.           Without being bound by theory with
   regards to entrainment of the compound, the multiple streams exiting the nozzle created by
   the plurality of outlet orifices are better able to entrain air within the plume, thereby shielding
   the edges of the plume against friction induced turbulence at the edges of the plume.
10 [000711         As shown in FIG. 1, a drug product inlet 2 is configured to receive a mixture
   of gas propellant and a drug formulation. The drug formulation (prior to mixing with the gas
   propellant) may be in the form of a powder, dispersion, liquid or other suitable nasal delivery
   dosage form. A nozzle body 4 is secured to the drug product inlet 2. The mixture of gas
   propellant and drug formulation pass through circular, tube-shaped nozzle channels 6 before
15 exiting the outlet orifices 8, 12 thus releasing the mixture. The circular, tube-shaped nozzle
   channels 6 aligned parallel to a longitudinal axis running through the center of the nozzle
   body 4. The distal surface 10 of the nozzle body 4 is shown in the distal view along with the
   outlet orifices 12.
   [00072]         In one embodiment, the drug product inlet may be optional.               In another
20 embodiment, the nozzle has an attachment mechanism to the source of the compound being
   distributed from the nozzle.      The attachment mechanism may be a screw, snap or other
   suitable mechanism. In another embodiment, the drug product inlet and nozzle may be of
   uniform construction with the chamber, container or the like holding the compound being

   [000891         As shown in FIGS. 27 and 28, a bypass nozzle is shown and described.
   Nozzle C (Example 11) describes an annular gas bypass nozzle.              Nozzle C includes a
   chamber for the compound to be delivered and a chamber for the propellant. In one aspect,
   the compound is a drug and the propellant is a gas. The drug may be in liquid or powder
 5 form.    Nozzle C includes a channel to transport the drug. This drug channel is centered
   inside of another channel, the propellant channel, which serves to deliver the propellant. In
   one aspect, the drug channel transports a powder while the propellant channel delivers a gas.
   The dimensions of the drug channel with respect to the propellant channel affects the amount
   and velocity of gas emitted from the outlet of the nozzle. Both the powder transport channel
10 and the gas channel can be altered to change the performance of the nozzle assembly, as
   discussed in Example I1.
   [000901         Upon actuation of nozzle C, both chambers are pressurized and gas is emitted
   from the end of the nozzle as a uniform and symmetrical hollow cylinder, while at the same
   time the dose is emitted into the center of the gas cylinder. Depending on the configuration
15 of the two channels and the amount and type of gas used to drive the nozzle, the relative
   velocity of the gas and powder streams can be different, causing different effects on
   performance.    In one embodiment, multiple dose transport channels are placed in the center
   of the gas transport tube so that this nozzle design would deliver doses of more than one drug
   at the same time with minimal mixing before the drugs are deposited on the target surface or
20 tissue.
   [00091]         In one embodiment, the drug channel can transport a liquid, a powder, a gas,
   or combinations thereof.

   diameter of the compound chamber behind the nozzle. Upon activation of the device, the ball
   rolls up behind the drug and seats on the back side of nozzle D, thereby effectively
   preventing gas flow through the drug channel once the drug is released.
   [00093]         A variety of compounds may be delivered by the nozzle. In one embodiment,
 5 a mixture of drug and gas propellant is delivered by the nozzle. In another embodiment, a
   mixture of liquid propellant and drug is delivered by the nozzle. In another embodiment, a
   liquid propellant is delivered by the nozzle. In yet another embodiment, a drug is delivered
   by the nozzle. In yet other embodiments, a combination of compounds is delivered by the
   nozzle.
10 [00094]         The compound delivered by the nozzle may be a liquid, gas, solid, or
   combinations thereof. The compound may be a liquid or a powder. The compound may be a
   drug.
   [00095]         The nozzle may be used to deliver compounds to many environments.        The
   nozzle may be used to deliver a compound intranasally. The nozzle may be used to deliver a
15 compound orally, rectally, vaginally, topically, to the eye, or intranasally.
   [000961         The nozzle may be used to deliver medicaments or other compounds not for
   therapeutic use.     For example, the nozzle may be used to deliver a precise plume in
   manufacturing.

   stainless tubes (approximately 0.011 inch circular -orifice and approximately 5mm in length)
   mounted within an 18G stainless steel tube for a tight fit. No voids between the 25G and 15G
   tubes were filled, so the nozzle configuration had 5 additional ports, approximately triangular
    in shape, the nozzle ports surrounding the 5 circular ports.      In addition, a central void of
10 roughly pentagonal shape exists at the very center which was capable of passing a dose. The
    distal end of the nozzle was finished with all tubes flush and of equal length. The openings
   were finished clean and square.
    [0001001        Nozzle number 3, as shown in FIG. 22, was constructed having 6 outlets
    composed of 3, 23G stainless tubes assembled into a 15G stainless steel tube.          These fit
15  tightly and no glue or filler was used. In addition to the three nozzle ports from the 23G
    tubes, there were three additional approximately triangular shaped outlets from the nozzle.

    bend in the last 2mm of the tube at the distal end of the nozzle. These tubes were inserted
    into a 14G stainless steel tube so that their orientation was all the same around the perimeter
    of the 14G tube.   These were held in place with a central brass rod.      The distal end of the
    nozzle was finished with all tubes flush and of equal length. The openings were finished

   (Example 3) with straight 23G stainless steel tubes set into a 14G stainless steel tube. No
 5 brass rod was used to hold the tubes in, with the 14G tube being lightly crimped. The distal
   end of the nozzle was finished with all tubes flush and of equal length. The openings were
   finished clean and square. All voids between elements were open.
   [0001031         Nozzle number 13 has some of the same components as nozzle number 2.
   Similar to nozzle number I (Example 1), nozzle number 13 has all intervening open voids

   to the center of the assembly.    The assembly of 5 needles was secured within the 16G tube
   under tension from a centrally placed brass rod. The brass rod was tapered so that a tension
   fit held everything together. All voids other than the 5 outlet ports were filled with epoxy

 5 27G stainless steel needles inserted into the port channels of a nozzle number 37 nozzle
   assembly.      The needles extend from the plastic end of the distal end of the nozzle by
    approximately 5.5mm. The needles are all arranged so that the tip side of each needle is
    oriented toward the center of the nozzle. They lie closest to the central axis of the nozzle.

    extension is 2.15mm in diameter at the point that it joins the distal end of the nozzle and
    tapers in an aerodynamic fashion. The port channels are straight and parallel to the nozzle

   internal diameter of 0.0 15inch.   Orifice diameters are 0.011 inches.       The dose is driven
 5 through the multiple ports by gas pressure.
   10001201        Nozzle C. Single port annular gas bypass nozzle.      Two configurations were
   designed and tested. This nozzle design is a two compartment nozzle, one for the dose and
   one for gas.     These nozzles feature a straight 0.03 in internal diameter port tube that
   transports the powder. This transport tube is centered inside of another tube that serves to
10 deliver a stream of gas.    The configurations tested have different gas tube diameters and
   therefore affect the amount and velocity of gas emitted from the end of the nozzle. Both the
   powder transport tube and the gas tubes can be altered to change the performance of the
   nozzle assembly. These test configurations were designed to be driven by a single source of
   compressed gas (e.g. hydrofluoroalkane), but each compartment of the nozzle could be
15 independently driven.    Upon actuation, both chambers are pressurized and gas is emitted
   from the end of the nozzle as a uniform and symmetrical hollow cylinder, while at the same
   time the dose is emitted into the center of the gas cylinder. Depending on the configuration
   of the two tubes and the amount and type of gas used to drive the nozzle, the relative velocity
   of the gas and powder streams can be different, causing different effects on performance.

   emptied of powder can cause interference with the plume.        In that event, a check shutoff
   valve was conceived and tested. The valve consisted of a ball of plastic slightly smaller than
   the diameter of the dose chamber behind the nozzle. Upon activation of the device, the ball
   rolls up behind the dose and then seats on the back side of the nozzle, thereby effectively
 5 preventing gas flow through the dose tube once the dose is gone.

   10001251        Plume angle was tested as a performance criterion. The testing of the nozzles
10 included establishing the angle of the plume and/or the size of the deposition area at a fixed
   distance from the nozzle tip.
   [0001261        1) Photography.   The pattern of expelled high pressure water from the nozzle
   was photographed and the angle described by the pattern on the printed photo was measured.
   This method proved to be accurate and reproducible.        Additional methods would look at
15 describing the plume angle of an aerosolized plume as would be generated during actual use.
   Photography data was used as comparison data for the nozzles described herein.
    [0001271       2)  Blotter paper deposition.    A method was developed that relied on the
   deposition of a stained (Fluorescein) aqueous dose emitted from a nozzle onto a blotter paper
   held at a distance of.4cm. 4cm was chosen as a distance relevant to the distance needed to
20 traverse from a likely nozzle tip position in the human naris to the upper olfactory region of
   the human nasal sinus. This blotter paper deposition assay offered the advantage of creating
   a permanent record of the dose deposition. In addition, it would be capable of showing any
   asymmetry in plume geometry.         Plume angles were calculated using the blotter paper
   deposition. A limitation of this method is that the dose staining can bleed beyond the region

   of deposition, thereby making the observed deposition spot to be larger than the actual
   deposition zone.       This is especially true for larger dose volumes and for nozzles that
   concentrate the dose into the smallest zone. Another limitation is that the method describes
   the end result of the deposition and cannot describe how deposition occurs over the course of
 5 the event. This limitation yields less information about the nature of the plume as it starts,
   progresses and ends.       It can say very little about how the plume is affected by its travels
   through the air from nozzle to target.
    [000128]        Two additional approaches designed to analyze plume geometry during the
    time course of dose delivery were applied.
10  [0001291        3) High speed blotter recording, with dose deposition onto a rapidly spinning
    blotter paper target. This method is able to create a physical record of deposition over time.
    The blotter disk can be rotated fast enough so that dose spread is reduced and appears to yield
    accurate plume geometries displayed during the full shot.            It appears to be able to
    discriminate between different nozzle designs and can catch asymmetries in plume geometry.
15  [000130]        4) The second method is high speed videography (greater than 200 frames per
    second) enhanced with fluorescent dye and lighting.           This method appears capable of
    discriminating the performance between different nozzle designs and can record defects in
    performance. This method has been adapted for studying nozzle performance under various
    situations, such as free air performance and within human nasal models.
20  [0001311         5)   An adaptation of method high speed videography.          Modified lighting
    conditions were used to enhance the visualization of powder doses. In some cases lighting
    was adjusted so that only limited sections of the spray plume were visible.          White light
    illumination is valuable for seeing the overall plume geometry for powder, however white
    light is easily scattered and is not able to report on the various dose densities within a plume

   and likely best highlights the surface of a powder plume. Using single wavelength light in
   the red spectrum is able to reduce light scatter and better penetrate a powder plume.
   [0001321        Dose Deposition
   [0001331        Previous methods are principally directed at understanding plume geometry
 5 generated by each nozzle.        We used these methods to attain certain pre-determined
   performance parameters, such as symmetrical and narrow plumes, to predict actual
   performance in use. An in vitro method for assessing nozzle performance was to measure
   dose deposition efficiency in human nasal models. We have employed several methods for
   this, differing mostly in the manner in which we quantitate the amount of dose deposited in
10 different areas of the human nasal sinus. Of the three methods developed, here we report data
   generated from two methods.
   [0001341        5) One method assessed deposition by dose weight and was able to report
   only dose weight deposited in our upper olfactory region of interest (ROI) and elsewhere.
   [000135]        6)   Another method reports dose deposition through optical densitometry.
15 This method is capable of reporting fractional deposition within our upper olfactory ROI as
   well as any number of other ROI that are user defined.
   [0001361        Impact Force
   [0001371        Another physical performance characteristic that affected nozzle design was
   the impact force generated by the developed plume from any nozzle.             We developed a
20 method that records impact force profiles (including maximal impact force) for the duration
   of a dose shot. Forces generated during dosing could be compared to other commercially
   available nasal spray devices.

    [000143]      The deposition study presented in Table I shows the average from at least
   three nozzle firings for each nozzle and each aim angle. All conditions of firing were the
   same for all the nozzles and for each firing condition studied.     A correlation can be made
   between the size of the dose deposition zone and the percent of dose deposited in the upper
 5 olfactory region of a human nasal model. The correlation persists regardless of the aim angle
   used for these shots. We conclude that the smaller the dose plume angle is, the higher the
   deposition in our ROI. Not expected from these results is that some of the nozzles appear to
   perform better regardless of the aim of the nozzle. In contrast, the urethral tip, which has a
   single nozzle port and generates a single plum stream, appears to be more sensitive to aim
10 angle. While the urethral tip has good deposition (though by no means the best) when aimed
   directly at the target, its performance falls off dramatically at most other angles.         We
   generally see with this data that multiport nozzles, which generate multiple stream plumes,
   perform better in off-angles compared to the single port nozzle.
    10001441      The experimental results presented in the FIG. 29 demonstrate how parallel
15  multistream plumes appear to be more resistant to plume degradation over greater distances.
   All nozzles can be seen to have narrow deposition zones. The single port nozzles #20 and
   #21 appear to degrade faster -upon distance from the nozzle tip. This can especially be seen
   with nozzle #21.    The smallest diameter single port nozzle has comparability to the multi
   dose nozzles, but the constraint of this narrow port (1/5th the port area of the 0.0069in 5 port
20 nozzle) adversely affects the time of full dose delivery and/or the forces generated by the
   plume on potentially sensitive nasal membranes (see Table 2 below).
    [0001451      Two measured parameters, nasal model deposition and plume stability, point
   to a parallel multistream nozzle configuration beirig better able to maintain a narrow dose
   plume while traveling to the target. Our results demonstrate a narrow plume can deposit on

   the narrow recessed upper olfactory region of the human nasal sinus. Also, a multistream
   dose plume appears to better negotiate the intricacies of the complex human sinus. The off
   angle performance advantage for a multistream dose plume compared to the urethral catheter
   (e.g., a single port 0.020inch nozzle) demonstrates that clearly.     Without being bound by
 5 theory, it may be that the ability of a multistream dose plume's ability to entrain air
   (essentially forming an air capsule) is capable of solving both of these challenges (nasal
   model deposition and plume stability). Such an air capsule may reduce peripheral turbulent
   degradation of the dose steam as well as buffer its interaction with the walls of the nasal
   sinus.
10 [0001461        Table 2 addresses the property of shot duration for various narrow plume
   nozzles. Multi port nozzles have the advantage of initiating and completing dose delivery in
   relatively short times.  In contrast, the best performing single port nozzle (with respect to
   deposition zone) required in excess of 50 milliseconds to complete a reduced volume dose.
   The single port nozzles would greatly limit the size of the dose that a device could deliver. A
15 50pL dose would take in excess of 100 milliseconds and a IOOpL dose nearly 2/10ths of a
   second.    This is too long for a user actuated device.     Even if increasing the single port
   aperture to 0.020in, which could in theory bring the shot duration performance into line with
   the multiport nozzles, performance is lost, as shown in Tables 1 & FIG. 29. Alternatively,
   increased pressure might be able to reduce the shot time for nozzle #20, but the impact force
20 from such a stream is more likely to be damaging to sensitive tissues.

   [0001491         FIG. 30 shows the effect that a bypass nozzle can make on a plume of powder
   as it is ejected out of a nozzle into free air. In most cases a simple tubular powder nozzle will
   display what is shown in FIG. 30. The front of the plume appears to form a bullet point
   shape. Video analysis shows that likely mechanism causing this is that the powder is ejected
20 from the nozzle as a ballistic stream and the leading edge is immediately met by resistance
   from the air that it is moving into. This appears to be met by additional material fed into the
   back of this turbulent feature. In cases where the nozzle has clogged mid shot, the "bullet"
   plume essentially comes to a rest.               The propagation of the plume through the ambient air
   requires additional force from the fresh material emanating from the nozzle.

   [0001501         In contrast, the bypass nozzles do not possess this feature.    The powder
   appears to be buffered against impact with any stationary air in the firing path. Without
   being bound by theory, we believe that the propellant that exits the nozzle has displaced the
   stationary air, replacing it with a forward moving stream of gas. This forward stream of gas
 5 likely paves the way or carries the powder as if on a slipstream moving in the direction
   aimed. Additional studies have shown what appears to be more tightly collimated powder
   streams when fired from the bypass nozzles, as shown in FIG. 30.
   [0001511         FIG. 31 demonstrates again how the high bypass generated slipstream appears
   to negate the leading edge bullet point and turbulence that a simple zero bypass nozzle
10 generates. In this case where the plumes are directed between two plates 1.8mm apart also
   shows how the powder streams generated by the high bypass nozzle can remain collimated as
   compared to that caused by the zero bypass nozzles.
