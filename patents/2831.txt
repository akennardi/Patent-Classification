                                              Field of the Invention
                The present invention concerns high-concentration monoclonal antibody formulations
   suitable for subcutaneous administration, e.g. via a pre-filled syringe. In particular, the
   invention concerns a formulation comprising a spray dried monoclonal antibody at a
15 concentration of about 200mg/mL or more suspended in a non-aqueous suspension vehicle,
   wherein the viscocity of the suspension vehicle is less than about 20 centipoise. The
   invention also concerns a subcutaneous administration device with the formulation therein, a
   method of making the suspension formulation, a method of making an article of manufacture
   comprising the suspension formulation, use of the suspension formulation in the preparation
20 of a medicament, and a method of treating a patient with the suspension formulation.
                                           Background of the Invention
                Outpatient administration of high-dose monoclonal antibodies (several mg per kg) via
   subcutaneous (SC) injection is a preferred form of delivery for treating chronic conditions
25 (Stockwin and Holmes, Expert Opin Biol Ther 3:1133-1152 (2003); Shire et al., JPharmSci
   93:1390-1402 (2004)). The subcutaneous route of administration that requires injections
   using syringes, auto-injectors, or other devices generally restricts product formulation with
   regards to injection volume and solution viscosity, and device functionalities in terms of
   injection force and time. To deliver high-dose of monoclonal antibody with limitations of
30 injection time, volume, and force, a high-concentration monoclonal antibody formulation
   (100 mg/mL or greater) is required for subcutaneous administration (Stockwin and Holmes,
   Expert Opin Biol Ther 3:1133-1152 (2003); Shire et al., JPharmSci 93:1390-1402 (2004)).

   A potential challenge in the development of high protein concentration formulations is
   concentration-dependent solution viscosity. Injection force (or glide force) is a complex
   factor influenced by solution viscosity, the size of the needle (i.e., needle gauge), and surface
   tension of container/closure. Smaller needles, e.g., > 26 gauge, will pose less pain sensation
 5 to the patients. Overcashier and co-workers established a viscosity-glide force relationship as
   a function of needle gauge based on Hagen-Poiseuille Equation (Overcashier et al., Am.
   Pharm Rev. 9(6):77-83 (2006)). With a 27-gauge thin walled (TW) needle (ID, min.: 0.241
   mm), the liquid viscosity should be maintained below 20 centipoise in order not to exceed the
   glide force of 20 newton. Unfortunately, formulation scientists are constantly challenged
10 against a conflicting reality with high monoclonal antibody concentration and high solution
   viscosity (Shire et al., JPharmSci 93:1390-1402 (2004); Kanai et al., JPharmSci 97:4219
   4227 (2005)). Another challenge with liquid formulations at high monoclonal antibody
   concentration is protein physical stability. Greater aggregation rates and undesirable
   opalescence are generally observed in high monoclonal antibody concentration liquid
15 solutions (Alford et al., JPharmSci 97:3005-3021 (2008); Salinas et al., JPharmSci 99:82
   93 (2010); Sukumar et al., PharmRes 21:1087-1093 (2004)).
               Different formulation strategies have been attempted to reduce the viscosity of high
   concentration monoclonal antibody liquid solution by formulating with salt, amino acid, or
   sugar to balance repulsive and attractive forces through intermediate ionic strengths
20 (Sukumar et al., Pharm Res 21:1087-1093 (2004); He et al., JPharmSci 100:1330-1340
   (2011)). However, the effectiveness of these approaches may be limited at monoclonal
   antibody concentration beyond 100 mg/mL or due to specific characteristics of certain
   monoclonal antibodies. Dani and co-workers applied the approach of reconstituting spray
   dried monoclonal antibody powder to prepare high monoclonal antibody concentration liquid
25 solution prior to subcutaneous injection (Dani et al., JPharmSci 96:1504-1517 (2007)).
   This approach can certainly improve the protein stability in the solid state during the entire
   shelf life, however the high viscosity issue still remains because the spray dried monoclonal
   antibody powder needs to be reconstituted at high monoclonal antibody concentration prior to
   injection. A powder-based approach emerged recently using monoclonal antibody crystalline
30 particle suspensions (Yang et al., ProcNatl Acad Sci 100:6934-6939 (2003); Trilisky et al.,
   "Crystallization and liquid-liquid phase separation of monoclonal antibodies and Fc-fusion
   proteins: Screening results," AICHE online publication DOI 10, 1002/btrp.621 (published by
   Wiley Online Library) (2011)). It is based on the perception that viscosity of a crystal
                                                     -2
   103316021 (GHMatters) P98606.AU.1

   monoclonal antibody suspension may be lower than a liquid formulation at the same
   monoclonal antibody concentration. However, no viscosity or injection force data were
   presented in these references and this concept remained speculative. Furthermore,
   monoclonal antibody crystallization is not yet a mature process platform applicable to a wide
 5 range of monoclonal antibodies although some successful examples have been presented
   (Trilisky et al., "Crystallization and liquid-liquid phase separation of monoclonal antibodies
   and Fc-fusion proteins: Screening results," AICHE online publication DOI 10, 1002/btrp.621
   (published by Wiley Online Library) (2011)).
                The present invention represents a different powder-based concept employing a high
10 concentration monoclonal antibody powder suspension in a non-aqueous suspension vehicle.
   The suspension approach has been comprehensively reviewed (Floyd and Jain, "Injectable
   emulsions and suspensions," In: PharmaceuticalDosageForms: Disperse Systems Volume 2
   (eds. Lieberman HA, Rieger MM, Banker GS). Dekker, NY, NY, p2 6 1 - 3 1 8 (1996); Akers et
   al., JParentSci & Techn 41:88-96 (1987)) and has been reported for microsphere/emulsion
15 suspensions in vegetable oils, such as sesame oil (Larsen et al., Eur JPharmSci 29:348-354
   (2006); Hirano et al., JPharmSci 71:495-500 (1982)), soybean oil (Salmer6n et al., Drug
   Dev Ind Pharm 23:133-136 (1997); Karasulu et al., Drug Dev 14:225-233 (2007)), and
   peanut oil (Santucci et al., J Contr Rel 42:157-164 (1996)) as parenteral injectables. The
   physical and chemical forces influencing the properties of non-aqueous suspensions can be
20 quite different from those of aqueous suspension due to the absence of electrical effects
   associated with the DLVO theory (van der Waals attraction and electrostatic repulsion as the
   result of double layer of counterions).
                Pena and co-workers (Pena et al., Intl JPharm 113:89-96 (1995)) reported
   rheological characterization of excipient-free bovine somatotropin (rbSt) powder lyophilizedd
25 or spray-dried) suspension in caprylic/capric triglyceride (MIGLYOL 812@) oil with or
   without polysorbate 80. RbSt is a 191-amino acid peptide with a molecular weight of 22,000
   daltons. Pena et al. determined that a network formed among drug particle, polysorbate 80,
   and MIGLYOL 812@, and a higher viscosity was observed with increasing polysorbate 80
   and powder concentrations. These studies also found that particle shape/morphology played
30 an important role in suspension viscosity. The smaller spherical (more densely packed)
   spray-dried particles resulted in more viscous suspensions than the lyophilized counterpart
   which displayed larger irregular shaped flakes.

   10331602_1 (GHMatters) P98606.AU.1

                The non-aqueous powder-based approach for high concentration monoclonal antibody
   concentration suspensions remains unexplored. Studies with the small rbSt peptide in Pena et
   al. would not predict the ability to effectively formulate a large tetrameric monoclonal
   antibody (about 150,000 daltons). In addition, the oil vehicles used by Pena et al. were too
 5 viscous to be considered for use in pre-filled syringe administration. The viscosity of
   MIGLYOL 812@, sesame oil, soybean oil, peanut oil are ~30 centipoise (cP) at 25'C, 43 cP
   at 25'C, 50 cP at 25'C and 35 cP at 37'C, respectively. In addition, Pena et al. determined
   the suspension performance of spray dried powder was inferior to lyophilized counterpart.

20                                         Summary of the Invention
                The objectives of the present study were to: (1) identify process parameters that
   dictate suspension performance; (2) assess the feasibility of establishing monoclonal antibody
   powder suspensions (i.e. > 250 mg monoclonal antibody/mL) with acceptable injectability
   (i.e. injection force < 20 N through 27-guage thin-walled (TW) needle) and physical
25 suspension stability; and/or (3) understand the mechanism of suspension performance. To
   prepare monoclonal antibody powders, spray drying was used. Spray drying is a mature,
   scalable, and efficient manufacturing process. The short-term effect of spray drying on
   monoclonal antibody was studied at accelerated temperature. An important criterion for
   suspension vehicle selection was that the viscosity of the suspension vehicle be below 10
30 centipoise (cP). The three model suspension vehicles, propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate,
   benzyl benzoate, and ethyl lactate, tested in this study have low viscosity and met this
   requirement.

                Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) has been used for surface energy analysis (SEA)
   (Newell et al., PharmRes 18:662-666 (2001); Grimsey et al., JPharmSci 91:571-583
   (2002); Newell and Buckton, Pharm Res 21:1440-1444 (2004); Saleem and Smyth, Drug
   Devel & Ind Pharm 34:1002-1010 (2008); Panzer and Schreiber, Macromolecules 25:3633
 5 3637 (1992)). In IGC, a probe is injected into a column packed with the powder of interest
   (stationary phase) and the time required for the probe to pass through the column (tr) is a
   measure of the magnitude of the interaction between the probe and the stationary phase.
   Surface energy can normally be divided into polar and dispersive (non-polar) components.
   Thus, the use of non-polar (alkanes) and polar (electron acceptor-donor or acid-base solvents)
10 probes allowed these two surface energy components to be quantified. Surface energies of
   the spray-dried particles may serve as a more direct and relevant indicator to suspension
   performance than other particle characteristics. Another parameter is heat of sorption which
   is a direct measure of the strength of the interactions between a solid and gas molecules
   adsorbed on the surface (Thielmann F., "Inverse gas chromatography: Characterization of
15 alumina and related surfaces," In "Encyclopediaof Surface and Colloid Science Volume 4
   (edit by P. Somasundaran). CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL., p 3 0 0 9 - 3 0 3 1 (2006); Thielmann and
   Butler, "Heat of sorption on microcrystalline cellulose by pulse inverse gas chromatography
   at infinite dilution," Surface Measurement Services Application Note 203

20 (2007)). The IGC method was employed to measure the heat of sorption between spray dried
   particles and the suspension vehicle in this study.
                The experimental data herein demonstrate that the objectives were achieved, and
   high-concentration monoclonal antibody suspension formulations suitable for subcutaneous
   administration were developed.
25              Thus, in a first aspect, the invention concerns a suspension formulation comprising a
   spray dried monoclonal antibody at a concentration of about 200 mg/mL or more suspended
   in a non-aqueous suspension vehicle, wherein the viscocity of the suspension vehicle is less
   than about 20 centipoise.
                In another aspect, the invention concerns a suspension formulation comprising a spray
30 dried full length human IgGI monoclonal antibody at a concentration from about 200 mg/mL
   to about 400 mg/mL suspended in a non-aqueous suspension vehicle with a viscocity less

   than about 20 centipoise, wherein the formulation has an average particle size from about 2
   microns to about 10 microns, and injection glide force less than about 15 newton.
                The invention further concerns a subcutaneous administration device (e.g. a pre-filled
   syringe) with the formulation therein.
 5              In another aspect, the invention concerns a method of making a suspension
   formulation comprising suspending a spray dried monoclonal antibody in a non-aqueous
   suspension vehicle with a viscosity less than about 20 centipoise, wherein the antibody
   concentration in the suspension formulation is about 200 mg/mL or more.
                Additionally, the invention provides a method of making an article of manufacture
10 comprising filling a subcutaneous administration device with the formulation herein.
                In related aspects, the invention concerns use of the formulation in the preparation of
   a medicament for treating a patient in need of treatment with the monoclonal antibody in the
   formulation, as well as a method of treating a patient comprising administering the
   formulation to a patient in need of treatment with the monoclonal antibody in the formulation.

     .          Definitions
                In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the
10 context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word
   ''comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
   i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition
   of further features in various embodiments of the invention.
                The term "pharmaceutical formulation" refers to a preparation which is in such form
15 as to permit the biological activity of the active agent (e.g. monoclonal antibody) to be
   effective, and which contains no additional components which are unacceptably toxic to a
   subject to which the formulation would be administered. Such formulations are sterile. In
   one embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation is suitable for subcutaneous administration.
                "Pharmaceutically acceptable" with respect to an excipient in a pharmaceutical
20 formulation means that the excipient is suitable for administration to a human patient.
                A "sterile" formulation is asceptic or free from all living microorganisms and their
   spores.
                "Subcutaneous administration" refers to administration (of a formulation) under the
   skin of a subject or patient.
25              A "stable" formulation is one in which the active agent (e.g. monoclonal antibody)
   therein essentially retains its physical stability and/or chemical stability and/or biological
   activity upon suspension and/or storage. Preferably, the formulation essentially retains its
   physical and chemical stability, as well as its biological activity upon suspension and storage.
   The storage period is generally selected based on the intended shelf-life of the formulation.
30 Various analytical techniques for measuring protein stability are available in the art and are
   reviewed in Peptide and ProteinDrugDelivery, 247-301, Vincent Lee Ed., Marcel Dekker,
   Inc., New York, New York, Pubs. (1991); and Jones, A. Adv. DrugDelivery Rev. 10: 29-90
   (1993), for example. In one embodiment, stability of the suspension formulation is assessed
                                                               -8

   around the time the spray dried particles are suspended in the vehicle to produce the
   suspension formulation. In one embodiment, stability can be evaluated when the formulation
   is held at a selected temperature for a selected time period. In one embodiment, monoclonal
   antibody stability is assessed by size distribution (percentage monomer, aggregation, and/or
 5 fragmentation) before and after spray drying (e.g. before and after spray drying over 3-month
   storage under the accelerated temperature of 40'C). In one embodiment, size distribution is
   assessed using size exclusion chromatography-high performance liquid chromatography
   (SEC-HPLC). In one embodiment, the percentage monomer loss (as measured by SEC
   HPLC) over 3 months is less than about 10%, for example less than 5 %, e.g. at accelerated
10 temperature of 40'C. In one embodiment, stability is assessed by evaluating suspension
   physical stability, e.g. visual inspection of settling and/or particle sedimentation rate.
             "Spray drying" refers to the process of atomizing and drying a liquid or slurry comprising
   a protein or monoclonal antibody using gas (usually air or nitrogen) at a temperature above
   ambient temperature so as to produce dry powder particles comprising the protein or
15 monoclonal antibody. During the process, liquid evaporates and dry particles form. In one
   embodiment, the spray drying is performed using a spray dryer, e.g. which has an air inlet
   temperature from about 100 0 C to about 220'C and an air outlet temperature from about 50'C to
   about 100 0 C . Particles can be separated from the gas by various methods such as cyclone, high
   pressure gas, electrostatic charge, etc. This definition of spray drying herein expressly
20 excludes freeze drying or crystallizing the monoclonal antibody.
                A "dry" particle, protein, or monoclonal antibody herein has been subjected to a drying
   process such that its water content has been significantly reduced. In one embodiment, the
   particle, protein, or monoclonal antibody has a water content of less than about 10%, for
   example less than about 5%, e.g., where water content is measured by a chemical titration
25 method (e.g. Karl Fischer method) or a weight-loss method (high-temperture heating).
             For the purposes herein, a "pre-spray dried preparation" refers to a preparation of the
   monoclonal antibody (usually a recombinantly produced monoclonal antibody which has
   been subjected to one or more purification steps) and one or more excipients, such as
   stabilizers (e.g. saccharides, surfactants, and/or amino acids) and, optionally, a buffer. In one
30 embodiment the preparation is in liquid form. In one embodiment the preparation is frozen.
            A "suspension formulation" is a liquid formulation comprising solid particles (e.g.
   spray dried monoclonal antibody particles) dispersed throughout a liquid phase in which they
                                                      -9

   are not soluble. In one embodiment, the solid particles in the suspension formulation have an
   average particle diameter from about 2 to about 30 microns, e.g. from about 5 to about 10
   microns (e.g. as analyzed by laser diffraction). Optionally, the solid particles in the
   suspension formulation have a peak (highest percentage) particle size of less than about 30
 5 micron, and optionally less than about 10 microns (e.g. as analyzed by laser diffraction). The
   suspension formulation may be prepared by combinding spray dried monoclonal antibody
   particles with a non-aqueous suspension vehicle. In one embodiment, the suspension
   formulation is adapted for, or suitable for, subcutaneous administration to a subject or patient.
            As used herein "non-aqueous suspension vehicle" refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable
10 liquid which is not water-based and in which spray dried monoclonal antibody particles can be
   suspended in order to generate a suspension formulation. In one embodiment, the vehicle
   comprises a liquid lipid or fatty acid ester or alcohol (e.g. propylene glycol
   dicaprylate/dicaprate), or other organic compound such benzyl benzoate or ethyl lactate.      The
   vehicle herein includes mixtures of two or more liquids, such as a mixture of propylene glycol
15 dicaprylate/dicaprate and ethyl lactate. Preferably, the non-aqueous suspension vehicle has a
   viscosity (at 25'C) of less than about 20 centipoise (cP), optionally less than about 10 cP, and,
   in one embodiment, less than about 5 cP. Examples of non-aqueous suspension vehicles herein
   include the vehicles in the Table 1 below:

               "Viscosity" refers to the measure of the resistance of a fluid which is being deformed
   by either shear stress or tensile stress; it can be evaluated using a viscometer or rheometer.
   Unless indicated otherwise, the viscosity measurement (centipoise, cP) is that at about 25"C.
   Viscosity as used herein can refer to that of either the non-aqueous suspension vehicle per se
 5 or that of the suspension formulation.
               "Injectability" refers to the ease with which the suspension formulation can be
   administered to a subject. According to one embodiment of the invention, the injectibility of
   a given suspension formulation can be superior to the injectability of a liquid formulation
   comprising the same monoclonal antibody concentration and the same excipient(s) and
10 concentrations) thereof. In one embodiment, injectability refers to the injection glide force.
               "Injection glide force" as used herein refers to the force required for the injection of a
   solution at a given injection rate via a needle of predetermined gauge and length. In one
   embodiment, it is evaluated using pre-filled syringe (e.g. l.0mL-long syringe with           25
   gauge needle, or preferably          27 guage needle) with glide force analyzed and established as
15 a function of the distance of the plunger rad travelling inside the syringe at a steady
   compression rate (e.g. using "Syringe Glide Force Measurement" as in the Example herein).
   Time and rorce required for a manual injection (or time required for an injection using an
   autoinjector) may impact the usability of the product by the end-user (and thus compliance
   with the intended use of the product). In one embodiment, the Hagen-Poiseuille equation is
20 utilized to estimate the travel (or glide) force (Equation 1).

   the dexterity of the patient population. In an embodiment exemplified herein, the parameters

                In one embodiment, injection glide force is determined as a function of monoclonal
   antibody concentration by injecting 1-mL of suspension formulation using a 1-mL long
   syringe through a 27-guage thin walled (TW) staked needle in 10 seconds.

25              As used herein, "buffer" refers to a buffered solution that resists changes in pH by the
   action of its acid-base conjugate components. The buffer of this invention (if used) generally
   has a pH from about 4.0 to about 8.0, for example from about 5.0 to about 7.0, e.g. from
   about 5.8 to about 6.2, and in one embodiment its pH is about 6.0. Examples of buffers that
   will control the pH in this range include acetate, succinate, succinate, gluconate, histidine,
30 citrate, glycylglycine and other organic acid buffers. In one embodiment herein, the buffer is
                                                                 -12

   a histidine buffer. A buffer is generally included in the pre-spray dried preparation and may
   be present in the suspension formulation prepared therefrom (but is not required therein).
                A "histidine buffer" is a buffer comprising histidine ions. Examples of histidine
   buffers include histidine chloride, histidine acetate, histidine phosphate, histidine sulfate. In
 5 one embodiment, the histidine buffer is histidine-acetate or histidine-HCl. In one
   embodiment, the histidine buffer is at pH 5.5 to 6.5, optionally pH 5.8 to 6.2, e.g. pH 6.0.
                The term "excipient" refers to an agent that may be added to a preparation or
   formulation, for example: as a stabilizer, to achieve a desired consistency (e.g., altering the
   bulk properties), and/or to adjust osmolality. Examples of excipients herein include, but are
10 not limited to, stabilizers, sugars, polyols, amino acids, surfactants, chelating agents, and
   polymers.
                A "stabilizer" herein is an excipient, or mixture of two or more excipients, which
   stabilizes a pharmaceutical formulation. For example, the stabilizer can prevent instability
   due to spray drying at elevated temperature. Exemplary stabilizers herein include saccharides,
15 surfactants, and amino acids.
                A "saccharide" herein comprises the general composition (CH20)n and derivatives
   thereof, including monosaccharides, disaccharides, trisaccharides, polysaccharides, sugar
   alcohols, reducing sugars, nonreducing sugars, etc. Examples of saccharides herein include
   glucose, sucrose, trehalose, lactose, fructose, maltose, dextran, glycerin, dextran, erythritol,
20 glycerol, arabitol, sylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, mellibiose, melezitose, raffinose, mannotriose,
   stachyose, maltose, lactulose, maltulose, glucitol, maltitol, lactitol, iso-maltulose, etc. The
   preferred saccharide herein is a nonreducing disaccharide, such as trehalose or sucrose.
                Herein, a "surfactant" refers to a surface-active agent, preferably a nonionic surfactant.
   Examples of surfactants herein include polysorbate (for example, polysorbate 20 and,
25 polysorbate 80); poloxamer (e.g. poloxamer 188); Triton; sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS);
   sodium laurel sulfate; sodium octyl glycoside; lauryl-, myristyl-, linoleyl-, or stearyl
   sulfobetaine; lauryl-, myristyl-, linoleyl- or stearyl-sarcosine; linoleyl-, myristyl-, or cetyl
   betaine; lauroamidopropyl-, cocamidopropyl-, linoleamidopropyl-, myristamidopropyl-,
   palmidopropyl-, or isostearamidopropyl-betaine (e.g. lauroamidopropyl); myristamidopropyl-,
30 palmidopropyl-, or isostearamidopropyl-dimethylamine; sodium methyl cocoyl-, or disodium
   methyl oleyl-taurate; and the MONAQUATTM series (Mona Industries, Inc., Paterson, New
   Jersey); polyethyl glycol, polypropyl glycol, and copolymers of ethylene and propylene
   glycol (e.g. Pluronics, PF68 etc); etc. In one embodiment, the surfactant is polysorbate 20 or
                                                        -13

   polysorbate 80. The surfactant may be included to prevent or reduce aggregation or
   denaturation of the monoclonal antibody in the preparation and/or formulation.
                The term "amino acid" as used herein denotes a pharmaceutically acceptable organic
   molecule possessing an amino moiety located at a-position to a carboxylic group. Examples
 5 of amino acids include: arginine, glycine, ornithine, lysine, histidine, glutamic acid, asparagic
   acid, isoleucine, leucine, alanine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophane, methionine, serine,
   and proline. The amino acid employed is optionally in the L-form. Examples of amino acids
   which can be included as stabilizers in the preparations and/or formulations herein include:
   histidine, arginine, glycine, and/or alanine.
10              By "isotonic" is meant that the formulation of interest has essentially the same osmotic
   pressure as human blood. Isotonic formulations will generally have an osmotic pressure from
   about 250 to 350mOsm. Isotonicity can be measured using a vapor pressure or ice-freezing
   type osmometer, for example.
                The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a
15 population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising
   the population are identical and/or bind the same epitope, except for possible variants that may
   arise during production of the monoclonal antibody, such variants generally being present in
   minor amounts. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations that typically include different
   antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is
20 directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the
   monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are uncontaminated by other
   immunoglobulins. The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being
   obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed
   as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the
25 monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the
   hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975), or may be made by
   recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567). The "monoclonal
   antibodies" may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described
   in Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J Mol. Biol., 222:581-597
30 (1991), for example. Specific examples of monoclonal antibodies herein include chimeric
   antibodies, humanized antibodies, and human antibodies.

                A "spray dried" monoclonal antibody has been subjected to spray drying. The term
   includes the spray dried monoclonal antibody in powder form (i.e. prior to suspension) and in
   liquid form (i.e. when suspended in the non-aqueous suspension vehicle to form the suspension
   formulation).
 5              The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies
   (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or
   homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or
   belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is
   identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another
10 species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, so long as they exhibit the desired
   biological activity (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,
   81:6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include "primatized" antibodies
   comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate
   (e.g. Old World Monkey, such as baboon, rhesus or cynomolgus monkey) and human
15 constant region sequences (US Pat No. 5,693,780). An example of a chimeric antibody
   herein is rituximab.
                "Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies
   that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part,
   humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues
20 from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable
   region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman
   primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework
   region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non
   human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not
25 found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to
   further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise
   substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or
   substantially all of the hypervariable regions correspond to those of a non-human
   immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin
30 sequence, except for FR substitution(s) as noted above. The humanized antibody optionally
   also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region, typically that of a
   human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986);

                A "human antibody" herein is one comprising an amino acid sequence structure that
   corresponds with the amino acid sequence structure of an antibody obtainable from a human
 5 B-cell. Such antibodies can be identified or made by a variety of techniques, including, but
   not limited to: production by transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon
   immunization, of producing human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin
   production (see, e.g., Jakobovits et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:2551 (1993);

10 (1993); and US Patent Nos. 5,591,669, 5,589,369 and 5,545,807)); selection from phage
   display libraries expressing human antibodies (see, for example, McCafferty et al., Nature
   348:552-553 (1990); Johnson et al., Current Opinion in StructuralBiology 3:564-571 (1993);

   isolation from human antibody producing hybridomas. An example of a human antibody
   herein is ofatumumab.
                   A "multispecific antibody" herein is an antibody having binding specificities for
   two or more different epitopes.
20                 A "bispecific antibody" is an antibody with binding specificities for two different
   epitopes. An example of a bispecific antibody specifically contemplated herein is
   HER3/EGFR Dual Acting Fab (DAF) molecule, such as DL 11 f comprising human IgG 1
   heavy chains (US 2010/0255010; W02010/108127).
                Antibodies herein include "amino acid sequence variants" with altered antigen
25 binding or biological activity. Examples of such amino acid alterations include antibodies
   with enhanced affinity for antigen (e.g. "affinity matured" antibodies), and antibodies with
   altered Fc region e.g. with altered (increased or diminished) antibody dependent cellular
   cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (see, for example,
   WO 00/42072, Presta, L. and WO 99/51642, Iduosogie et al.); and/or increased or diminished
30 serum half-life (see, for example, WOOO/42072, Presta, L.).

                An "affinity matured variant" has one or more substituted hypervariable region
   residues of a parent antibody (e.g. of a parent chimeric, humanized, or human antibody)
   which improve binding of the affinity matured variant.
                The antibody herein may be conjugated with a "heterologous molecule" for example
 5 to increase half-life or stability or otherwise improve the antibody. For example, the
   antibody may be linked to one of a variety of non-proteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene
   glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, polyoxyalkylenes, or copolymers of polyethylene glycol
   and polypropylene glycol.
                The antibody herein may be a "glycosylation variant" such that any carbohydrate
10 attached to its Fc region is altered. For example, antibodies with a mature carbohydrate
   structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in US Pat
   Appl No US 2003/0157108 (Presta, L.). See also US 2004/0093621 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo
   Co., Ltd). Antibodies with a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the carbohydrate
   attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in WO 2003/011878, Jean-Mairet et
15 al. and US Patent No. 6,602,684, Umana et al. Antibodies with at least one galactose residue
   in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported in WO
    1997/30087, Patel et al. See, also, WO 1998/58964 (Raju, S.) and WO 1999/22764 (Raju, S.)

20              The term "hypervariable region" when used herein refers to the amino acid residues
   of an antibody that are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region comprises
   amino acid residues from a "complementarity determining region" or "CDR" (e.g. residues
   24-34 (LI), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (HI), 50
   65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al., Sequences of
25 ProteinsofImmunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of
   Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)) and/or those residues from a "hypervariable loop" (e.g.
   residues 26-32 (LI), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32
   (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk J.
   Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). "Framework" or "FR" residues are those variable domain
30 residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. The CDRs of
   rituximab, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab are disclosed in Figures 8A-B, 9A-B, and 10A-B,
   respectively.

                A "full length antibody" is one which comprises an antigen-binding variable region as
   well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH1, CH2 and
   CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g. human native
   sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variants thereof. Preferably, the full length
 5 antibody has one or more effector functions. In one embodiment, a human IgG heavy chain Fc
   region extends from Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus of the heavy
   chain. However, the C-terminal lysine (Lys447) of the Fc region may or may not be present.
   Unless otherwise specified herein, numbering of amino acid residues in the Fc region or
   constant region is according to the EU numbering system, also called the EU index, as
10 described in Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteins ofImmunologicalInterest, 5th Ed. Public
   Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 1991. Rituximab, trastuzumab,
   and bevacizumab are examples of full length antibodies.
             A "naked antibody" is a monoclonal antibody that is not conjugated to a heterologous
   molecule, such as a cytotoxic moiety, polymer, or radiolabel. Rituximab, trastuzumab, and
15 bevacizumab are examples of naked antibodies.
             Antibody "effector functions" refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc
   region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody.
   Examples of antibody effector functions include Cl q binding, complement dependent
   cytotoxicity (CDC), Fc receptor binding, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
20 (ADCC), etc.
             Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, full
   length antibodies can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of full length
   antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into
   "subclasses" (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy chain constant
25 domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called alpha, delta, epsilon,
   gamma, and mu, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of
   different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. The antibody herein is a human IgG 1
   according to one embodiment of the invention.
             A "human IgG 1" antibody herein refers to full length antibody comprising human IgG 1
30 heavy chain constant domains.

             The term "recombinant antibody" as used herein, refers to a monoclonal antibody (e.g. a
   chimeric, humanized, or human monoclonal antibody) that is expressed by a recombinant host
   cell comprising nucleic acid encoding the monoclonal antibody. Examples of "host cells" for
   producing recombinant antibodies include: (1) mammalian cells, for example, Chinese Hamster
 5 Ovary (CHO), COS, myeloma cells (including YO and NSO cells), baby hamster kidney (BHK),
   Hela and Vero cells; (2) insect cells, for example, sf9, sf21 and Tn5; (3) plant cells, for
   example plants belonging to the genus Nicotiana (e.g. Nicotiana tabacum); (4) yeast cells, for
   example, those belonging to the genus Saccharomyces (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or the
   genus Aspergillus (e.g. Aspergillus niger); (5) bacterial cells, for example Escherichiacoli cells
10 or Bacillus subtilis cells, etc.
             As used herein, "specifically binding" or "binds specifically to" refers to an antibody
   selectively or preferentially binding to an antigen. Preferably the binding affinity for antigen is
   of Kd value of 10-9 mol/1 or lower (e.g. 10-10 mol/l), preferably with a Kd value of 10-10 mol/1
   or lower (e.g. 10-12 mol/1). The binding affinity is determined with a standard binding assay,
15 such as surface plasmon resonance technique (BIACORE@).
                A "therapeutic monoclonal antibody" is a monoclonal antibody used for therapy of a
   human subject. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies disclosed herein include: CD20
   antibodies for therapy of B cell malignancies (such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic
   lymphocytic leukemia) or autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis);
20 HER2 antibodies for cancer (such as breast cancer or gastric cancer); VEGF antibodies for
   treating cancer, age-related macular degeneration, macular edema, etc.
                For the purposes herein, "rituximab" refers to an antibody comprising the variable
   heavy amino acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 3 and variable light amino acid in SEQ ID No. 4,
   and, optionally, the heavy chain amino acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 1 and light chain amino
25 acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 2. This term specifically includes biosimilar rituximab.
                For the purposes herein, "bevacizumab" refers to an antibody comprising the variable
   heavy amino acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 13 and variable light amino acid in SEQ ID No.
    14, and, optionally, the heavy chain amino acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 11 and light chain
   amino acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 12. This term specifically includes biosimilar
30 bevacizumab.
                For the purposes herein, "trastuzumab" refers to an antibody comprising the variable
   heavy amino acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 23 and variable light amino acid in SEQ ID No.

   24, and, optionally, the heavy chain amino acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 21 and light chain
   amino acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 22. This term specifically includes biosimilar
   trastuzumab.
                The monoclonal antibody which is formulated herein is preferably essentially pure
 5 and desirably essentially homogeneous (i.e. free from contaminating proteins etc).
   "Essentially pure" antibody means a composition comprising at least about 90% by weight of
   the antibody, based on total weight of the composition, preferably at least about 95% by
   weight. "Essentially homogeneous" antibody means a composition comprising at least about
   9 9 % by      weight of antibody, based on total weight of the composition.

                   In one embodiment, the pre-spray dried preparation comprises a monoclonal
   antibody preparation which has been subjected to one or more prior purification steps, such
   as affinity chromatography (e.g. protein A chromatography), hydrophobic interaction
   chromatography, ion exchange chromatography (anion and/or cation exchange
30 chromatography), virus filtration, etc. Thus, the antibody preparation may be purified,
   essentially pure, and/or essentially homogeneous.
                                                     -24
   10331602_1 (GHMatters) P98606.AU.1

                   In one embodiment, the monoclonal antibody in the pre-spray dried preparation is
   concentrated. Exemplary methods for concentrating the antibody include filtration (such as
   tangential flow filtration or ultrafiltration), dialysis etc.
                The pre-spray dried preparation may be liquid or frozen.
 5              The pH of the pre-spray dried preparation is optionally adjusted by a buffer. The
   buffer may for example have a pH from about 4 to about 8, e.g. from about 5 to 7, for
   example 5.8 to 6.2, and, in one embodiment, is approximately 6.0. A histidine buffer is an
   exemplified embodiment herein. The concentration of the buffer is dictated, at least in part,
   by the desired pH. Exemplary concentrations for the buffer are from about 1mM to about
10 200mM, or from about 10mM to about 40mM.
                The pre-spray dried preparation optionally also comprises one or more stabilizers
   which prevent denaturation and/or aggregation of the antibody during the spray drying
   process. Examples of such stabilizers include saccharides (e.g. sucrose or trehalose) and/or
   surfactants (e.g. polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80) and/or amino acids (e.g. histidine, arginine,
15 glycine, and/or alanine). The stabilizers are generally added in amount(s) which protect
   and/or stabilize the monoclonal antibody at the lowest amount of stabilizer possible, to avoid
   increasing the viscosity of the final formulation.
                With respect to saccharide stabilizers, such as disaccharides (e.g. trehalose or sucrose),
   the molar ratio of saccharide: monoclonal antibody (or disaccharide: monoclonal antibody) is
20 optionally from about 50 to about 400: 1, e.g. from about 100 to about 250: 1. Stated
   differently, exemplary saccharide concentrations in the pre-spray dried preparation are, for
   example, from about 10mM to about IM, for example from about 50 mM to about 300 mM.
                With respect to surfactant (if included in the pre-spray drying formulation),
   polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80 are examples of surfactants that can be included. The
25 surfactant is generally included in an amount which reduces or prevents denaturation and/or
   aggregation of the monoclonal antibody during the spray drying process. The surfactant (e.g.
   polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80) concentration is optionally from about 0.0001% to about
    1.0%, for example from about 0.01% to about 0.1%.
                The pre-spray dried preparation may be subjected to spray drying procedures such as
30 those described in the following section.

   IV.          Spray Drying the Preparation
                Spray drying herein is distinct from freeze drying commonly used to prepare
   monoclonal antibody formulations insofar as it is performed at temperatures above ambient
   temperature. Spray drying temperatures are commonly expressed as "air inlet" and "air
 5 outlet" temperatures. In one embodiment, the spray drying is performed at an air inlet
   temperature from about 100 0C to about 220'C (for example from about 120 C to about 160
    C) and an air outlet temperature from about 50'C to about 100'C (for example from about 60
   'C to about 80 C).
                The spray drying process generally comprises: atomization of the liquid feed; drying
10 of the droplets; and separation or recovery of the dried product.
                Embodiments of atomizers herein include: rotary atomizers, pneumatic nozzle
   atomizers, ultrasonic nozzle atomizers, sonic nozzles, etc.
                The contact between the liquid feed and the drying air can occur in two different
   modes. In a co-current system, drying air and particles (droplets) move through the drying
15 chamber in the same direction. When drying air and droplets move in an opposite direction,
   this is called a counter-current mode. Particles produced in counter-current mode usually
   show a higher temperature than the exhausting air. The exhausted air itself can leave the
   system or can be recirculated. By choosing from the various spray dryer designs (size,
   atomizer, aseptic conditions, etc.) and adjusting the different process parameters (drying air
20 flow, drying air temperature, etc.), the final powder properties like particle size, shape and
   structure or even sterility can be modified. If the resulting moisture of the recovered powder
   is not sufficiently low, post-treatment might be required, e.g., in the form of fluid bed dryers
   and coolers, contact dryers or even microwave dryers.
                When the liquid feed is atomized, its surface to mass ratio is increased, the heat
25 transfer between the air and the droplets is accelerated, and droplets can dry relatively rapidly.
   Two convection processes may be involved: heat transfer (air to droplet) and mass transfer of
   moisture (droplet to air). In the latter, moisture permeates through the boundary layer that
   surrounds each droplet. Transfer rates may be influenced by temperature, humidity, transport
   properties of the surrounding air, droplet diameter and relative velocity between droplet and
30 air.

   10331602_1 (GHMatters) P98606.AU.1

                The last step of a spray drying process is typically the separation of the powder from
   the air/gas and the removal of the dried product. In some embodiments, this step is as
   effective as possible to obtain high powder yields and to prevent air pollution through powder
   emission to the atmosphere. To this end, various methods are available such as cyclones, bag
 5 filters, electrostatic precipitators, high pressure gas, electrostatic charge and combinations
   thereof.
                The spray drying process produces particles comprising the monoclonal antibody.
                In one embodiment, the characteristics of the spray dried powder comprise any one or
   more or the following:
10              (a) average particle size: from about 2 microns to about 30 microns; e.g. from about 2
   microns to about 10 microns;
                (b) particle morphology: predominantly spherical particles, some dimples or holes in
   particles, "dry raisin" shape;
                (c) water content: less than about 10%, for example less than about 5 %, e.g., where
15 water content is measured by a chemical titration method (e.g. Karl Fischer method) or a
   weight-loss method (high-temperture heating); and
                (d) stability: e.g., assessed by suspending the particles in a vehicle and evaluating
   physical stability and/or chemical stability and/or biological activity of the suspension
   preparation. In one embodiment, the percentage monomer of such preparation is 950% to 100%,
20 e.g. as evaluated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC).
   V.           The Suspension Formulation
                The spray dried monoclonal antibody particles prepared as described in the preceding
   section are combined with a non-aqueous suspension vehicle to generate the suspension
   formulation. This formulation is suitable for administration to a subject. Generally, the
25 suspension formulation will not be subjected to either prior, or subsequent, lyophilization or
   crystallization. In one embodiment, a subcutaneous administration device (e.g. a pre-filled
   syringe) is filled with the suspension formulation and used for administering the formulation
   (see below for more detailed disclosure regarding devices and methods of treatment).
                The invention also provides a method of making a suspension formulation comprising
30 suspending the spray dried monoclonal antibody in a non-aqueous suspension vehicle.
                                                        -27
   10331602_1 (GHMatters) P98606.AU.1

                In one embodiment the antibody concentration in the suspension formulation is about
   200 mg/mL or more.
                In one embodiment the antibody concentration in the suspension formulation is from
   about 200 mg/mL to about 500 mg/mL.
 5              In one embodiment the antibody concentration in the suspension formulation is from
   about 250mg/mL to about 400 mg/mL.
                In one embodiment the antibody concentration in the suspension formulation is from
   about about 250 mg/mL to about 350mg/mL.
                The non-aqueous suspension vehicle preferably has a viscosity at 25'C, which is less
10 than about 20 centipoise, for example, less than about 10 centipoise, and optionally less than
   than about 5 centipoise.
                According to one embodiment of the invention, the viscosity of the suspension
   formulation is from about 5 to about 100 centipoise, for instance, from about 10 to about 70
   centipoise at 25'C. In one embodiment, viscosity of the suspension formulation is measured
15 using a cone and plate rheometer (e.g. a AR-G2 TA Instrument rheometer).
                In one embodiment, the average particle size in the suspension formulation is from
   about 2 microns to about 30 microns, for example from about 5 microns to about 10 microns.
                In one embodiment, the suspension formulation has an injection glide force of less
   than about 20 newton, for example less than about about 15 newton. Such injection glide
20 force may be determined as a function of monoclonal antibody concentration by injecting 1
   mL suspension using a 1-mL long syringe through a 27-gauge TW staked needle in 10
   seconds.
                In one embodiment the non-aqueous suspension vehicle is selected from: propylene
   glycol dicarprylate/dicaprate, benzyl benzoate, ethyl lactate, or mixtures of two or three
25 thereof.
                In one embodiment the non-aqueous suspension vehicle comprises ethyl lactate.
                In one embodiment, the non-aqueous suspension vehicle comprises a mixture of at
   least two non-aqueous suspension vehicles: Vehicle A plus Vehicle B, wherein the viscosity
   of Vehicle A is less than that of Vehicle B, but the monoclonal antibody stability in Vechicle
30 B is greater than that in Vehicle A. An embodiment of such mixture is exemplified by the
   mixture of ethyl lactate and propylene glycol dicarprylate/dicaprate (for example).
                                                    -28
   10331602_1 (GHMatters) P98606.AU.1

                In one aspect, the suspension formulation comprises a spray dried full length human
   IgGI monoclonal antibody at a concentration from about 200 mg/mL to about 400 mg/mL
   suspended in a non-aqueous suspension vehicle with a viscocity less than about 20 centipoise,
   wherein the formulation has an average particle size from about 2 microns to about 10
 5 microns, and injection glide force less than about 15 newton.
                The suspension formulation optionally further comprises one or more excipients or
   stabilizers. Examples of such stabilizers include saccharides (e.g. sucrose or trehalose) and/or
   surfactants (e.g. polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80) and/or amino acids (e.g. histidine, arginine,
   glycine, and/or alanine). The stabilizers are generally present in an amount which protects
10 and/or stabilizes the monoclonal antibody at the lowest amount of stabilizer possible, to avoid
   increasing the viscosity of the suspension formulation. In one embodiment, the stabilizers
   are present in the suspension formulation as a result of having been added to the pre-spray
   dried preparation, and/or have been added to the suspension formulation, as desired.
                With respect to saccharide stabilizers, such as disaccharides (e.g. trehalose or sucrose),
15 the molar ratio of saccharide: monoclonal antibody (or disaccharide: monoclonal antibody) in
   the suspension formulation is optionally from about 50 to about 400: 1, e.g. from about 100
   to about 250: 1. Stated differently, exemplary saccharide concentrations in the suspension
   formulation are from about 10 mM to about 1 M, for example from about 50 mM to about
   300 mM.
20              With respect to surfactant (if included in the pre-spray dried preparation), polysorbate
   20 or polysorbate 80 are examples of surfactants which can be present in the suspension
   formulation. The surfactant (e.g. polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80) concentration is
   optionally from about 0.00010% to about 1.0%, for example from about 0.010% to about 0.1%.
                The suspension formulation is generally sterile, and this can be achieved according to
25 the procedures known to the skilled person for generating sterile pharmaceutical formulations
   suitable for administration to human subjects, including filtration through sterile filtration
   membranes, prior to, or following, preparation of the suspension formulation.
                Moreover, the formulation is desirably one which has been demonstrated to be stable
   upon storage. Various stability assays are available to the skilled practitioner for confirming
30 the stability of the formulation. Stability can be tested by evaluating physical stability,
   chemical stability, and/or biological activity of the antibody in the suspension formulation
   around the time of formulation as well as following storage at different temperatures and
                                                       -29
   10331602_1 (GHMatters) P98606.AU.1

   time-points. In one embodiment, monoclonal antibody stability is assessed by size
   distribution (percentage monomer, aggregation, and/or fragmentation) before and after spray
   drying (e.g. before and after spray drying over 3-month storage under the accelerated
   temperature of 40'C). In one embodiment, size distribution is assessed using using size
 5 exclusion chromatography-high performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC). In one
   embodiment, the percentage monomer loss in the suspension formulation (as measured by
   SEC-HPLC) over 3 months is less than about 10%, for example less than about 5 %.
                In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of making a pharmaceutical
   formulation comprising preparing the suspension formulation as described herein, and
10 evaluating any one or more of the following properties of the formulation:
                (a) physical stability, chemical stability, and/or biological activity of the monoclonal
   antibody in the suspension (e.g. measuring percentage monomer using size exclusion
   chromatography);
                (b) viscosity of the suspension formulation;
15              (c) injectability or injection glide force of the suspension formulation;
                (d) surface energy analysis (SEA) or heat of sorption, e.g. by inverse gas
   chromatography (IGC) to evaluate particle-suspension vehicle interaction;
                (e) particle size (e.g. average and/or peak particle size, e.g. by laser diffraction
   analyzer); and/or
20              (e) suspension physical stability (settling, homogeneity over time, particle
   sedimentation rate, etc).
                Further detail of exemplary assays for these properties is provided in the example
   below.
                One or more additional other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or
25 stabilizers such as those described in Remington's PharmaceuticalSciences 16th edition,
   Osol, A. Ed. (1980) may be included in the formulation provided that they do not adversely
   affect the desired characteristics of the formulation. Acceptable carriers, excipients or
   stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include;
   additional buffering agents; co-solvents; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine;
30 chelating agents such as EDTA; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); biodegradable
   polymers such as polyesters; preservatives; and/or salt-forming counterions such as sodium.

   V.           Medicaments and Treatments Using the Suspension Formulation
                In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating a disease or disorder
   in a subject comprising administering the suspension formulation described herein to a
   subject in an amount effective to treat the disease or disorder.
 5              Thus, the invention provides: the suspension formulation as described herein for
   treating a patient in need of treatment with the monoclonal antibody in the suspension
   formulation; and use of the suspension formulation in the preparation of a medicament for
   treating a patient in need of treatment with the monoclonal antibody in the suspension
   formulation. In an alternative embodiment, the invention provides: the formulation as
10 described herein for treating a disease or disorder in a patient; and use of the formulation in
   the preparation of a medicament for treating a disease or disorder in a patient.
                In addition, the invention provides a method of treating a patient comprising
   administering the formulation described herein to a patient in order to treat a disease or
   disorder in the subject. Preferably the formulation is administered subcutaneously to the
15 subject or patient. In one embodiment, the formulation is administered by a pre-filled syringe
   containing the formulation therein.
                Where the antibody in the formulation binds to HER2, the suspension formulation is
   preferably used to treat cancer. The cancer will generally comprise HER2-expressing cells,
   such that the HER2 antibody herein is able to bind to the cancer cells. Thus, the invention in
20 this embodiment concerns a method for treating HER2-expressing cancer in a subject,
   comprising administering the HER2 antibody pharmaceutical formulation to the subject in an
   amount effective to treat the cancer. Exemplary cancers to be treated herein with a HER2
   antibody (e.g. trastuzumab or pertuzumab) are HER2-positive breast cancer or gastric cancer.
                Where the antibody in the formulation binds to a B-cell surface marker such as CD20,
25 the formulation may be used to treat a B-cell malignancy, such as NHL or CLL, or an
   autoimmune disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or vasculitis).
                Where the antibody in the formulation binds VEGF (e.g. bevacizumab), the
   formulation may be used to inhibit angiognesis, treat cancer (such as colorectal, non-small
   cell lung (NSCL), glioblastoma, breast cancer, and renal cell carcinoma), or treat age-related
30 macular degeneration (AMD) or macular edema.
                Where the indication is cancer, the patient may be treated with a combination of the
   suspension formulation, and a chemotherapeutic agent. The combined administration
                                                      -31
   10331602_1 (GHMatters) P98606.AU.1

   includes coadministration or concurrent administration, using separate formulations or a
   single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein
   there is a time period when both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological
   activities. Thus, the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered prior to, or following,
 5 administration of the composition. In this embodiment, the timing between at least one
   administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and at least one administration of the
   formulation is preferably approximately 1 month or less, and most preferably approximately
   2 weeks or less. Alternatively, the chemotherapeutic agent and the formulation are
   administered concurrently to the patient, in a single formulation or separate formulations.
10              Treatment with the suspension formulation will result in an improvement in the signs
   or symptoms of the disease or disorder. Moreover, treatment with the combination of the
   chemotherapeutic agent and the antibody formulation may result in a synergistic, or greater
   than additive, therapeutic benefit to the patient.
                The formulation is administered to a human patient in accord with known methods,
15 such as intravenous administration, e.g., as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of
   time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerobrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular,
   intrasynovial, or intrathecal administration.
                Intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of antibody composition is preferred,
   with subcutaneous administration being most preferred.
20              For subcutaneous delivery, the formulation may be administered via syringe (e.g. pre
   filled syringe); autoinjector; injection device (e.g. the INJECT-EASETM and GENJECTTM
   device); injector pen (such as the GENPEN TM ); or other device suitable for administering a
   suspension formulation subutaneously. The preferred device herein is a pre-filled syringe.
                For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of the monoclonal
25 antibody will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and
   course of the disease, whether the monoclonal antibody is administered for preventive or
   therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the
   monoclonal antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably
   administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type
30 and severity of the disease, about 1 pg/kg to 50 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1-20mg/kg) of antibody is an
   initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or
   more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. The dosage of the antibody will
   generally be from about 0.05mg/kg to about 10mg/kg. If a chemotherapeutic agent is
                                                      -32
   10331602_1 (GHMatters) P98606.AU.1

   administered, it is usually administered at dosages known therefor, or optionally lowered due
   to combined action of the drugs or negative side effects attributable to administration of the
   chemotherapeutic agent. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents
   may be used according to manufacturers' instructions or as determined empirically by the
 5 skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also
   described in Chemotherapy Service Ed., M.C. Perry, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD
   (1992).
   VII.         Articles of Manufacture
10              The invention herein also concerns a device with the suspension formulation therein.
   Preferably the device is a subcutaneous administration device, such as a pre-filled syringe.
                In a related aspect, the invention provides a method of making an article of
   manufacture comprising filling a container with the suspension formulation.
                Embodiments of the container in the article of manufacture include: syringes (such as
15 pre-filled syringe), autoinjectors, bottles, vials (e.g. dual chamber vials), and test tubes, etc.
   The container holds the suspension formulation and the label on, or associated with, the
   container may indicate directions for use. The article of manufacture may further include
   other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers,
   diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and package inserts with instructions for use as noted in
20 the previous section.
                The invention will be more fully understood by reference to the following examples.
   They should not, however, be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. All literature
   and patent citations are incorporated herein by reference.
25                                                EXAMPLES
                Developing high-concentration monoclonal antibody liquid formulations (> 200
   mg/mL) for subcutaneous (SC) administration is often challenging with increased viscosity
   that makes injection difficult. This investigation was intended to overcome this obstacle
   using a non-aqueous powder suspension approach. Three human IgGI monoclonal
30 antibodies were spray dried and suspended in a suspension vehicle at different monoclonal
   antibody concentrations. Propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate, benzyl benzoate, and ethyl
   lactate were employed as model suspension vehicles. Suspensions were characterized for
                                                       -33
   10331602_1 (GHMatters) P98606.AU.1

   viscosity, particle size, and syringeability. Physical stability of the suspension was visually
   inspected. The suspensions in general outperformed the liquid solutions in terms of
   injectability despite higher viscosity at the same monoclonal antibody concentrations.
   Powder formulations and powder properties appeared to have little effect on suspension
 5 viscosity or injectability. Among the three suspension vehicles, ethyl lactate suspensions had
   the lowest viscosity, below 20 centipoise, and lowest syringe injection glide force, below 15
   newton, at monoclonal antibody concentration as high as 333 mg/mL (total powder
   concentration at 500 mg/mL). Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) analysis of the suspension
   supported the conclusion that the suspension vehicle was the most important factor impacting
10 suspension performance. Ethyl lactate rendered greater heat of sorption than other
   suspension vehicles. Without being bound by any one theory, this indicates that strong
   particle-suspension vehicle interaction may reduce particle-particle self association, leading
   to low suspension viscosity and glide force. Ethyl lactate suspensions, however, lacked the
   physical suspension stability exhibited by propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate and benzyl
15 benzoate. Specific mixtures of ethyl lactate and propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate
   improved the overall suspension performance in high monoclonal antibody concentration
   suspensions.
                Amongst other things, these examples demonstrated the viability of high monoclonal
   antibody concentration (> 300 mg/mL) in suspension formulations for SC administration.

                                      MATERIALS AND METHODS
                Three recombinant chimeric/humanized monoclonal antibodies of the human IgGI
   subclass bevacizumab, trastuzumab and rituximab were manufactured by Genentech (South
   San Francisco, CA). These antibodies were expressed by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell
25 lines. All antibody drug substance liquid solutions were concentrated to 100 mg/mL using a
   tangential-flow filtration unit (PELLICON3@ 10kD, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and
   formulated with trehalose dihydrate. All bulks were buffered to a pH of ~6.0. For antibody

   Spray Drying
                Two types of spray dryers were used in this study, a pilot-scale unit (MS-35, SPX
   Flow Technology Systems, Inc., Elkridge, MD) and a bench-top unit (B-191, Buchi Corp.,
   New Castle, DE). MS-35 is approximately 2-fold larger capacity than B-191, i.e., 2.5 vs. 1.6
 5 kg/hour of the maximum water evaporation rate and 35 vs. 20 kg/hour maximum compressed
   air consumption rate. The pilot-scale unit was constructed mostly of stainless steel with heat
   insulation (drying chamber, cyclone, etc.) while the bench-top unit was made of glass. The
   pilot scale unit was equipped with a high-efficiency cyclone. To calculate the yield of
   powder collection, only the powder collected in the receiver was considered for the pilot
10 scale unit, and the powder collected on the cyclone and the receiver lid was included for the
   bench-top unit. The spray drying conditions and the characteristics dry powders produced
   using both spray dryers are listed in Table 2.

   Freeze Drying
               Monoclonal antibody solutions were also freeze-dried to compare the dry-state
   stability with spray dried samples. Liquid formulations were aliquoted in 1mL into 2 cc glass
   vials placed with butyl stoppers, then placed on pre-chilled shelves at -50 C in a lyophilizer
 5 (Model# LYOMAX2@, BOC Edward, Tewksbury, MA). The samples were dried by
   lowering the pressure to 100 mTorr and increasing the shelf temperature to -25 C during the
   primary drying, followed by the secondary drying at 35 C. The total lyophylization cycle
   time was approximately 60 hours.
10 Particle Size Analysis
               The particle size distribution was measured using a laser diffraction analyzer (LA-950,
   Horiba Instruments, Kyoto, Japan). The LA-950 consists of two light sources (blue LAD, red
   laser), a sample handling system to control the interaction of particles and incident light, and
   an array of high quality photodiodes to detect the scattered light over a wide range of angles.
15 The scattered light collected on the detectors was used to calculate the particle size
   distribution of the sample analyzed using the Mie Theory. For spray dried samples, several
   milligrams of the dry powders were dispersed in 50 mL of isopropyl alcohol in the MiniFlow
   cell attached on LA-950 and sonicated using the sonicator also attached on LA-950 for about
   one minutes prior to analysis. For particles suspended in vehicles were diluted with each
20 vehicle in FractionCell and mix with a stirrer attached on LA-950 prior to analysis.
   Density Analysis
               The density of the powder was determined by mixing 500 mg of powder in 4 mL of
   propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate oil in a volumetric cylinder and measuring the
25 displaced oil volume as the powder volume. Powder density can be calculated using powder
   weight and volume.
   Scanning Electron Microscopy
               Surface morphology of spray dried samples was examined using an environmental
30 scanning electron microscope (XL30, FEL, Hillsboro, OR). Each sample was mounted on
   aluminum stubs and sputter coated with 10 nm layer of AuPd, and scanned at a voltage of 2
   kV, and the photographs were taken at magnifications of 1000 and 2000.

   Water Content Analysis
                Residual moisture in spray dried samples were determined using volumetric Karl
   Fischer titration analyzer (DL3 1, Mettler-Toledo). Approximately 100 mg of each sample
   was injected into the titration cell that contained anhydrous methanol. Hydranal composite 2
 5 volumetric reagent (Cat# 34696, Hiedel-deHaen, Heidelberg, Germany) was used as a titrant.
   Size Exclusion Chromatography
                The quantitation of size variants was determined by size exclusion chromatography.
   This analysis utilized a G3000SWxL column, 7.8 mm ID x 30 cm, 5 [m (TOSOH
10 BioScience) run on an HPLC system (1100, Agilent). The mobile phases are 0.2 M
   potassium phosphate and 0.25 M potassium chloride at pH 6.2 for bevacizumab, 0.1 M
   potassium phosphate at pH 6.8 for trastuzumab, and 0.2 M potassium phosphate and 0.25 M
   potassium chloride at pH 7.0 for rituximab. The chromatography was run isocractically at a
   flow rate of 0.5 mL/min for 30 minutes. The column temperature was maintained at ambient
15 for bevacizumab and rituximab, and 30'C for trastuzumab, and the eluent absorbance was
   monitored at 280 nm. Each monoclonal antibody was diluted with its respective formulation
   buffer to 25 mg/mL for bevacizumab and 10 mg/mL for both trastuzumab and rituximab.
   Their injection volume is 10 pL for bevacizumab and for 20 [L for both trastuzumab and
   rituximab.

   Monoclonal Antibody Physical Stability in Spray dried and Freeze-Dried Powder
   Formulations
                Spray dried and freeze-dried powder samples were aliquotted into 2 cc glass vial,
   approximately 25 monoclonal antibody. Each vial was sealed with a rubber stopper and
25 FLIP-OFF cap and stored at 40'C for up to 3 months. At the stability time points of time
   zero (immediately after drying), 1, 2, 3 months, each dry sample was reconstituted with 1 mL
   of purified water, and the antibody physical stability was determined by protein size
   distribution (% monomer, aggregation, and fragmentation) using SEC-HPLC.
30 Preparation of Suspension Formulations
                The powder was weighed onto a 2-mL vial. Based on the powder density determined,
   the appropriate amount of suspension vehicle was added to prepare the powder concentration
   in the unit of mg of powder in 1 mL of suspension volume. Samples were then homogenized
                                                      -37

   for 2 minutes at 7500 rpm using a 0.5-cm tip probe on a Tempest Virtishear homogenizer
   (Virits Corp, Gardiner, NY).
   Viscosity Measurement
 5              The viscosity of solution and suspension samples was measured using a cone and
   plate rheometer (AR-G2 TA Instrument, New Castle, DE). Each sample was loaded onto the
   lower measuring plate and allowed to come to thermal equilibrium at 25'C. A solvent trap
   equipped on AR-G2 was used to prevent solution evaporation during the measurement. The
   sample viscosity was measured every 10 seconds for 2 minutes using a cone with a 20 mm
10 diameter and 1 degree angle at shear rate of 1000 per second.
   Syringe Glide Force Measurement
                One mL of suspension was drawn into a 1.0 mL-Long 27G TW 2" staked needle
   syringe (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) sealed with a plunger stopper (W4023/FLT, West
15 Pharmaceutical, Lionville, PA). The internal barrel of the syringe was coated with 0.5 mg
   silicone oil (Dow 360 Medical Fluid, 1,000 cSt). A Material Testing System (Model 5542,
   Instron, Grove City, PA) with a load cell was used to apply a steady compression rate of 190
   mm/min. The gliding force profile was analyzed and established as a function of the distance
   of the plunger rod travelling inside the syringe barrel.
20
   Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC)
                IGC experiment was performed using a Surface Energy Analysis (SEA) System
   (MSM-iGC 2000, Surface Measurement Services Ltd, Allentown, PA). Approximately 200
   mg of powder sample was packed into individual silanised glass columns and both ends of
25 columns were sealed using silanised glass wool to prevent sample movement. The specific
   surface areas of the powder samples were determined by measuring the Octane adsorption
   isotherms at 30'C and 0% RH from the IGC SEA. The BET specific surface areas of the
   samples were subsequently calculated from their corresponding octane isotherms, within the
   partial pressure range (10% to 35% P/Po). Decane, nonane, octane and heptane were used as
30 alkane probes for dispersive surface energy determination. Specific acid-based Gibbs free
   energy was also measured using acetone, acetonitrile, ethanol and ethyl acetate. For heat of
   sorption measurement, the suspesnion vehicles were used as the gaseous probes. All samples
                                                     -38

   were pre-conditioned in-situ with a carrier gas of helium at 30'C for 2 hours, and all the
   measurements were conducted at 30'C with a carrier gas flow rate of 10 cm3/sec.
                                      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
 5 Spray Dried Antibody/Trehalose Powders
                Three types of monoclonal antibodies were formulated in liquid solutions containing
   trehalose, serving as a carbohydrate stabilizer to monoclonal antibody, at the weight ratio of
    1:2 of trehalose:antibody prior to spray drying. This low weight ratio is equivalent to
   approximately 220:1 molar ratio was used for the purpose of minimizing its volume
10 contribution, which was below the minimum molar ratio of 300:1 commonly used for sugar
   to stabilize proteins as a lyoprotectant (Shire et al., JPharmSci 93:1390-1402 (2004)). Note
   that a 400 mg powder/mL suspension represents a 270 mg antibody/mL concentration even at
   the 1:2 weight ratio of trehalose:antibody, which was at the low limit of the target antibody
   concentration for this study.
15              Three monoclonal antibodies formulated at 100 mg/mL with 50 mg/mL trehalose,
   were spray dried using a bench-top spray dryer (B-191) and a pilot-scale spray dryer (MS-35).
   Spray-drying conditions and powder characterization results are summarized in Table 2.
   Comparable outlet temperatures of 87-89 'C were employed for all samples because outlet
   temperature was considered the key parameter dictating the spray-drying capability (Maa et
20 al., Pharm Dev Technol 2:213-223 (1997); Lee G. Spray Drying of Proteins, in "Rational
   Protein Formulation: Theory and Practice" (Eds. Carpenter J, Manning M), Pharmaceutical
   Biotechnology Series (Ed. Borchardt R). Plenum Press, pp. 135-158 (2002); Maury et al. Eur.
   J. Pharm. Biopharm. 59:566-573 (2005); Maa et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 60:301-309 (1998); and
   Maa et al. J. Pharm. Sci. 87:152-159 (1998)). The pilot-scale spray dryer demonstrated better
25 performance in powder collection yield (> 96%) and water content of 4 - 5%, while the
   samples dried by the bench-top spray dryer had 60% yield and 7 - 9% water content. The
   pilot-scale dryer was also capable of producing larger particles of 8 - 11 [m (D5 o) whereas
   the bench-top dryer produced 2 - 5 pm (D5o) particles. The advantages of the pilot-scale
   dryer can be attributed to efficient energy use and greater powder collection efficiency.
30 Particle shape and morphology for all antibodies was generally spherical with dimples, which
   were antibody dependent. The type of the spray dryer did not affect particle morphology.
   Overall, dryer performance and the antibody type resulted in some degree of variations in
                                                    -39
   10331602_1 (GHMatters) P98606.AU.1

   particle properties. Although these variations are not dramatic, they allowed us to evaluate
   their effect on suspension performance.
   Antibody Physical Stability in Spray dried and Freeze-Dried Powder Formulations
 5              A general concern about spray drying of biologics was high temperature stress,
   particularly for the pilot dryer which had higher inlet temperature of> 180'C. Antibody
   physical stability of the dry samples was determined upon reconstitution with purified water
   by protein size distribution (% monomer, aggregation and fragmentation) using SEC-HPLC
   before and after spray drying over 3-month storage under the accelerated temperature of 40'C
10 (Figure 1). Despite the high drying temperature used in the pilot-scale spray dryer, the
   impact of the drying process on (%) monomer was minimal. The antibody physical stability
   for spray dried bevacizumab and trastuzumab was compared to the freeze-dried counterparts
   by monitoring the change in (%) monomer at 40'C over 3 months. The (%) monomer for all
   samples decreased at the accelerated condition mainly due to aggregation, which is not
15 surprising given the sub-optimal amount of trehalose to protect antibody in the formulation.
   However, the spray dried samples had greater antibody physical stability than the freeze
   dried samples. The (%) monomer of spray dried trastuzumab and bevacizumab decreased by
         02%and      ~ 4% respectively, whereas both freeze-dried antibodies suffered a greater (%)
   monomer loss of ~6.5% over 3 months, despite their lower water content of ~0.8%. Thus,
20 spray drying is a viable approach, from the process and stability perspective, in making
   antibody powders for suspension formulation development.
   Selection of Suspension Vehicles
                The primary criterion for the selection of the suspension vehicle was low viscosity,
25 preferably <10 Cp, as suspension vehicle viscosity would contribute to suspension viscosity
   in a linear fashion based on Einstein's Equation for the viscosity of solutions (Einstein, A.,
   Annalen der Physik 34:591-92 (1911)).
                              i     = ilo (1 + 2 .5 y)                 (Equation 2)
   Where il is the suspension viscosity, rjo the viscosity of pure suspension vehicle, and P the
30 volume fraction of the solute.
                The three suspension vehicles selected for this study, propylene glycol
   dicaprylate/dicaprate, benzyl benzoate, and ethyl lactate, met this criterion (Table 3).
   MIGLYOL 840@ is propylene glycol diesters of caprylic and capric acids from the
                                                       -40
   10331602_1 (GHMatters) P98606.AU.1

   MIGLYOL@ neutral oil family. MIGLYOL 8 10@ and MIGLYOL 812@ have been
   approved for intravenous and intramuscular injections but they are viscous, >30 cp at
   ambient temperature. Propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate, the least viscous in the family
   (-9 cp), has been used for transdermal applications (Mahjour et al., Intl JPharm95:161-169
 5 (1999); Seniro, W., Intl J Toxicol 18:35-52 (1999)). Benzyl benzoate is similar to propylene
   glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate in viscosity,                 -  9 cp, and has often been used as a preservative in
   liquid injectables at < 10% concentration. Ethyl lactate has been used commonly in
   pharmaceutical preparations, food additives, and fragrances due to its relatively low toxicity.
   Although ethyl lactate has not yet been parenterally approved, it had low toxicity in mice for
10 intramuscular and intravenous injection (Spiegel and Noseworthy, JPharmSci 52:917-927
   (1963); Mottu et al., PDA J. Pharm. Sci. Technol. 54:456-469 (2000)). Ethyl lactate has a
   water-like viscosity, -2 cp.

20 Effect of Antibody Type and Powder Properties on Suspension Viscosity
               All antibodies dried by both bench-top and pilot-scale spray dryers (Table 2) were
   suspended in propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate. Suspension viscosity was measured as
   a function of antibody concentration, and compared to the antibody liquid solutions (Figure
   2). Suspension viscosity for all antibodies was similar in the range of antibody concentration
25 tested, suggesting that variations in antibody types and powder properties (particle size,
   morphology, and moisture content) had little effect on suspension viscosity. Suspension
                                                                   -41
   103316021 (GHMatters) P98606.AU.1

   viscosity increased with increasing antibody concentration in an exponential manner, which
   can be expressed as:
                                            0088

 5 Certainly, it is very different from the Einstein equation (Equation 2) which is primarily for
   dilute suspensions. Equation 4, a modified version of Equation 2, took the interactions of
   more concentrated suspensions into consideration (Kunitz, M., J. GeneralPhysiology pages
   715-725 (July 1926)), however, it still significantly underestimated the empirical data (see
   the dash line in Figure 2).

                It was interesting to find that suspension viscosity was actually higher than the
   viscosity of the corresponding antibody liquid solution at the same antibody concentration.
   No difference in suspension viscosity was observed among the antibodies, although the type
15 of antibody did significantly affect liquid viscosity.
   Surface Energies of Spray dried Powders by IGC
                Kanai and co-workers (Kanai et al., J Pharm. Sci. 97:4219-4227 (2005)) found
   reversible self-association as the result of Fab-Fab interactions in their viscosity study tested
20 with two antibodies made of the same construct with different amino acid sequences in the
   complementarity determining region (CDR) region in aqueous solutions. Such viscosity
   differences due to the antibody types in powder suspensions in non-aqueous vehicles were
   not observed (Figure 2). This observation could be interpreted from the perspective of
   particle surface energy distribution in the powder suspension. Particle surface energy, the
25 combination of polar and non-polar (dispersive) energy components, can dictate the level of
   interactions with suspension vehicles and particles. IGC is a common tool for surface energy
   measurement. The particle's dispersive surface energy using decane, nonane, octane and
   heptane as the probes, and also specific acid-base (polar) Gibbs free energy were measured
   using acetone, ethyl acetate, ethanol, and acetonitrile as the probes. Surface energy is a
30 distribution in response to particle size distribution of the powder sample but only surface
   energies at the 50% values were reported in Table 4. The dispersive surface energy,          750, was

   Injectability of Suspensions in Three Vehicles
                Injectability can be monitored by glide force measurement, which is a performance
   indicator more relevant than viscosity measurement. The glide force of the rituximab powder
 5 suspension in three vehicles was determined as a function of antibody concentration by
   injecting 1-mL suspension using a 1-mL long syringe through a 27-gauge TW staked needle
   in 10 seconds (Figure 3). The glide force for all suspensions increased with antibody
   concentration, however, it was below 20 N even at 200 mg/mL antibody concentration
   despite the high viscosity (Figure 2). The predicted glide force for the antibody liquid
10 solutions extracted from Figure 4 in Reference 3 was higher than the suspension glide force.
   The glide force in ethyl lactate suspension was lowest among the three suspension vehicles
   tested. The glide force of the ethyl lactate suspension at 333 mg antibody/mL was equivalent
   to that in the other two suspension vehicles at about half of the antibody concentration (167
   mg /mL), which was still below the target threshold of 15 newton, even at high antibody
15 concentration of 333 mg/mL. The reasons for the viscosity-glide force relationship
   discrepancy between the liquid solution and the suspension are not clear.
   Effect of Suspension Vehicle on Suspension Viscosity
                Suspension viscosity was tested in three vehicles containing the spray dried rituximab
20 powder (Figure 4). The viscosity in ethyl lactate was the lowest among the three vehicles;
   the viscosity of the ethyl lactate suspension at 333 mg antibody/mL was equivalent to that of
   the suspension in propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate and benzyl benzoate at about half of
   the antibody concentration (167 mg/mL).
25 Heat of Sorption by IGC and Particle Size
                Heat of sorption (AHsorption) is a direct measure of the strength of the interactions
   between a solid and gas molecules adsorbed on the surface (Thielmann F., "Inverse gas
   chromatography: Characterization of alumina and related surfaces," In "Encyclopedia of
   Surface and ColloidScience Volume 4 (edit by P. Somasundaran) CRC Press, Boca Raton,
30 FL., p 3 0 0 9 - 3 0 3 1 (2006); Thielmann and Butler, "Heat of sorption on microcrystalline
   cellulose by pulse inverse gas chromatography at infinite dilution," Surface Measurement
   Services Application Note 203

   10331602_1 (GHMatters) P98606.AU.1

   (http://www.thesorptionsolution.comllnformationApplicationNotes_IGC.php#Aps)
   (2007)).
                The IGC method was employed to measure the heat of sorption between spray dried
   particles and the suspension vehicles (Table 4). For both bevacizumab and rituximab, ethyl
 5 lactate suspension had higher heat of sorption than the other two suspension vehicles. Particle
   size of the suspension particles was also compared among the three suspensions (Figure 5).
   The peak particle size (highest percentage) was 28, 25, and 7 mm for propylene glycol
   dicaprylate/dicaprate, benzyl benzoate and ethyl lactate, respectively. Both heat of sorption
   and particle size data show that the higher heat of sorption in ethyl lactate suspensions
10 indicated higher particle-suspension vehicle interaction than particle-particle interaction and
   that the degree of particle self-association in ethyl lactate was lower than that in propylene
   glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate or benzyl benzoate.
   Suspension Physical Stability
15              Despite low viscosity and glide force in the ethyl lactate suspension, it displayed a
   peculiar suspension physical stability as a function of time. The powder in the ethyl lactate
   suspension settled to the bottom and floated to the surface of the suspension after 1-day
   ambient storage (Figure 6A). Homogeneity of the ethyl lactate suspension could be restored
   by vortexing (Figure 6B). On the contrary, the suspension physical stability in propylene
20 glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate was much more stable and remained well suspended over two
   weeks (Figure 6C).
                According to the particle sedimentation rate determined by Stoke's Law (Eq. 4
   below), the particles in ethyl lactate would settle approximately 4.5 times faster than in
   propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate, based on the density and viscosity of ethyl lactate and
25 propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate, 1.03 g/cm 3 and 0.92 g/ cm 3 , and 2 cP and 9 cP,
   respectively. Thus, Stoke's Law alone couldn't fully explain the observation of extremely
   fast settlement of particles in ethyl lactate as compared to propylene glycol
   dicaprylate/dicaprate, suggesting other mechanisms such as surface electrical charge (i.e.,
   zeta potential) may play a role. However, the phenomenon of some of the particles floating
30 to the top of ethyl lactate surface is difficult to explain because the density of the spray dried
   particles is higher than ethyl lactate.
                                      s = d (ps - pi)g / (1 8 f)              (Equation 5)
                                                                 -46

   where s is sedimentation rate, d diameter of the particle, ps the density of the particle, pi the
   density of the suspension vehicle, g acceleration due to gravity, and 11 the viscosity of the
   suspension vehicle.
 5 Suspension Vehicle Mixture to Imrove Suspension Performance
                The mixtures of ethyl lactate and propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate were used as
   suspension vehicles for testing rituximab suspension physical stability. Particle size was
   determined for these mixture suspensions (Figure 7A). The particle size decreased with
   decreasing propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate contribution in the mixture where the peak
10 particle size was 28, 13, 11, 8 and 7 [m for propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate:ethyl
   lactate mixture at 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100, respectively. From the suspension
   physical stability perspective, the poor suspension stability of ethyl lactate was improved by
   mixing with a small amount of propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate as demonstrated in
   Figure 7B where homogeneous suspension was maintained for rituximab powder in 25:75
15 propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate:ethyl lactate mixture after 2-week ambient storage. It
   was demonstrated that overall suspension performance can be improved using a suspension
   vehicle mixture.
                                               CONCLUSION
20       These examples demonstrated that the non-aqueous powder suspension approach was
   feasible for high monoclonal antibody concentration SC administration. Dry powder
   preparation by spray-drying was scalable using the high efficiency spray-drying process. The
   most important parameter for overall suspension performance was determined to be the type
   of suspension vehicle. Powder suspension in ethyl lactate displayed excellent suspension
25 injectability with a low glide force of< 15 N via a 27-gauge TW staked needle for antibody
   concentration as high as 333 mg/mL (total powder concentration of 500 mg/mL). Without
   being bound by any one theory, low viscosity and injectability could be attributed to strong
   particle-suspension vehicle interaction that prevents particle-particle agglomeration into
   larger particle size in the suspension. However, this mechanism did not support physical
30 suspension stability. Dry antibody particles had a higher tendency to settle out in the ethyl
   lactate suspension than in propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate. The approach of using
   suspension vehicle mixture proved to be effective in improving overall suspension
   performance.
