                                        FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
[0002]            This disclosure relates generally to packaging, and, more particularly, to a re
closable lid that is secured to a container, and to methods of making the packaging, and
flexible materials for forming the same.
                                               BACKGROUND
[0003]           Re-closable or re-sealable packaging assemblies are commonly used to store food
items, liquids, powders, baby wipes, chemicals, detergent, dry goods, pharmaceuticals,
nutraceuticals and other packaged products, for example. Typically, the re-closable
packaging assemblies include a container portion and a flap portion that covers an opening in
the container. An end of the flap portion is secured to the container adjacent to the opening
such that a user can pivot or fold the flap portion about the end to expose the opening,
thereby allowing the user to access a product contained in an interior volume defined by the
walls of the container. The underside of the flap and/or surface of the container covered by
the flap in a closed position may have an adhesive coating such that when the flap is in the
closed position, the flap releasably adheres to and sealingly engages the container. However,
dust, moisture, or other debris, such as powder stored in the container, may adhere to the
adhesive coating, and the adhesive coating may subsequently lose the ability, or the strength
of the resealability will be substantially reduced, to sealingly engage the container.
                                                        1
10133467_2 (GHMatters) P99740.AU.1

                                                                       Attorney Docket No.: 31332/47193
[0004]           A solution to the problem of contamination of the adhesive coating involves
securing an injection-molded plastic lid assembly on the container such that the lid assembly
is disposed around the opening. To access the interior volume of the container, a lid member
is upwardly pivoted about a living hinge of the lid assembly to an open position in which the
opening is exposed. To close the lid assembly, the lid member is downwardly pivoted about
the living hinge to sealingly engage a base of the lid assembly. While the injection-molded
plastic lid assembly is typically not affected by debris, moisture, or dust that gathers on or
near the sealing area, the plastic lid assembly may be relatively expensive to produce and
may add weight to the re-closable packaging assembly. In addition, attachment of the lid
assembly to the container involves a relatively complicated production step that adds time
and cost to production.
[0005]           Accordingly, there exists a need to provide a re-closable packaging assembly that is
simple and inexpensive to manufacture, that minimizes production time, and that provides
reliable sealing when exposed to contamination.
                                                 SUMMARY

[0020]            In some embodiments, a re-closable packaging assembly includes a container (also
referred to herein as a "package") formed at least partially by a first sheet, and the container
has a plurality of walls that cooperate to define an interior volume. The container may have
an opening through a least one of the plurality of walls. The re-closable packaging assembly
may also include a closure assembly secured to the container adjacent to the opening. The
closure assembly may at least partially comprise a second sheet and a portion of the first
sheet. The closure assembly may include a lid member and a hinge portion. The lid member
may be pivotable about the hinge portion between a first position in which the lid member
releasably engages a first portion of the container surrounding the opening and a second
position in which the lid member is pivoted away from the opening about the hinge portion,
thereby allowing for a user to access the interior volume through the opening. A first
engagement feature may be disposed on the container adjacent to the opening. A second
engagement feature may be disposed on the lid member of the closure assembly. The first
engagement feature may engage the second engagement feature to removably secure the lid
member to the container when the lid member is in the first position. The first engagement
feature may be integrally formed with the container. The first engagement feature may be
formed as a ridge and the second engagement feature may be formed as a channel adapted to
receive the ridge, for example.

providing a first sheet and providing a second sheet secured to a first portion of the first sheet.
The method may further include forming a lid member of a closure assembly from a portion
of the second sheet such that at least a portion of the lid member is secured to the first portion
of the first sheet. A hinge portion of the closure assembly may be formed from the second
sheet, and the hinge portion may be disposed adjacent to the lid member. The lid member
may be pivotable about the hinge portion between a first position in which the lid member
releasably engages a first portion of the container surrounding an opening formed in the first
sheet and a second position in which the lid member is pivoted away from a portion of the
opening.

                                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Re-closable Packaging Assembly
[0023]           As illustrated in Figure 1, a re-closable packaging assembly 10 includes a container
12 formed at least partially by a first sheet 14 (also called a first film), and the container 12
has a plurality of walls 16 that cooperate to define an interior volume 18. The container 12
has an opening 20 through a least one of the plurality of walls 16. The re-closable packaging
assembly 10 also includes a closure assembly 22 secured to the container 12 adjacent to the
opening 20 (or an area in which the opening 20 is defined). The closure assembly 22 at least
partially comprises a second sheet 24 (also called a second film) and optionally a portion of
the first sheet 14 (see Figure 3). For example, a portion of the first sheet 14 can detach from
the first sheet 14 and remain adhered to the second sheet to form an aperture in the first sheet.
In other embodiments, a portion of the first sheet 14 can be detached from the remaining
portion of the first sheet and discarded rather than adhered to the second sheet 24 to form the
aperture. The terms container and package are used herein interchangeably.
[0024]           In one embodiment, the closure assembly 22 includes a lid member 26 and a hinge
portion 28. The lid member 26 is pivotable about the hinge portion 28 between a first
position 30 (illustrated in Figure 4) in which the lid member 26 releasably engages a first
portion 32 of the container 12 surrounding the opening 20 and a second position 34
(illustrated in Figures 1 and 28) in which the lid member 26 is pivoted away from the opening
20 about the hinge portion 28, thereby allowing for a user to access the interior volume 18
through the opening 20. As illustrated in Figures 1 and 5, a first engagement feature 36 may
be disposed on the container 12 adjacent to the opening 20. As illustrated in Figures 1, 2, and
3, a second engagement feature 38 may disposed on the lid member 26 of the closure

assembly 22. The first engagement feature 36 engages the second engagement feature 38 to
removably secure the lid member 26 to the container 12 when the lid member 26 is in the first
position 30. The first engagement feature 36 may be integrally formed with the container 12.
As illustrated in Figures 1, 3, and 5, the first engagement feature 36 may be formed as a ridge
40 and the second engagement feature 38 may be formed as a channel 42 adapted to receive
the ridge 40, for example.
[0025]            So configured, in a single manufacturing step, the lid member 26, the first
engagement feature 36, and the second engagement feature 38 may be formed in the film of
the container 12, thereby eliminating the need to attach a separately-fabricated lid assembly
that is secured to a container. Because the features are formed in a single process step, and
because the separately-fabricated lid assembly is not necessary, one having ordinary skill in
the art would recognize that manufacturing time and cost are reduced. Moreover, one having
ordinary skill in the art would recognize such features allows for reliable resealing of the lid
member 26 to the container 12 by a mechanical closure, which is not degraded by the
presence of surface contaminants in the sealing area.
[0026]            Turning to the container 12 of the re-closable packaging assembly 10 in more
detail, the container 12 includes the plurality of walls 16 that cooperate to define the interior
volume 18, as illustrated in Figure 1. The plurality of walls 16 may cooperate to form any
suitable shape or combination of shapes. For example, the plurality of walls 16 may include
a top wall 16a, a first side wall 16b, a second side wall 16c, a third side wall 16d, a fourth
side wall 16e, and a bottom wall 16f. The top wall 16a may be planar or substantially planar
and may extend in a horizontal direction (i.e., parallel to the X-Y plane of the reference
coordinate system provided in Figure 1) or a substantially horizontal direction. The bottom
wall 16f may be planar or substantially planar and may extend in a horizontal direction or a
substantially horizontal direction, and the bottom wall 16f may be vertically (i.e., in a
direction parallel to or along the Z-axis of the reference coordinate system provided in Figure
1) offset from the top wall 16a. The first side wall 16b may vertically extend between the top
wall 16a and the bottom wall 16f, and the first side wall 16b may be parallel or substantially
parallel to the X-Z plane of the reference coordinate system provided in Figure 1. A first
portion of the first side wall 16b may extend vertically beyond the top wall 16a to form a

portion of a top ridge wall 44 that extends along and around the perimeter of the top wall 16a.
A second portion of the first side wall 16b may extend vertically beyond the bottom wall 16f
to form a portion of a bottom ridge wall 46 that extends along and around the perimeter of the
bottom wall 16f.
[0027]            Still referring to Figure 1, the second side wall 16c may vertically extend between
the top wall 16a and the bottom wall 16f, and the first side wall 16b may be offset from the
second side wall 16c along the Y-axis of the reference coordinate system provided in Figure
1. A first portion of the second side wall 16c may extend vertically beyond the top wall 16a
to form a portion of the top ridge wall 44. A second portion of the second side wall 16c may
extend vertically beyond the bottom wall 16f to form a portion of the bottom ridge wall 46.
The third side wall 16d may vertically extend between the top wall 16a and the bottom wall
16f, and the third side wall 16d may be parallel or substantially parallel to the Y-Z plane of
the reference coordinate system provided in Figure 1. A first portion of the third side wall
16d may extend vertically beyond the top wall 16a to form a portion of the top ridge wall 44.
A second portion of the third side wall 16d may extend vertically beyond the bottom wall 16f
to form a portion of the bottom ridge wall 46. A first sealed edge 48 may vertically extend
from the top ridge wall 44 to the bottom ridge wall 46. The third side wall 16d may not be
directly attached to the top wall 16a, and a portion of the first sheet 14 making up the top wall
16a may be inserted through a gap between the third side wall 16d and the top wall 16a such
that the portion of the first sheet 14 is disposed against a portion of an internal surface of the
third side wall 16d (i.e., tucking the portion of the top wall 16a into the gap). Similarly, the
third side wall 16d may not be directly attached to the bottom wall 16b, and a portion of the
first sheet 14 making up the bottom wall 16b may be inserted through a gap between the third
side wall 16d and the bottom wall 16b such that the portion of the first sheet 14 is disposed
against a portion of the internal surface of the third side wall 16d (i.e., tucking the portion of
the bottom wall 16b into the gap).
[0028]           Referring again to Figure 1, the fourth side wall 16e may vertically extend between
the top wall 16a and the bottom wall 16f, and the fourth side wall 16e may be parallel or
substantially parallel to the Y-Z plane of the reference coordinate system provided in Figure
1. A first portion of the fourth side wall 16e may extend vertically beyond the top wall 16a to

extend vertically beyond the bottom wall 16f to form a portion of the bottom ridge wall 46.
A second sealed edge 50 may vertically extend from the top ridge wall 44 to the bottom ridge
wall 46. The fourth side wall 16e may not be directly attached to the top wall 16a, and a
portion of the first sheet 14 making up the top wall 16a may be inserted through a gap
between the fourth side wall 16e and the top wall 16a such that the portion of the first sheet
14 is disposed against a portion of an internal surface of the fourth side wall 16e (i.e., tucking
the portion of the top wall 16a into the gap). Similarly, the fourth side wall 16e may not be
directly attached to the bottom wall 16b, and a portion of the first sheet 14 making up the
bottom wall 16b may be inserted through a gap between the fourth side wall 16e and the
bottom wall 16b such that the portion of the first sheet 14 is disposed against a portion of the
internal surface of the fourth side wall 16e (i.e., tucking the portion of the bottom wall 16b
into the gap).
[0029]          The plurality of walls 16 of the container 12 may cooperate to form any suitable
shape or combination of shapes that form a sealed or partially sealed enclosure. In other
contemplated embodiments, for example, the plurality of walls 16 may form a substantially
elongated tubular shape. The container 12 may include any container known in the art, such
as quad-sealed packaging, Horizontal Flow Wrap Packages (such as those manufactured by
Ilapak, Hayssen-Sandiacre, Bosch, or Doboy), Vertical - Form - Fill Seal "Pillow" style bags
(such as those manufactured by Hayssen, Ilapak, Bosch, or Triangle), Horizontal -Form-Fill
-Seal packages included a formed bottom and a iding [Rwi]material (such as those
manufactured by Multivac or Tiromat), Stand-Up Pouches (such as those manufactured by
KHS-Bartelt or Laudenberg), and tray sealing equipment such as such as those manufactured
by Pack-Line, Osgood or Modern.
[0030]          An exemplary quad seal package and methods of folding a quad seal package
which can be used as the container for the packages of the disclosure is described in U.S.
Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0312868, the disclosure of which is incorporated
herein by reference in its entirety. Such quad seal packages can include corner seals that
extend and surround one or more panels of the package. For example, the package can
include a top wall in which the opening is disposed and an oppositely disposed bottom wall.

Comers seals can extend from and surround one or both of the top and bottom walls. In
alternative embodiments, the corner seals can extend from one or more of the side walls.
[0031]           As illustrated in Figure 1, one or more ribs 51 may be formed along one or more
surfaces of the container 12. For example, a rib 51 may extend along the top wall 16a of the
container 12 adjacent to and aligned with the third side wall 16d of the container. In some
embodiments, as illustrated in Figure 26, for example, a first rib 251 a may extend along the
top wall 216a of the container adjacent to and aligned with the third side wall 216d and a
second rib 25 lb may extend along the top wall 216a of the container adjacent to and aligned
with the fourth side wall 216e. The one or more ribs 51 may be formed as an elongated
protrusion that upwardly extends from the top wall 16a of the container 12, and the protrusion
may provide stiffness to a desired area of the container 12. In addition, one or more ribs 51
may extend along all or part of one or more of the side walls 16b-d of the container 12 and
upwardly from the wall of the container as described above with respect to the top wall. In
various embodiments, the one or more ribs 51 can be formed in the wall containing the
closure assembly 22 as well as on one or more of the walls adjacent to the panel having the
closure assembly. The one or more ribs 51 may be formed in a thermoforming operation that
will be described in more detail below.
[0032]            The plurality of walls 16 of the container 12 may be formed from a single sheet of
material, (e.g., the first sheet 14), and the material may be flexible. However, the container
12 may be made of any suitable number of sheets of material. The first sheet 14 can include
any suitable number of laminate layers needed to achieve the desired composition and/or film
properties. The first sheet 14 may have a composition and structure that are appropriate for
the product to be stored within the container 12. The first sheet 14 may be formed from
materials such as polypropylene (PP), ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polyethylene (PE),
ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) co-polymers, foil (such as aluminum foil), paper, polyester
(PET), polyamide or nylon (PA), and laminates and composites thereof. In other
embodiments, the first sheet 14 may be formed from metalized polypropylene or metalized
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or combinations of such materials. Still further, the first
sheet 14 may include or be infused with a degradable or biodegradable component that may
allow the container to degrade in a relatively short amount of time after the useful life of the
                                                       22

container 12, such as after the container 12 is disposed in a landfill or other disposal facility.
If necessary or desired based on the implementation, the first sheet 14 may include an outer
ply of heat salable polypropylene or other material suitable for heat sealing so that the seals
joining portions of the film as the container 12 is fabricated may be sealed and/or attached to
the outer surface of the container 12 to form and shape the container 12.
 [0033]          As illustrated in Figure 1, the container 12 includes the opening 20 through at least
one of the plurality of walls 16. The opening 20 may be disposed through any suitable wall
or walls of the plurality of walls 16. For example, the opening 20 may be disposed through
the top wall 16a (i.e., an access panel or opening panel), as illustrated in Figure 1. As used
herein, the term opening panel is used to describe any panel in which the opening is formed
or defined. The opening 20 may have any suitable shape or combination of shapes to allow a
user to access the interior volume 18 through the opening 20. For example, as illustrated in
Figures 1 and 7, the opening 20 may have an elongated shape that extends along a horizontal
opening axis 52 that is parallel to the X-axis of the reference coordinate system of Figure 1.
The opening axis 52 may extend from a first end 53 of the opening 20 to a second end 54 that
is opposite the first end 53, and the opening axis 52 may at least partially extend along or
adjacent to a top surface of the first sheet 14 comprising the top wall 16a. The opening axis
52 may be equidistant from the first side wall 16b and the second side wall 16c when viewed
along the Z-axis of the reference coordinate system of Figure 1. The perimeter of the
opening 20 may be defined by an opening edge 55 that may include one or more segments.
For example, the opening edge 55 may include a first side edge 56a and a second side edge
56b, and each of the first side edge 56a and the second side edge 56b may be parallel to and
equidistantly offset from the opening axis 52. Each of the first side edge 56a and the second
side edge 56b may be disposed a first distance DIfrom the opening axis 52. The opening
edge 55 may also include an end edge 58 that may extend between a first end of the first side
edge 56a and a first end of the second side edge 56b at the second end 54 of the opening 20.
A curved front edge 60 may extend from a second end of the first side edge 56a and a second
end of the second side edge 56b towards the first end 53 of the opening 20. The front edge
60 may be symmetrically formed about the opening axis 60 and a distance between the front
edge 60 and the opening axis 24 may increase from the first end 53 of the opening 20 to the
second end of the first and second side edges 56a, 56b. The front edge 60 may have the
                                                       23

shape of a portion of a circle, a portion of an oval, or a portion of a parabola, a square, or a
rectangle, for example. The front edge 60 may also have a point or chevron (not shown) to
create a starting point. The edge surface of the opening edge 55 may be smooth, wavy,
scalloped, or have any other suitable texture or shape. The opening 20 can have a
symmetrical or an asymmetric shape.
[0034]            The opening 20 may be formed in a cutting operation. For example, in one
embodiment a cutting operation can include forming cuts for the first and second side edges
56a, 56b and the front edge 60 from the first sheet 14, while all or a portion of the end edge
58 may remain integrally secured to the first sheet 14 to form a portion of the hinge portion
28. In such an operation, an underportion 62 of the first sheet 14 is formed that is disposed
inward of the first and second side edges 56a, 56b and inward of the front edge 60 (when
formed during the cutting operation) and that may be pivotably coupled to the container 12
about the portion of the first sheet 14 at or adjacent to the end edge 58. In alternative
embodiments, the opening 20 may be formed in a cutting operation that cuts along the entire
opening edge 55. The cutting operation may cut substantially along the entire opening edge
55, and gaps or bridges may be provided along the opening edge 55 as desired.
[0035]           In alternative embodiments, an opening 20 can be defined in the container 12 (such
as on the top wall 16a of the container) by forming or defining the underportion 62 in a
portion of the top wall 16a such that when the underportion 62 is at least partially removed
from the remaining portion of the top wall 16a the opening 20 is defined. That is, the
underportion 62 may not be secured to the lid member 26. This can allow the re-closable
packaging assembly 10 to remain sealed, for example, hermetically sealed, until the first use
by the users. Such an embodiment can advantageously be utilized to provide a tamper
evident packaging assembly 10 in which the user would readily be able to determine if the
package 10 was previously opened by observing whether the underportion 62 had been at
least partially detached from the container 12. Any other known tamper evident mechanisms
can be provided on the container 12 as is known in the art. The underportion 62 may be
configured to completely or partially detach from the remaining portion of the container 12.
For example, the underportion 62 may be configured to partially detach from the container 12
                                                    24

such that it remains at least partially attached to the container 12. In other embodiments, the
underportion 62 can completely detach from the access panel 14.
[0036]           Referring to Figure 3, the underportion 62 of the first sheet 14 may be at least
partially secured to the second sheet 24 of the lid member 26. More specifically, all or a
portion of a first surface 90 of the underportion 62 may be secured to all or a portion of a
second surface 92 of the second sheet 24 of lid member 26. Preferably, the entire first
surface 90 of the underportion 62 may be secured to a portion of the second surface 92 of the
lid member 26. The underportion 62 may be secured to the second sheet 24 of the lid
member 26 in any manner known in the art, such as by the use of an adhesive, heat sealing,
ultra-sonic sealing, etc. Suitable adhesives may be pressure sensitive acrylics, two-part dry
bond, single component polyurethanes, and thermally activated, for example. Because the
underportion 62 may be formed in the cutting operation that forms the opening 20, the
underportion 62 may have dimensions that are equal or substantially equal to corresponding
dimensions of the opening 20. Specifically, the underportion 62 may have first and second
side edges 94a, 94b that dimensionally correspond to the first and second side edges 56a, 56b
of the opening 20 and a front edge 96 that dimensionally corresponds to the front edge 60, as
illustrated in Figures 2, 3, 6, and Figure 8. In the first position 30, a longitudinal axis of the
underportion 62 may be collinear with the opening axis 52, and the underportion 62 may be
symmetrically formed about the longitudinal axis.
[0037]            The underportion 62 may be defined in any suitable way. For example, the
underportion 62 (and, by extension) the opening 20) may be defined by a path of reduced
strength that allows the underportion 62 to be at least partially detached along the path of
reduced strength when a force is applied to pull the underportion 62 away from the remaining
portion of the container 12. The path of reduced strength defining the underportion 62 in the
container 12 may be provided by any suitable method, including, for example, by laser
scoring, mechanical scoring or a similar process for forming perforations in the first sheet 14
without puncturing the sheet, but allowing puncturing if necessary or desired based on the
requirements for the re-closable packaging assembly 10 and/or the stored product.
Alternatively, blade scoring with approximately 60%-100% penetration, for example, may be
used to form a score line defining the underportion 62 instead of individual perforations. In
                                                     25

such embodiments, it can be possible to retain a hermetic seal in the container until the first
opening of the container as there is not full penetration through the first sheet 14 until the
underportion 62 is separated from the first sheet 14. In other embodiments, full penetration
through the first sheet 14 may be performed by blade scoring to facilitate detachment of the
underportion 62. For example, a continuous blade score with full penetration through the
first sheet 14 may be performed with intermittent interruptions or bridges in the score line
being provided to hold the underportion 62 in place until the underportion 62 is detached by
the user. The distance between the bridges may range from 200 micron to 2.0", and the
length of the bridges may fall within the range of 50 microns 2500 microns depending on the
implementation.
[0038]            Other suitable methods of forming a score or perforation to define the opening edge
include laser scoring/cutting, laser perforation or micro perforation methods, for example,
using dies or knifes.
[0039]           As illustrated in Figure 1, the first engagement feature 36 may be disposed on the
container 12 adjacent to the opening 20, and the first engagement feature may be integrally
formed on or with the container 12. The first engagement feature 36 may be adapted to
engage the second engagement feature 38 disposed on the lid member 26 of the closure
assembly 22 such that the first engagement feature 36 engages the second engagement feature
38 to removably secure the lid member 26 to the container 12 when the lid member 26 is in
the first position 30 illustrated in Figure 4. The first engagement feature 36 may be any
element or combination of elements that engage a corresponding second engagement feature
38 to allow the lid member to releasably engage the container 12. For example, the first
engagement feature 36 may be a ridge 40 that may vertically extend upward from the top wall
16a and that may be integrally formed on or with the top wall 16a. The ridge 40 may extend
along a ridge axis 64 that has a general U-shape (when viewed along the Z-axis of the
reference coordinate system of Figure 1) and that extends around the opening 20, and the
open end of the U-shaped ridge axis 64 may be at or adjacent to the second end 54 of the
opening 20. The ridge axis 64 may be outwardly offset a uniform distance from the first side
edge 56a, the second side edge 56b, and the front edge 60.

[0040]           As illustrated in Figures 1 and 5, the ridge 40 may be formed in the first sheet 14
and may have any suitable cross-sectional shape or combination of shapes (when viewed
along the ridge axis 64). For example, the ridge 40 may include a pair of inwardly-tapering
sides 66a, 66b and a top wall 68. The cross-sectional shape of the ridge 40 may be uniform
or substantially uniform along the ridge axis 64. However, the ends of the ridge 40 that make
up the legs of the U-shape that are adjacent to the second end 54 of the opening 20 may
gradually downwardly taper such that the top wall 68 is flush or substantially flush with a top
surface of the first sheet 14 (i.e., a top surface of the top wall 16a). Instead of a gradual taper,
the ends of the ridge 40 may be chamfered or may be rounded. Alternatively, the ends of the
ridge 40 may not taper, and the cross-sectional shape of the ridge 40 may be uniform or
substantially uniform along the entire ridge axis 64.
[0041]           As previously explained, the ridge 40 may be adapted to engage a corresponding
channel 42 (see Figure 3) formed in the lid member 26 of the closure assembly 22 when the
lid member 26 is in the first position 30 illustrated in Figure 4, and the channel 42 will be
described in more detail below. Instead of a single ridge 40, the first engagement feature 36
may include two or more ridge segments (not shown) that are not continuous over the length
of the ridge axis. That is, gaps may separate the two or more ridge segments, and each of the
ridge segments may be adapted to engage a corresponding channel segment or a portion of a
channel 42 formed in the lid member 26 of the closure assembly 22 when the lid member 26
is in the first position 30.
[0042]           As illustrated in Figure 1, the re-closable packaging assembly 10 also includes the
closure assembly 22 secured to the container 12 adjacent to the opening 20 or adjacent to an
area in which the opening is defined (as when the underportion 62 acts as a removable seal to
cover the opening 20). The closure assembly 22 includes the lid member 26 and the hinge
portion 28, and the lid member 26 is pivotable about the hinge portion 28 between the first
position 30 and the second position 34. At least a portion of the closure assembly 22 may
include the second sheet 24 and a portion of the first sheet 14. More specifically, the lid
member 26 may partially include the second sheet 24, and the second sheet may be sized and
dimensioned to cover the opening 20 when the lid member 26 is in the first position 30. The
second sheet 24 may be any suitable material, such as any of the previously-described
                                                       27

materials that may comprise the first sheet 14. Specifically, the second sheet 24 may be PP,
PET, or PLA, or any other suitable material. The second sheet 24 may have a uniform
thickness, or the thickness may vary. In this first position 30, the lid member 26 may have an
elongated shape that extends along a longitudinal lid axis 70 from a first end 72 to a second
end 74 that is adjacent to the hinge portion 28, as illustrated in Figures 2 and 4. The lid axis
70 may at least partially extend along or adjacent to a bottom surface of the second sheet 24
(and a top surface of the first sheet 14) such that the lid axis 70 is collinear (or substantially
collinear) with the opening axis 52 when the lid member 26 is in the first position 30. In
alternative embodiments, the lid member 26 of the closure assembly 22 may include only the
second sheet 24, and the underportion 62 may remain secured to the container 12 to cover the
opening 20 and to act as a seal as previously described.
[0043]           As illustrated in Figures 2 and 8, the lid member 26 may include a lid edge 76 that
defines the outer edge (or an outer perimeter edge) of the lid member 26, and the lid edge 76
may include one or more segments. For example, the lid edge 76 may include a first side
edge 78a and a second side edge 78b, and each of the first side edge 78a and the second side
edge 78b may be parallel to and equidistantly offset from the lid axis 70. Each of the first
side edge 78a and the second side edge 78b may be disposed a second distance D2 from the
lid axis 70, and the second distance D2 may be greater than the first distance D1 that
separates each of the first side edge 56a and the second side edge 56b from the opening axis
52. A first end of the first side edge 78a and a first end of the second side edge 78b may be
disposed adjacent to the hinge portion 28 at the second end 54 of the opening 20.
[0044]            The lid edge 76 may also include a curved front edge 80 that extends from a second
end of the first side edge 78a and a second end of the second side edge 56b towards the first
end 53 of the opening 20. The front edge 80 may be symmetrically formed about the lid axis
60 and a distance between the front edge 80 and the lid axis 70 may increase from the first
end 72 of the lid member 26 to the second end of the first and second side edges 78a, 78b.
The front edge 80 may have the same or substantially the same general shape as the front
edge 60 of the opening 20. That is, the front edge 80 may have the shape of a portion of a
circle, a portion of an oval, or a portion of a parabola, a square, or a rectangle, for example.
The front edge 80 may be outwardly offset from the front edge 60 of the opening, and the
                                                       28

distance of offset may be uniform. For example, the offset distance may be the difference
between the second distance D2 of the lid member 26 and the first difference D1 of the
opening 20. The front edge 80 may include a pull tab 117 (illustrated in Figures 20A and
20B) that projects away from the second engagement feature 38 to facilitate the opening and
closing of the lid member 26 by a user.
[0045]           As illustrated in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 8, the lid member 26 of the closure assembly
22 includes the second engagement feature 38 adapted to engage the first engagement feature
36 disposed on the container 12 to removably secure the lid member 26 to the container 12
when the lid member 26 is in the first position 30 illustrated in Figure 4, and the second
engagement feature 38 may be integrally formed on or with the lid member 26. The second
engagement feature 38 may be any element or combination of elements that engage a
corresponding first engagement feature 36 to allow the lid member to sealingly engage the
container 12. For example, the second engagement feature 38 may be a channel 42 adapted
to receive the ridge 40 formed on the top wall 16a of the container 12. As illustrated in
Figure 3, the channel 42 may vertically extend upward (or substantially vertically upward)
from a first surface 82 of the second sheet 24, and, as shown in Figure 2, the channel may
extend along a channel axis 84. The channel axis 84 may have a general U-shape, and the
open end of the U-shaped channel axis 84 may be at or adjacent to the second end 74 of the
lid member 26. Referring to Figures 54A, and 59-65, in various embodiments, the channel
can be continuous, surrounding the entire perimeter of the opening. As described in detail
below, in such embodiments, the lid member can be completely removable from the
container, or can be hinged to the container, for example, at a second end of the lid member.
The channel axis 84 may be inwardly offset a uniform distance from the first side edge 78a,
the second side edge 78b, and the front edge 80 of the lid member 26. The channel axis 84
may overlap or substantially overlap (i.e., have the same shape, dimension, and relative
position) the ridge axis 64 when viewed along the Z-axis of the reference coordinate system
of Figure 1 when the lid member 26 is in the first position 30. The channel 42 may have a
uniform or substantially uniform cross-sectional shape along the channel axis 84.
Alternatively, the channel 42 may have a non-uniform cross-sectional shape.

[0046]           Referring to Figure 3, the channel 42 may be formed in the first sheet 14 and may
have any suitable cross-sectional shape or combination of shapes (when viewed along the
channel axis 84). For example, the channel 42 may include a pair of inwardly-tapering
surfaces 86a, 86b and a bottom surface 88, and the surfaces 86a, 86b, 88 are adapted to
contact or be adjacent to a corresponding surface of the ridge 40 (i.e., the inwardly-tapering
sides 66a, 66b and a top wall 68, respectively), when the lid member 26 is in the first position
30. The cross-sectional shape of the channel 42 may be uniform or substantially uniform
along the channel axis 84, and may correspond to the cross-sectional shape of the ridge 40
along the ridge axis 64. The ends of the channel 42 that make up the legs of the U-shape that
are adjacent to the second end 74 of the lid member 26 may gradually taper to receive the
corresponding tapered ends of the ridge 40.
[0047]            Instead of a single channel 42, the second engagement feature 38 may include two
or more channel segments (not shown) that are not continuous over the length of the channel
axis 84. Each of these channel segments may correspond to a previously-described ridge
segments formed on the top wall 16a of the container 12 such that each of the ridge segments
may be adapted to engage a corresponding channel segment or a portion of a channel 42
formed in the lid member 26 of the closure assembly 22 when the lid member 26 is in the
first position 30.
[0048]           In an alternative embodiment, the first engagement feature 36 may be a channel 42
that may vertically extend downward from the top wall 16a of the container 12, and the
second engagement feature 38 may be ridge 40 that may vertically extend downward from
the lid member 26 of the closure assembly 22. In the first position 30, the ridge 40 may be
received into the channel 42 to allow the lid member to sealingly engage the container 12.
[0049]           Referring to Figures 59-65, the lid member can include one or more additional
closure features 500, including undercuts, button or snap in features, or other interacting
locking features. For example, as shown in Figure 59, the lid member can include a single
closure feature 500 disposed at a first end 502 of the lid 26, and arranged in approximately
the center the closure feature can include a downwardly projecting portion formed in the
second sheet. The downwardly projecting portion formed in the second sheet can interact, for
example, reside in, a correspondingly shaped and sized recess formed in the first sheet, when
                                                       30

the lid is in the closed position. Figure 61 shows that a lid can include a closure feature 500
that is defined by an upwardly projecting portion formed in the first sheet and a receiving
recess formed in the second sheet, with the receiving recess being arranged such the
upwardly projecting portion resides in the receiving recess when the lid is in the closed
position.
[0050]            The lid member can include any number of closure features. For example, Figure
60 illustrates an embodiment having two closure features 500a, 500b disposed in the corners
of the lid near the first end of the lid. The closure feature(s) 500 can be disposed in any
suitable location of the lid to aid in securing the lid 26 in the closed position. For example,
the closure feature 500 can be provided in a center region of the lid 26 (as illustrated for
example in Figure 70), or near an edge of the lid 26 (as illustrated for example in Figures 60
and 71). The closure feature 500 can have any suitable shape. For example, Figures 59 and
60 illustrate embodiments in which the closure feature has a circular shape. Figure 61
illustrates an embodiment in which the closure feature has an oblong shape. For example, the
closure feature can have any shape, including circular, elliptical, square, rectangular,
triangular, or any other polygonal shape. Figure 64 illustrates an embodiment in which the
closure feature 500 has a tear-drop shape that projects downwardly from the second sheet 416
towards the opening. The closure feature 500 can have increasing depth as it approaches the
first end of the lid member 26, for example, as illustrated in Figure 64.
[0051]           As illustrated in Figures 1, 6, and 8, the lid member 26 of the closure assembly 22
may include a convex portion 98 to provide structural support to the lid member 26. The
convex portion 98 may extend from the second end 74 of the lid member 26 towards the first
end 72, and a back edge 100 of the convex portion 98 adjacent to the second end 74 may
comprise a portion of the hinge portion 28. More specifically, the lid member 26 may pivot
about the back edge 100 of the convex portion to displace from the first position 30 to the
second position 34. The back edge 100 may have the shape of a portion of an arc when
viewed along the Z-axis, and the shape of the back edge 100 coupled with the shape of the
convex portion 98 cooperate to maintain the lid member 26 in a rigidly erect position when in
the second position 34. For example, the lid axis 70 may form an angle between 45 degrees
and 125 degrees with the opening axis 52 when the lid member 26 is in the second position
                                                        31

34. Instead of an arc, the back edge 100 may include a plurality of arc segments or linear
segments that form a zigzag pattern.
[0052]           Referring again to Figures 1, 6, and 8, the convex portion 98 may have a parabolic
shape or a substantially parabolic shape when viewed along the Z-axis of the reference
coordinate system of Figure 1. The convex portion 98 may be symmetrically formed along
the lid axis 70, and the distance between a top surface of the first sheet 14 comprising the
convex portion 98 and the lid axis 70 may gradually decrease as the convex portion 98
extends from the second end 74 of the lid member 26 towards the first end 72, as illustrated
in Figure 6. For example, the distance between a top surface of the first sheet 14 comprising
the convex portion 98 and the lid axis 70 may gradually decrease as the convex portion 98
extends from the lid axis 70 towards the each of the first and second side edge 78a, 78b, as
illustrated in Figure 9. In addition, when view in cross-section along the lid axis 70; the
convex portion 98 may have a curved or substantially curved shape. In alternative
embodiments, the convex portion 98 may be have a generally triangle shape when viewed
along the Z-axis of the reference coordinate system of Figure 1, as provided in the
illustrations of the thermoforming molds of Figures 17A to 17J.
[0053]            Referring now to Figure 1, the closure assembly 22 may include a support portion
102 that extends from the second end 74 of the lid member 26 towards the fourth side wall
16e of the container 12, and a portion of the support portion 102 adjacent to the second end
74 of the lid member 26 may comprise a portion of the hinge portion 28. The support portion
102 may be formed from the second sheet 24, and the all or a portion of the second sheet 24
of the support portion 102 may be secured to a portion of the first sheet 14 (e.g., the top wall
16a of the container 12) adjacent to the fourth side wall 16e of the container 12. The support
portion 102 may structurally secure the lid member 26 to the container 12 and allow the lid
member 26 to pivot about the hinge portion 28. A portion of the support portion 102 (either
or both of the first sheet 14 and the second sheet 24) may extend from the hinge portion 28
through the gap between the fourth side wall 16e and the top wall 16a such that the portion of
the first sheet 14 is disposed against a portion of the internal surface of the fourth side wall
16e. The support portion 102 may be partially defined by a pair of lateral edges 103a, 103b
that may extend parallel to or substantially parallel to the first and second side edges 78a, 78b
                                                      32

when the lid member 26 is in the first position 30. However, the distance between each of
the pair of lateral edges 103a, 103b and the lid axis 70 may be less than the distance between
the first and second side edges 78a, 78b and the lid axis 70.
[0054]           As illustrated in Figures 1, 4, 6 and 7, the re-closable packaging assembly 10 may
also include a first securement feature 104a and a second securement feature 104b. The first
securement feature 104a may be a protrusion formed on the container 12, and the second
securement feature 104b may be a cavity formed on the lid member 26 that is adapted to
receive the first securement feature 104a, as illustrated in Figure 10. More specifically, the
first securement feature 104a may be an elongated protrusion formed along a portion of the
ridge axis 64, and the protrusion may have a plurality of side walls 106a-d that extend
vertically beyond the top wall 68 of the ridge 40, as shown in Figure 11 A. The first side wall
106a and oppositely-disposed second side wall 106b may be curved to correspond to the
contour of the ridge axis 64, and the third 106c and fourth side walls 106d may each extend
between the first 106a and second side wall 106b. The third 106c and fourth side walls 106d
may have any suitable cross-sectional shape, such as curved, linear, a chevron, a triangle, or
partially curved. A top surface 108 may be parallel or substantially parallel to and vertically
offset from the top wall 68 of the ridge 40. All or part of any or all of the plurality of side
walls 106a-d may be formed as an undercut. That is, the one or more side walls 106a-d or a
portion of the one or more side walls 106a-d may form an acute angle with the top surface of
the top wall 16a (i.e., the first sheet 14) of the container 12. Such an undercut will allow the
lid member 26 to "positively" secure to the container 12. The undercut may also be formed
on or into the first ridge 40.
[0055]           As previously explained, the second securement feature 104b may be a cavity
formed on the lid member 26. More specifically, the second securement feature 104b may be
an elongated cavity 109 formed on an underside of a protrusion formed along a portion of the
channel axis 84, and the cavity 109 may be adapted to receive the first securement feature
104a. As illustrated in Figures 2 and 1 IB, the cavity 109 may have a plurality of side
surfaces 1 Oa-d that each extend vertically upwards from a bottom surface 112 of the second
sheet 24 of the lid member 26. A first side surface 1 10a and an oppositely-disposed second
side surface 1 10b may be curved or contoured to correspond to the curved shape of the first
                                                       33

side wall 106a and the second side wall 106b, respectively of the first securement feature
104a. Similarly, a third side surface 1 Oc and a fourth side surface 1 Od may be shaped to
correspond to the shape of the third 106c and fourth side walls 106d of the first securement
feature 104a.
[0056]            Referring to Figures 2, 8, and 1 IB, a top surface 114 may be parallel or
substantially parallel to and vertically offset from the bottom surface 88 of the channel 42,
and a vertical distance between the top surface 114 and the bottom surface 112 of the second
sheet 24 of the lid member 26 may be greater than a vertical distance between the bottom
surface 88 of the channel 42 and the bottom surface 112 of the second sheet 24. The first
securement feature 104a may be dimensioned and sized such that the first securement feature
104a may be engaged (e.g., be received into) the second securement feature 104b to allow the
lid member 26 to sealingly engage the container 12. All or part of any or all of the plurality
of side surfaces 11 0a-d may be formed as an undercut. That is, the one or more side surfaces
1 Oa-d or a portion of the one or more side surfaces 1 Oa-d may form an acute angle with the
bottom surface 112 of the second sheet 24 of the lid member 26. The undercut of the first
securement feature 104a may engage a corresponding undercut on the second securement
feature 104b to releasably lock or secure the lid member 26 to the container 12. Instead of an
acute angle, a portion of the one or more side surfaces 11 0a-d may include a detent that starts
.050" from the top surface 108, proceeds down and inward at a 45' angle for about .070", and
transitions downward for .050", then down and outward at 35'. These dimensions are for
illustrative purposes only, other dimensions may be suitable. One having ordinary skill in the
art would recognize that a corresponding similar detent or protrusion may be formed on or in
the first securement feature 104a.
[0057]            In alternative embodiments, the first securement feature 104a may be a cavity
formed in a channel 42 that may vertically extend downward from the top wall 16a of the
container 12, and the second securement feature 104b may be a protrusion that may extend
downwardly from the lid member 26 of the closure assembly 22. In the first position 30, the
protrusion may be received into the cavity to allow the lid member to sealingly engage the
container 12.

[0058]           An alternative closure assembly 22 is illustrated in Figures 20A and 20B. In this
embodiment, the support portion 102 may be at least partially disposed on or secured to the
top wall 16a of the container 12. When viewed parallel to the Z-axis of the reference
coordinate system of Figure 1, the support portion 102 may be defined by a pair of parallel
lateral edges 103a, 103b, and a rear edge 105 extends between the lateral edges 103a, 103b
such that the support portion 102 is disposed on the top wall 16a. Alternatively, a portion of
the support portion 102 may be inserted through a gap between the top wall 16a and the
fourth side wall 16e. The hinge portion 28 may include a pair of oppositely-disposed cuts
107a, 107b that may inwardly extend from each of the pair of parallel lateral edges 103a,
103b (and inward from the first and second side edges 78a, 78b of the lid member 26 adjacent
to the second end 74 of the lid member 26). The cuts 107a, 107b may be symmetrical about
the lid axis 70. Each of the cuts 107a, 107b may include a first segment 111a, 111 b normal to
the corresponding lateral edge 103a, 103b. A second segment 113a, 113b may obliquely
extend from an end of the first segment 111 a, 111 b towards the first end 72 of the lid member
26. A third segment 115a, 1 15b may inwardly extend from a corresponding end of the
second segment 113a, 1 13b parallel to the first segment 111 a, 111 b. A terminal end of the
third segment 115a, 1 15b may be disposed a suitable distance from the lid axis 70 such that
the lid member 26 may pivot from a first position 30 to the second position 34 about a portion
of the closure member extending between a terminal end of each of the cuts 107a, 107b (i.e.,
a terminal end of each of the third segments 115a, 1 15b). Specifically, the lid member 26
may pivot from a first position 30 to the second position 34 about a crease or fold (that may
be scored, perforated, or formed as a feature on the closure member 22) that extends between
the terminal ends of each of the third segment 115a, 1 15b.
[0059]           When the lid member 26 is pivoted into a second position 34 illustrated in Figure
20B, a first lid projection 1 19a and a second lid projection 1 19b may snap, deform, or move
to a position in which an edge formed by one of more of the segments 111 a, 111 b, 113a,
1 13b, 115a, 1 15b engages the support portion 102 to support the lid member 26 in the second
position 34. Alternatively, the first lid projection 1 19a and the second lid projection 119b
may remain stationary relative to the remainder of the lid member 25 when engaging the
support portion 102 to support the lid member 26 in the second position 34. As the lid
member 26 is pivoted from the first position 30 to the second position 34, the lid member 26
                                                    35

may deform (e.g., take on a cambered shape) to provide longitudinal rigidity to the lid
member 26. The second position 34 may be a position that is intermediate between a first
position (e.g., a closed position) and a fully open position (a third position) in which the lid
member 26 or a portion of the lid member may be adjacent to a top portion of the fourth side
wall 16e. In the second position, the lid axis 70 may form an angle with the top wall 16a of
the container 12 (or with the position of the lid axis 70 when the lid member is in the first
position 30) that is between 300 and 1200.
[0060]            The hinge portion 28 including the cuts 107a, 107b may be used in embodiments in
which the lid member 26 includes an underportion 62, and the cuts 107a, 107b may extend
through each of the first sheet 14 (the underportion 62) and the second sheet 24.
Alternatively, the cuts 107a, 107b may extend only through the second sheet 24 and not the
underportion 62. The hinge portion 28 including the cuts 107a, 107b may also be used in
embodiments in which the lid member 26 is formed of only the second sheet 24 (i.e., when
the lid member 26 does not have an underportion 62). The cuts 107a, 107b may extend
through the second sheet 24 (and, optionally, the underportion 62), partially through the
second sheet 24 (and, optionally, the underportion 62), or a combination thereof. The cuts
107a, 107b may be continuous or may comprise cut segments and gaps between the
segments. The cuts 107a, 107b may be perforated or scored (or any combination thereof).
[0061]            The above-described hinge portion 28 that includes the cuts 107a, 107b can also be
suitable for use in a package not including a lid member 26. For example, packages can
generally include a re-sealable or re-closable label disposed on the first sheet 14, covering the
opening 20. The hinge portion 28 as described above can be formed, as described above, in
the re-sealable label to allow the re-sealable label to pivot about the hinge portion 22 and
reside in a position that is intermediate from a closed position and a fully open position (i.e.,
the second position).
[0062]           As illustrated in Figure 18, the closure assembly 22 may include a locking
mechanism 126 that includes a locking feature 128 that is received into a receiving feature
130 when the lid member 26 is in a fully open position. The locking feature 128 may be a
protrusion that upwardly extends from the lid member 26, and the protrusion may have a
rectangular, square, round, or any other suitable cross-sectional shape or combination of
                                                       36

cross-sectional shapes. The receiving feature 130 may be formed in the support portion 102
(or in the container 12 itself) on an opposite side of the hinge portion 28, and the receiving
feature 130 may include a pair of receiver protrusions 132 that are separated to form a
receiving slot 134 therebetween. Each of the pair of receiver protrusions 132 may have a
rectangular, square, round, or any other suitable cross-sectional shape or combination of
cross-sectional shapes. The width of the receiving slot 134 is approximately equal to or
slightly less than a corresponding width of the locking feature 128 such that the locking
feature 128 (and, consequently, the entire lid member 26) is retained in the receiving slot 134
when the lid member 26 is pivoted about the hinge portion 28 such that the lid member 26 is
in a fully open position. An undercut may be formed in the pair of receiver protrusions 132
and/or in the locking feature 128 to positively lock the locking feature 128 within the
receiving slot 134. The locking mechanism 126 may be formed in a thermoforming
operation using one of the molds illustrated in Figures 16A to 17J, for example.
Features For Retaining the Lid or Resealable Flap in an Open Position
[0063]            In various embodiments, the closure assembly or resealable flap can include
features disposed on the lid member that retain the lid member in an open position (second
position), which can facilitate access to the package. Referring to Figure 26, the lid member
226 can include first and second projections 219a, 219b that pivot upon opening of the lid
member 226 from a first (closed) position to the second (open) position. While description
below is provided with respect to the lid including two projections, it should be understood
that the lid can include any suitable number of projections, including a single projection or
greater than two projections. The projection or projections facilitate retaining the lid member
226 in the second position. The first and second projections 219a, 219b can be disposed in
the region of the hinge portion 228 of the lid member 226 and are positioned so that the axis
of the hinge lies between the projections and the distal end of the lid 226. Referring to Figure
27, the first and second projections 219a, 219b each have a first end 230a and a second end
230b. The projections are formed by cuts in the lid member such that the first end 230a of
the projections 219a, 219b remain attached to the lid member 226 and the second end 230b
and periphery of the projections 219a, 219b can detach from a portion of the second sheet
224 and pivot from a first position to a second position when the lid member 226 is moved
from the first position to the second position. In the first position, the lid projections 219a,
                                                     37
10133467_2 (GHMatters) P99740.AU.1

                                                                        Attorney Docket No.: 31332/47193
219b can be generally disposed parallel to the top wall 216a of the package. Referring to
Figure 28, in the second position the lid projections 219a, 219b can be positioned generally
perpendicular to the top wall 216a of the package 212, with the second end 230b of each lid
projection 219a, 219b being in contact with the top wall 216a, thereby retaining the lid
member 226 in the second position. For example, the friction between the projections 219a,
219b and the top wall 216a can resist the lid from closing by gravity force. The friction
interference between the projections 219a, 219b can be a function of how far the top wall
216a is deflected by the projections 219a, 219b during movement from the first to second
position. The amount of friction is sufficient to retain the lid 226 in the second position, but
can be overcome without damage to the projections 219a, 219b to return the lid and the
projections to the first (closed position).
[0064]            The first and second projections 219a, 219b can have any suitable shape, such as
for example, semi-circular, triangular, semi-hexagonal, and "W-shaped". Figure 29 is a
schematic illustration of the region of hinge portions 228 of lid members 226 having
differently shaped and sized projections 219a, 219b. In various embodiments, the first and
second projections 219a, 219b have the same shape and the same size. In some
embodiments, the first and second projections 219a, 219b can have different shapes and/or
different sizes.
[0065]            The first and second projections 219a, 219b have a length between the first and
second ends such that upon pivoting of the lid, the first and second projections 219a, 219b
move from the first position to the second position, the first and second projections 219a,
219b can contact the top wall 216a at least at their respective second edges 230b. The length
of the projections 219a, 219b can be adjusted to tailor the amount of force acting on and
resultant deflection of the top wall 216a by the projections 219a, 219b. In various
embodiments, the first and second projections 219a, 219b have a length such that the
projections 219a, 219b do not excessively bend or deform during movement from the first
and second positions and can retain sufficient stiffness to retain the lid member 226 in the
second (open) position.
[0066]            Referring to Figure 30, the first and second projections 219a, 219b can have any
suitable width or diameter. In various embodiments, the width of the projections 219a, 219b
                                                        38

                                                                      Attorney Docket No.: 31332/47193
are selected such that the cuts in the lid member 226 for forming the projections 219a, 219b
do not overlap with cuts in the first sheet and the underportion (if provided) for forming the
opening in the package. By arranging the various cuts in such a fashion, the package can be
provided such that there is no opening in the package that is not covered by the lid member.
[0067]            The top wall of the container can include one or more features disposed below the
first and second projections to aid in movement of the projections. The features can be
formed, for example, when forming, such as by thermoforming, the engagement and/or any
other closure features, on the lid. For example, the top wall can include one or more ridges
upon which the first and second projections can slide and ultimately reside against to aid in
maintaining the lid member in the open position.
[0068]           Referring to Figures 59-64, 70 and 71, the lid member can include additional
features to aid in retaining the lid in an open position and/or to add additional rigidity to the
lid member. For example, the lid can include a rib projecting upward from the top wall of the
container. The lid can include corner portions 506 having a thickness greater than a center
portion disposed between the comer portions. The varying thickness of the rib 51 and the
location of the rib 51 relative to the channel 42 can be arranged such that a back region of the
channel resides in the center portion when the lid member 26 is in the open position. The lid
member 26 can further include cut portions adjacent the back region of the channel that are
adapted to reside on the raised comers of the rib when the lid member is in the open position.
[0069]           Referring to Figure 65, in various embodiments, the lid member can be free of such
additional features, which can beneficially maximize the opening of the package. Figures
65A-E illustrate a mold for forming the lid 26 and Figure 65F illustrates a lid formed using
the mold of Figures 65A-E. As illustrated in Figure 65, the hinge 28 about which the lid 26
pivots can be disposed closely adjacent an end, for example the second end, of the lid
member 26. The first and second engagement features 34,36 can be channels and a
corresponding ridge defining the perimeter of the opening. The lid 26 can further include
projections 219 (described above) to aid in retaining the lid 26 in an opening position.
[0070]            The lid 26 can also include one or more closure features 500 to help retain the lid in
the closed position. Any of the closure feature as discussed above can be used. Figure 65

illustrates an embodiment in which undercuts are positioned in the corners of the lid to aid in
closure.
[0071]           Referring to Figure 67, illustrates an embodiment of the lid channel having a
hexagonal shape, with corner regions 508 of the lid 26 being substantially flat or having a
subtle curvature. The corners can be angled for example from about 30 degrees to about 60
degrees, about 30 degrees to about 45 degrees, about 30 degrees to about 35 degrees. Other
suitable values for the angle of the comer include, for example, about 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, and
60 degrees. Locking mechanisms 510, provided as undercuts in the corner regions, can be
provided to aid in retaining the lid in the closed position.
[0072]            In various embodiments, the lid can be provided with a pull tab disposed in the
comer region 508 of the lid 26, as opposed to a center portion of the lid 26. It should be
understood herein that lids in accordance with the disclosure can include one or more pull
tabs 117 disposed in any location of the lid 26. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is
believe that providing a pull tab 117 in a corner region 508 of the lid 26 can facilitate opening
of the lid 26, by reducing the amount of mechanical closure force of the lid 26 that must be
overcome to open the package as compared to a pull tab 117 disposed in center region of the
lid 117. It has been observed that by providing a pull tab 117 in the comer 508 the
mechanical force to open the container can be reduced from approximately 1000 grams of
mechanical force for a center pull tab to 150 grams mechanical strength. The embodiment of
Figure 70 illustrates an embodiment having two pull tabs 11 7a, 11 7b disposed at opposite
comers 508 of the front of the lid 26. Any suitable number of pull tabs, including zero or a
single, pull tab can be provided on packages in accordance with embodiments of the
disclosure.
[0073]            Referring to Figure 68, the lid 26 can have a center portion 512 with a curvature
extending downwardly (concave) into the interior of the package. The concave center portion
512 can provide the package, and particularly, the lid 26 with increased resistance from
opening due to internal pressure in the container. For example, during shipping the packages
may experience different pressure environments, even been subject to significant vacuum
                                                       40

pressure. The concave portion of the lid can provide some tolerance of the lid for such
pressure changes that may be experienced during, for example, shipping.
[0074]           Additionally, referring to Figures 68 and 69A and 69B, by providing the lid with a
downward concave portion 512, a portion of the lid can be disposed below the top surface of
the opening panel region and can interact with the side wall 512 of the channel below the top
surface of the opening panel region. The side wall 514 of the channel can be provided with a
recesses grove 516 disposed around all or a portion of the opening into which a
corresponding projection on the edge of the lid can reside when the lid is in the closed
position. This can enhance the sealability of the lid and the resistance of the lid to accidental
opening when dropped or otherwise during handling, shipping, or storage.
[0075]            Referring again to Figure 27, a hinge portion 228 of the lid 226 is disposed between
the first and second projections 219a, 219b. In one embodiment, the hinge portion 228 is
disposed in line with the first end of the projections 230a. The hinge portion 228 can be
provided by a cut in the lid. The cut defining the hinge portion extends between but does not
overlap with the cuts defining the first and second projections. The cut can have a length such
that the cut for the hinge portion also does not overlap with cuts in the first sheet 214 and the
underportion 262 (if provided) for defining the opening 220 of the package 212.
[0076]            The above described first and second projections 219a, 219b and associated hinge
portion 228 can be incorporated into embodiments of the package 212 including either the
formed lid or the unformed lid in which a portion of the second sheet 224 removably attaches
to the first sheet 214 to cover the opening 220 of the package 212.
[0077]            One or more additional features may be disposed on the ridge 40 of the first
engagement feature 36 to further secure the lid member 26 to the container 12. For example,
as illustrated in Figure 13, one or more oblong protrusions 124 may outwardly project from
the exterior tapering side 66b of the ridge 40, and each protrusion 124 may be adapted to
engage a corresponding surface of the channel 42 of the lid member 26 to secure the lid
member 26 to the container 12 in the first position 30. Alternatively, or in addition, one or
more protrusions 124 or undercuts may be disposed on a surface of the channel 42 of the lid
member 26 to engage a corresponding surface or undercut of the ridge 40 to secure the lid
member 26 to the container 12 in the first position 30.

[0078]            To further assist in the coupling of the lid member 26 to the container 12 in the first
position 30, a releasable surface adhesive may be applied to all or a portion of the lid member
26 that contacts (and sealingly engages) the top wall 16a of the container 12 when the lid
member 26 is in the first position 30. Alternatively, or in addition to the adhesive described
above, a releasable surface adhesive may be applied to all or a portion of the top wall 16a of
the container 12 that contacts the lid member 26 when the lid member 26 is in the first
position 30. For example, a releasable surface adhesive. The surface adhesive may be any
suitable adhesive that provides for adhesion between the lid member 26 and the container 12
over the course of a suitable number of openings and closings by the user. Suitable adhesives
may be pressure sensitive acrylics, for example.
[0079]           As illustrated in Figure 12, a stabilizing portion 180, such as a third sheet 116 (or a
third film), may be secured (or integrally formed with) the first sheet 14 comprising the
container 12 to increase the gauge of the container 12 in the region of the stabilizing portion
180 to provide added stiffness to the container 12 in a desired area. The stabilizing portion
180 may advantageously be provided only at a portion of the top wall 16a of the container 12
without affecting the gauge of other portions of the container 12. This can be advantageous
when forming various re-closable packaging assembly 10 configurations in which sealing of
edges and/or folding of portions of the first sheet 14 may be made more difficult if a film
having an overall large gauge was used. Referring to Figure 32, in some embodiments, the
third sheet can have one or more portions that extend outwardly from a main body such that
upon forming of the package the main body remains in the region of the top wall and the one
or more outwardly extended portions are disposed on one or more sidewalls. The stabilizing
portion 180 may be secured to (or integrally formed with) the first sheet 14 in any manner
known in the art. Specifically, all or a portion of a top surface 118 (i.e., a first side or first
surface) of the third sheet 116 may be secured to all or a portion of a bottom surface 120 (i.e.,
a second side or second surface) of the first sheet 14 that comprises all or a portion of the top
wall 16a, with a top surface 122 (i.e., a first side or first surface) of the first sheet 14 may be
an exterior surface of the top wall 16a. For example, the third sheet 116 may be secured to
the bottom surface 120 of the first sheet 14 such that the opening 20 in the first sheet 14 is
entirely surrounded by the third sheet 116. The third sheet 116 may extend to the opening
edge 55, or may be outwardly offset from the opening edge 55. The third sheet 116 may also
                                                        42

extend to any one or more of the first, second, third, and fourth side walls 16b-16e, or the
third sheet 116 may be inwardly offset from any or all of the first, second, third, and fourth
side walls 16b-16e. The distance of the inward offset may vary or may be uniform from each
side wall 16b-16e. To secure the third sheet 116 to the first sheet 14, an adhesive may be
applied to all or a portion of the top surface of the third sheet 116. In addition, or
alternatively, an adhesive may be applied to all or a portion of the bottom surface 120 of the
first sheet 14. As an alternative to adhesive, the third sheet 116 may be integrally formed
with, heat sealed to, or ultra-sonically welded to the first sheet 14. The thickness of the third
sheet 116 may be uniform or may vary, and may have any thickness that provides a desired
stiffness to the top wall 16a of the container 12 to allow for suitable sealing engagement of
the lid member 26 and the container 12 in the first position 30.
[0080]            The stabilizing portion 180 may also include a coating, such as an ink or an
adhesive, applied selectively to the bottom surface 120 of the first sheet 14. The stabilizing
portion 180 may also include an additional material layer disposed on the bottom surface 120
of the first sheet 14. For example, the material may have a foam structure. In one
embodiment, a coating of a polymeric material may be applied to at least a portion of the
bottom surface 120 of the first sheet 14 and reacted to form a foam structure and thereby
form the stabilizing portion 180. In various embodiments, the stabilizing portion 180 may be
provided when forming the first sheet 14. For example, the first sheet 14 may be extruded to
have an increased gauge portion in the region of the first sheet 14 that is adapted to be
adjacent to the opening 20. For example, the first sheet 14 may be provided with an
additional laminated layer in the region of the first sheet 14 that is adapted to be adjacent to
the opening 20, as compared to the number of layers in other regions of the first sheet 14,
thereby increasing the gauge of the first sheet 14 in the region of the opening 20.
[0081]            The one or more ribs 51 (see Figure 18) or any other protrusion or combination of
protrusions formed on or along the top wall 16a of the container 12, including the second
engagement feature 38, may allow for the vertical stacking of re-closable packaging
assembles 10. More specifically, the vertically-projecting feature/features may engage a
portion of the wall downwardly projecting from the bottom wall 16f of the container, and

such engagement limits or prevents relative horizontal movement between stacked assemblies
10.
[0082]           As illustrated in Figures 55A, 55B, and 56A to 56D, the re-closable packaging
assembly 10 may include a closure assembly 339 that may include a lid member 340 similar
(or identical) to the hinged embodiment of the previously-disclosed lid member 26 with the
exception that the lid member 340 is completely removable from the container 12. That is,
the lid member 340 is movable between a first position (Figure 55A) in which the lid member
340 releasably engages a first portion of the container 12 surrounding the opening 20 and a
second position (Figure 55B) in which the lid member is not in contact with the container 12,
thereby allowing for a user to access the interior volume through the opening. The opening
20 may have any suitable shape or combination of shapes, such as a rectangular, oval,
oblong, round, and/or polygonal shape.
[0083]            Referring to Figures 54A to 54C, 55A, 55B, and 56A to 56D, the lid member 340
may have any suitable shape or combination of shapes, such as square, oval, oblong, and/or
polygonal, for example. More specifically, the lid member 340 may be rectangular. The lid
member 340 may be defined by a first lateral edge 341 and a second lateral edge 432 parallel
or substantially parallel to the first lateral edge 341. Alternatively, the first lateral edge 341
and the second lateral edge 432 may each have any suitable orientation. A first end edge 343
may extend between a first end of the first lateral edge 341 and a first end of the second
lateral edge 432. A second end edge 344 may extend between a second end of the first lateral
edge 341 and a second end of the second lateral edge 432. The first end edge 343 may be
parallel or substantially parallel to the second end edge 344, but the first end edge 343 and the
second end edge 344 may have any suitable orientation. Each of the edges 341-344 may be
linear or may be curved, partially, curved, contoured, partially contoured, scalloped, and/or
partially scalloped, for example.
[0084]            The lid member 340 of the closure assembly 339 may include the second
engagement feature 38 adapted to engage the first engagement feature 36 disposed on the
container 12 to removably secure the lid member 26 to the container 12 when the lid member
339 is in the first position 30 illustrated in Figure 55A, and the second engagement feature 38
may be integrally formed on or with the lid member 340. The second engagement feature 38

may be any element or combination of elements that engage a corresponding first
engagement feature 36 to allow the lid member 340 to sealingly engage the container 12. For
example, the second engagement feature 38 may be a channel 42 adapted to receive the ridge
40 formed on the top wall 16a of the container 12, as previously described. As an additional
example, the first engagement feature 36 may be a channel 42 that may vertically extend
downward from the top wall 16a of the container 12, and the second engagement feature 38
may be ridge 40 that may vertically extend downward from the lid member 340 of the closure
assembly 339. In the first position, the ridge 40 may be received into the channel 42 to allow
the lid member 340 to sealingly engage the container 12.
[0085]            The second engagement feature 38 may include a first portion 38a, a second portion
38b, a third portion 38c, and a fourth portion 38d, and the first portion 38a, the second
portion 38b, the third portion 38c, and the fourth portion 38d may be in alignment with a first
portion 36a, a second portion 36b, a third portion 36c, and a fourth portion 36d of the first
engagement feature 36, respectively, when the lid member 339 is in the first position 30
illustrated in Figure 55A. Each of the first portion 38a, the second portion 38b, the third
portion 38c, and the fourth portion 38d may be inwardly (and, optionally, equidistant) from
the first lateral edge 341, the second lateral edge 342, the first end edge 343, and the second
end edge 344, respectively. Each of the first portion 38a and second portion 38b may be
elongated and may have a longitudinal axis parallel to the first lateral edge 341.
Alternatively, each of the first portion 38a and second portion 38b may be elongated and may
have a longitudinal axis that is curved or bowed (or inwardly curved or bowed) relative to the
first lateral edge 341. Each of the third portion 38c and fourth portion 38d may be elongated
and may have a longitudinal axis parallel to the first end edge 343. Alternatively, each of the
third portion 38c and fourth portion 38d may be elongated and may have a longitudinal axis
that is curved or bowed (or inwardly curved or bowed) relative to the to the first end edge
343. Each of the corresponding first portion 36a, second portion 36b, third portion 36c, and
fourth portion 36d of the first engagement feature 36 may be similarly formed on the
container 12. Each of the first portion 38a, the second portion 38b, the third portion 38c, and
the fourth portion 38d of the second engagement feature 38 may form a continuous, single,
uninterrupted feature that completely surrounds the opening 20. Alternatively, one or more

gaps or interruptions may be disposed in or between the first portion 38a, the second portion
38b, the third portion 38c, and the fourth portion 38d of the second engagement feature 38.
[0086]            The re-closable packaging assembly 10 may also include a pour spout feature 345,
as illustrated in Figure 54C. The pour spout feature 345 may include any feature or
combination of features that allows for easier pouring out or dispensing of materials stored in
the interior volume of the container 12. For example, the pour spout feature 345 may be a
contoured edge 346 partially defining the opening 20 formed on the container 12 or partially
defining an edge of a removable cut-out through the lid member 340. In addition, the pour
spout feature 345 may comprise or partially comprise a vertical projection in contact with or
adjacent to the opening 20, and the vertical projection may be a upwardly-extending ridge or
lip that extends from the top wall 16a of the container. The vertical projection may be a
thermoformed feature that may be formed when the features of the closure assembly 22 are
formed. Alternatively, the vertical projection may be formed prior to or after the forming of
the features of the closure assembly 22.
Resealable Flexible Container
[0087]            In various embodiments, the package can be provided with a resealable opening as
opposed to a closure assembly. Any of the features described above, including for example,
the projections 219a, 291b, a hinge, pull tabs, etc., can be utilized in the packages in
accordance with embodiments of the disclosure a having resealable opening.
[0088]           Referring to Figures 72 and 73, in an embodiment, the package can be provided
with only the first sheet 614 and the second sheet 616 disposed on the first sheet 614, such
that the second sheet 616 defines at least a portion of the outer surface of the package in at
least one panel of the package. The second sheet 616 can be disposed in the opening panel
region 620 of the package and can extend over at least three walls, each of the three walls
being adjacent to one of the other walls in which the second sheet is disposed. The second
sheet 616 can be disposed over all or just a portion of any of the at least three walls. An
opening 20 can be defined in the first sheet 614 and a resealable flap 623 can be defined in
the second sheet 616 in the opening panel region 620 to cover the opening. The resealable
flap 623 is movable between a closed position in which the flap 623 is resealable attached to
the first sheet and covers the opening, and an open position in which the flap 623 is disposed
                                                     46

away from the opening and the opening is accessible. The opening panel region 620 can be
any one of the walls defining the package, including, for example, the top wall, as illustrated
in Figure 72, the front or back wall, or both the top wall and one or both of the front or back
wall. In some embodiments, as illustrated in Figure 73b, the opening 20 can extend from the
opening panel region 620 to one or more side walls or panels 624 of the package. Figure 73b
illustrates an embodiment in which the opening panel 20 extends across the opening panel
region 620 and to a side panel 624, with the pull tab 617 being located on the side panel 624.
The opening 20 in this embodiment is provided in both the opening panel region 620 and the
side panel 624 and the resealable flap 623 provided by the second sheet 616 is dimensioned
to extend over the opening 20 in both the opening panel region 620 and the side panel region
624. The second sheet 616 can be scored, cut, or otherwise perforated so as to provide the
resealable flap portion 623 that is adapted to resealable seal to the first sheet 614 in the
opening panel region 620 to resealable close the package.
[0089]            The second sheet 616 is attached to the first sheet 614 in the regions of the first
sheet that it contacts. In various embodiments, the second sheet can be attached to the
portion of the film defining the opening, and the portion of the first sheet can separate from
the first sheet and remain attached to the second sheet during first opening of the package.
Alternatively, the first sheet can have a portion removed defining the opening, and the second
sheet can be disposed over the opening (in which the first sheet portion has been removed).
The second sheet can be attached to the first sheet using any known adhesives. For example,
portions of the second sheet can be permanently attached to the first sheet, with only the
portion of the second sheet defining the resealable flap being resealable attached to the first
sheet. In other embodiments, the second sheet can be attached to the first sheet entirely with
resealable adhesive. Any known methods of attaching film sheets can be used.
[0090]           Referring to Figure 72, the opening panel region 620 can have first and second
boundaries 626a, 626b that are configured to define first and second edges of the opening
panel of the package. The second sheet 618 can overlap with one or both of the first and
second boundaries 626a, 626b and extend past the boundary and be secured to the first sheet
on opposed sides of the boundary along one or more walls of the package. For example, the
second sheet 614 can extend down substantially an entire length and width of opposed walls
                                                      47

                                                                      Attorney Docket No.: 31332/47193
624c, 624d of the package. In alternative embodiments, the second sheet 616 can be
provided so as to extend partially down one or more walls 624 of the container. The second
sheet can also be provided to extend along one or more lateral edges of the package, which
can enhance the strength and rigidity of the package. In an embodiment, the second sheet is
provided along each of the four boundaries defining the opening panel 620 as well as along
the four lateral edges of the package. When combined with lines of reduced strength of the
second sheet (described below) such an arrangement can allow the film to essentially self
assembly into a box in a pop-up box type arrangement. Lines of reduced strength can include
perforations and/or score lines.
[0091]           Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the one or more lines of
reduced strength in the second sheet 616 in various regions of the second sheet at the
boundaries of the panels and walls, corresponding to edges and corners of the package,
reduce the bending strength of the second sheet such that the second sheet will force the first
sheet into a folded orientation in which the edges and corners (corresponding to the location
perforation) preferentially form and are maintained in the folded orientation, with minimal
application of a folding force. That is, the edges of the opening panel and the lateral edges of
the package may preferential form from the flat sheet material based on the incorporation of
the perforated second sheet material along these regions. This can advantageously provide a
package having well-defined edges, as well as improved crush resistance when a load is
applied against one of the walls and particularly in the opening panel region.
[0092]           Referring to Figure 90, in various embodiments, the second sheet 616 can extend
over a top panel and into a tuck formed in the side wall of the package. Figure 91 illustrates a
package defined by the film layout illustrated in Figure 90. Figure 92 illustrates an
embodiment of the package in which the opening and the resealable flap are provided on the
front panel. In the embodiments of Figures 91 and 92, the second sheet is illustrated as
extending over the entirety of the top wall, front wall, and back walls. It should be
understood that the second sheet could be disposed over only portions of any of the
respective walls. For ease of reference, reference numbers in Figures 91 and 92 generally
refer to portions of the second sheet as described below. The packages include opposed side
                                                     48

walls 668 and each side wall includes a seal 667 (illustrated in Figure 93, for example)
disposed along the side wall.
[0093]            The tucks are formed by tucking portions of the first sheet inwardly toward the
interior volume of the container such that the tuck portions of the first sheet are disposed
beneath the seal. The second sheet can include a tuck portion 650 that extends into the tucks.
As shown in Figure 90, the tuck portion 650 can extend from an adjoining portion of the
second sheet that extends over an adjacent wall. In the embodiment shown in Figure 90, the
tuck portion extends from a top wall portion of the second sheet and the top wall portion
includes the resealable flap 623 defined therein. It is contemplated, however, that the
opening 620 and corresponding resealable flap can be disposed in a different wall of the
package, for example, the front or back wall, or can be disposed along multiple walls of the
package. The tuck portion 650 extends from the top wall portion 652, with the boundary
between the tuck portion and the top wall portion being the edge between a side wall of the
container and the top wall of the container. The second sheet includes one or more lines of
reduced strength at or adjacent to the boundaries between the tuck portion and the top wall
portion of the second sheet. Figure 90 illustrates a single line of reduced strength 653 at each
of the boundaries between the top wall portion 652 and the tuck portions 650.
[0094]           Figure 72 similarly illustrates an embodiment in which the container includes at
least one tuck and the second sheet includes at least one tucking portion 636 that is adjacent
to a boundary of the opening panel region and/or a boundary 638 of at least one wall region
624c. The tuck folding region is configured to be tucked inward to define an edge of wall or
panel of the package. The flexible film can include a portion of the second sheet (for
example, detached from other portions of the second sheet) 634 secured to the first sheet in
the tuck folding region 636. As described above, the tuck folding region portion of the
second sheet can include a line of reduced strength 639 in the region of the boundary 638 to
facilitate folding the flexible film into the tuck fold. The tuck folding region of the second
sheet can provide improved rigidity to the edge of the package at the tuck fold, which in turn
can provide improved rigidity to the panel or wall of the package adjacent to the tuck fold. In
some embodiments, the second sheet can be provided as a single continuous sheet extending
across the opening panel region and the tuck folding regions. For example, the flexible
                                                      49

material can be folded into the package such that tuck fold regions are provided at the
boundaries of the opening panel region. For example, the line of reduced strength 653
adjacent the tuck portion can include perforations and/or score lines. As used herein, score
lines refer to one or more continuous or non-continuous lines (linear or nonlinear) that
penetrate through a defined portion of the thickness, express herein as a percentage of
penetration through the thickness. In the tuck region, the perforations can include about 50%
to about 100% cut openings or score lines having about 50% to 100% penetration through the
thickness of the second sheet to facilitate folding of the tuck portion and provide a well
defined edge. As used herein, "percent cut opening" refers to the percentage of the
perforated line that is cuts. Perforations include cuts and bridges between adjacent cuts, a
percent cut opening of 50%, for example, refers to a perforation having cuts and bridges of
equal length, such that 50% of the length of the perforation is cuts and 50% of the length of
the perforation is bridges. An 80% cut opening, for example refers to perforations having
cuts that are longer in length than the bridges, such that 80% of the overall length the
perforation is cuts and 20% of the overall length of the perforation is bridges. Other suitable
percent cut openings of perforations or percent penetration of score lines for the lines of
reduced strength 653 adjacent the tucks include about 50% to about 99%, about 6 0% to about
95%, about 55% to about 8 0%, about 7 0% to about 99%, about 75% to about 9 0%. The
percent cut opening can be for example about 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 68, 70, 72, 74,
76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, and 100%. The percent of
perforation or reduction in thickness of the line of reduced having perforations and/or score
lines can depend on the thickness of the second sheet. For second sheets having a high
thickness, for example, above 10 mils, a high degree of reduction in strength at the line of
reduced strength may be needed to allow for preferential folding of the first and second
sheets into the tucks.
[0095]           As noted above, the line(s) of reduced strengths facilitates folding the first and
second sheets during the tucking operation and advantageously provides a well-defined edge
to the top wall at the tucked portion. Without inclusion of a line of reduced strength, forming
the tucks can be difficult if not impossible depending on the overall thickness of the first and
second sheets. Further, while with relatively thin materials, such folding can be
accomplished, there are often defects, such as dents, in the folded regions because the flexible
                                                     50

material resists folding. It has been advantageously determined that inclusion of the line of
reduced strength in the second sheet at the boundary between the tuck portion and the top
wall portion induces the first sheet to preferentially form an edge along the line of reduced
strength to form a well-defined edge. As described in detail below, it has been unexpectedly
found that selective placement of the lines of reduced strength at various boundaries of the
package, including the boundary adjacent the tuck portion, as described above, can allow the
first sheet to preferentially fold into the desired package configuration, including for forming
a contoured package without the need for changing the packaging forming equipment. This
is advantageous as it avoids the needs for costly modification package forming equipment,
such as seal bars, and down times associated with adjusting the package forming equipment
for each configuration of the flexible package.
[0096]           Referring to Figure 72, in any of the embodiments in which the second sheet 416
overlaps a boundary or edge of the container, the second sheet can 616 can further include a
line of reduced strength 430a, 430b or perforation in the portion of the second sheet 416 that
overlaps with the boundary or edge. The line of reduced strength 630a, 630b can be defined
by one or more paths or lines of reduced strength, for example, two paths of reduced strength
disposed on opposed sides of the boundary or edge. As described above, extension of the
second sheet to overlap with one or more boundaries and even extend past the boundary can
beneficially strengthen a corner or edge of the package when formed. The line of reduced
strength facilitates bending of the secured first and second sheets in the region of the edge
and can aid in the defining a sharp or curved edge of the package that has improved rigidity.
This can also aid in defining the shape of the packaging, and in some embodiments can aid
the film to preferentially form into the defined package assembly shape during processing.
[0097]           As illustrated in Figures 72 and 73, the extension of the second sheet to overlap
with the boundary of a region can be provided in any one of the regions of the film including
the opening panel region and one or more wall regions. Figures 72 and 73 illustrate an
embodiment in which the second sheet is secured to the first sheet in the opening panel region
and two adjacent wall regions. In this embodiment, the second sheet overlaps and extends
beyond the boundaries 626a, 626b, 628a, 628b, of the opening panel region and the wall
regions. In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 72 and 73, the second sheet further extends
                                                      51

                                                                      Attorney Docket No.: 31332/47193
around the edges of the container, partially extending into the side walls of the package. The
second sheet is configured so as not to extend into and interfere with the leading and trailing
seals.
[0098]            The second sheet can overlap substantially along the entire length of the boundaries
and/or edges. Alternatively, the sheet can overlap with only a portion of the
boundaries/edges in one or more of the regions. Additionally, the second sheet may overlap
with both the opposed boundaries 626a and 626b and 628a and 628b of the region. If
desired, however, the second sheet can overlap with only one boundary.
[0099]           Referring to Figure 90, as noted above the second sheet can also include lines of
reduced strength at or adjacent to other boundaries between portions of the second sheet,
corresponding to edges of the container. For example, Figure 90 illustrates an embodiment in
which the second sheet includes first and second face portions 654, 656 that extend across at
least a portion of front and back walls of the container. The first and second face portions
654, 656 extend from the top wall portion 652. The respective boundary between the first
and second face portions 654, 656 and the top wall portion 652 can also include one or more
lines of reduced strength 658 in the second sheet at or adjacent to the boundary. The lines of
reduced strength 658 can aid in providing well defined side edges at the top wall and
similarly other walls of the package. However, the lines of reduced strength 658 reduce the
rigidity of the second sheet in the region of the edge of the boundary, which can reduce the
overall rigidity of the package, when for example, the package is gripped by a user at the top
wall or about which the lines of reduced strength are provided. Reduction of the rigidity is a
concern with flexible packaging as the package can tend to collapse or dent during handling
or gripping by a user if not sufficiently rigid, which can render the package difficult to use. It
has been advantageously determined that lines of reduced strength 658 can be provided in the
second label at the side edges of the top wall or other side edge gripped by the user by
controlling the degree of reduction of strength in the line of reduced strength. For example,
in the gripping region, for example lines of reduced strength 658 illustrated in Figure 90, can
include perforations having about 1 to about 50% cut openings or score lines having about
1% to 50% penetration through the thickness of the second sheet to facilitate folding of the
tuck portion and provide a well-defined edge. Other suitable cut opening percentages and/or
                                                     52

penetration percentages include about 5% to about 50%, about 10% to about             4 5 %, about 15%
to about 40%, about 20% to about 30%, about 20% to about 50%, and about 10% to about
50%. The cut opening percentages and/or can be, for example, about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10,
12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, and 50%. The percent
cut openings and/or the penetrations percentages will vary depending on the thickness of the
second sheet. For example, if the second sheet is thick, for example, having a thickness
greater than 10 mils, then high percentages of cut opening or scoring can be used to facilitate
folding of the relatively thick sheet, which by virtue of its thickness will maintain sufficient
rigidity to resist denting or collapsing when the package is gripped. Thinner second sheets,
for example, second sheets having a thickness of less than about 10 mils may require low
percentages of cut opening or scoring to maintain sufficient strength of the package in the
gripping region.
[0100]           In accordance with embodiments of the disclosure, first lines of reduced strength
653 disposed at the boundary between tuck portions 650 and an adjacent wall portion (for
example, a top wall portion 650) can have a percent cut opening or percent penetration of the
score lines that is greater than the percent cut opening or percent penetration of the score lines
of a second line of reduced strength disposed in a gripping region, for example lines of
reduced strength 658 disposed between the top wall portion 650 and the front and back wall
portions 654, 656. By selectively perforating or scoring as described above, a package can be
provided in which the first sheet defining the walls of the package preferentially folds into the
package configuration, while maintaining sufficient strengths in various regions of the
package that may be gripped by a user during handling.
[0101]           Referring still to Figure 90, the second sheet can include sidewall portions 660 that
extend to respective side walls of the container and extend from the first and second face
portions 654, 656 of the second sheet. The side wall potions 660 can be dimensioned so as
not to extend into a region of the first sheet that is sealed to form the seals disposed in the
side walls. In some embodiments, one or more of the side wall portions 660 can extend up to
the seal, but not into the seal. In such embodiments, the seal can be folded over and sealed to
one of the side wall portions. One or more of the side wall portions can alternatively
terminate at an edge that is spaced away from the seal, such that the seal can be sealed to a
                                                       53

                                                                      Attorney Docket No.: 31332/47193
portion the first sheet defining the side wall. In yet other embodiments, one or both of the
seals can remain extending outward from the side wall. In such, embodiments, one or both of
the seals can include, for example, an aperture defined in a portion of the seal, such that the
seal can act as a handle, and a user can grip through the aperture.
[0102]            The second sheet can be configured such that the terminal points of the side wall
portions 662 and the tucking portion 664 lie along the same line. Such configuration of the
second sheet can facilitate application of the second sheet to the first sheet and ensuring
registration of the second sheet and the first sheet is maintained during the package folding
process.
[0103]            The second sheet can include one or more lines of reduced strength 666 disposed at
or adjacent to the boundary between the side wall portions and the adjacent face portions,
which corresponds to edges of the container between the front and/or back wall and one of
the side walls. The line of reduced strength can include perforations having any suitable
percent of cut openings and/or score lines having any suitable percent penetration. For
example, if one or more of the liens of reduced strength is provided in a gripping region of
the container, it may be advantages to have a lower percent of cut openings or percent
penetration as described above.
[0104]           In one embodiment, the line of reduced strength 666 at or adjacent to the boundary
between the side wall portions and the face portions includes perforations having a cut
percent opening and/or score lines having a penetration percentage that is equal to those of
the line of reduced strength 658 between the top wall portion and the face portions. In
another embodiment, the line of reduced strength 666 at or adjacent to the boundary between
the side wall portions and the face portions includes perforations having a cut percent
opening and/or score lines having a penetration percentage that is equal to those of the line of
reduced strength 653 at or adjacent the boundary of the tuck portion. In yet another
embodiment, the line of reduced strength 666 at or adjacent to the boundary between the side
wall portions and the face portions includes perforations having a cut percent opening and/or
score lines having a penetration percentage that is greater than those of the line of reduced
strength 658 between the top wall portion and the face portions, but less than those of the line
of reduced strength 653 at or adjacent the boundary of the tuck portion.

                                                                     Attorney Docket No.: 31332/47193
[0105]           As with the lines of reduced strength described above, the percent of cuts and/or
penetration can vary depending on the thickness of the material.
[0106]           It has been advantageously found that by selectively perforating or scoring the
second sheet in a controlled manner, a package can be provided in which the first sheet
defining the plurality of walls of the package can be induced by the second sheet and
controlled perforations to preferentially fold into the package configuration. Further
controlled perforation or scoring as described above in the various regions of the second sheet
can allow for such preferential folding while maintain rigidity and even improving rigidity of
the container for improved durability, stability, and usability.
[0107]           As discussed above it has unexpectedly been found that controlled application of
non-linear lines of reduced strength in select regions of the second sheet can contour the
shape of the package, without the need for specialized package forming equipment to impart
the contour shape.
[0108]           Figure 93 illustrates one embodiment of a contoured package. Figure 94 illustrates
the film layer of the first and second sheets corresponding to the contoured package of Figure
93. As illustrated in Figures 93 and 94, the line of reduced strength formed in the second
sheet between the boundary between the side wall portions and face portions are curved. The
curvature of the line of reduced strength 666 in these regions will induce the first sheet to
preferentially form package edges having a substantially similar curvature. The curvature of
the side walls 668 can also be controlled using the second sheet. For example, as illustrated
in Figure 93, the side walls 667 curve inward. Such curvature can be achieved, for example,
by forming the side wall portions 660 of the second sheet to have a terminal edge 670 that has
a curvature corresponding to the curvature of the line of reduced strength. 666. In the
embodiment of Figures 93 and 94, the second sheet is provided with two opposed side
portions 660, extending from adjacent ends of the first face portion 654 (disposed in the front
panel). Each side portion 660 terminates in a curved edge 670. The curvature of the curved
edge 670 can be similar or the same as, for example, the curvature of the lines of reduced
strength 666. The second face portion 656, which is disposed on the back wall includes
opposed terminal edges 672 that have a curvature that is the same as the curvature of the lines
of reduced strength 666 and correspond in location of the lines of reduced strength 666.
                                                     55

Alternatively, the second face portion 656 can include side portions extending therefrom, as
with the first face portion, and lines of reduced strength having a curvature can be provided in
the second sheet at the boundary between the second face portion and the side portions, as
with the first face portion. The embodiment of Figures 93 and 94 also do not include a tuck
portion. However, such portions can optionally be included in this or any of the described
embodiments.
[0109]           Figure 94 also illustrates an embodiment in which the bottom panel 674 includes an
optional reinforcing sheet 676. The reinforcing sheet 676 can be similar to the second sheet
and can be optionally attached or detached (as shown in the figure) from the second sheet.
The reinforcing sheet can be disposed on either the exterior of the first sheet or the interior of
the first sheet. The reinforcing sheet can be optionally dimensions to reside only in the
bottom wall region. Additionally, a third sheet can be provided on the interior or exterior of
the first sheet, as described above, to further provide reinforcing. The third sheet, when
provided in a region corresponding to the second sheet can be similarly perforated or scored
for preferential folding of the first sheet.
[0110]           Figures 95 and 96 (package and film layout, respectively) illustrate another
embodiment of a contoured package. In the embodiment of Figures 95 and 96, lines of
reduced strength 666, 678 are provided as mirror images about the boundary between the side
wall portions and the face portions, with one line of reduced strength extending into the face
portion and one line of reduced strength extending into the side wall portion. As illustrated in
Figure 95, the mirror image lines of reduced strength provide a contour package having side
walls shapes that are distinct from that illustrated in Figure 93, thus illustrating the ability of
the controlled and selective perforation of scoring of the section sheet in controlling the
contour of the package. In the embodiment of Figure 95, the side walls include two angled
portions and a flat portion raised above the angled portions, the flap portion having the seal.
[0111]            Figures 97 and 98 illustrate other configurations of film layouts for achieving
preferential folding of a first sheet into a contoured package configuration.
[0112]            Other configurations and contours are contemplated and can be achieved by
modification of the curvature of the line of reduced strength at the boundary between the side
wall portions and the face portions, the shape of the terminal edge of the side wall portion,
                                                       56

and/or secondary lines of reduced strength including in the side wall portion. Additionally,
one or more of the regions described as having lines of reduced strength could also
alternatively be mechanically creased prior to folding the first sheet into the package
configuration.
[0113]            The features described above, including the percent cuts or penetration of the
various lines of reduced strength that can be included in the second sheet are applicable to the
contoured packages, as well.
[0114]           Any of the above package configurations can include a pull tab 617. The pull tab
can extend up to or past an adjacent edge of the container for easy gripping. In some
embodiments, it may be advantageous to space the pull tab a distance away from an edge of
the container, for example at least about 0.03 inches to about 0.1 inches, about 0.05 inches to
about 0.8 inches, about 0.4 to about 0.6, and about 0.02 to about 0.9 inches from the edge of
the container. Other spacings include, for example, about 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08,
0.09, and 0.1 inches. Such spacing can be advantageous if the pull tab extends adjacent to a
line of reduced strength in the second sheet. Such spacing can assist in maintaining strength
at the edge having the line of reduced strength. Extension of the pull tab up to or past the line
of reduced strength, however, is also contemplated.
[0115]           In any of the foregoing embodiments, the second sheet can include apertures or be
otherwise dimensioned such that the second sheet does not extend over one or more corners
of the package. For example, Figure 90 illustrate a film layout in which comer reliefs 678 are
provided at each of the four corners of the top panel. Corner reliefs 678 can be provided at
any number of the corners of the package. The comer relief 678 are arranged such that the
second sheet 616 is disposed around and not over the one or more comers. While comers can
be formed with the second sheet 616 being disposed in the comer regions, such comers may
be sharp and displeasing to the user when gripping the container.
[0116]           In one embodiment, the opening is disposed on the front or back wall and arranged
such that the pull tab extending from the resealable flap extends toward a bottom panel of the
package. The bottom panel can optionally include a corner seal 677, for example, as
illustrated Figure 95. In such embodiments, extension of the pull tab toward the comer seal
                                                     57

676 can allow a user to grip the corner seal 676 and the pull tab 617 when opening the
package to provide better gripping of the package when opening the package.
Flexible Materials For Forming Flexible Containers
[0117]           A flexible material 400 for forming a flexible package 400 includes an opening
panel region 420 that is configured to define a panel of the package having an opening for
accessing the internal volume of the package (also referred to herein as an opening panel).
For ease of reference, the Figures 30a-c, and 50-51 illustrate formed features 422 in the
opening panel region 420 that correspond to the closure assembly. It should be understood
that the formed feature need not be included in the flexible material 400 and can be formed
during forming of the package, as described herein. The flexible material 400 can further
include one or more wall regions 424 that are configured to define one or more walls of the
flexible package, including, for example one or more side wall and/or a bottom wall.
[0118]            The flexible material can be provided as a web of material capable of forming a
plurality of packages, which can be rolled into a flexible material roll. The flexible material
can include a plurality of opening panel regions and optionally a plurality of wall regions
discretely spaced along a longitudinal direction of the flexible material, wherein the plurality
of opening panel regions and the plurality of wall regions comprise the first sheet. That is,
the first sheet can be a common sheet material extending between each of the plurality of
regions configured to be folded or formed into the plurality of packages. The flexible
material can further include a plurality of second sheets and/or third sheets in the opening
panel regions and wall regions as described below.
[0119]            The flexible material includes a first sheet 414, which as disclosed above is
configured to be formed into the opening panel and provide an opening and/or can be
configured to be formed into more walls of the first sheet 414. The opening panel region 420
and one or more wall regions 424 comprise the first sheet 414. The flexible material 400 can
further include a second sheet 416 that is secured to the first sheet 414 in the opening panel
region 420. In various embodiments, the second sheet or at least a portion thereof is
thermoformable.
[0120]           As used herein the term "secured" refers joining of one layer or sheet to another
layer or sheet and can include intermediate layers or adhesives. Layers or sheets can be
                                                       58

joined using any known methods including adhesive, heat sealing, ultrasonic sealing,
welding, crimping, and combinations thereof. It should be understood herein that unless
otherwise specified, sheets or layers can be secured in whole or in part to another sheet or
layer. Layers or sheets can be permanently secured or releasable secured. As used herein,
the term "permanently secured" refers to a connection between two adjacent layers or sheets
that requires at least partial destruction of the one or both of the layers or sheets to separate
the layers or sheets at the connection. As used herein, the term "releasable secured" refers to
a connection between two adjacent layers or sheets such that the layers or sheets can be
separated substantially without destruction. In some embodiments, two sheets can be
resealably secured, meaning that the sheets layers can be separated and then re-secured
without application of a further adhesive or seal.
 [0121]           The flexible material can further include a third sheet 418 secured to the first sheet
414 at least in the opening panel region 420. In one embodiment, the third sheet 418 is
secured to the first sheet 414 and the second sheet 416 is secured to the third sheet 418. In
another embodiment, the first sheet 414 is disposed between the second and third sheets 416,
418. As described in detail below, the third sheet 418 can additionally or alternatively be
secured to the first sheet 414 in the one or more wall regions 424 of the flexible sheet 400.
The third sheet 418 can partially or completely overlap with first sheet in the opening panel
region 420 and/or the one or more wall regions. For example, Figure 50 illustrates an
embodiment wherein the third sheet 418 completely overlaps with the first sheet in the
opening panel region 420 and two adjacent wall regions 424a, 424b. Figure 51 illustrates an
embodiment wherein the third sheet 418 only partially overlaps with the first sheet 414 in two
adjacent wall regions 424a, 424b.
 [0122]          Referring to Figure 30b, which illustrates an opening panel region of the flexible
material, the flexible material can include a line or path of reduced strength 440 in the first
sheet 414 of the opening panel region 420 that is configured to define the opening of the
package. In embodiments in which the flexible material 400 further includes a third sheet
418, a line or path of reduced strength can be provided in the third sheet to define the opening
through the first and third sheets 414, 418. As used herein, the terms "line of reduced
strength" and "path of reduced strength" are used interchangeable and can be straight, curved,
                                                       59

or have any suitable shape. A line or path of reduced strength can be formed in a flexible
material or sheet using any known method including, for example, laser scoring, mechanical
scoring or a similar process for forming perforations. Perforations can either puncture the
sheet or be provided without puncturing the sheet if desired.
[0123]            The flexible material can further include a line or path of reduced strength 442 or a
continuous cut defining in the second sheet 416 in the opening panel region 420 that is
configured to define a hinge 442 about which a lid 26 of a closure assembly 22 of the
package can pivot. Additional cuts or lines or paths of reduced strength 444a, 444b can be
provided in the second sheet 416, if desired, to define first and second projections 219a, 219b
of the closure assembly as described in detail below. The cuts or paths or lines of reduced
strength for the hinge (442) and the projections 219a, 219b can be provided in the second
sheet such that they do not overlap with each other or with a line or path of reduced strength
440 defining the opening of the package. This can help to ensure that the package remains
hermetically sealed prior to first use.
[0124]           In various embodiments, as illustrated in Figures 50 and 51, the third sheet 418 can
be a single sheet that extends across one or more regions of the flexible material, for example,
the opening panel region 420 and one or more wall regions 424. In other embodiments, the
third sheet 418 can be provided as separated sheets overlapping with the first sheet 414 in one
or more regions of the flexible material. The third sheet can be between boundaries 426a,
426b, 428a, 428b, of a region as illustrated in Figures 50, 51. Alternatively, the third sheet
418 can extend only partially in a face of a region and/or can be provided as separated sheets
that overlap with the boundaries but are not contiguous. Figure 50 illustrates a third sheet
portion 434 that extends only partially in the face of the region. As described in detail below,
the third sheet portion 434 can in some embodiments be selectively placed at a boundary in a
tuck folding region of the flexible material. In such embodiments, the third sheet portion 434
is also referred to herein as a fourth sheet 434. It should be understood herein that in such
embodiments the fourth sheet can be same or a different material as the third sheet.
[0125]           Referring to Figures 50 and 51, in some embodiments, the flexible material can
include first 414, second 416, and third 418 sheets in the opening panel region 420. The
opening panel region 420 can have first and second boundaries 426a, 426b that are
                                                       60

                                                                   Attorney Docket No.: 31332/47193
configured to define first and second edges of the opening panel of the package. The third
sheet 418 can overlap with one or both of the first and second boundaries 426a, 426b and
optionally extend past the boundary and be secured to the first sheet 414 on opposed sides of
the boundary. The third sheet 418 can further include a line of reduced strength 430a, 430b
in the portion of the third sheet 418 that overlaps with the boundary 426a, 426b. As shown in
Figure 50, the line of reduced strength 430a, 430b can be defined by one or more paths or
lines of reduced strength, for example, two paths of reduced strength disposed on opposed
sides of the boundary. Extension of the third sheet 418 to overlap with one or more
boundaries and even extend past the boundary can beneficially strengthen a corner or edge of
the package when formed. The line of reduced strength facilitates bending of the secured
first and second sheets 414, 416 in the region of the corner or the edge and can aid in the
defining a sharp or curved edge of the package that has improved rigidity. As described in
detail below, this can also aid in defining the shape of the packaging, and in some
embodiments can aid the film to preferentially form into the defined package assembly shape
during processing. As illustrated in Figure 50, the extension of the third sheet 418 to overlap
with the boundary of a region can be provided in any one of the regions of the film including
the opening panel region and one or more wall regions. Figure 50 illustrates an embodiment
in which the third sheet 418 is secured to the first sheet 414 in the opening panel region 420
and two adjacent wall regions 424a, 424b. In this embodiment, the third sheet overlaps and
extends beyond the boundaries 426a, 426b, 428a, 428b, of the opening panel region and the
wall regions. In the embodiment of Figure 50, the third sheet 418 overlaps substantially
along the entire length of the boundaries. As illustrated in Figure 51, the third sheet 418 can
overlap with only a portion of the boundaries in one or more of the regions. Additionally, the
third sheet may overlap with both the opposed boundaries 426a and 426b and 428a and 428b
of the region. If desired, however, the third sheet can overlap with only one boundary.
[0126]           In some embodiments, for example, for flexible materials for quad-seal packages as
described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0312868, the flexible film can
include at least one tucking region 436 that is adjacent to a boundary of the opening panel
region and/or a boundary 438 of at least one wall region 424c (as illustrated in Figure 50).
The tuck folding region is configured to be tucked inward to define an edge of wall or panel
of the package. The flexible film can include a fourth sheet 434 secured to the first sheet in
                                                  61

the tuck folding region 436. As described above with the third sheet, the fourth sheet can
include a line of reduced strength 439 in the region of the boundary 438 to facilitate folding
the flexible film into the tuck fold. The fourth sheet 434 can provide improved rigidity to the
edge of the package at the tuck fold, which in turn can provide improved rigidity to the panel
or wall of the package adjacent to the tuck fold. In some embodiments, as noted above, the
third sheet 418 can function as the fourth sheet 434 and be disposed in the tuck folding
region. For example, the flexible material can be folded into the package such that tuck fold
regions are provided at the boundaries of the opening panel region. Extension of the third
sheet 418 past the boundary as illustrated in Figure 50 can result in the third sheet 418
extending into and supporting the tuck fold, as described with respect to the fourth sheet 434.
[0127]          The film can include any suitable printing and/or graphics. For example, all or
portions of the film can be colored. Referring to Figure 31, in one embodiment, the film can
be colored such that a portion of the film remains transparent or translucent to provide a
window for viewing the product contained therein. The graphical layout for the patterning
and/or coloring on the film can be adapted based on the package configuration and graphics
to be displayed on the package. In embodiments in which a closure assembly is formed into
the lid, the graphical layout illustrated in Figure 47 can be used when the lid-forming process
is performed on the side of the forming tube. In other embodiments in which a closure
assembly is formed into the lid, the graphical layout illustrated in Figure 48 can be used when
the lid-forming process is performed on the front of the forming tube. The lid forming
process can be performed on any one side of the forming tube. For example, in an
embodiment multi sides of the forming tube can be used in the lid forming process to provide
alternative formation of the lids on the forming die to increase the per package rate of the
forming process.
The First Sheet
[0128]           The first sheet 414 may have any suitable thickness, and the thickness may be a
uniform thickness or may vary. In various embodiments, the first sheet 414 has a nominal
thickness of about 1 mils to about 10 mils, about 3 mils to about 9 mils, about 4 mils to about
8 mils, about 5 mils to about 7 mils, about 2 mils to about 6 mils. Other suitable nominal
thicknesses include, for example, about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 6,

7, 8, 9, and 10 mils. As used herein, the term "nominal thickness" refers to the thickness of a
film or sheet material, not including ink or adhesive layers.
[0129]           Exemplary materials suitable for use as the first sheet 414 include, but are not
limited to, a laminate of 150 ga cast polypropylene, 120 ga polylactic acid, and 2.875 mil
coex including ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) (12321.302W), a laminate of 150 ga cast
polypropylene, 76 ga formable polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and 3.5 mil high clarity
polyethylene, a laminate of 140 ga biaxially oriented polypropylene, 92 ga PET, and 3.5 mil
high clarity polyethylene. The laminate layers can be adhered together using any suitable
adhesives. The thicknesses referred to in this paragraph are nominal thicknesses of the
laminate layers. As desired inks to color or apply graphics to the film can be applied between
the laminate layers or can be applied to an exposed surface of the film.
[0130]            The material can be selected based on the product to be incorporated therein. For
example, for salty snack foods, the material of the package film generally provides one or
more of a moisture barrier to keep the food crisp, an oxygen barrier to reduce rancidity of the
oils that are often used as ingredients or cooking aids for the product, and a light barrier to
reduce the presence of light in the package, which for some products can cause or increase
rancidity of the product. Figure 69 illustrates a number of exemplary embodiments of two
ply and three-ply films suitable for use with various embodiments of the disclosure.
[0131]            The first sheet can be polypropylene, which can provide good moisture barrier
properties. The polypropylene can be metalized to improve the moisture barrier properties as
well as provide oxygen barrier properties and reduce light transmission. Other exemplary
materials include, for example, polyesters, such as PET, and nylons, such as polyamides.
[0132]           As described above the first sheet can be a composite or laminate structure. For
example, in some embodiments, the material of the first sheet can include a polyethylene as a
tie or adhesion layer between two layers of polypropylene. Such layering can improve the
ability of the film to resist tearing or tear propagation. Sealants can also be used in the film.
Sealants can be provided as coextrusions (i.e., as distinct layers within a film), blends
(mixtures of polymers in a single layer), and combinations thereof. Suitable sealants include
linear low density polyethylene, ultra low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene,
metallocene, plastomer, hexene, butene polyethylenes and combinations thereof. Other
                                                      63

sealants include EVA copolymers, SURLYN* (Ionomers), and ethylene methacrylic acid
(EMA), and ethylene acrylic acid (EAA).
[0133]           Additional coatings or structure can be added to base material or laminate of the
first sheet to enhance desired properties. For example, PVDC (SARAN*) can be coated on
first sheet material to enhance the oxygen barrier properties. Acrylic coating can be applied
to the first sheet material to provide the desired surface energies and characteristics for
enhancing the efficiency of processing the film on a packaging machine.
The Second Sheet
[0134]            The second sheet may be formed from materials such as polypropylene (PP), ethyl
vinyl alcohol, polylactic acid (PLA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE),
EVA co-polymers, foil (such as aluminum foil), paper, polyester (PET), nylon or poly amide
(PA), and laminates and composites thereof.
[0135]           In various embodiments, the second sheet can be a resealable label. For example,
the resealable label can be as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,113,271, 6,918,532, 7,344,744,
7,681,732, and 8,182,891, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. For
example, the resealable label 20 can be formed by delaminating a web of pressure sensitive
film, for example, bi-axially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film, having a resealable
pressure sensitive adhesive, from a release liner. Other suitable materials for the resealable
label include, for example, EarthFirst* polylactic acid (PLA), BOPP (for example clear or
white), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Any other known resealable
label materials can also be used. The resealable label can also include any known pressure
sensitive adhesive, including but not limited to, emulsion acrylic and solvent acrylic.
Suitable labels are commercially available as well, such as the Avery Dennison R5195 and
R5423 labels, and Flexcon V-312, V-314, and V-233 labels.
[0136]            The second sheet can have any suitable thickness. For example, the second sheet
can have a nominal thickness in a range of about 1 mils to about 30 mils, about 1 mil to about
15 mil, about 2 mil to about 10 mils, about 3 mils to about 7 mils, about 4 mils to about 10
mils, about 7 mils to about 12 mils, about 10 mils to about 30 mils, about 1 mil to about 10
mil, about 11 mils to about 25 mils, or about 1 mil to about 8 mils. Other suitable nominal
thicknesses include, for example, about 1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30 mils. In one embodiment, the second
sheet is formed of 10 mil (nominally thick) PET. In some embodiments, the second sheet can
be adhered to the first sheet such that at least a portion of the second sheet is adhesively
resealable to the first sheet. For example, a portion of the second sheet can be attached to the
second sheet using a resealable adhesive. In an embodiment, a portion of the second sheet is
permanently adhered to the first sheet such that the second sheet cannot be completely
removed from the first sheet. As used herein the term "permanently adhered" refers to bond
between the sheets cannot be broken without at least partial destruction of at least one of the
sheets.
[0137]           In other embodiments, the second sheet is not resealably adhered to the first sheet,
but with at least a portion of the second sheet being removable from the first sheet. For
example, the second sheet can be adhered to the first sheet such that the second sheet has a
peel strength in a range of 500 to 1200 grams/inch when peeled from cast polypropylene film.
The cast polypropylene film can have, for example, a surface energy in a range of about 30
dynes/cm to about 50 dynes/cm, about 32 dynes/cm to about 44 dynes/cm, about 32 dynes/cm
to about 36 dynes/cm, about 45 dynes/cm to about 50 dynes/cm, about 30 dynes/cm to about
45 dynes/cm, and about 40 dynes/cm to about 50 dynes/cm. Other suitable surface energies
include about 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or
50 dynes/cm.                 The second sheet is selected and adhered to the first sheet such that there is
no residual stickiness once the package is opened and at least a portion of the second sheet is
pulled away from the first sheet. In some embodiments, portions of the adhesive used to
adhere the second sheet to the first sheet can be deadened, for example by using a varnish or
lacquer, in regions in which it is undesirable to include an adhesive. For example, regions of
the adhesive can be deadened to facilitate opening of the package and reduce the strength
required to open a package. In some embodiments, the second sheet is adhered to the first
sheet using an adhesive and upon peeling of the second sheet from the first sheet, there is no
adhesive transfer to the first sheet. In some embodiments, for example, embodiments in
which a moist or wet product is to be stored in the package, a moisture-resistant adhesive can
be used to adhere the first and second sheets. For example, the moisture-resistant adhesive
can be a non-whitening adhesive. As used herein the term "non-whitening adhesive" refers
to adhesives that are not aesthetically changed when contacted with water or moisture. As
                                                           65

described in detail below, the package can further include a third sheet attached to the first
sheet in the region of the opening. The third sheet can add stability to the region about the
opening by increasing the gauge of the package in that region. In one embodiment, the third
sheet is applied to the first sheet on a surface opposite to the surface to which the second
sheet is applied. In another embodiment, the third sheet is applied to a surface of the first
sheet and the second sheet is applied to a surface of the third sheet.
The Third Sheet
[0138]            The third sheet may be formed from materials such as polypropylene (PP), ethylene
vinyl alcohol, polylactic acid (PLA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE),
EVA co-polymers, foil (such as aluminum foil), paper, polyester (PET), nylon (poly amide),
and laminates and composites thereof.
[0139]            The third sheet can have any suitable thickness. For example, the third sheet can
have a thickness in a range of about 1 mil to about 15 mils, about 2 mils to about 10 mils,
about 3 mils to about 7 mils, about 4 mils to about 10 mils, or about 7 mils to about 12 mils.
Other suitable thicknesses include, for example, about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, and 15 mils. In one embodiment, the third sheet is formed of 10 mil PET. In another
embodiment, the third sheet is formed of a laminate of PLA and EVOH and has a thickness
of 7 mil.
[0140]            The third sheet can be attached to the first sheet using any known permanent
adhesion methods, such as for example, heat sealing and application of permanent adhesives.
[0141]            Depending on the end use of the product, the film, including the first, second and
optional third sheets and any adhesives or inks used therein can be formed with FDA
compliant materials.
Zoned Attachment
[0142]            In various embodiments, the second sheet can be adhered to the first sheet (or in
some embodiments a third sheet disposed on the portion of the first that defines the exterior
portion of the package) using zoned adhesion. For example, the overprint varnish (deadening
agent) can be printed upon a heat salable layer, for example, a cast polypropylene, at 0% to
100% screening levels, for example, in 10% increments. For example, either 10% or 20% or
30% etc of the surface up until we screen off (or cover) 100% of the surface with the

[0143]            60% coverage of a deadening agent can provide a significant decrease in the bond
strength. Varying the percentage and zoning of the percent coverage of a deadening agent
can allow for variations in peel strengths from greater than 100 gms to as low as 80 gms.
[0144]            The adhesion between the first and second sheet can be defined by a suitable
number of zones, with each zone having a different level of adhesion. For example, in one
embodiment, the second sheet can be adhered to the first sheet using two adhesion zones. A
first zone can be defined by the region that is disposed interior the edge of the opening - that
is the region in which the portion of the first sheet separates and is designed to remain
adhered to the second sheet upon opening of the package. The second zone can be defined by
the region disposed outside of the edge of the opening and to which the second sheet reseals
to the first sheet and/or where the closure assembly provides a mechanical closure between
                                                     67

                                                                      Attorney Docket No.: 31332/47193
formed structures in the first and second sheets to reclose the package.         In various
embodiments, the first zone can have a greater adhesion than the second zone to facilitate
opening of the package. In some embodiments, such as embodiments having a mechanical
closure, the second zone can be a region of substantially no chemical adhesion between the
first and second sheet, relying instead on the mechanical closure. For example, the second
zone can be coated with a deadening agent or varnish to reduce or eliminate any adhesive
properties of an adhesive which is applied to adhere the second sheet to the first sheet in the
first zone. This can eliminate the need to selectively apply adhesive and can facilitate the
manufacturing process. Zoned adhesion can be done with heal sealing techniques, selective
application of deadening agents, and/or the selective application of adhesives. An exemplary
deadening agent is Sun Chemical Opt- T -Flex overprint varnish.
[0145]            In the embodiments illustrated in Figure 30, the adhesion can be provided in three
adhesive zones. For example, the first and second sheets are adhered in a zone that defines a
portion of the second sheet that is configured to remain adhered to a portion of the first sheet
upon opening of the package. A zone can be defined in an overlapping portion provided in a
region of the opening, inside the edge of the opening, in which the second sheet is adhered to
a portion of the first sheet surrounding the aperture to provide a hermetic seal despite
perforations that are provided in the first sheet to define the aperture. The overlapping
portion is dimensioned such that a sufficient seal is provided between the first and second
sheets to retain a hermetic seal despite perforations in the first sheet used to define the
aperture and the second sheet is capable of detaching from the first sheet in the overlapping
portion upon opening of the package for the first time when a portion of the first sheet is
detached at the perforations or other edge feature defining the opening. This zone can have an
adhesion property such that it is less than the adhesion between the first and second sheet in
the first zone, to facilitate opening of the package while maintaining a hermetic seal. Another
zone can be defined in a region disposed outside of the edge of the opening. For example, this
zone can be defined where the thermoformed features are formed into the first and second
sheet to define a closure assembly. This zone can have substantially no adhesion between the
first and second sheet to further facilitate opening of the package.

[0146]            The second sheet can be adhered to the first sheet using an adhesive. A process of
zoning the adhesive can include applying a deadening agent to the first sheet in region in
which adhesion between the first and second sheet is not desired. An adhesive can then be
applied to the entire second sheet and adhered to the first sheet. The deadening agent will
eliminate the adhesive properties of the adhesive in the regions in which it is applied, thereby
zoning the adherence without need to apply the adhesive in a zoned manner. This can
simplify the adhesive application process.
[0147]            The selective application of the deadening agent or varnish can be accomplished,
for example, during the printing process for printing graphics onto the package. This can
advantageously provide a rapid process for defining a deadened or reduced adhesive zone
with high throughput printing machines.
[0148]           In some embodiments, the selective application of an adhesive or different types of
adhesive can be accomplished using a printing machine, such as for printing graphics on a
film package.
[0149]             In various embodiments, the flexible material can include the first second sheet
secured to the first sheet in zones of the opening panel region. As described above, the third
sheet can be interposed between the first and second sheets in some embodiments. It is
contemplated that the zones and relative peel strengths described below with respect to
securing the first sheet to the second sheet in the opening panel region apply to the peel
strengths associated with instead securing the second sheet to the third sheet. The peel
strength between the first and second sheets 414, 416 in the opening panel region 420 can be
defined by a suitable number of zones. Some of the zones can have different peel strengths.
As used herein, the term "peel strength" refers to the strength of the adherence of bond
between two sheets or layers. In embodiments in which a sheet or layer is permanently
secured to another sheet or layer, the peel strength between the layers or sheets is infinite, that
is greater than the structural strength of the laminate, as separation of the sheets or layers
results in destruction of one or both of the sheets or layers. In embodiments in which two
sheets or layers are disposed on each other, but not secured together, there is no peel strength,
which is described herein as a peel strength of 0 gms/in.

[0150]           Referring to Figure 30a, for example, in one embodiment, the opening panel can
include first and second zones 446, 448. The first zone is adjacent to the second zone and in
some embodiments directly adjacent to each other with no intervening zone (as illustrated in
Figure 30a). A first portion of the first sheet is secured to a first portion of the second sheet
in the first zone, and a second portion of the first sheet is secured to a second portion of the
second sheet in the second zone. The peel strength between the first and second sheets in the
first zone is greater than the peel strength between the first and second sheets in the second
zone. For example, the peel strength in the second zone can be about 10% to about 60% of
the peel strength of the first zone. A portion of the second zone can be configured to
thermoformed to include the closure assembly features or other formed features as described
herein. Figures 30a-30c illustrate formed features in a portion of the second sheet to illustrate
regions of the second sheet that can be configured to be thermoformed. It should be
understood that such formed features need not be included in the flexible material prior to
package forming and can be formed while configuring/forming the flexible material into the
package as described herein.
[0151]            The first zone 446 can include at least the portion of the opening panel region
configured to define the opening of the package. Referring to Figures 30a-c, the opening
panel region 420 includes an opening boundary, which can optionally be defined by the line
of reduced strength 440. The opening boundary is an outer boundary of the opening of the
package. In various embodiments, the first zone 446 corresponds to a portion of the opening
panel region in which the first sheet 414 is configured to remain attached to the second sheet
416. For example, when opening a package formed of the flexible material 400, a portion of
the first sheet can detach from a remaining portion of the first sheet 414 at the opening
boundary and remain secured to the second sheet 418 upon opening of the package.
Additionally, as illustrated in Figure 30a, in some embodiments, the first zone 446 can also
include a lid rear region of the opening panel that is configured such that a lid of the closure
assembly of a package remains secured in the lid rear region.
[0152]           As illustrated in Figure 30a, the first zone 446 can include portions of the opening
panel region disposed on opposed sides of the opening boundary. Referring to Figure 30b,
the first zone 446 can be disposed only inward of the opening boundary. The first zone can

have a peel strength of at least 500 gms/in. For example, the peel strength in the first zone
can be about 500 gms/in to about 2000 gms/in, about 600 gms/in to about 1500 gms/in, about
1000 gms/in to about 2000 gms/in. Other suitable peel strengths include about 500, 600, 700,
800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, and 2000 gms/in. In
some embodiments, the first sheet is permanently secured to the second sheet in the first
zone.
[0153]           Referring to Figures 30a-c, the second zone 448 can be directly adjacent to the first
zone. The second zone 448 generally includes a portion of the opening panel region
configured to be thermoformed. For example, the second zone can include a thermoformed
portion of the opening panel region configured to have the second engagement feature or
channel thermoformed therein. The second zone can have a peel strength of about 0 gms/in
to about 200 gms/in, about 5 gms/in to about 175 gms/in, about 10 gms/in to about 150
gms/in, about 25 gms/in to about 125 gms/in, about 50 gms/in to about 100 gms/in about 75
gms/in to about 150 gms/in, or about 0 gms/in to about 2 gms/in. Other suitable peel
strengths include, for example, 0, about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90,
100, 125, 150, 175, or 200 gms/in.
[0154]             Referring to Figure 30a, for example, the first zone 446 can extend up to a portion
of the second sheet 416 that is configured to be thermoformed (referred to herein as the
"thermoformed portion"). As illustrated in Figure 30a, for example, the first zone 446
extends up to the thermoformed portion of the opening panel region (illustrated in Figure 30a
by inclusion of the formed channel). The second zone 418 contains the thermoformed
portion and a portion of the opening panel region having the first sheet secured to the second
sheet outward of the thermoformed portion.
[0155]           Referring again to Figure 30b, in some embodiments the second zone 448 can be
disposed inward the thermoformed portion up to the opening boundary.
[0156]           Referring to Figure 30c, in some embodiments, the opening panel region can
include a third zone 452 disposed between the first and second zones 446, 448. For example,
as illustrated in Figure 30c, the first zone 446 can be bounded in part by the opening
boundary, the third zone 452 can be disposed between the opening boundary and the second
zone 448. The third zone 452 can have a peel strength that is less than the peel strength in the

first zone 446. Optionally the third zone 452 can have a peel strength that is substantially
equal to the peel strength in the second zone.
[0157]            The third zone can have a peel strength of about 0 gms/in to about 200 gms/in,
about 5 gms/in to about 175 gms/in, about 10 gms/in to about 150 gms/in, about 25 gms/in to
about 125 gms/in, about 50 gms/in to about 100 gms/in about 75 gms/in to about 150 gms/in,
or about 0 gms/in to about 2 gms/in. Other suitable peel strengths include, for example, 0,
about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 175, or 200 gms/in.
[0158]            In various embodiments, the second zone 448 can be disposed only in the
thermoformed portion (i.e., the region in which the second engagement feature is to be
formed. A fourth zone can optionally be provided outward of the second zone 448
thermoformed region. The fourth zone 454 can have a peel strength that is less than or
greater than the peel strength of the second zone 458, but is less than the peel strength of the
first zone 446.
[0159]            Figures 30a-c further illustrates an embodiment in which the opening panel region
includes a pull tab region. The pull tab region can define a pull tab zone 450. The pull tab
zone can have a peel strength of 0 gms/in to about 30 gms/in, about 0 gms/in to about 5
gms/in, about 1 gms/into about 10 gms/in, about 3 gms/in to about 7 gms/in, about 10
gms/into about 30 gms/in, about 15 gms/in to about 20 gms/in, and about 5 gms/in to about
25 gms/in. Other suitable values include, for example, about 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30 gms/in. In some
embodiments, the second zone can include the pull tab zone, in other embodiments, the
second zone can have a peel strength different that the pull tab zone 450.
[0160]            In various embodiments in which the flexible material is configured to form a
package having first and second projections 219a, 219b in the closure assembly 22, the
portion of the opening panel region in which the first and second projections (illustrated in
Figures 30a-30c as defined by lines of reduced strength 444a, 444b) are defined, can define a
projections zone. The peel strength of the projection zone 443a, 443b can about 0 gms/in to
about 30 gms/in. Have reduced peel strength in the projection zone 443a, 443b can aid in
allowing the projections 219a, 219b to freely move along the first sheet when pivoting
between first and second positions as described below.

[0161]           In some embodiments, such as embodiments having a mechanical closure, the
second zone 448 can be a region of substantially no chemical adhesion between the first and
second sheet 414, 416, relying instead on the mechanical closure. For example, the second
zone 448 can be coated with a deadening agent or varnish to reduce or eliminate any adhesive
properties of an adhesive which is applied to secure the second sheet 416 to the first sheet
414 in the first zone 446. This can eliminate the need to selectively apply adhesive and can
facilitate the manufacturing process. Zoned adhesion can be done with heal sealing
techniques, selective application of deadening agents, and/or the selective application of
adhesives.
[0162]           A process of zoning the adhesive in the opening panel region can include applying
adhesive to one or both of the first and second sheets. The process can then include applying
a deadening agent to the first or second sheet in the opening panel region in a zone in which
reduced peel strength is desired. For example, a deadening agent can be applied in the
second zone and optional third zone at a coverage percentage of about 50% to about 100% to
achieve the desired peel strength in the second zone. By way of further example, the
deadening agent can be applied at a coating percentage of 100% in the pull tab zone to
achieve no peel strength between the pull tab on the second sheet and the first sheet in the
pull tab zone. The deadening agent reduces the peel strength where applied with the amount
of reduction corresponding to the coating percentage of the deadening agent. Use of a
deadening agent to achieve the desired peel strengths in the various zones can simplify the
flexible material making process by avoiding the need to zone adhesive. Deadening agents
can be printed, for example, in similar fashion to printing inks and graphics on a sheet
material, allowing for precise control over the location and coating percentage of the
deadening agent. In alternative embodiments, an adhesive or sealing process can be
applied/pre-formed in a zoned fashion. For example, heat seals can be formed in the first
zone to achieve the desire peel strength, while adhesives can be used in the second and
optional third or fourth zones to achieve the desired reduced peel strengths. In some
embodiments, different adhesive chemistries resulting in different adhesion strengths can be
selectively applied to the regions to achieve the desired peel strengths.

[0163]            The selective application of the deadening agent or varnish can be accomplished,
for example, during the printing process for printing graphics onto the package. This can
advantageously provide a rapid process for defining a deadened or reduced adhesive zone
with high throughput printing machines.
[0164]           In some embodiments, the selective application of an adhesive or different types of
adhesive can be accomplished using a printing machine, such as for printing graphics on a
film package.
[0165]           Any of the second, third, fourth, pull tab and/or projection zones can have the first
and second sheets secured using a sealing layer. In one embodiment, the sealing layer can be
comprised of materials that contain both compatible and incompatible polymers as the
surface of the second sheet that is adapted to contact the first sheet. The second sheet can be
adhered to the sealing layer using known processes, such as, for example, heat sealing. When
the package is opened, the two adjoined surfaces peel apart in the area that was subjected to
the sealing process because of the controlled incompatible polymer chosen. In a second
embodiment, the sealing layer of the first sheet can be identical to the sealing layer on the
second sheet. The second sheet can be adhered to the sealing layer using heat which melts
and bonds the two surfaces. In this embodiment, one of the two sealing surfaces is designed
to have just a thin layer of the polymer and just adjacent to it (away from the sealing
interface) has a layer which is designed to break away. This breakage allows the transfer of
one polymeric surface to the other surface and thru such transfer, opens the package. In
various embodiments, the flexible material including the first sheet, the second sheet, and
optionally the third sheet, can be thermoformed to form a closure assembly having a lid
formed in the flexible material. In such embodiments, the flexible material must be adapted
for thermoforming and have a desired heat transfer through the flexible material structure
(i.e., the second sheet, first sheet, and optional third sheet). In some embodiments of the
forming process, the flexible material can be heated from one side, for example, the side of
the flexible material that is disposed on the exterior of the package. When heating from one
side, the flexible material can have a structure such that the higher melting point materials are
disposed closer to the heat source than lower melting point materials. Thermal conductivity

of the polymers can be controlled and tailored based on desired packaging machine line
speeds.
[0166]            Other parameters of the flexible material that can be selected or tailored to provide
the desired line speed, thermoforming, and/or sealing properties include elastic modulus E.
The elastic modulus is a measure of a materials resistance to deformation or its stiffness.
[0167]            The mechanical properties of polymers, such as those which can be included in the
flexible materials of the disclosure, are dependent on temperature. For example, the flexible
materials of the disclosure can have 1% secant modulus of greater than about 60,000 psi in
the stackable direction, as measured using ASTM D882 at 23 'C.
Method and Apparatus for Manufacturing A Flexible Container
[0168]            Turning to the assembly of the re-closable packaging assembly 10, the container 12
may be formed or assembled in any manner known in the art. For example, the container 12
may be formed as described in U.S. Patent No. 8,231,024, which is herein incorporated by
reference in its entirety. For example, the first sheet 14 may be provided as a roll of material,
and the second sheet 24 may be secured to desired portions of the first sheet 14 along the roll.
The opening 20 may also be pre-cut on the first sheet 14. In some embodiment in which a lid
is formed into the film, the second sheet may be pre-cut to the dimensions of the lid edge 76
such that no additional cutting operations may be required on the second sheet 24 subsequent
to attachment to the first sheet 14. In embodiments in which the lid is formed into the
flexible material, one or more forming stations may be provided at a desired location along
the assembly line to form desired features of the container 12 and/or the closure assembly 22.
While embodiments of the method and apparatus for forming the package may include and
illustrate one or more forming stations for forming a closure assembly, it is contemplated that
the methods and apparatuses disclosed herein, without the forming station(s), can be used in
forming a resealable package that does not include a formed closure assembly.
[0169]            The first forming station may include thermoforming the desired features of the
container 12 and/or the closure assembly 22. Thermoforming is a manufacturing process
where a plastic sheet, such as the first sheet 14 and/or the second sheet 24, is heated to a
pliable forming temperature and formed to a specific shape in a mold. The sheet, or "film"
when referring to thinner gauges and certain material types, is heated in an oven to a high
                                                      75

enough temperature that it can be stretched into or onto a mold and cooled to a finished
shape. Instead of thermoforming, one skilled in the art would recognize that other
manufacturing operations may be used to form the first engagement feature 36 and the first
securement feature 104a (or any other features described herein).
[0170]           In a typical thermoforming process, a plastic sheet (such as the first sheet 14) is fed
from a roll into a set of indexing chains that transport the plastic sheet through an oven for
heating to forming temperature. The heated sheet then indexes into a form station where a
mold (such as the molds illustrated in Figures 15A to 17J) and pressure-box close on the
sheet, with vacuum then applied to remove trapped air and to pull the material into or onto
the mold along with pressurized air to form the plastic to the detailed shape of the mold.
After a short form cycle, a burst of reverse air pressure is actuated from the vacuum side of
the mold as the form tooling opens, commonly referred to as air-eject, to break the vacuum
and assist the formed parts off of, or out of, the mold. A stripper plate may also be utilized
on the mold as it opens for ejection of more detailed parts or those with negative-draft,
undercut areas. As previously explained, one or more forming stations may be provided at
any suitable location along the assembly line. For example, a system for making the
packages of the disclosure can include a forming tube, about which the film is folded for
making the package. Along the forming tube, one or more heating stations (see heating
stations 138 in Figures 19A to 19F, for example) and forming stations for making the
thermoformed features can be included. Referring to Figure 33, in one embodiment, the
machine can be provided with two preheating stations 303 that heat the film to a suitable
temperature for thermoforming and a forming station 306 that includes a die to which the
preheated film is conformed to form the desired features, such as the closure assembly. The
heating and/or forming stations can be disposed such that the thermoforming process occurs
while the film is folded about the forming tube process to form the package structure. In one
embodiment, the film is provided into the machine from a film roll and is folded about the
forming tube by passing the film over a collar. While on the forming tube, a portion of the
film is preheated for thermoforming. The film then passes over a die having the desired
structures for thermoforming and compressed to conform the film to the structures of the die.
The film can then proceed to stations for forming the seals of the package.

[0171]            The forming tube can be adapted such that for a portion of the forming station, for
example, the die can be integrally incorporated onto the forming tube or may be directly
secured to the forming tube. As illustrated in Figure 34 and 35, the forming tube 307 can
have a first portion having a first diameter and a second portion 192 downstream the first
portion having a second diameter less than the first diameter. The forming tube 307 may also
have a square or rectangular cross-sectional shape, and the perimeter of the second portion
192 may be less than the perimeter of the first portion. A die 193 (such as or similar to the
die illustrated in Figure 40, for example) for thermoforming can be attached to or integrally
formed into the forming tube 191 at the second portion 192. The first and second diameters
(or perimeters) are selected such that when the film passes from the first portion of the
forming tube to the second portion of the forming tube with a die installed thereon, the film
remains in substantially the same plane. In some embodiments, the forming tube can also be
used as the fill tube for filling the product into the container. In such embodiments, the
interior of the forming tube can include a restriction portion that reduces the diameter on the
inside of the forming tube to the size of the second diameter such that product flow through
an interior portion of the forming tube having a consistent diameter.
[0172]            For example, a first forming station may form the first engagement feature 36 (e.g.,
the ridge 40) and, optionally, the first securement feature 104a. The first forming station may
also form any or all of the second engagement portion 38, the convex portion 98, the second
securement feature 104b, the hinge portion 28 of the closure assembly 22, the one or more
ribs 51, and/or the locking mechanism 126, for example. Other desired features may also be
formed at the first forming station. The first engagement feature 36, the first securement
feature 104a, the second engagement portion 38, the convex portion 98, the second
securement feature 104b, the hinge portion 28 of the closure assembly 22, the one or more
ribs 51, and/or the locking mechanism 126 may all be formed at the first forming station
using a single mold (such as the molds illustrated in Figures 15A to 17J) in a single process
step. Alternatively, the first engagement feature 36 and the first securement feature 104a may
be formed at the first forming station using a single mold in a single manufacturing operation,
and the second engagement portion 38, the convex portion 98, the second securement feature
104b, and the hinge portion 28, or example, may be formed at a second forming station that is
remote from the first forming station. If the opening 20 (and/or cuts 107a, 107b of the hinge

portion 28 of the embodiment of Figure 20A and 20B) is not pre-cut, the opening 20 or cuts
107a, 107b may be cut by a die at the first forming station at the same time as the first
engagement feature 36, the first securement feature 104a, the second engagement portion 38,
the convex portion 98, the second securement feature 104b, the hinge portion 28 of the
closure assembly 22, the one or more ribs 51, and/or the locking mechanism 126 are formed.
Alternatively, the opening 20 or cuts 107a, 107b may be cut by a cutting die prior to, during,
or after the forming operation at the first forming station. A cutting operation for the cutting
of the opening 20 or cuts 107a, 107b would include inserting a blade of a cutting die (that
corresponds to the shape of the opening 20 or cuts 107a, 107b) through the first sheet 14 up
to (but not through) the second sheet 24.
[0173]            In various embodiments, the forming die and/or forming structure can include
structures to retain the film so that it is able to controllably stretch during the forming
process. This can aid in reducing or preventing tearing or pulling of the film when the film is
compressed against the forming die to form the closure assembly structures into the film.
[0174]           In an embodiment, the opening can be formed or defined in the package at the time
of forming the closure assembly. For example, the die used for forming the closure assembly
into the film can include a cutting die incorporated within the forming die. For example, the
cutting die can be including on a back side of the forming die and arranged such that upon
sufficient compression of the forming die the cutting die will pass through an opening
provided in the face of the forming die to contact a film disposed on the face of the cutting
die. In another embodiment, the forming die can include two cutting dies, with a first cutting
die disposed on the back side of the forming die for cutting the first and third sheets, and a
second cutting die disposed on the front side of the forming die for cutting the second sheet.
The cutting dies can be, for example, forged steel knives. Figures 75A and 75B, illustrates an
exemplary forming die having forged knives disposed within the forming die. For example,
in an exemplary forming operation, a heated film can be disposed on the face of a forming die
and compressed at a first compression pressure to conform the heated film to the structure
defined in the forming die and cool the film to retain the formed shaped, then the film can be
compressed onto the die at a second compression pressure greater than the first compression

cutting die contacts the film to define the opening. For example, in another exemplary
forming operation, a heated film can be disposed on the face of a forming die and compressed
at a first compression pressure to conform the heated film to the structure defined in the
forming die and cool the film to retain the formed shaped, then the film can be compressed
onto the first die and engaged with the second cutting die at a second compression pressure
greater than the first compression pressure to engage the first cutting die disposed on a back
side of the forming die such that the cutting die contacts the film to define the opening
through the first and third sheets, and to engage the second cutting die to cut define the
moveable lid portion in the second sheet, including for example, defining the hinge feature.
The extent to which the cutting die extends to contact the film and/or second compression
pressure can be configured such that the cutting die cuts through the first sheet and optional
third sheet, but preferably does not cut through the second sheet. In some embodiments, the
cutting die can contact the second sheet, partially scoring the second sheet, so long as the
second sheet is not weakened by the scoring.
[0175]            Figures 75A and 75B, further illustrates an embodiment of a forming station that
includes a secondary forming plate that provides a secondary forming operation to further
force the film further into the inner forming cavity, which can improve formation of
undercuts and other features on the formed lid assembly.
[0176]           Any suitable packaging machinery may be used to form the re-closable packaging
assembly 10. For example, as illustrated in Figures 19A to 19F, a vertical form, fill, and seal
(VFFS) packaging machine 135 may be used. The packaging machine 135 is capable of
intermittently forming a series of re-closable packaging assemblies 10 from a web of film,
such as a roll 136 of the first sheet 14 that may be fed into the packaging machine 135. The
roll 136 can be adapted to have a larger diameter than conventional film rolls to
accommodate a locally thickened portion of the film, for example, by including a third sheet
on the films and/or locally thickening portions of the first sheet. For example, the roll can
have an increased diameter of 3/4 inch to 1 inch. On such a web of film, the opening 20
(and/or cuts 107a, 107b of the hinge portion 28 of the embodiment of Figure 20A and 20B)
may be pre-cut (or pre-scored or pre-perforated) on the first sheet 14 and the second sheets 24
may be secured to desired portions of the first sheet 14. One having ordinary skill in the art

                                                                    Attorney Docket No.: 31332/47193
would recognize that the second sheets 24 could be applied while the web of film is directed
through the packaging machine 135 at any point prior to heating and thermoforming. In
some applications, the web of film may be pre-printed with graphics relating to the product to
be disposed within the re-closable packaging assembly 10, such as product information,
manufacturer information, nutritional information, bar coding and the like. The roll 136 may
be rotatably mounted on a shaft at the inlet end of the packaging machine 135. The web of
film is typically fed into the packaging machine 135 over a series of dancer rolls and guide
rolls 137, one or more of which may be driven to direct the first sheet 14 in the direction of
the transport path of the packaging machine 135.
[0177]           Before being formed into the shape of the container 12 of the re-closable packaging
assembly 10, the web of film may be directed through one or more heating stations 138 that
heat the web of film for a subsequent thermoforming step. The web of film is then directed
through a first forming station 140 that may thermoform the desired features of the container
12 and/or the closure assembly 22 as described above. For example, at this first forming
station 140, the first engagement feature 36, the first securement feature 104a, the second
engagement portion 38, the convex portion 98, the second securement feature 104b, the hinge
portion 28 of the closure assembly 22, the one or more ribs 51, and/or the optional locking
mechanism 126 may all be formed simultaneously using a single mold. Pressure forming or
pressure and vacuum forming may be used. An inert gas may be used for pressure forming
and/or for reverse air-eject. Following the first forming station 140, the web of film may then
be directed through one or more subsequent forming stations (not shown) that may perform
further manufacturing operations, such as scoring or further thermoforming of desired
features, as described above. However, it is preferable if all of the forming is done at a single
forming station, such as the first forming station 140. After passing through the first forming
station 140 (and any subsequent forming station(s)), the web of film is directed to a package
forming station 142 having a forming shoulder 144, or other device such as a forming box or
sequential folding system, configured to wrap the film around a forming tube 146 in a manner
known in the art. In the present example, the forming tube 146 is a product fill tube 148
having a funnel 150 for receiving the product to be disposed in the re-closable packaging
assembly 10 and filling the re-closable packaging assembly 10 with the product as the film
proceeds along the forming tube 146. It is contemplated that filling of the package can occur
                                                    80

                                                                      Attorney Docket No.: 31332/47193
on or off the forming tube. For example, the package can be removed from the forming tube
having an open, unsealed end and filled in a separate operation. The forming tube 146 is
configured to form the film into the desired shape based on the characteristics of the final
package design, such as square, rectangular, oval, trapezoidal, round, irregular and the like.
Of course, where other types of non-VFFS packaging machines are used, a forming tube may
not necessarily be used, and instead the film may be wrapped directly around the product to
be stored in the re-closable packaging assembly 10. As previously described, the first
forming station 140 (or any subsequent forming station) may be disposed at and integrally
formed with a downstream end of the forming tube 146.
[0178]           After the film is formed around the forming tube 146, the web of film moves along
the transport path to a combination edge seal/corner seal station 152 to form corner seals at
the corners between the sides 16a-f of the container 12, and to create combination edge seal
and corner seals, if desired, at the lateral edges of the web of film. In various embodiments,
corner seals can border and surround one side of the package or opposed sides of the
package. The web of film may pass a series of forming plates and shaping bars, and the web
of film may then be directed past welding devices of the station 152 that weld overlapping
portions of the film to complete the corner seals of the container 12. Of course, the comer
seals and the edge seals of the container 12 may be formed by different work stations
depending on the particular configuration of the packaging machine.
[0179]            The one or more heating stations 138, first forming station 140, and any subsequent
forming stations have been described as being located upstream of the package forming
station 142 or the combination edge seal/corner seal station 152. However, in alternative
embodiments of the packaging machine 135, the web of film may be directed into the one or
more heating stations 138, the first forming station 140, and any subsequent forming stations
following the seal/corner seal station 152. Alternatively, the web of film may be directed into
the one or more heating stations 138, the first forming station 140, and any subsequent
forming stations at a point between the package forming station 142 and the seal/corner seal
station 152.
[0180]           In order to further control the movement of the web of film along the forming tube
146 and the transport path, pull belts 154 may be provided after the stations 152 (or after the
                                                     81

one or more heating stations 138, first forming station 140, and any subsequent forming
stations) to engage the film and pull the film through the previous stations 142, 152.
[0181]           Following the seal/comer seal station 152, the edges of the container 12 may be
sealed to close the container 12, and folded and tacked down to conform to the shape of the
container 12 at a closing station 156. At the closing station 156, seal bars 158 may
simultaneously close upon the film and may seal a trailing edge (such as the first and/or
second edge 48, 50, for example) of a preceding container 12 and a leading edge of a current
container 12 in a manner known in the art.
[0182]           As discussed above, the forming tube 146 of the illustrated embodiment of the
packaging machine 135 is a product fill tube 148. Once the leading edge of the container 12
is closed during the sealing process at the closing station 156, the product may be added to
the package 12. At that point, a specified amount of the product may be poured through the
funnel 150 into the fill tube 148 and dropped into the container 12. After or as the container
12 receives the product, the container 12 advances to align a trailing edge of the container 12
at the closing station 156 and the trailing edge may be tucked and is sealed in the manner
described above, thereby sealing the container 12 with the product disposed therein.
[0183]           At the same time the seals of the adjacent containers 12 are formed, a gas flushing
operation may be performed if necessary to place a desired atmosphere in the container 12.
Once the container 12 of the re-closable packaging assembly 10 is sealed, it may be detached
from the web of film in preparation for any final processing steps and containerization.
Consequently, the closing station 156 may further include a knife or other separation device
(not shown) proximate the seal bars 158 to cut the common seal and separate the adjacent
container 12. Alternatively, the separation may occur at a downstream station.
[0184]           After separation, the re-closable packaging assembly 10 may drop or otherwise be
transported to a conveyor 160 for delivery to the remaining processing stations. Referring to
Figures 76A-76C, the conveyor can be provided in some embodiments as a continuous, race
track type design. The race-track type conveyor can be provided with various stations, for
example, to provide for folding and sealing of an end seal (flap). In some embodiments, as
discussed in detail below, the conveyor can include package receiving member. The
conveyor can be further equipped with a tilting portion or open portion, for example, to tip or
                                                      82

allow the packages drop from the package receiving member into a box or take away
conveyor. Alternatively, an arm can remove the package from the conveyor. For example,
the re-closable packaging assembly 10 may drop through a package chute 162. The re
closable packaging assembly 10 may fall loosely at a first conveyor location 164, but mostly
aligned onto the conveyor 160. At a second conveyor location 166, package side guides
167a, 167b may hold snug against the re-closable packaging assembly 10 and may positively
locate it through a third conveyor location 168. At a fourth conveyor location 170, package
side guides 167a, 167b may start to taper down towards the re-closable packaging assembly
10. At a fifth conveyor location 172, the package top guide 173 may hold snug against the
re-closable packaging assembly 10 and positively locating it in a vertical direction. One or
more glue applicators 175 may deposit glue onto one or more open flaps (e.g., the portions of
the first sheet 14 fourth side wall 16e illustrated in Figure 1) that are to be disposed through a
gap between the top of the re-closable packaging assembly 10. At a sixth conveyor location
174, the package side guides 167a, 167b transition from a low profile to a high profile and
fold the flaps of the re-closable packaging assembly 10 into the position illustrated in Figure
1. So disposed, the glue begins to "cure" or harden" and may be fully cured or hardened in
this position. At a seventh conveyor location 176, the package side guides 167a, 167b are
high profile and continue to hold the one or more flaps in a desired position. If the glue is not
fully cured or hardened, it may continue to cure or harden in this position and/or subsequent
positions. Alternatively, the one or more flaps could be heat sealed to a corresponding side
wall 16d, 16e. If necessary, a post-processing station(s) (not shown) may be included along
the conveyor 160 for any additional operations to be performed prior to shipment, such as
code dating, weight checking, quality control, labeling or marking, RFID installation, and the
like. At the conclusion of the sealing and post-processing activities, the finished re-closable
packaging assembly 10 may be removed from the conveyor 160 by a case packer (not shown)
and placed into a carton (not shown) for storage and/or shipment to customers.
[0185]           Figure 66, illustrates an embodiment in which the conveyor includes a package
receiving member that guides the package along the conveyor locations. For example, the
package assembly drop from the packaging machine into a package receiving member
disposed on the conveyor. The package receiving member can aid in retaining the package
assembly shape while and remaining assembly steps, such as forming and/or folding of the
                                                    83

trailing seal (also referred to as end seals), are performed on the conveyor. The package
receiving member can have, for example, a size and shape that corresponds to the size and
shape of the package assembly. For example, the package receiving member can have the
same cross-sectional shape as the package assembly, and be sized so that the package
assembly resides within the package receiving member. The package receiving member can
be, for example, open on the top and bottom, such that side walls are provided corresponding
to the side walls of the package. For example, the package can reside tightly within the
package receiving member so as to provide a compressive force to maintain the intended
folded shape of the package. The package receiving member can have any suitable height.
For example, the package receiving member can have a height such that it extends to cover at
least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at
least 90%, at least 95%, or 100% of the height of the package assembly (as measured from
the bottom wall). In embodiments in which the package receiving member has
approximately the same height as the package assembly, it should be understood that a
trailing seal, which may be formed or unformed when the package assembly is placed onto
the package receiving member, can extend above the top of the package receiving member
such that it can be formed and/or further processed for folding and/or adhering to the package
wall. For example, the trailing seal (also referred to as an end seal or flap) can be folded over
and heat sealed to the outside of the package and/or glues using an adhesive. Figures 74A
74C illustrate embodiments of a heating plate that can be incorporated into the conveyor to
heat a flap formed by the trailing seal sufficiently to attached the flap to the side of the
package using a heat seal. As illustrated in Figure 74C, the heat plate can include two
downward extensions and a recessed region to receive the flap, while the sides of the flap are
heated by the downward extensions. In an alternative embodiment, illustrated in Figures 74A
and 74B the heat plate can include a flat plate or a plate with single projection, respectively,
for contacting and heating the flap before and/or after the flap is folded over to contact the
side of the container to thereby seal the flap by the container. The conveyor can include one
or more heating plates for sealing the flap to the side of the package. For example, a first
heating station can be provided with low heat than a second heating station. For example, the
first heating station can include a heat plate in accordance with the embodiment shown in
Figure 74C having the two projections and a second heating station can include a heating
                                                  84

plate with no projection or a single projection, for example, as illustrated in Figures 74A and
74B, respectively. For example, the conveyor can include the heating plate having first and
second projections for a first heating step when the flap is in the upright position and a
heating plate having no projection or a single projection for further heating after the flap has
been folded over to contact a side of the package.
[0186]            The conveyor can include any suitable number of package receiving members
spaced at suitable intervals along the conveyor. The number and spacing of the package
receiving members can be determined for example, by one or more of the speed of the
package forming process, the length of the conveyor, and the number and duration of
processes to be performed on the package while on the conveyor. For example, the conveyor
can include about 1 to about 30, about 5 to about 10, about 12 to about 24, about 6 to about
18, about 7 to about 20, or about 10 to about 25 package receiving members. Other suitable
numbers of package receiving members include about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30. The spacing can be
determined, for example, by the various processes performed on the package assembly while
on the conveyor and the timing of the processes to be performed. For example, in an
embodiment in which the trailing seal is folded over and attached to a side of the package, the
package receiving members can be spaced about 2 in to about 24 in.
[0187]           Figures 36, 37, and 46 illustrate various embodiments of VFFS machines. Figure
46 illustrates a VFFS machine 300 (Vertical Folding Station Mode) having an embodiment of
the vertical forming station 301 illustrated in Figure 38. The vertical forming station 301
includes the forming tube assembly 302 illustrated in Figure 33, and the forming tube
assembly 302 may include a forming tube 307 extending along a first longitudinal axis 330
from a first end 331 to a longitudinally-opposite second end 332. The first longitudinal axis
330 may be vertical or substantially vertical. As used herein, the term vertical includes a
direction parallel or substantially parallel to the Z-axis of the reference coordinate system
provided in Figures 33 and 52A. Alternatively, the first longitudinal axis 330 may be
horizontal or substantially horizontal. As used herein, the term horizontal includes a

plane of the reference coordinate system provided in Figures 33 and 52A. The forming tube
assembly 302 may be modular and may be releasably secured to a primary frame assembly or
a portion of the primary frame assembly. The forming tube assembly 302 of Figure 33 may
include one or more (e.g., two) heating stations 303, and the heating stations 303 may each be
identical to the embodiment of Figure 39. In some embodiments, the heat station 303 can be
designed to selectively heat zones of the portion of film disposed within the heating station.
The forming tube assembly 302 of Figure 33 may also include a forming station 304, such as
a thermoforming station, that may include an inside forming cavity or a first mold element
305 (illustrated in Figure 40) and an outside forming cavity or a second mold element 306
(illustrated in Figure 41) to form any or all of the first engagement feature 36, the first
securement feature 104a, the second engagement portion 38, the convex portion 98, the
second securement feature 104b, the hinge portion 28 of the closure assembly 22, the one or
more ribs 51, and/or the optional locking mechanism 126. The forming tube assembly 302 of
Figure 33 may further include a forming tube 307 (illustrated in Figure 34) that extends
longitudinally (i.e., along the first longitudinal axis 330) relative to the forming tube
assembly 302, and the forming tube 307 may function identically to the forming tube 146
described above. That is, the forming tube 307 may be adapted to shape the film as the film
displaces in a direction parallel to the first longitudinal axis 330. The first mold element 305
(which may be identical to the die 193 of Figure 35), or any portion of the forming station
304, may be secured directly to a portion of the forming tube 307, and the portion of the
forming tube may be at or adjacent to the second end of the forming tube 332.
[0188]            The forming tube assembly 302 of Figure 33 may further include a pressure offset
assembly 308 (illustrated in Figure 42) that applies pressure to the forming tube 307 opposite
to the inside forming cavity 305 and the outside forming cavity 306. The pressure applied to
the forming tube assembly 302 by the pressure offset assembly 308 may be equal or
approximately equal to the pressure applied by the inside forming cavity 305and the outside
forming cavity 306, and this offset pressure improves stability and reduces deflection in the
forming tube assembly 302. The forming tube assembly 302 of Figure 33 may additionally
include a product funnel 309 for receiving the product to be disposed in the re-closable
packaging assembly 10.

any portion of the forming tube assembly 302. A first end of the primary frame assembly 333
may be disposed adjacent to (or vertically extend above) the first end 331 of the forming tube
307 and a second end of the frame assembly may extend beyond (or vertically extend below)
the second end 332 of the forming tube 332. The primary frame assembly333 may include a
frame or other support assembly, such as a plate, (or multiple frames and/or support
assemblies) that is adapted to be a permanent or semi-permanent base for the components that
comprise the VFFS machine 300. In contemplated embodiments, one or more modular frame
assemblies 334, such as a first modular frame assembly 334a, may be removably secured to
the primary frame assembly 333, One or more components, such as the first heating station
303, may be secured to a first portion of the first modular frame assembly 334 and at least a
portion of the first thermoforming station 304 (such as the second mold element of the first
thermoforming station 304) may be secured to a second portion of the first modular frame
assembly 334. One skilled in the art would recognize that such modular frame assemblies
334 allow a user or technician to quickly and efficiently switch out components secured to
the modular frame assemblies 334. The second modular frame assembly 334b may have one
or more different heating stations 303 and/or one or more different thermoforming stations
304 (or a portion of a thermoforming station) than the first modular assembly 334. However,
such modular frame assemblies 334 are optional, and the first heating station 303 and at least
a portion of the thermoforming station 304 may be secured directly (or indirectly) to the
primary frame assembly 333.

52B, the film roll station 136 may be coupled to the primary frame assembly 333 in any
suitable manner, and the film roll station 136 may be adapted to support a roll of the film 14.
The film roll station 136 may be positioned such that the film 14 extends from the film roll
station 136 to a point at or adjacent to the first end 331of the forming tube 307. More
specifically, the film 14 may extend from the film roll station 136 to a portion of the forming
tube 307 between the first end 331 and at least one of the heating stations 303 (such as the
first heating station). The film may engage one or more dancer rolls 137 to guide the film

along the film path. Each of the dancer rolls 137 and the support rod of the film roll 136 may
have a diameter of 2" to prevent the label 24 from separating from the film 14 as the film 14
translates over the rolls 136, 137. In this embodiment, a first segment of the film 14 may
extend between the film roll station 136 and the first end 331 of the forming tube 307 along a
second longitudinal axis 336. The second longitudinal axis 336 may have any suitable
orientation, and the second longitudinal axis 336 may be non-parallel and non-coaxial with
the first longitudinal axis 330. For example, the second longitudinal axis 336 may be normal
to (extend oblique to) the first longitudinal axis 330.
[0191]           In this embodiment, one or more heating stations 303 may include a first heating
element 303a for heating a first portion of the film 14 as the film displaces toward the first
end 331 of the forming tube 307, the first heating station 303a being disposed between the
film roll station 136 and the first end 331 of the forming tube 307. A second heating station
303b may be disposed between the first heating station 303a and the first end 331 of the
forming tube 307. The first thermoforming station 304 may be disposed between the first
heating station 303a (or the second heating station 303b) and the first end 331 of the forming
tube 307. So configured, the one or more heating stations 303 and the first thermoforming
station 304 may be disposed upstream (relative to the direction of travel of the film 14
through the vertical forming station 335) of the forming tube 307 or the first end 331 of the
forming tube 307.
[0192]           In contemplated embodiments, as illustrated in Figures 52A and 52B, one or more
modular frame assemblies 334, such as a first modular frame assembly 334a, may be
removably secured to the primary frame assembly 333 at one or more locations between the
film roll 136 and the first end 331 of the forming tube 307. One or more components, such as
the first heating station 303, may be secured to a first portion of the first modular frame
assembly 334 and at least a portion of the first thermoforming station 304 (such as the second
mold element of the first thermoforming station 304) may be secured to a second portion of
the first modular frame assembly 334. One skilled in the art would recognize that such
modular frame assemblies 334 allow a user or technician to quickly and efficiently switch out
components secured to the modular frame assemblies 334. For example, a first modular
frame assembly 334 may removed from the primary frame assembly 333 and a second
                                                   88

modular frame assembly 334b may be secured to the primary frame assembly 333. The
second modular frame assembly 334b may have one or more different heating stations 303
and/or one or more different thermoforming stations 304 (or a portion of a thermoforming
station) than the first modular assembly 334. However, such modular frame assemblies 334
are optional, and the first heating station 303 and at least a portion of the thermoforming
station 304 may be secured directly (or indirectly) to the primary frame assembly 333.
[0193]           Referring again to Figure 38, the vertical forming station 301 of Figure 38 may
include an upper bottom flap folding assembly 310 (or a first folding assembly or a first
folding station illustrated in Figure 43) downstream of a seal bar assembly 313 and the
forming tube assembly 302. The first folding station 310 may be coupled to the primary
frame assembly 333 or the modular frame assembly 334 and may be disposed between the
second end 332 of the forming tube and the second end of the primary frame assembly.
[0194]            The upper bottom flap folding assembly 310 may also include a product settling
vibrator and/or a heater. The vertical forming station 301 may also include a top flap folding
assembly 311 (illustrated in Figure 44) and a lower bottom flap folding assembly 312
(illustrated in Figure 45), and the lower bottom flap folding assembly 312 may also include a
product settling vibrator and/or a heater. The upper bottom flap folding assembly 310, the
top flap folding assembly 311, and/or the lower bottom flap folding assembly 312 may
cooperate to form flaps, corners, and/or folds in the film to form portions of the re-closable
packaging assembly 10. The vertical forming station 301 may also include seal bars 313 to
seal edges of the film to form portions of the re-closable packaging assembly 10. The seal
bars 313 may also form the end seals and cut the packages apart.
[0195]           In the VFFS machine 300 illustrated in Figure 46, the re-closable packaging
assembly 10 is formed or substantially formed in the vertical forming station 301, and each
completed or substantially completed the re-closable packaging assembly 10 is placed on a
takeaway conveyor 314 that transports the re-closable packaging assembly 10 for subsequent
inspection or further packaging.
[0196]           Referring now to Figure 37, an embodiment of a VFFS machine 315 (Horizontal
Top End Seal Folding and Gluing Mode) includes an embodiment of a vertical forming
station 316 that includes the forming tube assembly 302 illustrated in Figure 33. The vertical
                                                     89

forming station 316 may be similar to the vertical forming station 301 of Figure 38.
However, the vertical forming station 316 may only include a package bottom folding
assembly 317. In this embodiment, partially-formed re-closable packaging assemblies 10 are
placed on the conveyor 314 and the partially-formed re-closable packaging assemblies 10 are
routed through side guides that hold snug against the re-closable packaging assembly 10 and
positively locate it in a desired fixed position, such a vertical orientation. On the conveyor,
the partially-formed re-closable packaging assemblies 10 may pass through a product
settling/vibration station 318, and, subsequently, additional folding and glue stations to
complete the re-closable packaging assemblies 10. The glue stations can include equipment
for applying glue to a flap and folding the flap over to seal to the side of the package.
Alternatively, heated bars can be provided at the glue station to heat the film material and
then folding devices can be provided to fold the heated flap over and apply pressure to secure
the flap to the side of the package by a heat seal. In various embodiments, the packaging
machine can include power driven belts, which can for example, facilitate moving the
film/packages through the machine.
[0197]            Referring to Figure 36, an embodiment of a VFFS machine 318 (Horizontal Top
End Seal Folding and Sealing Mode) includes an embodiment of a vertical forming station
319 that includes the forming tube assembly 302 illustrated in Figure 33. The vertical
forming station 319 may be similar to the vertical forming station 301 of Figure 38.
However, the vertical forming station 316 may only include a package bottom folding
assembly 317 and may include seal jaws 320 adapted to form seals having vent channels to
vent the re-closable packaging assembly 10 in a manner that will be subsequently described
in more detail. In such seal jaws 320, each of the seal bars has a channel extending
therethrough, and the channel of each of the seal bars is aligned such that when the seal bars
engage to seal a portion of the film of the packaging assembly 10, the channels cooperate to
create an elongated unsealed vent in the film. The vent may be disposed in any orientation,
including the vertical direction. In this embodiment, partially-formed re-closable packaging
assemblies 10 are placed on the conveyor 314 and the partially-formed re-closable packaging
assemblies 10 are routed through side rails as described above. On the conveyor, the
partially-formed re-closable packaging assemblies 10 may pass through a product
settling/vibration station 318. In addition, the partially-formed re-closable packaging
                                                    90

assemblies 10 may pass through an end seal control and deflation station 321 and then an end
seal station 322, 323 to seal the vent and/or to make the package tighter.
[0198]           As illustrated in Figures 53A to 53F, a VFFS machine may include a reject station
337 disposed between the second end of the primary frame assembly 333 and the second end
332 of the forming tube 307. The rejection station 337 may include at least one ramp (e.g., a
first ramp 338 alone or more than one ramps), and the at least one ramp 338 may be disposed
in any position below the second end of the forming tube to allow containers downwardly
displaced from the second end of the forming tube to contact a surface of the first ramp 338.
For example, the at least one ramp 338 may be disposed at an angle relative to a reference
plane normal to the first longitudinal axis 330. So configured, the first ramp has a first end
that is disposed adjacent to and below the second end of the forming tube such that the film
that forms a partially-formed re-closable container contacts the first end of the first ramp
when the partially-formed re-closable container is released from the forming tube 307. The
partially-formed re-closable container travels under the influence of gravity to the second end
of the ramp and into a waste receptacle, for example. The reject station 337 may be secured
directly or indirectly to any portion of the assembly, such as the primary frame assembly 333
or the vertical forming station 301, for example. The reject station 337 may be deployed at
start-up when partially-formed containers are released from the forming tube 307 that would
become stuck in downstream folding stations. The reject station may also be deployed if
under or overweight product fills are detected or if metal is detected in the package, for
example. A reject station can alternatively be provided on the conveyor. For example, a
portion of the conveyor can drop out or a robotic arm can be provided to remove a package
from the conveyor at a reject location. Figure 76A illustrates an embodiment in which a
reject station is provided on the conveyor.
[0199]            The components of the packaging machine 135 and the steps for forming the re
closable packaging assembly 10 therein may be rearranged as necessary to properly form the
re-closable packaging assembly 10, and to do so in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
For example, as explained above, the web of film may be directed into the one or more
heating stations 138, the first forming station 140, and any subsequent forming stations
following the seal/corner seal station 152.

[0200]           In various embodiments, the package can be formed using a process for venting the
internal atmosphere of the package. In the packaging of various materials, it can be
necessary to provide a particular head space in the package during the filling and package
sealing process to protect the product. Methods in accordance with the disclosure can include
venting this headspace, which can advantageously reduce the package size. The package can
be vented for example by forming a vent hole when sealing the leading or trailing seal of the
package. For example, the seal jaw can form the seal in the package leaving a small gap in
the seal through which air can vent. Once vented, the seal can be resealed to seal the vent
hole. In quad seal type packages, for example, an initial seal can be provided to include the
vent and then upon venting of the air in the package, the seal can be reformed to close the
vent and then the seal can be folded over and adhered to the outer side of the package.
[0201]            In some embodiments, the process can include settling the product in the package
before forming the seal to close the package. For example, a leading seal can be formed in
the package and the product can be filled in the package. Prior to sealing the trailing seal, the
product can be subject to a settling process, for example by vibration or other methods known
in the art, to settle the product to the portion of the package adjacent the formed leading
seal. The trailing seal can then be formed. In some embodiments, the package can be
dropped or placed onto a conveyor from the forming tube before forming the trailing
seal. The conveyor can include a settling station in which the product is settled to the portion
of the package adjacent the trailing seal. The leading seal can then be formed and optionally
may include a vent as described above.
[0202]           In various embodiments of the package, the trailing and leading seals can be folded
over and adhered to the outer portion of the package. Such folding and sealing operations of
the leading seal can be completed either when forming the leading seal with the film disposed
about the forming tube or when the package is disposed on the conveyor. Such folding and
sealing operations of the trailing seal can be completed either when the film is provided about
the forming tube or on the conveyor. When the trailing seal is formed on the conveyor, the
folding and sealing operations to adhere the seal to the outside of the package will be
performed on the conveyor. In some embodiments, the trailing seal can be formed while the
film is about the forming tube such that a sealed package is provided to the conveyor for the
                                                    92

folding and sealing of the leading and/or trailing seals to the outside of the package. In some
embodiments, the leading and trailing seals can be both formed and folded and sealed to the
outer portion of the package when the package is disposed in line with the forming tube, and
prior to placing the package on a conveyor.
[0203]            One skilled in the art will understand that the containers 10 may be formed by other
types of machines or combinations of machines, such as horizontal form, fill and seal (HFFS)
machines, Stand-Up Pouch type machines, sequential assembly machines and the like, and
the use of such machines or combinations of machines performing the various tasks in
forming containers in accordance with the present disclosure is contemplated by the
inventors. One skilled in the art would also recognize that any suitable product may be
disposed within the container 12 of the re-closable packaging assembly 10. For example,
food products, such as peanuts, may be disposed within the container 12. Alternatively, baby
wipes may also be disposed within the container 12.
[0204]           As previously explained, and unlike conventional re-closable packaging assemblies,
the lid member 26, the first engagement feature 36, and the second engagement feature 38
may be formed in the container 12 and the closure assembly 22 in one manufacturing
operation, thereby eliminating the need to attach a separately-fabricated lid assembly that is
secured to a container. Because the features are formed in a single process step, and because
the separately-fabricated lid assembly is not necessary, one having ordinary skill in the art
would recognize that manufacturing time and cost are reduced. Moreover, one having
ordinary skill in the art would recognize such features allows for reliable resealing of the lid
member 26 to the container 12 despite the presence of surface contaminants in the sealing
area.
[0205]           Referring now to Figure 78, an embodiment of a VFFS machine 1000 includes an
embodiment of a flap folding station assembly 1002 adapted to replace the race-track type
conveyor that includes various stations, for example, to provide for folding and sealing of an
end seal flap (see e.g., Figures 76A to 76C). In this embodiment, a film roll 1004 similar or
identical to any of those previously described (e.g., a first sheet 14 and a second sheet 24)
may be guided over a forming shoulder 1006 and around a forming tube 1008 that extends
along (or substantially along) a vertical (along or parallel to the Z-axis of the reference

coordinate system of Figure 78) axis in a the manner previously described or in any
conventional manner. However, to reduce or eliminate creasing in the first sheet 14 and/or
the second sheet 24, the forming shoulder 1006 may have one or more radius pieces 1007 (as
illustrated in Figures 84a to 84d) that allows for a bending radius of the first sheet 14 and the
second sheet 24that is greater than corresponding radii of conventional forming shoulders.
The forming shoulder 1006 may have one or more radius pieces 1007 that may be disposed at
any suitable location on the forming shoulder 1006, and the radius pieces 1007 may have any
suitable geometry to increase the bending radius of the first sheet 14 and the second sheet 16.
For example, each radius piece 1007 may be a ramp-like projection on an edge of the forming
shoulder 1006 that provides a bending radius of 0.063" to 2.000", depending on the thickness
of the first sheet 14. For example, the bending radius may be 0.375". As the first sheet 14
and the second sheet 24 are folded around the forming tube 1006 in a conventional manner,
one or more vertical sealing stations 1010 may apply a vertical seal-such as a heat seal-to
one or more vertically-aligned edges of the first sheet 14 such that the first sheet 14 is sealed
around the perimeter of the forming tube 1008.
[0206]           As previously described, one or more edges of the second sheet 16 may be
perforated or scored to assist in edge folding, additionally or alternatively one or more edge
folding stations 1012 may be disposed along the forming tube. 1008 to further assist in edge
folding and/or mechanically define a crease in the first and second sheets at the edge when no
line of reduced strength is provided. As illustrated in Figure 80a and 80b, the edge folding
stations 1012 may include a projection tab 1014 that may be vertically disposed along an
edge of the forming tube 1006 and may transversely (i.e., normal to the Z-axis of the
reference coordinate system of Figure 78, such as, for example, along or parallel to the X or
Y-axis of the reference coordinate system of Figure 78) extend beyond the perimeter of the
outer surface of the forming tube 1008. The projection tab 1014 may be aligned with a score
and/or a perforation on the first sheet 14 (and the second sheet 24) such that one or more
rollers 1016-such as a cylindrically-shaped roller-may engage one or both sides of a
portion of the perforated/scored edge to fold that edge about the projection tab 1014. One
skilled in the art would understand that as described, the projection tab 1014 cooperating with
the roller(s) 1016 allows for a bend that exceeds 90 degrees to form a more sharp crease in
the first sheet 14 along a score or perforation than that possible on the forming tube 1008

alone, as illustrated in Figure 80b. Figures 85a to 85g illustrate an embodiment of the edge
folding station 1012 having two rollers 1017 (the axles of the rollers 1017 are not shown)
disposed adjacent to projection tabs 1014 formed on edges of the forming tube 1008. The
projection tab 1014 or the forming tube 1008 may have portions that are contoured to
correspond with contoured shapes of scored or perforated portions of the first sheet and/or the
second sheet 24 to facilitate bending to the contoured shapes.
[0207]           After the vertical perimeter edge of the first sheet 14 is sealed, the first and second
sheets 14, 24 are vertically advanced to a first horizontal sealing station 1018 that may
include one or more tuckers (not shown) that may displace in a horizontal direction (or a
substantially horizontal direction) to displace a portion of a first end of a segment of the first
sheet 14 in a known manner. In some embodiments, a first and second tucker may converge
towards the vertical axis of the forming tube 1008 to symmetrically displace opposing
portions of the first end of a segment of the first sheet 14 in a known manner. A pair of
horizontally disposed seal bars may then seal (e.g., heat seal) the first end of a segment of the
first sheet 14 in a known manner. A horizontal cut may be made adjacent to the seal of the
first end of a segment of the first sheet 14 to create a partially-formed container with an open
second end.
[0208]            The partially-formed container with an open second end (e.g., a top end) may then
be vertically advanced to a second horizontal sealing station 1020. While advancing
between the first horizontal sealing station 1018 and the second horizontal sealing station
1020 (or while at either of the first horizontal sealing station 1018 or the second horizontal
sealing station 1020), the partially-formed container with the open second end may be filled
with product from the fill tube in a conventional manner. For example, the first and second
horizontal sealing stations 1018, 1020 may function cooperatively and substantially
simultaneously to define the lower seal of a first container and the upper seal of a second
container, disposed downstream of the first container, the first and second containers being
attached until the seal disposed between them (formed cooperatively by the first and second
horizontal sealing stations) is cut. The container may be filled with product after the lower
seal of the container is filled and just prior to or alternatively, while web is transition the
container such that the upper seal region is disposed in the second horizontal sealer.

[0209]            The second horizontal sealing station 1020 may be similar or identical in function
to the first horizontal sealing station 1018. That is, the second horizontal sealing station
1020 may include one or more tuckers (not shown) that may displace in a horizontal direction
(or a substantially horizontal direction) to displace a portion of the second end of the
partially-formed container in a known manner. In some embodiments, a first and second
tucker may converge towards the vertical axis of the forming tube 1008 to symmetrically
displace opposing portions of the partially-formed container in a known manner. The
horizontally disposed seal bar may then seal (e.g., heat seal) the second end of the partially
formed container in a known manner (e.g., while sealing the first end of the partially-formed
container at the first horizontal sealing station 1018), thereby creating a sealed container 1024
having a transverse sealed flap 1022 at the second end (e.g., the top end). The transverse
sealed flap 1022 (see Figure 81) is the transverse flap created when the second end of the
partially-formed container is sealed to close the partially-formed container into the sealed
container 1024.
[0210]           A support structure (e.g., a retractable platform) may be disposed normal to the
vertical axis of the forming tube 1008 to support the first end of the partially-formed
container at the second horizontal sealing station 1020. In addition, instead of cutting the
sealed first end of a segment of the first sheet 14 (to create a partially-formed container with
an open second end) at the first horizontal sealing station 1018, such a cut could be made at
the second horizontal sealing station 1020 to create the partially-formed container (or to
create the sealed container 1024). The first and second sheet 14, 24 may pause at the first
horizontal sealing station 1018 and the second horizontal sealing station 1020 to form the
seals and/or perform the horizontal cutting operation. However, the first and second sheet 14,
24 may continuously move at and between the first horizontal sealing station 1018 and the
second horizontal sealing station 1020. In such an embodiment, the first horizontal sealing
station 1018 and/or the second horizontal sealing station 1020 may vertically displace
downwards at the same rate as the first sheet 14 for the duration of the sealing/cutting
process, as is known in the art. The first horizontal sealing station 1018 and/or the second
horizontal sealing station 1020 may then vertically displace upwards to begin the next sealing
process, as is known in the art.

[0211]           A flap sealing station assembly 1002 may be disposed downstream of (e.g.,
vertically offset from or below) the first horizontal sealing station 1018 and/or the second
horizontal sealing station 1020. As illustrated in Figures 82a, 82b, 83a, 83b, and 86a to 89g,
the flap sealing station assembly 1002 may include a vertically-disposed guide structure 1028
that is adapted to ensure proper positioning of the sealed container 1024 after the sealed
container 1024 exits the second horizontal sealing station 1020 (e.g., is dropped from the
support structure). For example, the guide structure 1028 may include a plurality of vertical
walls disposed at right angles to form a rectangular perimeter that is slightly offset from the
vertically-aligned perimeter side walls of the sealed container 1024. The guide structure
1028 may be hinged about a vertical edge to allow one or more walls of the guide structure
1028 to be opened by a technician. In some embodiments, the flap sealing station 1024 may
also include a displaceable support (not shown) that may support the bottom (e.g., the first
end) of the sealed container 1024. The displaceable support may retract or pivot from a first
position at or adjacent to a bottom portion of (e.g., under) the guide structure 1028 to a
second position remote from the bottom portion of the guide structure 1028 to temporarily
support the sealed container 1024. In the first position, the sealed container 1024 may rest on
the displaceable support such that all or a portion of the sealed container 1024 is surrounded
by the guide structure 1028. In such a position, a transverse sealed flap 1023 (see Figure 81)
is maintained against the bottom portion of the sealed container 1024. Because the transverse
sealed flap 1023 is still heated from the sealing operation, the transverse sealed flap 1023 is
secured (e.g., heat sealed) to the bottom portion of the sealed container 1024, thereby
allowing for a more esthetically streamlined package. In the second position, the sealed
container 1024 may drop (under the influence of gravity alone) to a position directly beneath
and aligned with the guide structure 1028. In alternative embodiments, no displaceable
support may be used and the sealed container 1024 may drop (under the influence of gravity
alone) to a position directly beneath and aligned with the guide structure 1028. After
dropping, the bottom (e.g., the first end) of the sealed container 1024 may be disposed on a
support structure, such as a horizontal surface of a conveyor 1030, as illustrated in Figure 78.
[0212]            On the support structure, the sealed container 1024 may be engaged (e.g.,
immediately engaged or surrounded) by a retaining structure 1032 of the flap sealing station
assembly 1002, and the retaining structure 1032 may have a cross-sectional shape that
                                                       97

corresponds to the sealed container 1024. For example, the retaining structure 1032 may
include a plurality of vertical walls disposed at right angles to form a rectangular perimeter
that is slightly offset from the vertically-aligned perimeter side walls of the sealed container
1024. The retaining structure 1032 may include a first portion 1032a and a second portion
1032b that may horizontally displace from a first closed position to a second open position,
and vice versa. In the first closed position, shown in Figure 83a, an end portion of the first
portion 1032a may be adjacent to or in contact with an end portion of the second portion
1032b such that the first portion 1032a and second portion 1032b cooperate to form an
enclosure that surrounds the sealed container 1024 when the sealed container 1024 is
disposed on the support structure. That is, each of the plurality of vertical walls that form the
retaining structure 1032 (e.g., the first portion 1032a and second portion 1032b) may be
directly adjacent to or in contact with a corresponding vertical wall of the sealed container
1024. In the second open position, shown in Figure 82a, the end portion of the first portion
1032a may be displaced from the end portion of the second portion 1032b such that the
sealed container 1024 is not enclosed by the first portion 1032a and second portion 1032b
when the sealed container 1024 is disposed on the support structure. For example, each of
the first portion 1032a and the second portion 1032b may be horizontally disposed a
predetermined distance away from the vertical axis of the forming tube 1008.
[0213]           In the first closed position, one or more pressure plates 1034 of the flap sealing
station assembly 1002 may engage the top (e.g., the second end) of the sealed container 1024.
The one or more pressure plates 1034 may retract or pivot from a first position at or adjacent
to a top portion of (e.g., over) the retaining structure 1032 to a second position remote from
the top portion of the retaining structure 1032. In some embodiments, the sealed container
1024 may be disposed within the retaining structure 1032-and the retaining structure 1032
may be in the first closed position-prior to the one or more pressure plates 1034 displacing
to the first position. With the sealed container 1024 engaged by the retaining structure 1032
in the first closed position, pressure provided against the vertical sides and bottom of the
sealed container 1024 by the retaining structure 1032 and the support structure cooperate to
compress the residual fluid (e.g., air) in the sealed container 1024, thereby providing an
increased pressure within the sealed container 1024. As the one or more pressure plates 1034
are pivoted or otherwise displaced into the first position to engage (i.e., contact) the top (e.g.,
                                                       98

the second end) of the sealed container 1024, the increased pressure allows the one or more
pressure plates 1034 to compress the transverse sealed flap 1022 against the top portion of the
sealed container 1024. Because the transverse sealed flap 1022 is still heated from the
sealing operation, the transverse sealed flap 1022 is secured (e.g., heat sealed) to the top
portion of the sealed container 1024, thereby allowing for a more esthetically streamlined
package. When the transverse sealed flap 1022 has been so secured, the one or more pressure
plates 1034 is retracted, the retaining structure 1032 moves to the second open position, and
the conveyor transports the finished sealed container 1024 to a remote station for further
packaging or processing. The process is then repeated for the next sealed container 1024.

[0220]           Films were evaluated for their stiffness. It has been observed that films need to
have sufficient stiffness such that package retains its shape when the product is filled into the
package, but must remain sufficient flexibility to traverse the filling and forming material.
Table 1 provides a listing of materials and measured secant modulus. Table 2 provides the
secant modulus of different laminate. The stiffness of the laminate is an averaged value
between the stiffest web in the laminate and the softest web. The stiffness (as measured by
the 1% secant modulus) was measured using ASTM D882 at 23 'C.
