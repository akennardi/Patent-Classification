FIELD OF INVENTION
       [0001]    The present   invention relates    generally to systems
and methods for aliquotting frozen samples,          and more
particularly to systems       and methods for efficiently taking
multiple frozen sample cores        from a single frozen biological
sample to provide a plurality of aliquots that can be analyzed
separately without thawing the sample and while minimizing
degradation of the sample, protecting the          integrity of the
sample, and prolonging its usable life.
BACKGROUND
       [0002]    Biological samples    include any samples which are of
animal    (including human),     plant, protozoal, fungal, bacterial,
viral, or other biological origin.          For example, biological
samples    include, but are not limited to,       organisms and/or
biological fluids      isolated from or excreted by an organism such
as plasma, serum, urine, whole blood, cord blood, other blood
based derivatives, cerebral spinal fluid, mucus           (from
respiratory tract, cervical),        ascites, saliva, amniotic fluid,
seminal    fluid, tears,    sweat, any fluids from plants      (including
sap);   cells    (e.g., animal, plant, protozoal, fungal, or
bacterial cells,      including buffy coat cells;     cell lysates,
homogenates, or suspensions;        microsomes;   cellular organelles
 (e.g., mitochondria); nucleic acids         (e.g., RNA, DNA),   including
chromosomal DNA, mitochondrial DNA, and plasmids           (e.g., seed
plasmids);     small molecule compounds in suspension or solution
 (e.g. small molecule compounds in DMSO);         and other fluid-based
biological samples.        Biological samples may also include plants,
portions    of plants    (e.g., seeds) and tissues     (e.g., muscle, fat,
skin, etc.).

      [0003]     Bio-banks typically cryopreserve these valuable
samples    (e.g., in freezers at -80 degrees centigrade using
liquid Nitrogen or the vapor phase above liquid Nitrogen) to
preserve the biochemical composition and integrity of the frozen
sample as close as possible to the in vivo state to facilitate
accurate, reproducible analyses of the samples.
      [0004]     From time to time, it may be desirable to run one or
more tests on a sample that has been frozen. For example, a
researcher may want to perform tests on a set of samples having
certain characteristics. A particular sample may contain enough
material to support a number of different tests. In order to
conserve resources, smaller samples known as aliquots are
commonly taken from larger cryopreserved samples for use in one
or more tests so the remainder of the cryopreserved sample will
be available for one or more different future tests.
      [0005]     Biobanks have adopted a couple of different ways to
address this. One option is to freeze a sample in large volume,
thaw it when aliquots are requested and then refreeze any
remainder for storage in the cryopreserved state until future
aliquots are needed. This option makes efficient use of freezer
space; yet this efficiency comes at the cost of sample quality.
Repeated freeze/thaw cycles can degrade critical biological
molecules     (e.g., RNA) and damage biomarkers, either of which
could compromise the results of any study using data obtained
from the damaged samples.
      [0006]     Another option is to freeze a sample in  large
volume, thaw it when an aliquot is requested, subdivide the
remainder of the sample to make additional aliquots for future
tests and then refreeze these smaller volume aliquots to
cryopreserve each aliquot separately until needed for a future
test. This approach limits the number of freeze/thaw cycles to
which a sample is exposed, but there is added expense associated
with labor, the larger volume of freezer space, and a larger

inventory of containers       required to maintain the cryopreserved
aliquots. Moreover, the aliquots can be degraded or damaged by
even a limited number freeze/thaw cycles. Yet another approach
is to divide a large volume sample into smaller volume aliquots
before  freezing. This approach enables the freeze thaw cycles to
be limited to only one, yet there are disadvantages associated
with costs of labor, freezer space, and container inventory with
this approach.
      [0007]     U.S.  pre-grant publication  No. 20090019877,    the
contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference,
discloses a system for extracting frozen sample cores         from a
single  frozen biological sample without thawing the        sample. The
system uses a drill including a hollow bit coring needle to take
a frozen core sample from the original sample without thawing
the sample. The frozen sample core obtained by the drill is used
as the aliquot for the test. After the frozen core is         removed,
the remainder of the sample is returned to the        freezer until
another aliquot from the sample is needed for a future test. The
present inventors have made various improvements on the system
disclosed in the      '877 publication, as will be described in
detail below.
SUMMARY
      [0008]        One aspect of the invention is a method of
obtaining an aliquot of a frozen sample contained in a
container, wherein the sample includes two or more substances.
The method includes moving a sample coring device into the
frozen sample at a location and then withdrawing the sample
coring device from the sample to obtain the aliquot in the form
of a frozen sample core taken from that location. The location
is selected to be at a radial position where the concentration
of at least one substance of interest in the frozen sample core
is representative of the overall concentration of said at least

   WO 2012/074771                                   PCT/US2011/061214
                                   4
one substance of interest in the sample notwithstanding any
concentration gradients that may exist in the frozen sample.
      [0009]      Another aspect of the invention is a method of
obtaining an aliquot of a frozen sample contained in a
container, wherein the sample includes two or more substances.
The method includes moving a sample coring device into the
frozen sample at a first location and then withdrawing the
sample coring device from the sample to obtain a first aliquot
in the form of a frozen sample core taken from the first
location. The sample coring device or another sample coring
device is moved into the frozen sample at a second location
having a different radial position within the sample from the
first location and then withdrawn from the sample to obtain a
second aliquot in the form of a frozen sample core taken from
the second location. The first and second aliquots are combined
to form an aggregate aliquot. The first and second locations are
selected so the concentration of at least one substance of
interest in the aggregate aliquot is representative of the
overall concentration of that substance of interest in the
sample notwithstanding any concentration gradients that may
exist in the frozen sample.
      [0010]      Still another aspect of the invention is a system
for obtaining frozen aliquots from frozen samples. The system
has a platform for supporting a plurality of containers
containing the frozen samples. A sample coring device includes a
coring bit adapted to take frozen sample cores from the frozen
samples by being moved into the frozen samples and then
withdrawn from the frozen samples. A robotic system is adapted
to produce relative movement between the sample coring device
and platform and to operate the sample coring device to take
frozen sample cores from the frozen samples. The system has a
processor adapted to control the robotic system. The processor
is programmed to accept input from a user and operate in one of

   WO 2012/074771                                     PCT/US2011/061214
                                     5
multiple different modes in response to the input. The modes
differing from one another in one of more of the following
parameters:
          (a)    a speed at which the robotic system moves the coring
                 bit axially into the frozen samples to obtain the
                 frozen sample cores;
          (b)    a force with which the robotic system moves the
                 coring bit axially into the frozen samples to obtain
                 the frozen sample cores;
          (c)    a speed at which the robotic system rotates the
                 coring bit to obtain the frozen sample cores;
          (d)    a torque applied to the coring bit to obtain the
                 frozen sample cores;
          (e)    an amount of an impact force applied to the coring
                 bit as it is moved axially into the frozen samples
                 to obtain the frozen sample cores;
          (f)    a position within each of the respective samples
                 from which the frozen sample cores are taken;
          (g)    a depth to which the sample coring device is moved
                 into the frozen sample;  and
          (h)    a size or shape of a drill bit used by the sample
                 coring device to take the frozen sample core.
      [0011]        Another aspect of the invention is a high
precision automated positioning system. The system has a frame
and a platform supported by the frame. The platform is adapted
to support a plurality of samples. A temperature control block
is supported by the frame and operable to at least one of heat
and cool samples when they are on the platform. A robot
supported by the frame is adapted to pick up samples off the
platform, move the samples relative to the platform, and then
place the samples down at a different position relative to the
platform. The frame supports the temperature control block so
the temperature control block is spaced from the platform by a

   WO 2012/074771                                    PCT/US2011/061214
                                    6
gap to allow the platform to move relative to the temperature
control block without contacting the temperature control block.
The frame is connected to the temperature control block by a
plurality of flexure mounts adapted to isolate the frame        from
thermal expansion or contraction of the temperature control
block.
      [0012]       Yet another aspect of the invnetion is  a system
for taking frozen aliquots     from a plurality of frozen samples.
The system includes a frame and an enclosure supported by the
frame. A platform is supported by the frame and adapted to
support the     frozen samples within the enclosure. A temperature
control   system is adapted to maintain samples on the platform
and within the enclosure at a temperature in the range of about
0 degrees centigrade to about -180     degrees centigrade. A robot
has an arm adapted to pick up samples off the platform, move the
samples relative to the platform, and then place the samples
down at a different position relative to the platform. The robot
arm is mounted on the     frame at a location outside the enclosure.
A sample coring device is mounted on the robot arm. The coring
device is operable to take     frozen sample cores from the frozen
samples.
      [0013]       Another aspect of the invention is a system for
obtaining aliquots of frozen samples     from a plurality of sample
containers and transferring the aliquots to a plurality of
aliquot-receiving containers.     The system has a platform for
supporting the sample containers and the aliquot-receiving
containers. The platform includes at least one turntable. A
sample coring device is     adapted to take frozen sample cores from
the frozen samples by being moved into the frozen samples and
then withdrawn from the frozen samples.     The sample coring device
is mounted above the platform on an arm rotatable about a
substantially vertical axis and moveable vertically up and down
relative to the platform. A     first servo-motor is adapted to

   WO 2012/074771                                     PCT/US2011/061214
                                     7
drive rotation of the turntable. A second servo-motor is adapted
to rotate the arm. A third servo-motor is adapted to move the
arm up and down relative to the platform. The system is
constructed so the first, second, and third servo-motors provide
the only position control for one or more of the following
functions that can be carried out by the system:
          (a)    moving a container from the platform to a sample
                 coring station;
          (b)    moving another container from the platform to an
                 aliquot receiving station spaced from the sample
                 coring station;
          (c)    activating and releasing one or more clamping
                 mechanisms to hold and release the containers in
                 fixed positions at the sample coring and aliquot
                 receiving stations;
          (d)    removing threaded caps from the containers;
          (e)    scanning a beam from a sample inspection device
                 across a surface of the frozen sample to locate any
                 positions in the sample from which sample cores have
                 already been taken;
          (f)    moving a sample coring device into the sample
                 container to obtain a frozen sample core;
          (g)    transferring the frozen sample core to the aliquot
                 receiving container at the aliquot receiving
                 station;
          (h)    screwing the threaded caps back onto the containers;
          (i)    moving the containers back from the sample coring
                 and aliquot receiving stations to the platform; and
          (j)    moving the sample coring device to a cleaning
                 station for cleaning.

by being moved into the frozen samples     and then withdrawn from
the frozen samples. A robotic system is adapted to produce
relative movement between the sample coring device and platform
and operate the sample coring device to take sample cores         from
the frozen samples. A     sample inspection system is adapted to
detect one or more locations within a frozen sample from which a
frozen sample core has already been taken. The     sample inspection
system includes a time-of-flight distance     sensor adapted to
detect a distance between the sensor and a surface of the
samples.

image corresponding to only a portion of said potentially cored
surface   for a respective sample and determine whether or not
said portion has been cored.

particular location regardless of whether or not the
potentially-cored surface has physical characteristics that
cause it to reflect light in a diffuse manner.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
       [0043]    Referring now to the drawings, first to Figs.            1 and
2, one embodiment of an automated frozen sample aliquotting
system, generally designated 101,         includes a robot 103 adapted
to automatically take a plurality of frozen aliquots             (e.g., in
the form of frozen sample cores)         from a plurality of different
frozen samples. The samples are        suitably frozen biological
samples.
       [0044]     Biological samples include any samples which are of
animal   (including human),     plant, protozoal, fungal, bacterial,
viral, or other biological origin.          For example, biological
samples   include, but are not limited to,        organisms and/or
biological fluids      isolated from or excreted by an organism -
such as plasma, serum, urine, whole blood, cord blood, other
blood-based derivatives, cerebral spinal fluid, mucus              (from
respiratory tract, cervical),        ascites, saliva, amniotic fluid,
seminal   fluid, tears,     sweat, any fluids from plants       (including
sap),   cells    (e.g., animal, plant, protozoal, fungal, or
bacterial cells,      including buffy coat cells;      cell lysates,
homogenates, or suspensions;       microsomes;    cellular organelles
 (e.g., mitochondria); nucleic acids         (e.g., RNA, DNA),    including
chromosomal DNA, mitochondrial DNA, and plasmids            (e.g., seed
plasmids),     small molecule compounds in suspension or solution
 (e.g. small molecule compounds in DMSO),         and other fluid-based
biological samples.       Biological samples may also include plants,
portions    of plants   (e.g., seeds),    and tissues    (e.g., muscle,
fat,  organs,     skin, etc.).
       [0045]    The robot 103   includes or is    connected to a
processor     (not shown),   such as a computer, that controls
operation of the robot. The robot 103          is positioned in an
enclosure 105 which protects the robot and also protects an
operator from any sharp objects, aerosols, or spray that might
be associated with operation of the robot. In the case of frozen

   WO 2012/074771                                      PCT/US2011/061214
                                     14
biological samples, which might contain pathogens        (e.g., blood
borne pathogens),      the enclosure 105 also limits exposure of the
operator to potential pathogens. The ability to limit release of
sample materials into the environment can be important when the
aliquotting system is used to take aliquots from frozen
biological samples or other potentially hazardous materials.
      [0046]     Various different enclosures  can be used within the
scope of the invention. For example, the enclosure 105 in Fig. 1
includes a base 107 enclosing a lower chamber 109 in which the
base of the robot 103 is contained. As illustrated, the base 107
of the enclosure 105 is supported by a stand 111,       e.g.,   a cart
having wheels      (not shown), so the robot 103 is supported above
the floor at a comfortable working height to facilitate manual
loading and unloading of samples and aliquots from the robot and
other manual work. The cart 111 also makes it easy to move the
robot from one location to another. The base 107 of the
enclosure 105 could instead be positioned on a table or work
bench. It is also understood the base of the robot 103 does not
need to be supported at any particular elevation within the
broad scope of the invention.
      [0047]     The enclosure 105 also includes a removable cover
115 atop the enclosure base 107. The cover 115 can be removed to
access the robot 103 for maintenance or repair as may be needed
from time to time. The enclosure 105 also includes a door 117 on
the front of the cover 115 that can be opened to load and unload
the frozen sample vials and frozen aliquot vials from the system
and/or perform limited maintenance or repairs on the system 101
without removing the cover. The cover 115 also helps insulate
the frozen samples from thermal variables in the room containing
the robot 103. It is contemplated that the enclosure 105 can be
omitted from the system, such as if the circumstances permit
operation without any enclosure or the system is to be placed in
a separate fume or biological hood or other device that

   WO 2012/074771                                       PCT/US2011/061214
                                      15
sufficiently addresses any concerns about release of materials
from the samples into the environment.
       [0048]    Referring to Figs. 2 and 3, the robot 103 includes a
high-precision automated positioning system 121 adapted to move
multiple sample-containing and aliquot-receiving containers C
 (e.g., vials) between temporary storage locations 123 and a
sample-coring station 125 or aliquot receiving station 127,
respectively. The high precision positioning system 121
facilitates obtaining aliquots in the form of frozen sample
cores from precise locations within the sample containers. For
example, the positioning system 121 is suitably capable of
maintaining actual positioning that is within a few thousandths
of an inch     (e.g., about 4 thousandths of an inch) of targeted
positioning, while conducting operations in a cold environment
adapted to minimize undesirable thermally-induced changes to
frozen biological samples. This can facilitate taking the frozen
sample cores from locations that are selected to optimize the
quality of the aliquot       (e.g., as will be described in greater
detail later) and/or maximizing the number of aliquots that can
be taken from a single sample container. Although the ability to
maintain precise positioning can be advantageous, it is not
necessary within the broad scope of the invention.
       [0049]    Although it   is possible to use an x,  y, z,  Cartesian
coordinate positioning system within the broad scope of the
invention, the positioning system 121 in the illustrated
embodiment is a 0, 0',       z positioning system. The positioning
system 121 suitably includes one or more moveable platforms 131
for supporting the containers and a robotic arm 129         (the details
of which will be described later) adapted to pick up samples off
the platform(s),      move the samples relative to the platform(s),
and then place the samples down at a different position relative
to the platform(s). As illustrated in Figs. 3-6, for example,
the positioning system 121 includes two rotatably-mounted

   WO 2012/074771                                            PCT/US2011/061214
                                       16
platforms 131       (e.g., turntables) that    support the containers c
and a servo-controlled drive system 161 adapted to control
movement of the turntables. The turntables            131  suitably support
a plurality of receptacles 133 in which the containers C can be
received to hold the containers at fixed positions relative to
the respective turntable. The sample coring station 125 is
suitably a receptacle 133 at the center of one of the turntables
131 and the aliquot receiving station 127            is suitably a
receptacle at the center of the other turntable.
       [0050]     In the  illustrated embodiment, the turntables            131
are adapted to support a plurality of removable trays                  135, each
of which is capable of supporting a plurality of containers C.
For example, the upper surfaces of the turntables 131 may
include recesses       137 configured to receive the trays           135 and
hold them in position on the turntables. Each receptacle 133 in
the illustrated embodiment is defined by an upright peripheral
 (e.g., cylindrical) sidewall supported by one of the trays                  135.
For example, open-ended cylindrical sleeves            139 can be inserted
into wells     141 on the upper surfaces of the trays 135              to form
the receptacles 133. Similar sleeves         139 are inserted into wells
143 at the center of the turntables         131 to form receptacles 133
at the   sample coring and aliquot receiving stations 125,                127.
The sleeves     139 are suitably made of a solid thermally
conductive material such as metal and have a relatively high
thermal mass so frozen samples or frozen aliquots inside the
sleeves are thermally protected by the sleeve.
       [0051]    Another embodiment    of a tray    135'  is  illustrated       in
Fig. 20.    This tray 135'     is a one-piece tray or tray insert in
which relatively deep receptacles 133'           are formed in a solid
one-piece body 137'       so the body extends up along the sides of a
sample to provide thermal protection         for the sample when the
sample   is received in one of the receptacles.

   WO 2012/074771                                      PCT/US2011/061214
                                     17
      [0052]      The removable trays 135, 135' facilitate loading
and unloading containers from the turntables 131 because an
entire tray and the containers thereon can be loaded or unloaded
together in a single step. Although the receptacles 133, 133' in
the illustrated embodiment are circular in shape, it is
understood the receptacles could have other shapes including
polygonal shapes      (e.g., square, hexagonal, etc.)  within the
scope of the invention. It is also understood that there are
various other ways to adapt a platform for supporting a
plurality of containers without using any trays or receptacles
within the broad scope of the invention.
      [0053]     The drive system 161 for the turntables 131 suitably
includes a single precision motion control device 163
 (e.g.,servo-motor) adapted to control movement of both
turntables 131. As used herein the term "precision motion
control device" refers to a mechanical drive system adapted to
track a drive output, such as position or velocity, and ensure
that a desired drive output is attained. Precision motion
control devices include servo-motors and servo-mechanisms, which
refer to motors or drive mechanisms having control systems that
use feedback to provide precise control       (e.g., positional
control) of the motor/mechanism and/or one or more structures
driven by the device. For example, servo-motors and servo
mechanisms can include control systems that use feedback from
one or more position-indicating sensors       (not shown) to achieve
precise control of the output. The term precision motion control
also includes stepper motors, which have motor control systems
that track output of the motor by counting the number of steps
through which the rotor has been rotated.
      [0054]     One feature of the system 101 is that it uses a
relatively low number of precision motion control devices to
perform a large number of varied tasks, as will be described
below. Because precision motion control devices are relatively

   WO 2012/074771                                         PCT/US2011/061214
                                      18
expensive to build or purchase and because significant
maintenance     is required to keep a precision motion control
device in good working order, the ability to limit the number of
precision motion control devices in the system 101 provides
advantages. Using a precision motion control device           (e.g., a
single  servo-mechanism 136) to control movement of both
turntables is      one aspect of this  feature of the system 101.
Others that may also be present will be described later.
      [0055]     Referring to Figs.  6-8,   the turntable drive motor
163 is mounted under the turntables        131 on a frame    181.  The
frame  181 also supports the turntables        131  in generally side-by
side relation to one another. For instance, the frame 181
suitably supports a plurality of rollers         197 positioned to
engage a radially-outward extending lip 199 on each of the
turntables     131 to support the turntables for rotation relative
to the  frame. The lip 199 is     received in a notch      (e.g., V-shaped
notch) in each of the rollers 197        so the rollers hold the
turntable lip at a fixed elevation. As         illustrated in Fig. 3,
there are three rollers 197      for each turntable     131.
      [0056]     One or more of the rollers 197 for each turntable is
suitably moveable in the radial direction and biased            (e.g., by a
spring) to move radially inward toward the center of the
turntable to ensure the rollers maintain engagement with the
turntable lip 199. As      illustrated in Fig.     7, for example, the
rollers   197 mounted on the    far left and right sides of the frame
181 are mounted on a roller support arm 202, which has a
generally upright orientation in the         illustrated embodiment. The
support arm 202 is moveable relative to the frame and biased to
move the roller radially inward. In the illustrated embodiment,
the support arm 202 is      secured to the frame 181 by a bracket 204
that allows pivoting movement of the arm about a pivot axis 206.
A spring 208 or other biasing member is positioned to bias the
support arm 202 to pivot in the direction in which the roller

   WO 2012/074771                                          PCT/US2011/061214
                                      19
moves toward the center of the turntable, as indicated by arrows
in Fig.   7. For example, the spring 208 is        suitably mounted under
the pivot axis 206 and compressed between a side of the support
arm 202 and the head of a bolt 210 or other suitable retaining
structure fixed to the frame 181.        The bolt 210    is suitably
adjustable to increase or decrease preload applied to the spring
208. Because one of the rollers 197 for each turntable can move
in the radial direction, the rollers 197 are able to accommodate
thermal expansion and/or contraction of the turntables 131,
while the bias from the preloaded spring 208 ensures the rollers
remain snuggly engaged with the turntables.
      [0057]     Referring again to Figs.    6-8,   the motor 163    is
operably connected       (e.g., by a drive shaft 167 as illustrated in
Fig. 8) to a wheel 165       so motor is operable to rotate the wheel.
The wheel 165       is adjacent the turntables    131  (e.g., generally
between the turntables)       and is operably connected to each of the
turntables     131 so rotation of the wheel by the motor 163 drives
rotation of both turntables.       For example, the wheel 165 is
suitably positioned to simultaneously engage the opposing edges
of the turntables       131 so the turntables are rotated at the same
time.
      [0058]      In particular, the wheel 165    in the illustrated
embodiment supports a plurality of rotatable pegs 169 and the
turntables     131 have teeth 171 that are enmeshed with the pegs so
the turntables are turned by the pegs. This results in the
turntables     131 being rotated in unison     (i.e.,   at the same time,
in the  same direction, and at the same speed),          but it is
understood the turntables are not required to rotate in unison
within the broad scope of the invention. The pegs 169 are
suitably substantially cylindrical in cross           sectional shape and
the spaces between the teeth 171 are        shaped so they
substantially conform to the pegs, as illustrated. The pegs 169
can be made from or include roller bearings, ball bearings, or

   WO 2012/074771                                       PCT/US2011/061214
                                     20
other bearings      (not shown) that allow the pegs/bearings to
rotate relative to the wheel 165       (e.g., on vertical axes when
oriented as illustrated) while engaged with either of the
turntables 131. The wheel 165 and pegs 169 result in a low
friction, low-backlash, positive drive connection between the
motor 163 and the turntables 131, which facilitates very precise
positioning of the turntables and the containers C thereon by
the positioning system 121.
      [0059]     The system 101 includes   a temperature control system
151  (See Fig. 3) operable to maintain the frozen samples and
aliquots at a desired temperature       (e.g., at cryogenic
temperatures suitably in the range of about 0 degrees centigrade
and about -180      degrees centigrade, more suitably in the range of
about -   40 degrees centigrade and about -180      degrees centigrade,
more suitably in the range of about -40        degrees centigrade to
about -   80 degrees centigrade) while they are on the turntables
131 to limit sample degradation and protect sample and aliquot
integrity. It will usually be desirable to operate the
temperature control system 151 so the temperature is lower than
about -40    degrees centigrade. The temperature control system 151
suitably is programmed to accept input from an operator for
setting or adjusting the desired temperature.
      [0060]     As illustrated,  the temperature control system 151
includes a temperature control block 153 positioned under the
turntables 131 and an enclosure 155 partially enclosing the
temperature control block, along with the turntables 131 and the
containers thereon. The enclosure 155 includes a pair of
removable covers 159. Each of the turntables 131 is covered by
one of the covers 159. Various different temperature control
blocks can be used to control the temperature of the frozen
samples within the scope of the invention. For example, the
temperature control block 153 can include a reservoir or
passages    (not shown) for containing a cooling fluid, such as

   WO 2012/074771                                      PCT/US2011/061214
                                    21
liquid nitrogen or ethanol. By keeping the samples very cold,
the temperature control system 151 helps limit       (and ideally
prevent) melting of the frozen samples during the aliquotting
process. The temperature control system 151 also limits frost
formation on the frozen samples. It is undesirable for frost to
form on the samples because water in the frost can dilute the
sample material and thereby alter the results of any
quantitative analysis performed on the sample. Although the
temperature control system 151 in the illustrated embodiment
provides only cooling, it is contemplated that the temperature
control system may heat frozen samples within the scope of the
invention. For instance, it may be desirable in some cases to
warm the frozen samples slightly above their cryogenic storage
temperature to make the frozen samples less susceptible to
cracking or other physical damage during the aliquotting
process.
      [0061]     The temperature control block 153 is   mechanically
isolated from the turntables 131 to facilitate highly precise
positioning of the sample containers by the positioning system
121. The frame 181 supports the turntables 131 so they are
spaced slightly above the temperature control block 153.
Accordingly, there are small gaps 157 between the top of the
temperature control block 153 and the bottoms of the turntables
131, as illustrated in Figs. 11 and 12. The gaps 157 are
suitably no more than about 0.25 inches in length. In general,
heat transfer between the temperature control block 153 and the
turntables 131 is better when the gaps 157 are relatively small.
The gaps 157 are suitably in the range of about 0.0001 inches to
about 0.25 inches and more suitably in the range of about 0.001
inches to about 0.006 inches. In the illustrated embodiment, the
gaps 157 are equal in length, but this is not required within
the broad scope of the invention. Because of the gaps 157
separating the turntables 131 from the temperature control block

   WO 2012/074771                                     PCT/US2011/061214
                                     22
153, there is no physical contact between the turntables and the
temperature control block. Consequently, the turntables 131 do
not slide on, rub against, or otherwise contact the temperature
control block 153 as they move. This helps maintain the frozen
samples at the desired temperature because there is no heat from
friction between the turntables 131 and the temperature control
block 153 when the turntables move.
      [0062]     Although the frame 181 supports the temperature
control block 153, the frame is mechanically isolated from the
potential effect of thermal expansion and contraction of the
temperature control block. This further isolates the turntables
131  (and the positioning system 121 in general) from any
thermally-induced strain associated with operation of the
temperature control block 153. Referring to Fig. 3, for example,
the temperature control block 153 is supported by a plurality of
supports 183      (e.g., rectangular bars) connected to the frame 181
by flexure mounts 185. As illustrated in Fig. 12, each flexure
mount 185 includes one or more sections 187 adapted to flex
generally on an axis 189 generally perpendicular to an imaginary
line 191 extending between the connection 193 of the flexure
mount to the support 183 and the center 195 of the temperature
control block (See Fig. 6).      In particular, the flexure mounts
185 are relatively stiff except at the flexible sections 187 and
the flexible sections are resistant to bending except along the
flexure axis 189. As illustrated in Fig. 12, the flexible
sections 187 of flexure mounts include a relatively thin wall
195 or other structure constructed to have a relatively small
bending moment about the flexure axis 189 and a relatively
higher bending moment in other directions. When the flexure
mounts 185 include multiple flexible sections 187, as
illustrated, the flexure axes 189 are suitably substantially
parallel to one another. Each of the flexure mounts 185 can
easily flex at the flexible sections 187 in the directions

block 153 expands or contracts due to thermal changes to
alleviate thermal strain while the flexure mounts collectively
support the temperature control block 153 securely below the
turntables 131.
      [0063]      If desired, the temperature control system 151 can
also include one or more chillers or other cooling units           (not
shown) positioned outside the enclosure 155 surrounding the
samples to keep the temperature outside the enclosure relatively
cool to minimize the temperature difference between the interior
and exterior of the enclosure 155. For example, one or more
chillers can be used to cool the air or other gas inside the
larger enclosure 105 enclosing the robot 103. In some cases, it
may be desirable to keep the temperature outside the inner
enclosure 155 and inside the outer enclosure 105 at a
significantly higher temperature than the temperature inside the
inner enclosure. Thus, the temperature control system can be
designed to maintain a temperature outside the inner enclosure
155 but inside the outer enclosure 105 above a particular
temperature      (e.g., above freezing or at about room temperature).
This may be desirable, for instance, to avoid the need to
operate any precision motion control devices or other components
of the system at the low temperatures maintained inside the
enclosure 155.
      [0064]       As illustrated in Figs. 13 and 14, the robot arm
129 is mounted on the frame 181       (e.g., at a location outside the
inner enclosure 155) for pivoting movement about a vertical axis
201 as indicated by arrows 0. Rotation of the robot arm 129 on
this axis 201 is suitably driven by a precision motion control
device. As illustrated, for example, a servo-controlled rotary
stage 203 mounted on the frame 181 is adapted to drive rotation
of the arm 129 on axis 201. Movement of the robot arm 129 in the
vertical Z direction is suitably driven by a precision motion

   WO 2012/074771                                           PCT/US2011/061214
                                      24
control device. For example, movement of the robot arm is
suitably driven by a servo-controlled linear stage 207 mounted
on a support 211 driven by the rotary stage 203. The rotary
stage 203 and linear stage 207 are part of the positioning
system 121. Accordingly, in the illustrated embodiment the
positioning system 121 has no more than three precision motion
control devices      (e.g., exactly three precision motion control
devices).
      [0065]     The robot arm 129 suitably includes a sample coring
device adapted to take frozen sample cores from the frozen
samples by being moved into the frozen samples and then
withdrawn from the frozen samples. For example, the robot arm
129 in the illustrated embodiment includes a downward extending
hollow coring bit 215       (Fig. 19) and a motor 221      (Figs. 14 and
15) operable to rotate the coring bit. For example, the motor
221 is suitably connected to a rotatable spindle assembly 317
holding the coring bit 215 by a belt           (Fig. 15). Although the
robot arm 129 in the illustrated embodiment is adapted to rotate
the coring bit 215, it is understood there are other ways to
operate a drill assembly to obtain a frozen sample core within
the broad scope of the invention, including the methods
disclosed in U.S. pre-grant publication No. 20090019877.
      [0066]     The motor 221 in   the illustrated     embodiment    is
suitably a precision motion control device           (e.g., servo-motor)
adapted to drive rotation of the coring bit 215. The servo
controlled motor 221,      suitably provides very precise control
over the speed and torque at which the coring bit is rotated.
The ability to control the speed and torque facilitates
operation of the coring bit 215 according to various different
modes that can be selected to account for the physical
characteristics of various types of frozen samples, as will be
described in more detail below. Although the coring bit 215 in
the embodiment illustrated in the drawings is driven by a

   WO 2012/074771                                      PCT/US2011/061214
                                      25
precision motion control device 221, this device is not
considered part of the positioning system 121 because it only
rotates the coring bit and is not involved in moving the
containers C or robot arm 129. In the illustrated embodiment,
the entire system 101 includes no more than four        (e.g., exactly
four) precision motion control devices.
      [0067]     The robot arm 129 has a pair of gripping mechanisms
251 on opposite sides of the arm. Each gripping mechanism has a
gripping arm 253 pivotally mounted on the robot arm 129 and
moveable    (e.g., by a pneumatic actuator 253) between a retracted
position    (shown in solid in Fig. 13) and an extended position
 (shown in phantom in Fig. 13).      The arm 253 has one or more
movable fingers 257 at its free end. The fingers 257 are
selectively moveable       (e.g., by another pneumatic actuator 259)
between a hold position in which the fingers are relatively
closer to one another and a release position in which the
fingers are relatively farther from one another. When the arm
253 is in the extended position, the fingers 257 can be moved to
selectively grip or release containers C containing frozen
samples or frozen aliquots. For example, the gripping mechanisms
251 can be adapted to grip a cap 261 on the top of a container.
      [0068]     The cap 261 is suitably a threaded cap that can be
secured to the container C by screwing the cap onto the top of
the container. Thus, when the cap 261 is secured to the
container C, the gripping mechanism 251 can pick up the entire
container by gripping the cap. The system 101 is also adapted to
remove the cap 261 from the container C while it is at the
sample coring station 125 or aliquot receiving station 127
without picking up the container. For example, as illustrated in
Figs.  10, 10A, 11,     11A, 21, and 22 the system 101 includes a
pair of clamping mechanisms 271, each of which is adapted to
selectively hold a container C at a respective one of the sample
coring and aliquot receiving stations 125, 127 in a fixed

   WO 2012/074771                                        PCT/US2011/061214
                                     26
position relative to the respective turntable 131 and release
the container to permit the container to be moved relative to
the turntable.
      [0069]     The clamping mechanisms 271 each include a rod 273
extending radially inward toward the sample coring or aliquot
receiving station 125, 127 from a toggle mechanism 275           (e.g.,
mechanical toggle switch) on the perimeter of the respective
turntable 131. When the toggle mechanism 275 is in a first
position    (FIGS. 10, 10A, and 22),    the rod 273 extends into the
receptacle 133 and clamps the container C in position relative
to the turntable 131. When the toggle mechanism 275 is in a
second position      (Figs. 11, 11A, and 21)  the rod 273 does not
extend as far toward the center of the turntable 131 as it does
in the first position and the rod does not clamp the container C
in position. When the container C is not clamped in position by
the clamping system 271, the container can easily be rotated
relative to the turntable and/or picked up from the turntable
131  (e.g., by the robot arm 129).
      [0070]     The frame 181 supports a pair of clamping mechanism
actuators 277      (e.g., pneumatic actuators) positioned on the
periphery of the turntables. The actuators 277 can be extended
radially inward to move the toggle mechanism 275 between the
first and second positions when the turntable is in an
orientation such that the portion of the toggle mechanism to be
pushed by the actuator to accomplish the desired movement of the
toggle mechanism is aligned with the actuator         (see alignment of
left turntable 131 to actuator 277 in Fig. 8).         The toggle
mechanisms 275 are each pushed at one location 279a          (Figs. 21
and 22) to clamp the container C and another location 279b to
release the container. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, each
turntable 131 is at a first orientation        (e.g., as illustrated
Fig. 8) when the respective actuator 277 is activated to clamp a
container and a second orientation different from the first

   WO 2012/074771                                     PCT/US2011/061214
                                     27
 (e.g. rotated slightly counterclockwise from the position
illustrated in Fig. 8) when the actuator is activated to release
the container.
      [0071]     The robot arm 129 also includes a plunger 231
adapted to eject frozen sample cores from the coring bit 215. As
illustrated in Figs. 14-16B, the plunger 231 is suitably mounted
above the coring bit 215 and connected to a pneumatic actuator
235 adapted to drive movement of the plunger up and down within
the robot arm 129. The plunger 231 is normally in a retracted
position    (Fig. 16A),   in which the bottom of the plunger is
spaced above the top of the coring bit 215. After a frozen
sample core 241 has been taken from one of the frozen samples,
the pneumatic actuator 235 drives the plunger 231 downwardly to
an extended position      (Fig. 16B) to eject the frozen sample core
241 from the hollow coring bit 215 into an aliquot receiving
container C.
      [0072]     The enclosure 155 for the frozen samples confines
the coldest temperatures in the system 101 to relatively small
space surrounding the samples. Significantly, the majority of
the robot arm 129 remains outside the enclosure 155 even when
the robot arm is inserted into the enclosure to drill into a
frozen sample or move sample containers. For example, the motors
203, 207 for moving the robot arm 129 and the motor 221 for
driving the coring bit 215 are outside the enclosure 155 in an
environment that can be warmer than the environment inside the
enclosure without degrading frozen samples. The motor 163 for
the turntables 131 is also outside the enclosure. Because the
motors 203, 207, 221, and 163 are outside the enclosure 155,
they do not need to operate at the lower temperatures existing
within the enclosure. For example, the motors 203, 207, 221, and
163 can operate at temperatures above freezing, more suitably at
temperatures above about 10 degrees centigrade, and still more
suitably at temperatures above about 20 degrees centigrade.

   WO 2012/074771                                      PCT/US2011/061214
                                     28
      [0073]     The rollers 197 also are positioned at an outer
margin of the enclosure 155. For example, in the illustrated
embodiment, the rollers 197 are spaced radially-outward of the
temperature control block 153 where the temperature can be
warmer than it is in the immediate vicinity of the temperature
control block. As illustrated, the rollers 197 are positioned
between the turntable and the enclosure 155. Accordingly, the
moving parts of the turntable drive system 161 are positioned at
the outer margin of the enclosure 155 or outside the enclosure.
Accordingly, the rollers 197 and the rest of the turntable drive
system 161 can operate at the warmer temperatures existing
outside the enclosure 155 or at the margin of the enclosure
instead of at the lower temperatures that may exist in the
immediate vicinity of the temperature control block 153 and the
frozen samples.
      [0074]     Referring to Figs. 17A-17F, the system 101 includes
a cleaning system 281 operable to automatically clean and dry
the inside and outside of the coring bit 215 and also clean and
dry the lower end of the plunger 231. The cleaning system 281
includes a cleaning station 283 supported by the frame 181.            The
cleaning station 283 includes a housing 285 having an internal
chamber 287 and an opening 289 for inserting the coring bit 215
into the chamber. A drain 291 is installed at the bottom of the
chamber 287 and connected to a drain line 293 for draining
fluids from the chamber. The housing 285 also has an inlet 295
for receiving one or more cleaning fluids       (e.g., a cleaning
solution and a rinsing fluid) from a cleaning fluid supply line
297 connected to the housing at the inlet. The cleaning station
238 can optionally include a vibrator      (e.g., acoustic or
ultrasonic vibrator)      (not shown) positioned to agitate cleaning
fluid while it is in contact with the coring bit 215 to help
dislodge sample materials from the coring bit. For example, the

   WO 2012/074771                                     PCT/US2011/061214
                                    29
vibrator can be used to help dislodge proteins or other sticky
substances from the coring bit 215.
       [0075]    The cleaning system 281 also includes a plunger
cleaning sub-system 301 on the robot arm 129. The plunger
cleaning sub-system 301 includes a plunger seal tube 303
positioned above the motor housing 305. The plunger 231 extends
through a hollow center 307 of the plunger seal tube 303. The
plunger seal tube 303 has a fluid inlet 311 for receiving one or
more cleaning fluids into its hollow center 307 from a fluid
supply line 313 connected to the fluid inlet. A sealing member
309  (e.g., an 0-ring) at the top of the plunger seal tube 303
seals against the plunger 231 and limits fluid from flow from
the hollow center 307 of the plunger seal tube 303 out the
plunger seal tube through its top. The plunger seal tube 303 is
selectively moveable by an actuator 315      (e.g., a pneumatic
actuator) between a position in which the plunger seal tube is
spaced slightly above a rotating spindle assembly 317        (Fig. 17C)
that holds the coring bit 215 and a position in which the bottom
of the plunger seal tube contacts the spindle assembly        (Fig.
17D).
       [0076]    The spindle assembly 317 has a hollow central
portion 321 extending from the top of the spindle assembly to
the coring bit 215 that is in fluid communication with the
hollow center of the coring bit. When the plunger seal tube 303
is moved into contact with the spindle assembly 317, the hollow
center 307 of the plunger seal tube is in fluid communication
 (e.g., aligned with) the hollow central portion 321 of the
spindle assembly 317 so fluid in the plunger seal tube can flow
down into the spindle assembly and out through the hollow center
of the coring bit 215. A sealing member 325      (e.g., an 0-ring)
forms a seal between the plunger seal tube 303 and the spindle
assembly 317 when the plunger seal tube is in contact with the
spindle assembly, to limit flow of fluid out of the plunger seal

   WO 2012/074771                                       PCT/US2011/061214
                                     30
tube except through the spindle assembly. When the plunger seal
tube 303 is     in the position in which it does not contact the
spindle assembly 317, the spindle assembly can rotate with the
coring bit 215 without subjecting the sealing member 325 to any
sliding or rubbing.
      [0077]     To use the cleaning system 281,   the robot arm 129
moves the coring bit 215 into alignment with the opening 289 in
the top of the cleaning station 283       (see Fig.  17A and 17C).      Then
the robot arm 129 moves the coring bit 215 down so the lower end
of the bit extends into the chamber 287       (see Figs.  17B and 17D).
In this position, the bottom of the spindle assembly 317           forms a
seal against the housing 285 of the cleaning station. The
plunger seal tube actuator      315 moves the plunger seal tube 303
down into contact with the upper portion of the spindle assembly
317  so the sealing member 325 forms a seal between the plunger
seal tube and spindle assembly, as illustrated in Fig. 17D.
      [0078]     To clean the outside of the coring bit 215,      cleaning
fluid is pumped from a cleaning fluid supply        (not shown) through
the inlet 295 to inject cleaning fluid into the chamber 287
where it contacts the bit. After contacting the outside of the
bit 215,    the cleaning fluid exits the chamber through the drain
291.  To clean the plunger 231 and inside of the coring bit 215,
cleaning fluid is pumped from the same or a different cleaning
fluid supply into the robot arm 129 through the plunger seal
tube inlet 311      to inject cleaning fluid into the hollow center
307  of the plunger seal tube 303 where it contacts the plunger
231.  The cleaning fluid flows from the plunger seal tube          303
into the hollow center 321 of the spindle assembly moving down
along the plunger 231,      cleaning it as it goes. The cleaning
fluid then flows down through the hollow center of the coring
bit 215 to clean the inside of the bit. After flowing out of the
coring bit 215 into the chamber 287 of the cleaning station, the
cleaning fluid is drained through the drain 291.        The cleaning

   WO 2012/074771                                              PCT/US2011/061214
                                      31
fluid is    suitably alternately pumped to the cleaning station 283
to clean the outside of the coring bit 215 and then pumped to
the robot arm 129 to clean the plunger 231 and inside of the bit
215.  However, if desired cleaning fluid can be pumped to the
cleaning station 283 and robot arm 129 concurrently within the
scope of the invention. At any time during cleaning, the
optional vibrator can be activated to agitate the cleaning fluid
to help clean the coring bit 215.        In some cases,        the cleaning
fluid may be clean water or another fluid that does not need to
be rinsed off the coring bit 215 or plunger 231.               If the cleaning
fluid is    something other than pure water, the cleaning fluid can
be rinsed from the coring bit 215 and plunger 2313 if desired.
       [0079]    The  cleaning system 281   optionally      dries    the coring
bit 215 after cleaning it with the cleaning fluid. A drying gas
 (e.g., air, nitrogen, or other suitable gas) is             suitably pumped
from a drying gas       supply (not shown) through the same fluid
lines as the cleaning to inject drying gas             into the chamber of
the cleaning station and into the hollow center of the plunger
seal tube to dry the inside and outside of the coring bit. When
the sample is      to be subjected to quantitative analysis it is
important to dry the coring bit 215 after cleaning to prevent
dilution of the frozen samples with the cleaning fluid. It is
understood, however, the cleaning system is not required to dry
the coring bit within the broad scope of the invention.
       [0080]    The system 101 includes a sample inspection system
341  adapted to detect one or more locations within a frozen
sample   from which a frozen sample core has already been taken.
The sample inspection system can include any of a variety of
sensors that can be adapted to detect holes in the sample from
which frozen cores have already been taken. Suitable sensors and
sensor systems that can be used in the sample inspection system
341  include an image analysis system, a vision inspection
system, a con-focal imaging system, an optical profilometer, a

   WO 2012/074771                                      PCT/US2011/061214
                                     32
time-of-flight distance sensor, an angle of incidence/reflection
triangulation based distance sensor, and digital camera, and the
like. The foregoing sensors and sensor systems can also be used
in any combination to increase robustness of the sample
inspection system.
       [0081]    For instance, one embodiment of a sample inspection
system suitably includes a precision triangulation-based optical
range finder 341 mounted on the robot arm 129. The range finder
341 is operable to direct a beam 342 of electromagnet radiation
 (e.g., an infrared laser beam) onto the upper surface of a
frozen sample at the sample coring station 125       (see Fig. 18A).
The range finder 341 also includes a detection system 340 to
detect electromagnetic radiation 344 reflected from the surface
of the sample and determine the spacing between the location 346
where the beam is emitted and the location 348 on the detector
340 where the reflected beam 344 is received by the detector. By
rotating the container C      (e.g., using the turntable 131) and/or
moving the robot arm 129, the entire upper surface of the frozen
sample can be scanned by the beam to identify any locations
where frozen sample cores have already been taken. For example,
Fig. 18B is a graph illustrating how output from the range
finder 341 varies as the beam is scanned over the surface of a
sample having four frozen sample core holes arranged in a ring
at a radius r from the center of the sample by rotating the
container C while the robot arm 129 is positioned so the beam is
directed onto the sample at location spaced the same distance r
from the center as the sample core holes. When the beam scans
over a hole, the spacing between the beam emitter and the
location where the reflected beam is received changes         (as
illustrated by the arrows in Fig. 18A).      There is a dramatic jump
in the output from the range finder when the beam crosses the
edge of a hole, allowing the system to determine the presence of
a hole.

      [0082]     Although the triangulation-based optical range
finder works well in some cases, the        inventors have discovered
it does not work well when the physical characteristics of the
sample cause it to reflect light in a diffuse manner. Some serum
and plasma samples,      for example, have characteristics that
result in diffuse reflections. When the reflection is diffuse              it
is difficult or impossible to set the instrument settings so the
signal  from the sensor can be used to reliably detect any holes
in a potentially-cored sample surface. Thus, the sample
inspection system desirably includes a sensor that is          operable
to determine whether or not a potentially-cored surface of the
sample has been cored at a particular location regardless of
whether or not the sample reflects light in a diffuse manner.
      [0083]     Another embodiment   of the sample  inspection    system
includes    a time-of-flight based precision range finder 341'
 (Fig. 18D) The time-of-flight distance sensor comprises a source
of electromagnetic radiation adapted to emit a pulsed beam 342'
of electromagnetic radiation       (e.g., an infrared laser) onto a
surface of the sample and a detector 340' adapted to detect
radiation reflected by the      surface of the   sample. The sensor
341'  includes or is connected to a processor adapted to output a
signal  indicative of a difference in time between the time a
pulse in the beam 342'      is emitted and the time the detector
detects the corresponding pulse        in the reflected beam 344'.       This
time will increase slightly as the beam is        scanned over a hole
in the  surface of the     sample, allowing output from the sensor to
be used to identify the location of any holes in the surface of
the sample.
      [0084]     Although the time-of-flight sensor described above
uses electromagnetic radiation, it is recognized an analogous
acoustic based sensor that emits pulsed acoustic signals and
detects echoes from the sample surface could be used in a
similar manner within the scope of the invention.

      [0085]      In another embodiment of the system 101, the sample
inspection system includes an imaging system (e.g., digital
camera not shown) and processor that processes the image to
determine if any cores have been taken from a sample. For
example, various light/dark contrast algorithms can be used to
analyze a complete image of the sample and identify the
locations of any holes in the sample surface.
      [0086]      In still another embodiment of the system 101, the
sample inspection system includes a processor programmed to
analyze a smaller image of only a portion of the sample surface
 (or only a portion of a larger image of the entire surface) to
make a binary decision       (yes/no) about whether there are any
holes in the sample that would prevent successful coring of the
sample at that particular location. If there are no holes in the
area immediate surrounding the potential drilling location, the
sample inspection system allows the system to drill at that
location. On the other hand, if the sample inspection system
detects a hole in the vicinity of the potential drilling
location, the robot arm and/or container are moved to assess
whether or not a different location is suitable for being the
location from which a frozen core is taken for use as an
aliquot. The simpler yes/no algorithm is much easier to
implement and eliminates the need for more elaborate image
processing technology required to simultaneously identify the
presence and locations of all holes that may exist in a sample.
      [0087]     The system 101 optionally includes a bar code reader
351  (e.g., mounted on the frame 181 as illustrated in Fig. 2)
for reading bar code labels that may be applied to the
containers C to ensure and verify the aliquots are taken from
the correct container and placed in the correct container. It is
understood a bar code reader could be positioned elsewhere on
the system within the scope of the invention.

                                      35
      [0088]     To further illustrate the various features of the
system 101, one embodiment of a method of using the system to
obtain one or more frozen aliquots from frozen samples by taking
frozen sample cores will now be described. It is understood that
the system 101 can be used in different ways without departing
from the scope of the invention.
      [0089]     To start  the process,  a plurality of capped
containers C containing frozen samples from which one or more
aliquots are desired are placed in trays 135 and loaded on one
of the turntables 131       (e.g., adjacent the sample coring station
125).  A plurality of empty capped containers C for receiving the
aliquots are placed in other trays 135 and loaded on one of the
turntables 131      (e.g., adjacent the aliquot receiving station
127).  For example, all of the frozen sample containers C can
suitably be placed on one turntable 131 while all of the aliquot
receiving containers are placed on the other turntable. However,
it is understood that this is not required to practice the
invention.
      [0090]     After the containers C are loaded on the system 101
the robot 103 begins taking the aliquots. The robot arm 129
moves into a position so one of the gripping mechanisms 251 is
above a container C containing a frozen sample. The actuator 255
is activated to move the gripping arm 253 to the extended
position. Then the robot arm is lowered until the fingers 257 of
the gripping mechanism 251 are adjacent the sides of the cap
261. The finger actuator 259 is activated to move the fingers
257 into contact with opposing sides of the cap to grip the cap.
The robot arm 129 is raised to lift the container C, moved to a
position so the container is above the sample coring station
125, and then lowered to place the container on the sample
coring station.
      [0091]     Once the container C is   received in the receptacle
133 at the sample coring station 125, the turntables 131 are

   WO 2012/074771                                     PCT/US2011/061214
                                    36
rotated to align the toggle mechanism actuator 277 with the
clamp button 279a on the toggle mechanism 275. The toggle
mechanism actuator 277 is extended to push the clamp button 279a
on the toggle mechanism and thereby clamp the container at the
sample coring station to hold it in a fixed position relative to
the turntable 131. While the container C is clamped and the
gripping mechanism 251 is still holding the cap, the turntables
131 are rotated to unscrew the cap 261 from the container. The
robot arm 129 can be raised as the cap is being unscrewed so the
gripping mechanism 251 does not press down on the cap 261 while
it is being unscrewed. After the cap 261 is unscrewed, the robot
arm 129 is raised further and the gripping arm 253 is retracted
by the actuator 255 while still holding the cap.
      [0092]     The process is repeated using the other gripping
mechanism to move the aliquot receiving container to the aliquot
receiving station 127 on the other turntable 131. At this point,
the sample container C is uncapped and clamped in position at
the sample coring station 125 and the aliquot receiving
container is uncapped and clamped at the aliquot receiving
station 127. The caps 261 for the containers are retained by the
retracted gripping mechanism.
      [0093]     The sample inspection device 241 is used to inspect
the upper surface of the frozen sample in the container C at the
sample coring station 125 to determine whether any previous
frozen sample cores have been taken from the frozen sample. If
frozen sample cores have already been taken from the frozen
sample, the sample inspection device 341 also determines the
locations within the sample from which the frozen cores have
been taken, and by a process of elimination identifies one or
more positions from which another frozen core can be taken.
      [0094]     The robot arm 129 moves the coring bit into position
above the sample container at the sample coring station 125. In
particular, the robot arm 129 moves the bit into a position

   WO 2012/074771                                      PCT/US2011/061214
                                      37
above a portion of the sample from which no frozen samples cores
have been taken yet. In one example, the location from which the
frozen sample core is to be taken is selected to be at a radial
position where the concentration of at least one substance of
interest in the frozen sample core is representative of the
overall concentration of said at least one substance of interest
in the sample notwithstanding any concentration gradients that
may exist in the frozen sample.
      [0095]     The present inventors have recognized that radial
concentration gradients can develop in a biological sample as it
is being frozen. In order to ensure the concentration of the
substance of interest in the aliquot is representative of the
concentration of that substance in the original unfrozen sample,
it may be necessary to take the frozen sample core from a
position that is radially offset from the center axis of the
sample. The position at which the local concentration in the
frozen sample is representative of the overall concentration can
vary depending on the characteristics of the sample and the
substance of interest and can be determined experimentally for
any particular type of sample and substance of interest.
      [0096]      It is also recognized that two or more frozen sample
cores can be taken from different radial positions in the sample
that are selected so an aggregate aliquot formed by combining
the multiple frozen sample cores has a concentration of a
substance of interest that is representative of the
concentration of that substance in the original unfrozen sample.
For example, a first frozen sample core can be taken from
position at which the local concentration of the substance of
interest is known to be too high to be representative of the
overall sample and a second frozen sample core can be taken from
a position at which the local concentration of the substance of
interest is too low to be representative of the overall sample.
However, the positions from which the first and second sample

   WO 2012/074771                                        PCT/US2011/061214
                                      38
cores are taken can be selected so when the first and second
sample cores are combined in a single aggregate aliquot the
concentration of the substance of interest in the aggregate
aliquot is representative of the overall concentration of the
substance of interest in the original sample.
       [0097]    The high-precision positioning system 121
facilitates taking the frozen sample core         from the desired
location with a high degree of accuracy. This capability can be
important when the aliquots are to be used in quantitative tests
 (i.e., tests     in which the concentration or relative
concentration of one or more substances is needed).          Those
skilled in the art will recognize that for some tests,           it is
only necessary to know whether or not a particular substance is
present and the precise concentration at which it is present is
not that important. Accordingly, it is not necessary to take the
frozen sample core from any particular position within the
sample within the broad scope of the        invention.
       [0098]    The  coring bit  motor 221 turns the coring bit      215 as
the robot arm 129 is lowered to move the tip of coring bit 215
from the upper surface of the sample down into the frozen
sample.   In one embodiment of the method, the coring bit 215 is
lowered substantially all the way to the bottom of the container
C to obtain a frozen sample core extending substantially all the
way through the vertical height of the sample at the location
from which the frozen sample core is taken. This can be
desirable to account for any vertical concentration gradients
that may exist in the       sample.
       [0099]    Once the drilling process is    complete, the motor 221
is deactivated to stop rotation of the coring bit 215.           Then the
robot arm 129 is raised to lift the coring bit and the frozen
sample core contained therein out of the sample container. The
robot arm 129 is then moved to position the coring bit 125             and
the frozen sample core contained therein to a position above the

   WO 2012/074771                                        PCT/US2011/061214
                                    39
aliquot receiving container at the aliquot receiving station
127. The plunger actuator 235 is activated to eject the sample
core from the coring bit 215 into the aliquot receiving
container.
      [00100] Once the frozen sample core      is  in the aliquot
receiving container, the robot 103 screws the caps 261 back onto
the sample container and the aliquot receiving container using
the gripping mechanisms 251 to hold the caps stationary while
the turntables 131    are rotated to rotate the clamped containers.
The robot arm 129 may move down during the process of screwing
the cap 261 back on the containers to track downward movement of
the cap as it is   screwed on the container. After the caps 261
are back on the containers, the turntables        131 are rotated to
align the toggle mechanism actuator 277 with the release buttons
279b on the toggle mechanisms 275.       The actuators 277 are
extended to press the release buttons 279b and unclamp the
containers C so they can be removed from the sample coring and
aliquot receiving stations 125,      127.  Then the robot arm 129 is
moved to position the gripping mechanisms 251 over the
containers C to pick them up and move them back to the temporary
storage positions 123 on the turntables.        In this embodiment of
the method, the containers C are only uncapped at the sample
coring station 125    or aliquot receiving station 127.       The
containers C are always capped when they are at any of the
storage positions 123.
      [00101] If  more than one aliquot     is needed from the same
sample, the process is    substantially the same except the robot
103 leaves the sample container C at the sample coring station
125 while it removes the first aliquot receiving container from
the aliquot receiving station 127       and replaces   it with another
aliquot receiving container. Then the robot 103 obtains another
frozen sample core from the sample and places it in the second
aliquot receiving container. This process can be repeated to

   WO 2012/074771                                      PCT/US2011/061214
                                     40
obtain three, four or more aliquots from a single sample during
one aliquotting session, as long as there is sufficient sample
material for the aliquots. It is also possible to place multiple
frozen sample cores into a single aliquot receiving container
 (e.g., to obtain a larger volume of sample material) within the
scope of the invention.
       [00102] The cleaning system 281 is    then used to clean the
coring bit 215 and plunger 231 in the manner described above.
After cleaning, the process can be repeated with a different
sample. After all the aliquots to be taken from the samples
loaded on the system 101 have been taken, the trays 135 are
removed from the turntables. The still frozen samples are
returned to the cryogenic storage so they will be available in
the future if there is a desire to obtain another aliquot for
use in a different test. The aliquots are taken from the system
101 and delivered to customers of the biobank or biorepository
for testing.
       [00103] It    will be appreciated from the foregoing that the
system 101 is able to accomplish one or more       (e.g., all) of the
following tasks using only three precision motion control
devices    (the servo-controlled turntable motor 161, the servo
controlled rotary stage 203 for moving the robot arm 129 in the
o direction,      and the servo-controlled linear stage 207 for
moving the robot arm in the z-direction) to control positioning
of the relevant structures:
          (a)    move a container from a temporary storage location
                 123 to a sample coring station 125;
          (b)    move another container from the temporary storage
                 location to an aliquot receiving station 127 spaced
                 from the sample coring station;
          (c)    activate and release clamping mechanisms 271 to hold
                 and release the containers in fixed positions at the
                 sample coring and aliquot receiving stations;

                                    41
          (d)    remove threaded caps from the containers;
          (e)    scan the beam from the sample inspection device 341
                 across the upper surface of the frozen sample to
                 locate any positions in the sample from which sample
                 cores have already been taken;
          (f)    move a sample coring device  (e.g., coring bit 215)
                 into the sample container to obtain a frozen sample
                 core from a location that has not been previously
                 cored;
          (g)    transfer the frozen sample core to the aliquot
                 receiving container at the aliquot receiving
                 station;
          (h)    screw the threaded caps back onto the containers;
          (i)    move the containers back from the sample coring and
                 aliquot receiving stations to the temporary storage
                 location; and
          (j)    move the sample coring device to a cleaning station.
      [00104] Another feature of the system 101 is the processor
is suitably adapted to accept input from a user and operate the
system in one of multiple different modes selected by the user
For example, the processor is suitably programmed and/or
hardwired to operate in various modes differing from one another
in one of more of the following parameters:
          (a)    a speed at which the robot 103 moves the coring bit
                 215 axially into the frozen samples to obtain the
                 sample cores;
          (b)    a force with which the robot 103 moves the coring
                 bit 215 axially into the frozen samples to obtain
                 the sample cores;
          (c)    a speed at which the robot 103 rotates the coring
                 bit 215 to obtain the sample cores;
          (d)    a torque applied to the coring bit to obtain the
                 sample cores;

   WO 2012/074771                                     PCT/US2011/061214
                                    42
          (e)    an amount of an impact force applied to the coring
                 bit 215 as it is moved axially into the frozen
                 samples to obtain the sample cores;
          (f)    a position within each of the respective samples
                 from which the frozen sample cores are taken;
          (g)    a depth to which the sample coring device is moved
                 into the frozen sample; and
          (h)    a size or shape of a drill bit used by the sample
                 coring device to take the frozen sample core.
      [00105] The ability to operate in different modes allows
users the flexibility to select a mode designed to facilitate
taking frozen sample cores from the frozen samples while
limiting the risk and/or extent of physical damage to the sample
resulting from the coring process. The variables listed above
for the modes can influence the propensity of the frozen sample
to crack or otherwise break, be heated by friction, partially
melt, or experience other effects that degrade the sample and/or
limit the number of frozen sample cores that can be taken from a
particular frozen sample. The optimal settings for the variables
identified above can vary depending on the characteristics of
the frozen sample, the characteristics of the container, the
temperature of the frozen samples, and other variables. For
example, one mode of operation can be adapted to facilitate
taking aliquots from frozen serum sample cores without cracking
or otherwise damaging the frozen serum samples and another mode
can be adapted to facilitate taking frozen sample cores from
frozen plasma samples without cracking or otherwise damaging the
frozen plasma samples.
