         QUATERNARY AMMONIUM COMPOUNDS AS FUEL OR LUBRICANT ADDITIVES
   The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent application number
   2014294792, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The present
   invention relates to novel quaternary ammonium compounds, to compositions comprising such
 5 compounds and to methods and uses relating thereto.
   In particular the present invention relates to the use of quaternary ammonium compounds as
   fuel or lubricant additives, especially as fuel additives, for example diesel fuel additives or
   gasoline fuel additives.
10
   It is common to include nitrogen-containing detergent compounds in lubricating oil and fuel oil
   compositions in order to improve the performance of engines using such compositions. The
   inclusion of detergent additives prevents the fouling of moving parts of the engine. Without
   such additives fouling would cause the performance of the engine to diminish and eventually
15 cease.
   Many different types of quaternary ammonium salts are known in the art for use as detergent
   additives in fuel and lubricating oil compositions. Examples of such compounds are described
   in US4171959 and US7951211. One commonly used class of quaternary ammonium additives
20 is prepared by the reaction of a tertiary amine with an epoxide and an acid. Various acids may
   be used but typically these are small acid molecules, for example acetic acid, and the
   counterion to the quaternary ammonium cation is not considered to be of importance.
   Detergent additive compounds typically include a polar group and a hydrophobic group. The
25 hydrophobic group is typically a long chain hydrocarbyl moiety. A common feature of existing
   quaternary ammonium salt detergent additives is that the hydrophobic group is included within
   the cationic portion of the compound. The present inventors have surprisingly found that
   quaternary ammonium salts including a hydrophobic moiety in the anion can provide good
   performance as a detergent.

    As used herein, the term "hydrocarbyl" substituent or group is used in its ordinary sense, which
    is well-known to those skilled in the art. Specifically, it refers to a group having a carbon atom
    directly attached to the remainder of the molecule and having predominantly hydrocarbon
    character. Examples of hydrocarbyl groups include:

    branched, e.g., alkyl or alkenyl), alicyclic (e.g., cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl) substituents, and
    aromatic-, aliphatic-, and alicyclic-substituted aromatic substituents, as well as cyclic
    substituents wherein the ring is completed through another portion of the molecule (e.g., two
10  substituents together form a ring);
    (ii) substituted hydrocarbon groups, that is, substituents containing non-hydrocarbon groups
    (e.g., halo (especially chloro and fluoro), hydroxy, alkoxy, keto, acyl, cyano, mercapto,
    alkylmercapto, amino, alkylamino, nitro, nitroso, and sulphoxy);

    (iii) hetero substituents, that is, substituents which, while having a predominantly hydrocarbon
    character, in the context of this invention, contain other than carbon in a ring or chain
    otherwise composed of carbon atoms. Heteroatoms include sulphur, oxygen, nitrogen, and
    encompass substituents as pyridyl, furyl, thienyl and imidazolyl. In general, no more than two,

20  The quaternary ammonium salts of the present invention are useful as detergent additives for
    fuel and lubricating oil compositions. The inclusion of these additives in fuel compositions has
    been found to reduce deposits within engines in which the fuel is combusted. This may be
    achieved by preventing or reducing the formation of deposits, i.e. keeping the engine clean, or
    may aid the removal of existing deposits, i.e. cleaning up a fouled engine.
25
    The quaternary ammonium compounds of the present invention have been found to be
    particularly effective in diesel engines, especially in modern diesel engines having a high
    pressure fuel system.
30  Due to consumer demand and legislation, diesel engines have in recent years become much
    more energy efficient, show improved performance and have reduced emissions.
    These improvements        in performance     and emissions have         been brought about by
    improvements in the combustion process. To achieve the fuel atomisation necessary for this
35  improved combustion, fuel injection equipment has been developed which uses higher
    injection pressures and reduced fuel injector nozzle hole diameters. The fuel pressure at the
    injection nozzle is now commonly in excess of 1500 bar (1.5 x 108 Pa). To achieve these
    pressures the work that must be done on the fuel also increases the temperature of the fuel.
    These high pressures and temperatures can cause degradation of the fuel. Furthermore, the

  WO 2015/011506                                                               PCT/GB2014/052311
                                                     43
    timing, quantity and control of fuel injection has become increasingly precise. This precise fuel
    metering must be maintained to achieve optimal performance.
    Diesel engines having high pressure fuel systems can include but are not limited to heavy duty
 5  diesel engines and smaller passenger car type diesel engines. Heavy duty diesel engines can
    include very powerful engines such as the MTU series 4000 diesel having 20 cylinder variants
    designed primarily for ships and power generation with power output up to 4300 kW or engines
    such as the Renault dXi 7 having 6 cylinders and a power output around 240kW. A typical
    passenger car diesel engine is the Peugeot DW1 0 having 4 cylinders and power output of 100
10  kW or less depending on the variant.
    In preferred diesel engines relating to this invention, a common feature is a high pressure fuel
    system. Typically pressures in excess of 1350 bar (1.35 x 108 Pa) are used but often
    pressures of up to 2000 bar (2 x 108 Pa) or more may exist.
15
    Two non-limiting examples of such high pressure fuel systems are: the common rail injection
    system, in which the fuel is compressed utilizing a high-pressure pump that supplies it to the
    fuel injection valves through a common rail; and the unit injection system which integrates the
    high-pressure pump and fuel injection valve in one assembly, achieving the highest possible
20  injection pressures exceeding 2000 bar (2 x 108 Pa). In both systems, in pressurising the fuel,
    the fuel gets hot, often to temperatures around 100"C, or above.
    In common rail systems, the fuel is stored at high pressure in the central accumulator rail or
    separate accumulators prior to being delivered to the injectors. Often, some of the heated fuel
25  is returned to the low pressure side of the fuel system or returned to the fuel tank. In unit
    injection systems the fuel is compressed within the injector in order to generate the high
    injection pressures. This in turn increases the temperature of the fuel.
    In both systems, fuel is present in the injector body prior to injection where it is heated further
30  due to heat from the combustion chamber. The temperature of the fuel at the tip of the injector
    can be as high as 250 - 350 "C.
    Thus the fuel is stressed at pressures from 1350 bar (1.35 x 108 Pa) to over 2000 bar (2 x 108
    Pa)and temperatures from around 1000C to 3500C prior to injection, sometimes being
35  recirculated back within the fuel system thus increasing the time for which the fuel experiences
    these conditions.
    A common problem with diesel engines is fouling of the injector, particularly the injector body,
    and the injector nozzle. Fouling may also occur in the fuel filter. Injector nozzle fouling occurs

  WO 2015/011506                                                                PCT/GB2014/052311
                                                    44
    when the nozzle becomes blocked with deposits from the diesel fuel. Fouling of fuel filters
    may be related to the recirculation of fuel back to the fuel tank. Deposits increase with
    degradation of the fuel. Deposits may take the form of carbonaceous coke-like residues,
    lacquers or sticky or gum-like residues. Diesel fuels become more and more unstable the
 5  more they are heated, particularly if heated under pressure. Thus diesel engines having high
    pressure fuel systems may cause increased fuel degradation.           In recent years the need to
    reduce emissions has led to the continual redesign of injection systems to help meet lower
    targets. This has led to increasingly complex injectors and lower tolerance to deposits.
10  The problem of injector fouling may occur when using any type of diesel fuels. However, some
    fuels may be particularly prone to cause fouling or fouling may occur more quickly when these
    fuels are used. For example, fuels containing biodiesel and those containing metallic species
    may lead to increased deposits.
15  When injectors become blocked or partially blocked, the delivery of fuel is less efficient and
    there is poor mixing of the fuel with the air. Over time this leads to a loss in power of the
    engine, increased exhaust emissions and poor fuel economy.
    Deposits are known to occur in the spray channels of the injector, leading to reduced flow and
20  power loss. As the size of the injector nozzle hole is reduced, the relative impact of deposit
    build up becomes more significant. Deposits are also known to occur at the injector tip. Here,
    they affect the fuel spray pattern and cause less effective combustion and associated higher
    emissions and increased fuel consumption.
25  In addition to these "external" injector deposits in the nozzle hole and at the injector tip which
    lead to reduced flow and power loss, deposits may occur within the injector body causing
    further problems. These deposits may be referred to as internal diesel injector deposits (or
    IDIDs). IDIDs occur inside the injector on the critical moving parts. They can hinder the
    movement of these parts affecting the timing and quantity of fuel injection. Since modern
30  diesel engines operate under very precise conditions these deposits can have a significant
    impact on performance.
    IDIDs cause a number of problems, including power loss and reduced fuel economy due to
    less than optimal fuel metering and combustion. Initially the user may experience cold start
35  problems and/or rough engine running. These deposits can lead to more serious injector
    sticking. This occurs when the deposits stop parts of the injector from moving and thus the
    injector stops working. When several or all of the injectors stick the engine may fail completely.

    It is known to add nitrogen-containing detergents to diesel fuel to reduce coking. Typical
    nitrogen-containing detergents include those formed by the reaction of a polyisobutylene
    substituted succinic acid derivative with a polyalkylene polyamine. However, newer engines
    including finer injector nozzles are more sensitive and current diesel fuels may not be suitable
 5  for use with the new engines incorporating these smaller nozzle holes.
    As mentioned above, the problem of injector fouling may be more likely to occur when using
    fuel compositions comprising metal species. Various metal species may be present in fuel
    compositions.     This may be due to contamination of the fuel during manufacture, storage,
10  transport or use or due to contamination of fuel additives. Metal species may also be added to
    fuels deliberately. For example transition metals are sometimes added as fuel borne catalysts,
    for example to improve the performance of diesel particulate filters.
    The present inventors believe that problems of injector sticking occur when metal or
15  ammonium species, particularly sodium species, react with carboxylic acid species in the fuel.
    Sodium contamination of diesel fuel and the resultant formation of carboxylate salts is believed
    to be a major cause of injector sticking.
20  In preferred embodiments the diesel fuel compositions used in the present invention comprise
    sodium and/or calcium. Preferably they comprise sodium. The sodium and/or calcium is
    typically present in a total amount of from 0.01 to 50 ppm, preferably from 0.05 to 5 ppm
    preferably 0.1 to 2ppm such as 0.1 to 1 ppm.
25  Other metal-containing species may also be present as a contaminant, for example through
    the corrosion of metal and metal oxide surfaces by acidic species present in the fuel or from
    lubricating oil. In use, fuels such as diesel fuels routinely come into contact with metal surfaces
    for example, in vehicle fuelling systems, fuel tanks, fuel transportation means etc. Typically,
    metal-containing contamination may comprise transition metals such as zinc, iron and copper;
30  other group I or group II metals and other metals such as lead.
    The presence of metal containing species may give rise to fuel filter deposits and/or external
    injector deposits including injector tip deposits and/or nozzle deposits.
35  In addition to metal-containing contamination which may be present in diesel fuels there are
    circumstances where metal-containing species may deliberately be added to the fuel. For
    example, as is known in the art, metal-containing fuel-borne catalyst species may be added to
    aid with the regeneration of particulate traps. The presence of such catalysts may also give

  WO 2015/011506                                                                  PCT/GB2014/052311
                                                      46
    rise to injector deposits when the fuels are used in diesel engines having high pressure fuel
    systems.
    Metal-containing contamination, depending on its source, may be in the form of insoluble
 5  particulates or soluble compounds or complexes. Metal-containing fuel-borne catalysts are
    often soluble compounds or complexes or colloidal species.
    In some embodiments, the diesel fuel may comprise metal-containing species comprising a
    fuel-borne catalyst. Preferably, the fuel borne catalyst comprises one or more metals selected
10  from iron, cerium, platinum, manganese, Group I and Group II metals e.g., calcium and
    strontium. Most preferably the fuel borne catalyst comprises a metal selected from iron and
    cerium.
    In some embodiments, the diesel fuel may comprise metal-containing species comprising zinc.
15  Zinc may be present in an amount of from 0.01 to 50 ppm, preferably from 0.05 to 5 ppm,
    more preferably 0.1 to 1.5 ppm.
    Typically, the total amount of all metal-containing species in the diesel fuel, expressed in terms
    of the total weight of metal in the species, is between 0.1 and 50 ppm by weight, for example
20  between 0.1 and 20 ppm, preferably between 0.1 and 10 ppm by weight, based on the weight
    of the diesel fuel.
    It is advantageous to provide a diesel fuel composition which prevents or reduces the
    occurrence of deposits in a diesel engine. Such deposits may include "external" injector
25  deposits such as deposits in and around the nozzle hole and at the injector tip and "internal"
    injector deposits or IDIDs. Such fuel compositions may be considered to perform a "keep
    clean" function i.e. they prevent or inhibit fouling. It is also be desirable to provide a diesel fuel
    composition which would help clean up deposits of these types. Such a fuel composition which
    when combusted in a diesel engine removes deposits therefrom thus effecting the "clean-up"
30  of an already fouled engine.
    As with "keep clean" properties, "clean-up" of a fouled engine may provide significant
    advantages. For example, superior clean up may lead to an increase in power and/or an
    increase in fuel economy. In addition removal of deposits from an engine, in particular from
35  injectors may lead to an increase in interval time before injector maintenance or replacement is
    necessary thus reducing maintenance costs.
    Although for the reasons mentioned above deposits on injectors is a particular problem found
    in modern diesel engines with high pressure fuels systems, it is desirable to provide a diesel

    fuel composition which also provides effective detergency in older traditional diesel engines
    such that a single fuel supplied at the pumps can be used in engines of all types.
    It is also desirable that fuel compositions reduce the fouling of vehicle fuel filters. It is useful to
 5  provide compositions that prevent or inhibit the occurrence of fuel filter deposits i.e, provide a
    "keep clean" function. It is useful to provide compositions that remove existing deposits from
    fuel filter deposits i.e. provide a "clean up" function. Compositions able to provide both of
    these functions are especially useful.
10  According to a sixth aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of improving
    the performance of an engine, the method comprising combusting in said engine a fuel
    composition comprising as an additive a quaternary ammonium compound of formula (X):

15  wherein R , R1, R2 and R3 is each individually an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl and aryl
    group and R includes an optionally substituted hydrocarbyl moiety having at least 5 carbon
    atoms.
    In preferred embodiments the sixth aspect of the present invention provides a method of
20  improving the performance of an engine, the method comprising combusting in said engine a
    fuel composition comprising as an additive a quaternary ammonium compound which is the
    reaction product of:
          (a) a tertiary amine;

25        (c) an acid including an optionally substituted alkyl or alkenyl moiety having at least 6
              carbon atoms.
    Preferred features of the sixth aspect of the present invention are as defined in relation to the
    first, second, third and fifth aspects.
30
    The sixth aspect of the present invention may suitably provide a method of improving the
    performance of an engine comprising the steps of: preparing a quaternary additive according
    to the method of the second aspect; adding the quaternary ammonium salt additive to a fuel
    composition; and combusting the additised fuel composition in the engine.

  WO 2015/011506                                                               PCT/GB2014/052311
                                                     48
    Preferably the sixth aspect of the present invention comprises combusting in an engine a fuel
    composition comprising as an additive a quaternary ammonium compound which is the
    reaction product of:
         (a) a tertiary amine;
 5       (b) an epoxide; and
         (c) an acid including an optionally substituted alkyl or alkenyl moiety having at least 5
              carbon atoms, preferably at least 6 carbon atoms.
    In the method of the sixth aspect the engine may be a gasoline engine and the fuel
10  composition may be a gasoline fuel.
    Preferably in the method of the sixth aspect the engine is a diesel engine and the fuel
    composition is a diesel fuel composition.
15  The method of the sixth aspect of the present invention is particularly effective at improving the
    performance of a modern diesel engine having a high pressure fuel system.
    Such diesel engines may be characterised in a number of ways.
20  Such engines are typically equipped with fuel injection equipment meeting or exceeding "Euro
    5" emissions legislation or equivalent legislation in US or other countries.
    Such engines are typically equipped with fuel injectors having a plurality of apertures, each
    aperture having an inlet and an outlet.
25
    Such engines may be characterised by apertures which are tapered such that the inlet
    diameter of the spray-holes is greater than the outlet diameter.
    Such modern engines may be characterised by apertures having an outlet diameter of less
30  than 500pm, preferably less than 200pm, more preferably less than 150pm, preferably less
    than 100pm, most preferably less than 80pm or less.
    Such modern diesel engines may be characterised by apertures where an inner edge of the
    inlet is rounded.
35
    Such modern diesel engines may be characterised by the injector having more than one
    aperture, suitably more than 2 apertures, preferably more than 4 apertures, for example 6 or
    more apertures.

  WO 2015/011506                                                              PCT/GB2014/052311
                                                     49
    Such modern diesel engines may be characterised by an operating tip temperature in excess
    of 2500C.
    Such modern diesel engines may be characterised by a a fuel injection system which provides
 5  a fuel pressure of more than 1350 bar, preferably more than 1500 bar, more preferably more
    than 2000 bar. Preferably, the diesel engine has fuel injection system which comprises a
    common rail injection system.
    The method of the present invention preferably improves the performance of an engine having
10  one or more of the above-described characteristics.
    The method of the present invention improves the performance of an engine. This
    improvement in performance is suitably achieved by reducing deposits in the engine.
15  The present invention may therefore provide a method of combating deposits in an engine
    comprising combusting in said engine a fuel composition of the fourth aspect.
    The sixth aspect of the present invention preferably relates to a method of combating deposits
    in an engine, preferably a diesel engine. Combating deposits may involve reducing or the
20  preventing of the formation of deposits in an engine compared to when running the engine
    using unadditised fuel. Such a method may be regarded as achieving "keep clean"
    performance.
    Combating deposits may involve the removal of existing deposits in an engine. This may be
25  regarded as achieving "clean up" performance.
    In especially preferred embodiments the method of the sixth aspect of the present invention
    may be used to provide "keep clean" and "clean up" performance.
30  As explained above deposits may occur at different places within a diesel engine, for example
    a modern diesel engine.
    The present invention is particularly useful in the prevention or reduction or removal of internal
    deposits in injectors of engines operating at high pressures and temperatures in which fuel
35  may be recirculated and which comprise a plurality of fine apertures through which the fuel is
    delivered to the engine. The present invention finds utility in engines for heavy duty vehicles
    and passenger vehicles. Passenger vehicles incorporating a high speed direct injection (or
    HSDI) engine may for example benefit from the present invention.

  WO 2015/011506                                                              PCT/GB2014/052311
                                                   50
    The present invention may also provide improved performance in modern diesel engines
    having a high pressure fuel system by controlling external injector deposits, for example those
    occurring in the injector nozzle and/or at the injector tip. The ability to provide control of
    internal injector deposits and external injector deposits is a useful advantage of the present
 5  invention.
    Suitably the present invention may reduce or prevent the formation of external injector
    deposits. It may therefore provide "keep clean" performance in relation to external injector
    deposits.
10
    Suitably the present invention may reduce or remove existing external injector deposits. It may
    therefore provide "clean up" performance in relation to external injector deposits.
    Suitably the present invention may reduce or prevent the formation of internal diesel injector
15  deposits. It may therefore provide "keep clean" performance in relation to internal diesel
    injector deposits.
    Suitably the present invention may reduce or remove existing internal diesel injector deposits.
    It may therefore provide "clean up" performance in relation to internal diesel injector deposits.
20
    The present invention may also combat deposits on vehicle fuel filters. This may include
    reducing or preventing the formation of deposits ("keep clean" performance) or the reduction or
    removal of existing deposits ("clean up" performance).
25  The diesel fuel compositions of the present invention may also provide improved performance
    when used with traditional diesel engines. Preferably the improved performance is achieved
    when using the diesel fuel compositions in modern diesel engines having high pressure fuel
    systems and when using the compositions in traditional diesel engines. This is important
    because it allows a single fuel to be provided that can be used in new engines and older
30  vehicles.
    The removal or reduction of IDIDs according to the present invention will lead to an
    improvement in performance of the engine.
35  The improvement in performance of the diesel engine system may be measured by a number
    of ways. Suitable methods will depend on the type of engine and whether "keep clean" and/or
    "clean up" performance is measured.

  WO 2015/011506                                                             PCT/GB2014/052311
                                                    51
    An improvement in "keep clean" performance may be measured by comparison with a base
    fuel. "Clean up" performance can be observed by an improvement in performance of an
    already fouled engine.
 5  The effectiveness of fuel additives is often assessed using a controlled engine test.
    In Europe the Co-ordinating European Council for the development of performance tests for
    transportation fuels, lubricants and other fluids (the industry body known as CEC), has
    developed a test for additives for modern diesel engines such as HSDI engines. The CEC F
10  98-08 test is used to assess whether diesel fuel is suitable for use in engines meeting new
    European Union emissions regulations known as the "Euro 5"regulations. The test is based on
    a Peugeot DW10 engine using Euro 5 injectors, and is commonly referred to as DW10 test.
    This test measures power loss in the engine due to deposits on the injectors, and is further
    described in example 6.

    the first, second, third and fifth aspects, and especially as defined in relation to the sixth

    examples. In the examples which follow the values given in parts per million (ppm) for treat
    rates denote active agent amount, not the amount of a formulation as added, and containing

    Example 1
    Additive Al was prepared as follows.
10
    A sample of polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride prepared from 1000MW pib (PIB1000SA) was
    hydrolysed by reaction with a slight excess of water at 90-95'C.         The acid value of the
    resulting PIB1000SAcid was determined to be 1.50 mmol/g by titration against 0.1 N lithium
    methoxide in toluene.
15
    The PIB1OOOSAcid sample (50.10 g, 75 mmol C02H) was charged to a 3-neck round bottom
    flask. The flask was fitted with N2 flush, reflux condenser, stirrer-bar and thermocouple well.
    An oil bath thermostatically controlled to maintain 1050C was used to heat the flask contents
    with stirrin. The flask was charged with Shellsol AB (70.73 g) and was heated with strong
20  stirring to 950C. Water (3.384 g, 188 mmol, 2.51 equivalents to C02H) was added forming a
    turbid solution.
    N,N-Dimethyl ethanolamine (6.76 g, 76 mmol, 1.0 equivalents) was then added.              This
    significantly reduced but did not remove the turbidity. FTIR confirmed the formation of an
25  amine salt. After a further two hours a second FTIR spectrum was essentially unchanged from
    the first.
    2-ethylhexylglycidyl ether (14.06 g, 75.6 mmol, 1.01 equivalents) was added, dropping the
    temperature from 94 to 880C.         Heating continued and after a further 90 minutes at a
30  temperature of 950C a further FTIR spectrum was acquired. The peak associated with the
    carboxylate salt had shifted slightly to 1574 cm-1 and approximately doubled in height relative
    to the CH2 absorbances at 1463 and 1455 cm-1. Additive Al, the di-quaternary ammonium
    salt of PIB1000SAcid via the ring-opening of 2-ethylhexylglycidyl ether with N,N-dimethyl
    ethanolamine was formed as a 50% solution in aromatic solvent.

    The flask was fitted with N2 flush, reflux condenser, stirrer-bar and thermocouple well. An oil
    bath thermostatically controlled to maintain 1050C was used to heat the flask contents with
    stirring to 830C. The temperature of the oil bath thermostat was re-set to 110 C. Reaction
    monitoring by FTIR confirmed that the reaction was substantially complete and a half-ester,
 5  half-acid formed after one hour. A further aliquot of 2-ethylhexanol (0.204 g, 0.1 equivalents)
    was added and FTIR used to confirm that no further reaction had occurred after a further 40
    minutes.
    A previously prepared sample of PIB1000SI-DMAPA (reaction product of PIB1000SA with
10  N,N-dimethyl propylamine, 21.18 g, 15.5 mmol, 1.01 equivalents) and 2-methylphenylglycidyl
    ether, 2.526 g, 15.4 mmol, 1.0 equivalents) were added to the reaction flask. FTIR monitoring
    showed that a peak at about 1589 cm-1, consistent with formation of a carboxylate salt, began
    to form immediately. After 3 hours the peak had doubled in intensity and shifted to 1573 cm-1.
    No further changes were noted on further heating.

10
    This engine was chosen as a design representative of the modern European high-speed direct
    injection diesel engine capable of conforming to present and future European emissions
    requirements. The common rail injection system uses a highly efficient nozzle design with
    rounded inlet edges and conical spray holes for optimal hydraulic flow. This type of nozzle,
15  when combined with high fuel pressure has allowed advances to be achieved in combustion
    efficiency, reduced noise and reduced fuel consumption, but are sensitive to influences that
    can disturb the fuel flow, such as deposit formation in the spray holes. The presence of these
    deposits causes a significant loss of engine power and increased raw emissions.
20  The test is run with a future injector design representative of anticipated Euro V injector
    technology.
    It is considered necessary to establish a reliable baseline of injector condition before beginning
    fouling tests, so a sixteen hour running-in schedule for the test injectors is specified, using
25  non-fouling reference fuel.

    This test measures injector nozzle coking using a Peugeot XUD9 A/L Engine and provides a
    means of discriminating between fuels of different injector nozzle coking propensity. Nozzle
20  coking is the result of carbon deposits forming between the injector needle and the needle
    seat. Deposition of the carbon deposit is due to exposure of the injector needle and seat to
    combustion gases, potentially causing undesirable variations in engine performance.

    The Peugeot XUD9 A/L engine is a 4 cylinder indirect injection Diesel engine of 1.9 litre swept
    volume, obtained from Peugeot Citroen Motors specifically for the CEC PF023 method.
    The test engine is fitted with cleaned injectors utilising unflatted injector needles. The airflow at

    The propensity of the fuel to promote deposit formation on the fuel injectors is determined by
10  measuring the injector nozzle airflow again at the end of test, and comparing these values to
    those before test. The results are expressed in terms of percentage airflow reduction at
    various needle lift positions for all nozzles. The average value of the airflow reduction at
    0.1mm needle lift of all four nozzles is deemed the level of injector coking for a given fuel.

 5 Example 11
   Additive Al 1, a further additive of the invention was prepared as follows:
   With FTIR monitoring, a sample of technical grade oleic acid (Fisher, 15.31 g) was caused to
10 mix with iso-propylglycidyl ether (6.36 g) by magnetic stirring before addition of water (3.90 g)
   and finally N, N-dimethyl ethanolamine (14.45 g).         Amine addition was accompanied by a
   temperature rise from 21 to 300C, controlled by raising up an oil bath at ambient temperature
   around the flask. After the initial exotherm had died down, the oil bath heater was turned on
   and set to provide 100 C. After three hours at an internal temperature of 94-950C the reaction
15 was adjudged, by FTIR, to be complete. The reaction mass was transferred to a pear-shaped
   flask and stripped at the rotary evaporator at 100 C, 9 mBar. Mass balances were consistent
   with formation of the desired 2-hydroxy-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-isopropoxy-N,N-dimethylpropan
   1-aminium salt of oleic acid. A trace of ester was apparent in the IR spectra.
