ABSTRACT
Devices and methods for extracting a beverage from a container, such as a wine bottle.
Beverage can be extracted from a container by inserting a needle through a container closure,
such as a cork, delivering pressurized gas into the container via the needle, and dispensing
beverage from the container via the needle. A pressure regulator may control a pressure of gas
introduced into the container, and a lance used to pierce a pressurized gas cylinder may include
a leading face arranged to reliably pierce a cylinder closure. The regulator may include valve
features to reduce valve chatter or hammering and provide a more reliable pressure seal. See

          METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR BEVERAGE EXTRACTION WITH
                             IMPROVED GAS CYLINDER ACCESS

                                      Background of Invention
             This invention relates generally to accessing pressurized gas cylinders.
                                        Summary of Invention
             One or more embodiments in accordance with aspects of the invention allow a
10  user to withdraw or otherwise extract a beverage, such as wine, from within a container
    that is sealed by a cork, plug, elastomeric septum or other closure without removing the
    closure. In some cases, removal of liquid from such a container may be performed one
    or more times, yet the closure may remain in place during and after each beverage
    extraction to maintain a seal for the container. Thus, the beverage may be dispensed
15  from the bottle multiple times and stored for extended periods between each extraction
    with little or no effect on beverage quality. In some embodiments, little or no gas, such
    as air, which is reactive with the beverage may be introduced into the container either
    during or after extraction of beverage from within the container. Thus, in some
    embodiments, a user may withdraw wine from a wine bottle without removal of, or
20  damage to, the cork, and without allowing air or other potentially damaging gasses or
    liquids entry into the bottle. However, not all embodiments require the ability to remove
    an extraction device from a cork or other closure such that the closure reseals the bottle.
             Other aspects of the invention are described below and relate to methods and
    apparatus for piercing a gas cylinder, and regulating a pressure of gas provided from a
25  gas cylinder.
             For example, in one aspect of the invention, a piercing lance for piercing
    pressurized gas cylinders includes a body having a front piercing end, a rear end opposite
    the front piercing end, and a fluid passageway extending between the front piercing end
    and the rear end. The front piercing end may include a tapered portion having an
30  opening at a distal end of the tapered portion and a longitudinal axis. The tapered
    portion may have a first surface partially defining the opening at the distal end that is

   WO 2014/200881                                                            PCT/US2014/041465
                                                 -2
    arranged in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and a second surface partially
    defining the opening at the distal end that is arranged in a plane transverse and not
    perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. Such an arrangement in which the leading face of
    the piercing lance includes two surfaces at an angle to each other, e.g., of 20-35 degrees,
 5  may help in reliably piercing gas cylinders, including cylinders that have a metal closure.
    A first surface may cut an opening in the closure, while the second surface may aid in
    bending the cut portion of the closure away from the opening. As a result, the cut
    portion of the closure may remain attached to the cylinder and be prevented from
    covering the opening of the lance. In some embodiments, the second surface may be
10  arranged in a plane that is at an angle of 55-70 degrees to the longitudinal axis. A line
    extending along an area where the first and second surfaces meet may pass through the
    opening, e.g., as a chord that may or may not pass through a center of the opening. The
    tapered portion may have an outer surface arranged at an angle of 10-30 degrees to the
    longitudinal axis, and may include a vent channel that extends from the first or second
15  surface to a proximal end of the tapered portion.     Such a vent channel may help vent a
    cartridge that is prematurely removed from the lance and/or help keep a cut portion of a
    cylinder closure attached to the cylinder. A gasket-contacting portion of the body may
    be located proximal of the tapered portion and be arranged to contact a gasket positioned
    between the lance and a gas cylinder and create a gas-tight seal between the gasket and
20  the lance. In one embodiment, the gasket-contacting portion may include an annular
    surface arranged in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and/or a cylindrical
    surface that extends around the longitudinal axis. The rear end of the body may include
    a gasket arranged to form a seal with a bore in which the rear end of the body is
    positioned, e.g., a bore of a pressure regulator that receives the lance.
25           In another aspect of the invention, a fluid pressure regulator includes a first stage
    valve arranged to open and close a fluid flow path to control flow of fluid through the
    valve. The first stage valve may include a first valve body defining a valve chamber
    having an outlet opening and an inlet opening, a first valve gasket arranged in the valve
    chamber at the outlet opening, a first valve ball movable in the valve chamber to contact
30  the first valve gasket and close the outlet opening, and a gasket retainer in the valve
    chamber and stationary relative to the first valve body arranged to hold the first valve

   WO 2014/200881                                                            PCT/US2014/041465
                                                   -3
    gasket at the outlet opening. A first stage piston may be arranged for movement to move
    the first valve ball relative to the outlet opening and thereby open and close the first stage
    valve, and a regulator body may define a piston chamber in which the first stage piston is
    movable and may house the valve chamber. In one embodiment, the gasket retainer may
 5  include a cylindrical shell portion and an inwardly extending flange at a gasket end of the
    retainer arranged to contact the first valve gasket. The flange may have an annular shape
    and taper inwardly from the cylindrical shell portion. The first valve gasket may be
    arranged to deform with contact with the first valve ball, and the gasket retainer may be
    arranged in the valve chamber to restrict movement of the gasket due to deformation of
10  the gasket. For example, the gasket retainer may be arranged to restrict movement of the
    gasket so that the gasket prevents contact of the first valve ball with the first valve body
    near the outlet opening. This arrangement may help prevent contact of a metal valve ball
    with a metal valve body, thereby reducing wear.
             In one embodiment, the valve piston includes a depressor to contact and move the
15  valve ball to open/close the valve, and the depressor may have a rigid, convex contact
    surface arranged to contact the first valve ball. This arrangement may help prevent the
    valve ball from following a same track during opening and closing movement, thus more
    evenly wearing the valve ball, gasket and/or depressor and/or allowing the valve to open
    and close to regulate pressure with reduced chattering or hammering of the valve ball.
20           In another aspect of the invention, a fluid pressure regulator includes a first stage
    valve arranged to open and close a fluid flow path to control flow of fluid through the
    valve. The first stage valve may include a first valve body defining a valve chamber
    having an outlet opening and an inlet opening, a first valve gasket arranged in the valve
    chamber at the outlet opening, and a first valve ball movable in the valve chamber to
25  contact the first valve gasket and close the outlet opening. A first stage piston may be
    arranged for movement to move the first valve ball relative to the outlet opening and
    thereby open and close the first stage valve. A molded plastic regulator body may define
    a piston chamber in which the first stage piston is movable and house the valve chamber,
    and the first valve body may be a metal component positioned in a cavity of the molded
30  plastic regulator body. For example, the valve body may include a metal cylinder that is
    co-molded with the regulator body. This arrangement may allow the regulator to

    suitably withstand relatively high pressures, e.g., 1000, 2000, 3000 psi or more, while
    employing a plastic regulator body. That is, only that portion of the regulator that is
    exposed to high pressure, e.g., the valve chamber, need be made of metal or other
    suitable material to withstand the high pressure while other portions of the regulator are
 5  made to withstand lower pressures, e.g., 30-100psi.

                                        Detailed Description
            Aspects of the invention are described below with reference to illustrative
10  embodiments, but it should be understood that aspects of the invention are not to be
    construed narrowly in view of the specific embodiments described. Thus, aspects of the
    invention are not limited to the embodiments described herein. It should also be
    understood that various aspects of the invention may be used alone and/or in any suitable
    combination with each other, and thus various embodiments should not be interpreted as
15  requiring any particular combination or combinations of features. Instead, one or more
    features of the embodiments described may be combined with any other suitable features
    of other embodiments.
            FIGs. 1-4 show schematic views of one embodiment of a beverage extraction
    device 1 that may incorporate one or more aspects of the invention. This illustrative
20  system 1 includes a body 3 with an attached pressurized source of gas 100 (such as a
    compressed gas cylinder) that provides gas under pressure (e.g., 2600 psi or less as
    dispensed from the cylinder) to a regulator 600. In this arrangement, the cylinder 100 is
    secured to the body 3 and regulator 600 by a threaded connection, although other
    configurations are possible, such as those described below and/or in US Patents
25  4,867,209; US 5,020,395; and US 5,163,909 which are hereby incorporated by reference
    with respect to their teachings regarding mechanisms for engaging a gas cylinder with a
    cylinder receiver. The regulator 600 is shown schematically and without detail in FIGs.
    1-4, but specific embodiments are described below and/or could include any of a variety
    of commercially available or other single or multi-stage pressure regulators capable of
30  regulating gas pressures to a pre-set or variable outlet pressure. The main function of the
    regulator 600 is to provide gas at a pressure and flow rate suitable for delivery to the

   WO 2014/200881                                                           PCT/US2014/041465
                                                 -6
    container 700 (such as a wine bottle), e.g., so that a pressure established inside the
    container 700 does not exceed a desired level, such as a level that ensures the closure 730
    will not be expelled.
            In this embodiment, the body 3 also includes a valve 300 operable to control the
 5  flow of gas from the regulator 600. The valve 300 may be a 3-way toggle valve that
    includes a single operation button and functions to selectively introduce pressurized gas
    into the container 700 and extract beverage 710 (such as wine) from the container 700
    via a needle 200. Details regarding the operation of such a valve 300 are provided in US
    Patent 8,225,959, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. However, other
10  valve arrangements for controlling pressurized gas and beverage flow are possible,
    including those described below and which incorporate aspects of the invention.
            To introduce gas into the container 700 and extract beverage, a needle 200
    attached to the body 3 is inserted through a cork or other closure 730 that seals an
    opening of the container 700. This illustrative system 1 uses a pencil-tip non-coring
15  needle 200 with a needle opening 220 along a sidewall of the needle near the needle tip.
    While the needle 200 may be inserted into the cork or other closure 730 in different
    ways, in this embodiment, the system 1 includes a base 2 with a pair of channels 21 that
    receive and guide movement of respective rails 31 of the body 3. Thus, movement of the
    body 3 and attached needle 200 relative to the container closure 730 may be guided by
20  the base 2, e.g., the body 3 may slide relative to the base 2 to move the needle 200
    into/out of the closure 730. In addition, movement of the needle 200 may be guided by a
    needle guide 202 that is attached to the base 2 and positioned over the closure 730.
    Other arrangements for guiding movement of the body 3 relative to the base 2 are
    possible, such as providing one or more rails on the base 2 which engage with a channel
25  or other receiver of the body 3, providing an elongated slot, channel or groove on the
    body or base which engages with a corresponding feature (e.g., a tab) on the other of the
    body or base and allows for sliding movement, a linkage that connects the body and base
    together and allows for movement of the body to insert the needle into the closure, and
    others. In yet other embodiments, the body 3 need not be movable relative to the base 2,
30  but may be fixed to each other. In this case, needle insertion may be performed by
    moving the body and base together relative to the container.

   WO 2014/200881                                                           PCT/US2014/041465
                                                  -7
            In some embodiments, the base 2 may be fixed or otherwise held in place relative
    to the container 700, e.g., by a clamp, sleeve, strap or other device that engages with the
    container 700. Clamp arrangements may be used to temporarily or releasably secure the
    device 1 to a wine bottle neck or other container 700. By restraining movement of the
 5  base 2 relative to the container 700, such an arrangement may help guide motion of a
    needle 200 relative to the container 700 when penetrating a closure 730, or when being
    withdrawn from the closure 730. Alternately, the container 700 may be manipulated by
    grasping and manipulating the device 1 since the clamp engaging the device 1 to the
    container 700 may securely hold the device 1 and container 700 together.
10          To insert the needle 200 through the closure 730, a user may push downwardly
    on the body 3 while maintaining the base 2 and the container 700 at least somewhat
    stationary relative to each other. The needle 200 will pass through the closure 730,
    guided in its motion, at least in part, by the guided motion of the body 3 relative to the
    base 2 (e.g., by the rails 31 and channels 21). With the needle 200 suitably inserted as
15  shown in FIG. 2, a needle opening 220 at the needle tip may be positioned below the
    closure 730 and within the enclosed space of the container 700. The container 700 may
    then be tilted, e.g., so that the beverage 710 flows to near the closure 730 and any air or
    other gas 720 in the container 700 flows away from the closure. Pressurized gas 120
    may then be introduced into the container 700 by actuating the valve 300 and causing gas
20  from the cylinder 100 to flow through the valve 300 and needle 200 to exit at the needle
    opening 220, as shown in FIG. 3. Thereafter, the valve 300 may be operated to stop the
    flow of pressurized gas and allow beverage 710 to flow into the needle opening 220 and
    through the needle 200 to be dispensed from the valve 300, as shown in FIG. 4.
            FIGs. 5-7 show another illustrative embodiment of a beverage extraction device 1
25  that may incorporate aspects of the invention. This embodiment is similar in operation to
    that of FIGs. 1-4, but has a few different features including a valve for controlling gas
    and beverage flow. In this embodiment, the body 3 includes a handle 33, that may be
    gripped by a user for moving the body 3 relative to the base 2 in upward and downward
    motions to insert a needle 200 through a cork or other closure of a container 700. Also, a
30  lever 32 is provided for operating the valve 8, e.g., to dispense beverage from an outlet
    301 and/or deliver gas to the container 700 via the needle 200. To allow movement of

   WO 2014/200881                                                           PCT/US2014/041465
    the body 3 relative to the base 2, the body 3 includes a rail 31 that has T-shaped cross
    section, and is arranged to move within a T-shaped receiving slot or channel 21 of the
    base 2. As discussed above, however, other arrangements are possible for engaging the
    body 3 and base 2 while allowing for movement of the needle 200. Also, a gas cylinder
 5  cover 101 threadedly engages with the body 3 at the regulator 600 to engage and hold the
    cylinder 100 in place relative to the body 3. (A gas cylinder cover 101 in this
    embodiment is a kind of cap that covers the gas cylinder 100 and threadedly engages
    with another part of the body 3 to hold the gas cylinder 100 in place.) This arrangement
    of a gas cylinder cover 101 allows for the use of gas cylinders 100 that do not threadedly
10  engage with the regulator 600, but rather are held in engagement with the regulator 600
    by the cover 101.
            Also included in this embodiment is a clamp 4 having a pair of clamp arms 41
    that are arranged to support the device 1 in an upright orientation on a flat, horizontal
    surface 102, such as a table or counter top. In this embodiment, a lowermost portion of
15  the clamp arms 41 contacts the surface 102 along with a lowermost portion of the body
    3, which in this example is a lower end of gas cylinder cover 101. Thus, the clamp arms
    41 and cover 101 may provide three points of contact with the surface 102, although
    additional points of contact may be provided. Also, the cover 101 need not contact the
    surface 102, and instead other portions of the body 3 or the base 2 may contact the
20  surface 102 to support the device 1 in an upright orientation. In another arrangement, the
    clamp arms 41 alone may contact the surface 102 and support the device 1. For
    example, the clamp arms 41 may include "feet" or other structure that contacts the
    surface 102 to suitably support the device 1 without assistance from other parts of the
    device 1.
25          It has been found that needles having a smooth walled exterior, pencil point or
    Huber point needle of 16 gauge or higher are effective to penetrate through a wine bottle
    cork or other closure, while sealing effectively with the cork to prevent the ingress or
    egress of gases or fluids during beverage extraction. Moreover, such needles allow the
    cork to reseal after withdrawal of the needle, allowing the container and any remaining
30  beverage to be stored for months or years without abnormal alteration of the beverage
    flavor. Further, such needles may be used to penetrate a foil cover or other wrapping

   WO 2014/200881                                                          PCT/US2014/041465

    commonly found on wine bottles and other containers. Thus, the needle may penetrate
    the foil cover or other element as well as the closure, eliminating any need to remove the
    foil or other wrapping prior to beverage extraction. Other needle profiles and gauges are
    also usable with the system.
 5           A needle used in a beverage extraction device may be a smooth exterior walled,
    cylindrical needle with a non-coring tip that can be passed through a cork without
    removing material from the cork. One non-coring tip is a pencil-tip that dilates a
    passageway through the cork, although deflected-tip and stylet needles have also been
    found to work properly and could be used in alternative embodiments. The pencil-tip
10  needle preferably has at least one lumen extending along its length from at least one inlet
    on the end opposite the pencil-tip and at least one outlet proximal to the pencil-tip. As
    shown above, a needle outlet may be positioned in the side-wall of the needle at the
    distal end of the needle, although proximal of the extreme needle tip.
             With the correct needle gauge, it has been found that a passageway (if any) that
15  remains following removal of the needle from a cork self-seals against egress or ingress
    of fluids and/or gasses under normal storage conditions. Thus, a needle may be inserted
    through a closure to extract beverage, and then be removed, allowing the closure to
    reseal such that beverage and gas passage through the closure is prevented. While
    multiple needle gauges can work, preferred needle gauges range from 16 to 22 gauge,
20  with an optimal needle gauge in some embodiments being between 17 and 20 gauge.
    These needles gauges may offer optimal fluid flow with minimal pressures inside the
    container while doing an acceptably low level of damage to the cork even after repeated
    insertions and extractions.
             Multiple needle lengths can be adapted to work properly in various embodiments,
25  but it has been found that a minimum needle length of about 1.5 inches is generally
    required to pass through standard wine bottle corks. Needles as long as 9 inches could
    be employed, but the optimal range of length for some embodiments has been found to
    be between 2 and 2.6 inches. The needle may be fluidly connected to the valve directly
    through any standard fitting (e.g. NPT, RPT, Leur, quick-connect or standard thread), via
30  a custom fitting or thread arrangement, or alternatively may be connected to the valve
    through an intervening element such as a flexible or rigid tube. When two or more

                                                 - 10
    needles are used, the needle lengths may be the same or different and vary from 0.25
    inches to 10 inches. Creating distance between the inlet/outlets of the needles can
    prevent the formation of bubbles.
             In some embodiments, a suitable gas pressure is introduced into a container to
 5  extract beverage from the container. For example, with some wine bottles, it has been
    found that a maximum pressure of between around 40 and 50 psi may be introduced into
    the bottle without risking leakage at, or ejection of, the cork, although pressures of
    between around 15 and 30 psi have been found to work well. These pressures are well
    tolerated by even the weakest of cork-to-bottle seals at the bottle opening without
10  causing cork dislodging or passage of liquid or gas by the cork, and provide for relatively
    fast beverage extraction. The lower pressure limit in the container during wine
    extraction for some embodiments has been found to be between about 0 and 20 psi. That
    is, a pressure between about 0 and 20 psi has been found needed in a bottle to provide a
    suitably fast extraction of beverage from the bottle. In one example using a single 17 to
15  20 gauge needle, a pressure of 30 psi was used to establish an initial pressure in a wine
    bottle, and rapid wine extraction was experienced even as the internal pressure dropped
    to about 15-20 psi.
             The source of pressurized gas can be any of a variety of regulated or unregulated
    pressurized gas containers filled with any of a variety of non-reactive gasses. In a
20  preferred embodiment, the gas cylinder contains gas at an initial pressure of about 2000
    3000 psi. This pressure has been found to allow the use of a single relatively small
    compressed gas cylinder (e.g., about 3 inches in length and 0.75 inches in diameter) for
    the complete extraction of the contents of several bottles of wine. Multiple gasses have
    been tested successfully over extended storage periods, and preferably the gas used is
25  non-reactive with the beverage within the container, such as wine, and can serve to
    protect the beverage oxidation or other damage. Suitable gases include nitrogen, carbon
    dioxide, argon, helium, neon and others. Mixtures of gas are also possible. For example,
    a mixture of argon and another lighter gas could blanket wine or other beverage in argon
    while the lighter gas could occupy volume within the bottle and perhaps reduce the
30  overall cost of the gas.

   WO 2014/200881                                                             PCT/US2014/041465

             The embodiment above, a single needle with a single lumen is used to introduce
    gas into the container and extract beverage from the container. However, in other
    embodiments two or more needles may be used, e.g., one needle for gas delivery and one
    needle for beverage extraction. In such an embodiment, the valve may operate to
 5  simultaneously open a flow of gas to the container and open a flow of beverage from the
    container. The needles may have the same or different diameters or the same or different
    length varying from 0.25 to 10 inches. For example, one needle delivering gas could be
    longer than another that extracts wine from the bottle. Alternately, a two lumen needle
    may be employed where gas travels in one lumen and beverage travels in the other. Each
10  lumen could have a separate entrance and exit, and the exits could be spaced from each
    other within the bottle to prevent circulation of gas.
             As noted above, some aspects of the invention relate to features of a pressure
    regulator, e.g., for use in a beverage extraction device, and/or features of a lance for
    piercing a gas cylinder. FIG. 8 illustrates a cross sectional view of an exemplary
15  embodiment of a pressure regulator 600 that incorporates one or more aspects of the
    invention and may be used with the beverage extraction devices described above.
    Although embodiments described herein are used with a pressurized cartridge (not
    shown) containing C02 gas, other pressurized gases or fluids may be harnessed out of
    compressed gas cartridges such as nitrogen or oxygen. The pressure regulator includes a
20  first stage 10 that operates to reduce the pressure from a cylinder 100 (which may be
    approximately 2600-3000 psi or more, or less) which is received at a receiver opening 24
    and pierced by a lance 25 to cause the release of gas from the cylinder. The first stage 10
    may reduce the pressure of gas received from the cylinder 100 to a first level, e.g., in a
    range of 30-60 psi, while an optional second stage (not shown) may reduce the pressure
25  of gas received from the first stage 10 to a yet lower level, e.g., in a range of 15-30 psi.
    (A second stage may be arranged in the same basic way as the first stage 10 and have its
    valve chamber inlet opening fluidly connected to the gas outlet 62 of the first stage 10.)
    The lance 25 may be is press-fit into (or otherwise engaged with) an opening of the first
    stage regulator body 4, and may employ hollow and/or solid piercing lance designs. A
30  seal between the lance 25 and the cylinder 100 may be formed using a gasket (such as an
    o-ring 41) that is positioned between the lance 25 and the cylinder (not shown) when the

   WO 2014/200881                                                           PCT/US2014/041465
                                                 - 12
    lance 25 is used to pierce the cylinder. To engage the cylinder at the receiver opening
    24, the cylinder may be held in a cup (e.g., such as the cover 101 in FIG. 5) that engages
    with a thread 42 at the bottom of the regulator body 4 around the receiver opening 24 so
    that threading the cup onto the regulator body 4 pushes the neck of the cylinder into the
 5  receiver opening 24, causing the lance 25 to pierce the cylinder and a seal to be formed,
    e.g., by the o-ring 41, to prevent leakage of gas. US Patent 7,334,598 describes a cup
    arrangement used to engage a cylinder at a receiver opening 24.
             With a cylinder received at the receiver opening 24 and pierced by the lance 25, a
    valve chamber 5 of the first stage regulator 10 receives relatively high pressure gas from
10  the cylinder via a passageway through the lance 25. Flow of gas from the valve chamber
    5 (through an outlet opening 13) is controlled by a valve assembly 20 that includes a
    spring 30 which urges a valve ball 16 upwardly into contact with a valve gasket 11, e.g.,
    a resilient o-ring. Suitable contact of the valve ball 16 with the gasket 11 prevents the
    flow of gas from the valve chamber 5 through the outlet opening 13 while movement of
15  the valve ball 16 away from the outlet opening 13 allows for flow from the valve
    chamber 5. Thus, movement of the ball 16 relative to (i.e., toward and away from) the
    gasket 11 and the outlet opening 13 can control the flow of gas from the valve chamber
    5.
             Movement of the valve ball 16 is controlled by a depressor 12, which is attached
20  to a piston 14 arranged for movement in a piston bore 26 of the regulator body 4. A
    piston spring 17 urges the piston 14 to move downwardly in the bore 26 (and thus moves
    the depressor 12 and ball 16 downwardly), while gas pressure at an inner, bottom surface
    of the piston 14 (provided by gas emitted from the valve chamber 5 through the outlet
    opening 13) urges the piston 14 to move upwardly and thus moves the depressor 12
25  upwardly, allowing the spring 30 to move the ball 16 upwardly. A piston seal 15 is
    arranged to engage with a stepped surface of the piston 14 and with a tapered, stepped or
    other sealing surface of the piston bore 26 to control the flow of gas from an inner side of
    the piston 14 to outside the piston (e.g., to a space where the piston spring 17 is located).
    Gas in the area outside of the piston 14 is vented from the body 4 by a vent, e.g., a hole,
30  groove or other feature 27 in the regulator body 4.

   WO 2014/200881                                                           PCT/US2014/041465

            Thus, when the piston 14 is moved downwardly by the piston spring 17, flow
    from inside of the piston 14 is stopped by the piston seal 15 although flow from the valve
    chamber 5 is permitted, and when the piston 14 is moved upwardly, flow from inside the
    piston 14 past the piston seal 15 is permitted but flow from the valve chamber 5 is
 5  stopped. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, movement of the piston 14,
    and the corresponding movement of the depressor 12 and valve ball 16 as influenced by
    the piston spring 17 and the spring 30, respectively, will provide a pressure-regulated
    flow of gas from the valve chamber 5. Generally speaking, a compressive force on the
    piston spring 17 (and/or a spring constant of the spring 17) will define the pressure of gas
10  released by the valve assembly 20. The spring 17 is retained in the piston bore 26 by a
    cap 58 which threadedly engages with the body 4 and may be adjusted in position to
    adjust a preload or compression force on the spring 17 to adjust a pressure of gas emitted
    by the first stage 10. The regulator body 4 and/or the cap 58 may include a hole or other
    opening to allow any gas pressure on the outer side of the piston 14 to vent.
15          Pressure-regulated gas flow is output from the first stage 10 via an exit conduit
    62 which taps off of the top of the piston 14. The exit conduit 62 could be connected to a
    hose, a threaded fitting or other component which delivers the pressure-regulated gas for
    use, such as to a valve 300 in the device of FIGs. 1-7, for inflating a tire, driving liquid
    from a beverage container, or other pneumatic or hydraulic device that uses a regulated,
20  substantially constant working pressure gas. Alternately, a pressure-regulated supply of
    gas may be provided by the exit conduit 62 to a second stage pressure regulator, e.g., that
    is arranged like the first stage regulator 10 and has its valve chamber 5 fluidly connected
    to the exit conduit 62.
            In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a valve body that defines a valve
25  chamber in a pressure regulator may be a metal component that is positioned in a cavity
    of a molded plastic regulator body. For example, in one embodiment, the valve body
    may be co-molded with the regulator body. Such an arrangement may allow the
    regulator body to be made of relatively light and less robust material, such as a plastic
    material, while still enabling the regulator to handle relatively high pressures, such as
30  1000, 2000, 3000 psi or more. That is, since only the valve chamber of the regulator
    may be exposed to relatively high pressures received from a gas cylinder or other source,

   WO 2014/200881                                                          PCT/US2014/041465
                                                - 14
    only the valve body that defines the valve chamber need be made to withstand relatively
    high pressures. Components downstream of the valve body are not exposed to such high
    pressures, e.g., because the regulator may control opening/closing of the regulator valve
    so that pressures downstream of the valve may be maintained below a desired threshold,
 5  e.g., below 50, 60 100 psi or less. As a result, components downstream of the valve
    chamber may be required to withstand much lower pressures, e.g., below 100 psi.
             FIG. 8 shows an embodiment in which the valve assembly 20 includes a valve
    body 50 that defines the first valve chamber 5. The valve body 50 is formed as a
    generally cylindrical element with a radially inwardly extending annular end wall that
10  defines the outlet opening 13, and a radially outwardly extending flange at the inlet
    opening 51 of the valve chamber 5. The annular end wall may provide a seal engaging
    surface to engage with the gasket 11 and form a seal to help resist leakage of gas from
    the valve chamber 5 when the valve ball 16 is engaged with the gasket 11. In this
    embodiment, the inner surface of the annular end wall of the valve body 50 has a curved
15  shape that at least partially approximates a shape of the gasket 11, e.g., a partial toroidal
    shell shape arranged to work with an o-ring gasket 11, but may have any suitable shape.
    Also, the size of the outlet opening 13 may be arranged in relation to the size of the
    depressor 12 to help resist movement of the gasket 11 through the outlet opening 13. For
    example, the depressor 12 may have a size and shape that is similar to the outlet opening
20  13, thus helping prevent movement of the gasket 11 through the opening 13. The valve
    body 50 in this embodiment includes a flange at the inlet opening 51 end to help
    maintain a position of the body 50 in a cavity of the regulator body 4, but such a flange
    or other feature is not required. The thickness of the valve body 50 may be any suitable
    value, and may be arranged to withstand the expected pressures, such as 2000psi or
25  more.
             In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a gasket retainer may be
    provided in the valve chamber to help hold the valve gasket at the outlet opening. In one
    arrangement, the gasket retainer may be formed as part of the valve body, or may be
    provided by a separate element positioned in the valve chamber. FIGs. 9 and 10 show an
30  illustrative embodiment of a pressure regulator 600 that is arranged similar to that in
    FIG. 8, but in this embodiment a gasket retainer 52 is provided in the valve chamber 5.

   WO 2014/200881                                                           PCT/US2014/041465

    While the gasket retainer 52 is arranged as a separate element from the valve body 50,
    the gasket retainer 52 could be formed as part of the valve body 50, e.g., as an inwardly
    extending flange, wall, protrusion or other element attached to the inner wall of the body
    50. In this embodiment, the gasket retainer 52 includes a cylindrical shell portion and an
 5  inwardly extending flange at a gasket end of the retainer 52 arranged to contact and hold
    the valve gasket 11 near the outlet opening 13. The gasket retainer 52 is maintained
    relatively stationary in position in the valve chamber relative to the first valve body 50,
    but in some embodiments may be permitted to move to some extent. While the gasket
    retainer 52 could be held in place in different ways, in this embodiment the gasket
10  retainer 52 contacts a portion of the lance 25 which is received into the inlet opening 51
    of the valve body 50. That is, an end of the gasket retainer 52 near the inlet opening 51
    contacts a portion of the lance 25 in the valve body 50 so that the flange of the gasket
    retainer 52 is held in place relative to the outlet opening 13. Of course, other
    arrangements are possible, such as welding, adhering or otherwise fixing the gasket
15  retainer 52 in place relative to the valve body 50.
            Assembly of the gasket retainer 52 in the valve body 50 is shown in FIG. 10. As
    noted above, the valve body 50 may be molded into the regulator body 4 or otherwise
    positioned in a cavity of the regulator body 4 so that the inlet opening 51 of the valve
    body 50 is exposed at the receiver opening 24. The gasket 11 may be inserted into the
20  valve chamber 5 through the inlet opening 51, followed by the gasket retainer 52, the
    valve ball 16, the valve spring 30 and the lance 25. As can be seen in FIG. 10, the lance
    has a rear end that is sized and configured to fit into the inlet opening 51 of the valve
    body 50 and form a gas-tight seal with the valve body 50. In this embodiment, the lance
    25 includes an o-ring gasket received in a groove of the rear end of the lance 25 to form a
25  seal with the valve body 50, although other arrangements are possible, such as a sealant,
    welding, adhesive, a threaded connection, a compression fitting, etc. As can also be seen
    in FIG. 10, the gasket retainer 52 in this embodiment includes two or more legs that
    extend toward and contact the lance 25 to position the gasket retainer 52 in the valve
    chamber 5. Such legs are optional, however, and need not be provided.
30          FIGs. 11 and 12 illustrate how the gasket retainer 52 functions in some
    embodiments to restrict movement of the gasket 11 as the gasket is deformed with

   WO 2014/200881                                                          PCT/US2014/041465

    contact of the valve ball 16. In this embodiment, the gasket retainer 52 has a flange at
    the outlet opening end with an annular shape that tapers inwardly from the cylindrical
    shell portion. Other arrangements are possible for the gasket-contacting portion of the
    gasket retainer 52, such as multiple inwardly extending fingers, a flange that is
 5  perpendicular to the valve body 50 inner wall, or other arrangements. FIG. 11 shows the
    valve ball 16 in a closed position in which the outlet opening 13 is sealed closed by
    contact of the valve ball 16 with the gasket 11 and by contact of the gasket 11 with the
    valve body 50 at the outlet opening 13. However, FIG. 11 illustrates generally how the
    gasket 11 would move if unrestrained by the valve body 50 and the gasket retainer 52.
10  FIG. 12, in contrast, shows the valve ball 16 in the closed position but with the gasket 11
    in its deformed state and restrained by the valve body 50 and the gasket retainer 52. As
    can be seen, the gasket 11 is resilient and generally conforms to the shape of the valve
    body 50 and the retainer 52 when pressed by the valve ball 16. Though not shown, in the
    absence of the retainer 52, the gasket 11 would tend to deform in a direction away from
15  the outlet opening 13 and into a space between the valve ball 16 and the valve body 50.
    However, the gasket retainer 52 prevents this movement, and as a result, the contact
    force between the gasket 11 and the valve ball 16 is effectively increased. In some
    embodiments, the valve gasket 11 and the gasket retainer 52 are arranged to prevent
    contact of the valve ball 16 with the valve body 50 near the outlet opening 13. For
20  example, the valve body 50 in this embodiment curves inwardly at the outlet opening 13
    so that the valve body extends somewhat inwardly into the valve chamber 5 at the outlet
    opening 13 to a valve seat 19. While in some cases the valve ball 16 may be permitted to
    contact the valve body 50 at the valve seat 19, in this embodiment, the gasket 11 and the
    gasket retainer 52 are arranged so that the valve ball 16 cannot contact the valve body 50
25  at the valve seat 19. Instead, the gasket 11 prevents the valve ball 16 from moving into
    contact with the valve body 50, e.g., because deformation of the gasket 11 is limited by
    the gasket retainer 52 and the valve body 50 such that the gasket 11 effectively becomes
    a rigid body before the valve ball 16 contacts the valve seat 19. By preventing contact of
    the valve ball 16 with the valve body 50 at the valve seat 19, damage to the ball 16
30  and/or body 50 can be resisted, e.g., due to contact of the two relatively hard metal

    other. Moreover, noise associated with the contact as the valve closes may be reduced or
    eliminated.
             In some embodiments, a gap between the gasket retainer 52 and the valve ball 16
    and/or a gap between the valve seat 19 and the valve ball 16 with the ball 16 at the closed
 5  position in FIG. 12 may be suitably sized (i.e., suitably small) to help prevent the gasket
    11 from deforming (e.g., extruding) into the respective gap. This can help prevent
    damage to the gasket 11 and/or seal failure. In some embodiments, the gap width may
    be 0.5 to 2 millimeters or less. While in this embodiment the gasket 11 is an o-ring
    having a durometer of Shore A 90, other arrangements for the gasket are possible, and
10  higher durometer gaskets may allow for a larger gap between the valve ball 16 and the
    valve seat 19 or gasket retainer 52.
             Another aspect of the invention illustrated in FIGs. 11 and 12 is that the depressor
    12 of the valve piston 14 may include a rigid, convex contact surface arranged to contact
    the valve ball 16. This is in contrast to a contact surface that is flat, concave and/or
15  resilient, e.g., formed by a rubber ball, concave or flat metal surface, or other similar
    element at the end of the depressor 12. By using a rigid, convex contact surface on the
    depressor 12 (such as a spherical surface), the depressor 12 may urge the valve ball 16 to
    move away from the outlet opening 13 in a direction that is at an angle to the direction of
    movement of the depressor 12. For example, as shown in FIG. 12, the depressor 12 may
20  move along a line 121 with movement of the piston 14. However, since the depressor 12
    and the ball 16 contact each other at spherical or other convex, the depressor 12 may
    move the ball 16 away from the outlet opening 13 in a direction that is at an angle to the
    line 121. That is, since the depressor 12 and valve ball 16 contact each other at convex
    surfaces, the depressor 12 does not restrain movement of the ball 16 in directions
25  transverse to the line 121. As a result, and since the spring 30 and valve body 50 may
    permit lateral movement of the valve ball 16, the valve ball 16 is free to move laterally
    (in a direction transverse to the line 121) when pushed away from the outlet opening 13
    by the depressor 12. This is true whether the depressor 12 contacts the valve ball 16 at a
    point where a diameter line of the ball 16 is parallel to the line 121 or not. In fact, by
30  positioning the point of contact of the depressor 12 with the valve ball 16 at a location
    where a diameter of the ball 16 is parallel to the line 121, wear of the gasket 11 may be

   WO 2014/200881                                                            PCT/US2014/041465
                                                 - 18
    more evenly spread to different areas of the gasket 11. That is, if the point of contact
    between the depressor 12 and the ball 16 is positioned away from a diameter line that is
    parallel to the line 121, the ball 16 may be consistently moved in a direction transverse to
    the line 121, but may be moved along a same or similar track every time the valve opens
 5  and closes. This may cause the gasket 11 to wear along the track faster than other
    portions of the gasket 11. However, by positioning the point of contact between the
    depressor 12 and the ball 16 at a diameter line that is parallel to the line 121, the ball 16
    may be moved along different, random tracks, allowing the gasket 11 to wear more
    evenly.
10          As a result of moving the valve ball 16 in a direction transverse to the line 121
    away from the outlet opening 13, the ball 16 may move so as to break contact with the
    gasket 11 at one side of the ball 16 before an opposite side of the ball 16 moves away
    from the gasket 11. This type of movement allows the valve to open and/or close more
    smoothly, reducing a chattering or hammering noise that may be caused by the valve
15  quickly opening and closing while transitioning from open to closed (or vice versa).
    That is, in arrangements where the ball 16 moves linearly away from the gasket 11, the
    ball 16 tends to maintain contact with the gasket at a circular area (and thus maintain a
    seal with the gasket 11) until the ball 16 completely breaks free of the gasket 11. This
    abrupt opening of the valve can allow gas to flow abruptly through the outlet opening 13,
20  which tends to bias the piston 14 away from the valve 20. As a result, the depressor 12
    may be moved out of the opening 13, allowing the ball 16 to again contact the gasket 11
    and form a complete seal, closing the valve. This drops the pressure on the inner surface
    of the piston 14, allowing the spring 17 to move the piston 14 so the depressor 12 again
    moves the ball 16 to open the valve 20. This rapid cycling between valve open/closed
25  can cause the ball 16 to rapidly move between open and closed positions, creating a
    chattering or hammering noise. However, by having the ball 16 move away from the
    gasket 11 in a direction that is transverse to the line 121, the valve 20 may more
    gradually open, helping to prevent the abrupt pressure changes that may cause the piston
    to rapidly move between open and closed positions. As a result, chattering or
30  hammering of the valve may be reduced or eliminated.

             In another aspect of the invention, the depressor 12 may include flutes or other
    flow channels along its length to help reduce resistance to flow through the outlet
    opening 13. That is, in some embodiments, the depressor 12 may have a size and shape
    that is similar to the outlet opening 13, e.g., to help reduce a likelihood of the gasket 11
 5  being extruded through the outlet opening 13 with strong gas flow out of the valve
    chamber 5. However, to help reduce flow resistance through the outlet opening 13, the
    depressor 12 may include flow channels, such as flutes that run along a length of the
    depressor 12, to help reduce a resistance to flow out of the outlet opening 13. Other
    arrangements are possible, such as holes, depressions or other features in the depressor
10  12.
             Another aspect of the invention relates to providing a piercing lance with a front
    piercing end that is arranged to help reliably pierce gas cylinders while reducing the
    chance that a flap or other portion of the cylinder closure is formed during the piercing
    process that prevents or reduces flow from the cylinder. That is, most gas cylinders of
15  the type described above include a relatively thin metal closure (sometimes referred to as
    a cap) that is intended to be pierced to open the cylinder. With some lance arrangements,
    the cylinder closure can be pierced in such a way that a portion of the closure blocks an
    opening of the lance, preventing the exit of gas from the cylinder. In one illustrative
    embodiment, a piercing lance may include a tapered portion with first and second
20  surfaces that define an opening at the distal end of the tapered portion and are arranged to
    help prevent blockage of the opening by a portion of a cylinder closure. The first and
    second surfaces may each be arranged in respective first and second planes that are at an
    angle of 20-35 degrees relative to each other. By having the distal end of the tapered
    portion arranged in two different planes, the lance may piece a gas cylinder in a way that
25  helps prevent the formation of a flap or other part that may occlude the opening of the
    lance. For example, the first surface may be arranged in a plane that is perpendicular to a
    longitudinal axis of the tapered portion of the lance, while the second surface may be
    arranged in a plane that is transverse and non-perpendicular to the longitudinal axis, e.g.,
    at an angle of 55-70 degrees to the longitudinal axis. Such an arrangement may allow
30  the first surface to initially cut an arc in a gas cylinder closure, while the second surface
    may function to fold the cut portion of the cylinder closure away from the opening of the

   WO 2014/200881                                                           PCT/US2014/041465
                                                 - 20
    lance. This is in contrast to other lance arrangements that have a leading face of the
    lance arranged in a single plane, whether in a plane that is perpendicular or other angle
    transverse to a longitudinal axis of the lance. Such arrangements have been found in
    some circumstances to deform and/or cut the gas cylinder closure so that a flat portion of
 5  the closure is positioned over the opening of the lance. With flow of gas out of the
    cylinder and into the lance opening, the flat portion of the closure has been found to
    cover the opening, blocking flow into the opening. In contrast, arranging the lance as
    described above to have two leading faces (or more) that are at an angle to each other
    may help avoid this problem, whether by preventing the complete cutting of a part of the
10  cylinder closure and/or providing a non-planar leading face of the lance over which a
    cylinder closure portion may be positioned to block flow.
             FIG. 13 shows an exploded cross sectional view and FIG. 14 shows a perspective
    view of a lance that incorporates aspects of the invention mentioned above. The lance 25
    in this embodiment includes a body 251 with a front piercing end 252, a rear end 253
15  opposite the front piercing end, and a fluid passageway 254 extending between the front
    piercing end and the rear end. The front piercing end 252 includes a tapered portion 255
    having an opening 256 at a distal end of the tapered portion 255 and a longitudinal axis
    257. The opening 256 may have a size of about 1-3mm. The tapered portion 255 has a
    first surface 258 partially defining the opening 256 at the distal end that is arranged in a
20  plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 257 and a second surface 259 partially
    defining the opening 256 at the distal end that is arranged in a plane transverse and not
    perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 257. (A plane perpendicular to the longitudinal
    axis 257 need not be exactly 90 degrees to the longitudinal axis 257, but rather may be
    +/- 5 degrees of 90 degrees to the axis.) In one embodiment, the second surface may be
25  arranged in a plane that is at an angle of 55-70 degrees to the longitudinal axis 257
    (measured as the smallest angle between the plane and the longitudinal axis). A line that
    extends along a junction or area where the first and second surfaces 258, 259 meet may
    pass through the opening 256. For example, in one embodiment the line extending
    along an area where the first and second surfaces meet passes through a center of the
30  opening 256, although the line may define a chord of the opening 256 that does not pass
    through the center. The tapered portion may have an outer surface arranged at an angle

    to the longitudinal axis 257 as well, e.g., the outer surface may be frustoconical and
    arranged at an angle of 10-30 degrees to the longitudinal axis 257.
             The rear end 253 of the lance 25 may include a groove 265 or other feature to
    receive a gasket 264 which is arranged to provide a seal between the lance 25 and the
 5  valve body 50 when the rear end of the lance 25 is received into the inlet opening 51 of
    the valve body 50 as shown in FIG. 9. Barbs or other features 266 on the lance body 251
    may engage with the regulator body 4 to help hold the lance 25 in place relative to the
    valve body 50 and the regulator body 4. An optional filter 263 may be provided in the
    passageway 254, e.g., to help prevent relatively large particles from entering the valve
10  chamber 5. The filter 263 in this embodiment may be a solid, porous body (e.g., made of
    stainless steel and having 30 micron pores), but may be arranged in other ways such as a
    screen, membrane, etc. The filter 263 may be press fit into the passageway 254 and/or
    plastically deformed (e.g., by a punch) to help ensure the filter 263 remains firmly in the
    passageway 254.
15           In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the outer surface of the
    tapered portion may include a vent channel that extends from the first or second surface
    at the distal end to a proximal end of the tapered portion. For example, FIGs. 13 and 14
    show a vent channel 260 that is provided in the outer surface of the tapered portion 255.
    In this embodiment, the vent channel 260 may be formed by a tapered milling tool
20  (shown schematically at reference number 1000) although other arrangements are
    possible. A vent channel 260 like that shown in FIGs. 13 and 14 may provide one or
    more benefits including: 1) indicating that piercing of a gas cylinder has been successful,
    2) helping to prevent complete cutting of a flap or other piece from the gas cylinder
    closure during piercing, and/or 3) help provide venting of the gas cylinder if an attempt
25  is made to remove the cylinder from the regulator 600 prior to complete emptying of the
    cylinder. The vent channel 260 may indicate successful piercing of a cylinder by
    allowing for leakage of gas from the cylinder through the vent channel 260 before a
    gasket (such as a gasket 41 shown in FIG. 8) creates a seal between a sealing surface 261
    of the lance 25 and the gas cylinder when the gas cylinder is fully seated in the receiver
30  opening 24. That is, the tapered surface 255 typically provides at least a temporary seal
    between the lance 25 and the gas cylinder closure during piercing, but the vent channel

   WO 2014/200881                                                          PCT/US2014/041465
                                                 - 22
    260 may provide a leak path that allows gas to leak before a seal is made at the sealing
    surface 261. This leaking may be temporary and audible to the user, indicating that the
    cylinder was successfully pierced (indicated by the audible leak sound) and that a seal
    was created by the gasket 41 (indicated by the stopping of the audible leak sound). In
 5  some cases the vent channel 260 may be provided along the tapered surface 255 from a
    distal to a proximal end of the tapered surface 255, as well as along a step 262 at the
    proximal end of the tapered surface 255. The step 262 may provide a stop for
    advancement of the gas cylinder relative to the lance 25, and by providing the vent
    channel 260 along the step 262 a leak path may be established even if a leading face of
10  the gas cylinder contacts the step 262.
             The vent channel 260 may also provide for venting of a gas cylinder if the
    cylinder is removed from the lance 25 and regulator 600 before the cylinder is
    completely emptied. That is, if a cylinder is only partially used, and a user removes a
    cap or other holder so the cylinder can be removed from the receiver opening 24, high
15  pressure in the cylinder may cause the cylinder to be pushed off of the lance 25. In this
    case, the vent channel 260 may provide a leak path for gas as the cap or other holder is
    removed, allowing high pressure gas to escape as soon as a seal at the sealing surface
    261 is broken. This may alert the user that the cylinder is not yet emptied, prompting the
    user to again tighten the cover 101 or wait for further removal of the cover 101 until the
20  cylinder is fully vented.
             To explain how the vent channel 260 may help prevent complete cutting of a flap
    or other piece from a gas cylinder closure, FIGs. 15 and 16 show the lance 25 of FIGs.
    13 and 14 piercing a gas cylinder 100. In FIG. 15, the lance 25 has contacted a closure
    of the gas cylinder 100 so that the first surface 258 of the lance 25 has cut an arcuate slot
25  through the cylinder closure and a flap 105 portion of the closure has been formed and
    pushed downwardly into the cylinder. By having the first surface 258 only partially
    surround the opening 256, the first surface 258 cuts only an arcuate slot, not a completely
    circular opening. Thus, the flap 105 is formed, rather than having a complete circular
    piece cut from the closure. Also, since the second surface 259 is arranged at an angle to
30  the first surface 258, the second surface 259 may serve to bend the flap 105 downwardly
    with or without substantial further cutting of the flap 105 from remaining portions of the

   WO 2014/200881                                                          PCT/US2014/041465
                                                 - 23
    closure. Moreover, the flap 105, which may be formed as a generally flat element, is less
    likely to block the opening 256 because the first and second surfaces 258, 259 are
    arranged at an angle to each other, preventing the flat flap 105 from covering the opening
    256. Finally, since the vent channel 260 provides a disruption in the outer edge of the
 5  second surface 259, the vent channel 260 may help stop any further cutting of the flap
    105 that is performed by the second surface 259 with advancement of the cylinder into
    the receiver opening 24, and instead encourage to flap 105 to remain attached to the
    remaining part of the cylinder closure and to bend away from the opening 256.
             While a cylinder may be arranged in different ways, FIG. 15 shows an
10  embodiment of a gas cylinder 100 that includes a gasket 104, e.g., an o-ring, captured on
    a leading face of the gas cylinder 100 by a cap 103 that is threadedly engaged with a
    neck of the cylinder 100. The lance 25 may enter an opening of the cap 103 so that the
    sealing surface 261 contacts the gasket 104 and a seal is formed by the gasket 104
    between the leading face of the gas cylinder 100 and the sealing surface 261. The cap
15  103 may serve to not only keep the gasket 104 in place on the cylinder 100, but also to
    help restrain deformation of the gasket 104 when contacted by the lance 25. As
    discussed above with reference to the gasket retainer 52, by restraining deformation of
    the gasket 104, the cap 103 may help increase a contact force between the lance sealing
    surface 261 and the gasket 104, thereby providing an improved seal. In this
20  embodiment, the sealing surface 261, or a gasket-contacting portion of the lance 25, is
    proximal of the tapered portion 255 and is arranged to contact the gasket 104 to create a
    gas-tight seal between the gasket and the lance. The sealing surface 261 includes an
    annular surface arranged in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 257 of the
    lance and a cylindrical surface that extends around the longitudinal axis 257, although
25  other arrangements are possible.
             In another aspect of the invention, the tapered portion 255 or other parts of the
    lance 25 that contact metal portions of a gas cylinder 100 may have a surface finish that
    helps reduce friction between the lance 25 and the cylinder 100 during piercing. For
    example, the tapered portion 255 may have a surface finish with an average roughness of
30  16 micro-inches or better. This surface finish has been found to help the lance 25 pierce
    a gas cylinder with reduced friction, with reduced likelihood that the gas cylinder will

   WO 2014/200881                                                           PCT/US2014/041465

    "stick" to the tapered portion 255, and with reduced deformation of the cylinder closure
    at the point of penetration. That is, a high surface roughness on the tapered portion 255
    may cause the cylinder closure to "stick" to the tapered portion 255 during piercing such
    that the closure is deformed inwardly rather than being cut. By providing the tapered
 5  portion 255 with a suitable surface roughness, the cylinder closure is more likely to be
    cleanly cut during penetration rather than being deformed in a way similar to that in
    some deep drawing processes, e.g., used to form cans from metal sheets.
             Having thus described several aspects of at least one embodiment of this
    invention, it is to be appreciated various alterations, modifications, and improvements
10  will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such alterations, modifications, and
    improvements are intended to be part of this disclosure, and are intended to be within the
    spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description and drawings
    are by way of example only.
