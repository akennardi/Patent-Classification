 [Title of  Invention] SYSTEM FOR MANAGING PACKAGES OF
SHUFFLED PLAYING CARDS
 [Technical Field]
 [0001]
      The present invention relates to a system for
managing packages of   shuffled playing cards for
preventing loss or replacement of the packages of the
cards while casinos using the packages of a number of
cards are operated, in the casinos, and card game
facilities using other card game tables.
 [Background Art]
 [0002]
      There are baccarat and blackjack in a number of live
table games performed in casinos or game facilities.     In
these games, standard decks each including fifty-two
playing cards are used, and the cards are usually
distributed from a shooter including the plurality of
decks   (six to nine or ten decks) shuffled in accordance
with the start   of play.  When an operator (hereinafter
described as a   "dealer (D)I) of a casino distributes
playing cards to a game table in order to use them in
such a game, a result of the game is decided by
arrangement of the cards of the plurality of decks from

                               -  2
the shooter    (a  winner or a victor).     Before the casino
uses these packages for such a purpose, game cards of a
predetermined number of decks are shuffled in random
order   (arrangement), and are individually packed in one
package.
 [0003]
      Shortage and exchange of the cards must not occur in
the casino.     This is because when someone reads
arrangement of the cards included in the package, and
returns the package to the casino, he can predict a
result of a game at the time of the dealer         (D) using the
read package.
      In order to ensure a fair game by preventing the
shortage and exchange of the packages of the shuffled
game cards in the casino, the casino manages the packages
of the shuffled game cards, and appropriately performs
the game at the table      (i.e.,   exchange of the packages of
the shuffled game cards, other unexpected or unauthorized
acts,   etc. are eliminated) .      Packages of shuffled game
cards are well-known, and are disclosed in Patent
Literature 1     (US Patent Application Publication No.
2010/0327525).

 [Description of Embodiment]
 [0011]
      Details of the present invention will be explained
hereinafter.   However, the following detailed explanation
and accompanying drawings do not limit the invention.
 [0012] Explanation of preferred      embodiment
<Example 1>
      An embodiment of a system for managing a package 2
of shuffled playing cards ls will be explained
hereinafter.   Figure 1 is a perspective view of:        the
package 2 of the shuffled playing cards 1s;         a reader R
that reads a bar code 3     (as an ID code 4) of the package
2 of the shuffled playing cards 1s;        a card shooter device
S used in a table game in a casino;        and a storage box
that manages the after-mentioned package 2 of the
shuffled playing cards    1s.     Figure  2a is  a diagram

                             - 8
showing an outline of a whole system for managing
packages of shuffled playing cards of the embodiment of
the present invention.
 [0013]
      The respective shuffled playing cards ls include a
predetermined number of decks      (usually, six, eight, nine,
or ten decks),   are shuffled in random order and arranged
in unique and random arrangement order, and are packed so
as to be the package 2 to which a uniquely identifiable
shuffle card ID    (the bar code 3, a RFID tag, or the like)
has been attached as the    ID code 4   in a factory 5.  In
this example, the ID code 4 is attached to the package 2
in a form of the bar code 3     (a two-dimensional code as a
QR Code   (registered trademark) may be employed) read by
the bar code reader R and the other RFID tag reading
means   (not shown) of the card shooter device S, or in a
form, such as the RFID tag.     The package 2 is sealed by a
sealing material or a shrink packaging material at      the
factory 5.
 [0014]
      A management control device 7 in a casino 6 is used
to manage whether or not the package 2 is      lost, or
whether or not the number of the packages 2 is more
increased than the number of packages 2 accepted in a
backyard 8 of the casino 6.      If the package 2 is lost or
missing, in order to win a game, the following acts may
be performed:   someone tears the package 2 to then read

                              - 9
order of cards in the package 2; he mixes his own cards
in the cards in the package 2;      or he exchanges   several
cards in the package 2 so that the cards distributed to
himself are previously arranged in certain arrangement,
and returns the package used at the game table to a pit
or the table of the casino.       In order to solve the above
described problem, there is provided a system for
managing or monitoring the packages 2 of all the shuffled
playing cards in the casino 6 using the management
control device 7.
 [0015]
      The packages 2 to which the bar codes 3 have been
attached as the unique ID codes are supplied to the
backyard 8 of the casino 6.      All the   ID codes 4 of the
packages 2 carried to the backyard 8 are registered in a
database 7b    (a memory etc.)  of the management control
device 7   (as a registration step of registering all      the
ID codes 4 in the database).       All the  ID codes 4  (the bar
codes 3   (they may be two-dimensional codes as QR Codes))
of the packages 2 carried to the backyard 8 at this        stage
are registered to create a basic database.         In order to
register all the ID codes of the packages 2 supplied to
the casino 6, data from the factory, an after-mentioned
carton ID code 30,    or an after-mentioned pallet ID 40 may
be used instead of reading all the bar codes 3 of the
packages.    In carrying-out of the present invention, a
camera 12 or an RFID tag reading device        (not shown) may

                             - 10
be used instead of a bar code reader       (not shown) in order
to register or read the ID code 4.       The packages may be
carried from the factory etc. as a carton CA in a state
where eighteen packages of the      shuffled playing cards is
(refer to Figure 3) are present      (several cartons CA may
be put on a pallet    PA) . The carton   ID code  30 or the
pallet ID 40 may be used to register the       ID codes of the
packages 2 carried to the backyard 8 from the        factory 5.
 [0016]
      The packages 2 each with the bar codes 3 are stored
in the cartons CA while being carried to the casino 6,
the cartons CA are put on the pallet PA, and then the
packages 2 are stored in the backyard 8       (refer to Figure
3).   The unique carton ID code 30     is attached to each
carton CA, and the unique pallet ID 40 is attached to
each pallet PA.    The carton ID code 30    is associated with
the ID codes of the packages stored in the carton CA, and
is previously registered in the database 7b of the
management control device 7.      The pallet ID 40    is
associated with the corresponding carton ID code 30 on
the pallet PA and the ID codes 4 of the packages 2 stored
in the carton CA, and is previously registered in the
database 7b of the management control device 7.          All the
ID codes 4 of the packages 2 are associated with the
carton ID code 30 of the carton CA in which the packages
2 have been stored, and the pallet ID 40.
 [0017]

                                 -  11
       The packages 2 are usually carried to a game table
pit 10    from the backyard 8 by a plurality of trolleys 9
while they are stored in the cartons CA             (refer to Figure
2b),   are taken out from the cartons CA in the game table
pit 10,     are stored for a certain period, and subsequently,
the packages 2 are manually taken out from the game table
pit 10 by a dealer        (D) etc.,   are put on the game table 11,
and are used at the game table.             The ID codes 4 of all
the packages of       the shuffled playing cards       (or the carton
ID codes 30 of the cartons CA in which the packages 2 are
stored) are read by the camera 12 or bar code readers 451,
551, 651,     and 751 at a predetermined place, and thereby
all the packages 2        (or the cartons CA in which the
packages 2 are stored) present in the casino 6 are
monitored.      The monitoring camera 12 is arranged or
installed in order to be able to read from the backyard 8
the bar codes 3       (as the ID codes) of all the existing
packages 2 of the shuffled playing cards present in the
game table pit 10        (or the carton ID codes 30 of the
cartons CA in which the packages 2 are stored).
 [0018]
       In the carrying-out of the present invention, the
trolley 9 carries the packages 2 of the shuffled playing
cards 1s used for a game from the backyard 8 to the game
table   pit   10.  In   addition,   a plurality    of AGVs
 (automatic conveying vehicles) may be used as the trolley
9.    Usually, although the packages 2 are carried to the

                               -  12
game table pit 10 from the backyard 8 in a state of being
stored in the cartons CA       (refer to Figure 2b),      the
embodiment is not limited to this, and it         is also
possible to carry the packages 2 while being placed on
the trolley 9 as they are        (refer to Figure 2c).        The
plurality of packages 2     (at least eighteen or thirty-six
packages) are stored in each game table pit 10,             and are
manually carried to the game table 11 from there.               When
the trolley 9 carries the plurality of cartons CA or
packages 2 from the backyard 8 to each game table pit 10,
they are carried through a programmed delivery route 13
in the casino 6.    In so doing, the trolley 9 holding the
cartons CA or the packages 2 is monitored by the
management control device 7 by using the         camera 12 etc.
at a predetermined certain place of the delivery route 13
in the casino 6.    In addition, ID code readers 651 and
751  (other reading devices may be used) that read at
predetermined timing the carton ID codes 30 of the
cartons CA including the packages 2 or the bar codes 3
(as the ID codes) of the packages 2 may be installed
inside the trolley 9, and it is also possible to monitor
the packages 2 or the cartons CA placed on the trolley 9
by the ID code readers 651 and 751         (refer to Figures 2b
and 2c) .  Further,  the trolley     9 may have a   structure      of
having transmission means       655 and 755 for reading at
predetermined timing the carton ID codes 30 of the
cartons CA including the packages 2 or the bar codes 3

                             -  13
(as the ID codes) of    the packages 2, and for transmitting
results of   the reading to an outside or communicating
with the outside.    Inside the trolley 9, the plurality of
readers 651 and 751 are installed at scanning means 653,
753,  and 754,  the scanning means 653,   753, and 754 move
in an X direction and a Y direction, thereby each reader
moves in the X direction and the Y direction, and the
carton ID codes 30 of all the cartons CA or the bar codes
3 of the packages 2 that are stored in the trolley 9
always continue   to be read.    Lids 652 and 752 of the
trolley 9 include keys 656 and 756, and the cartons CA
and the packages 2 inside the trolley 9 can be prevented
from being taken out by locking the keys 656 and 756.
 [0019]
      The management control device 7 is achieved by
computer equipment    (as a management control device having
the following functions),     and functions of methods and
processes are achieved by installing in a computer a
program executed by a computer processor.      The management
control device 7 performs management as follows.
 [0020]
      1) A registration step of registering in the
database 7b all   the ID codes 4 of the packages 2 carried
to the backyard 8.    In order to register all the ID codes
4 of the packages 2 supplied to the casino 6, data from
the factory, the carton ID codes 30,     or the pallet  ID 40
can be used instead of reading all the bar codes 3 of the

                            -   14
packages 2 or reading the     ID codes 4 by the camera 12 or
the RFID tag reading device      (not shown) . A two
dimensional code reader as a QR Code reader can be used
for carrying out the present invention instead of the bar
code reader   (not shown).
      2) A management step of reading all the     ID codes 4
of the packages 2 carried to the game table pit 10 by
obtaining the respective ID codes 4 of all the existing
packages 2 of the shuffled game cards by the       ID code
readers 451 and 551   (the camera 12 or the other reading
device can be used) in the game table pit 10,       and of
monitoring the respective ID codes 4 of all the existing
packages 2 of the shuffled game cards at the game table
pit 10.
 [0021]
      In the management step in the game table pit 10,      it
is inspected whether or not all the      ID codes 4 of the
packages 2 are carried in the backyard 8 for the first
time, and are registered in the database 7b.       An image
obtained by the monitoring camera 12      is sent to the
management control device 7 by a transmission device       (by
wired or wireless communication),      is analyzed by the
management control device 7, and is confirmed as a proof
that all the ID codes 4 of all      the packages 2 in the
image, and the   ID codes 4 monitored by the monitoring
camera 12 or read by the bar code readers 651 and 751 are
actually present in the game table pit 10.       The image is

                             -  15
obtained by the monitoring camera 12,      and is transmitted
at predetermined timing     (for example, every five minutes,
every hour,   or the like).    The management  control device
7 makes all the    ID codes 4 of all the existing packages 2
obtained by the monitoring camera 12 or read by the bar
code readers 651 and 751 coincide with registered
registration ID codes 4 of the packages 2 stored in the
database 7b at predetermined timing      (for example, every
five minutes, every hour, or the like) in each game table
pit 10.   The registration ID codes 4 of the packages 2 in
the database 7b are basic data considered to be present
in the casino 6 as the packages 2 carried       (or the
packages 2 seem to be carried) to the backyard 8.
 [0022]
      The ID codes 4 of the packaged 2 in the game table
pit 10 are checked each time when each package 2 reaches
the game table pit 10    for monitoring   (normally, in a
state where the packages 2 are stored in the carton CA)
and when the package 2 alone is taken away from the game
table pit 10.    The packages 2 in the game table pit 10
are monitored by the management control device 7 even at
timing decided whether or not the packages 2 are present
in the game table pit 10     (for example, every minute,
every five minutes, every hour, or every longer time).
The storage box 401 can be used to store the plurality of
packages 2   (or the cartons CA including the packages) of
the shuffled game cards, and to monitor the ID codes 4

                                  - 16
 (or the carton ID codes 30)        attached to the packages in
the game table pit 10.
 [0023]
        The package 2 present in the game table pit 10         is
manually carried to the game table 11 by the dealer             (D)
etc.,    and is put on the game table in order to use it for
a game     (for example, baccarat game).         When the shuffled
playing cards ls are used for the game at the game table
11,   the package 2 is unpacked and is installed in the
card shooter device S in order to be able to pull out the
shuffled playing cards ls one by one from the card
shooter device      S  (refer   to Figure    1).  During the game,
the dealer      (D) pulls out cards 1 from the card shooter
device S, and distributes them to the game table 11.
 [0024]
        Just before the package 2 is torn on the game table
11,   the ID code 4 of the package 2 is read by the bar
code reader R of the card shooter device S in order to
authenticate the ID code 4 of the package 2 having used
at each game table 11         (the ID code 4 of the package 2
used next     is read as mentioned later, and the package 2
is  set   to be   "used").    The registered     ID code 4 of the
package 2 in the database is deleted from the database 7b,
or the package 2 is authenticated to have been used at
each game table 11 and then registered when selected so
as to be used for the next game at the playing table 11,
and is read by the bar code reader R.             The ID code 4 of

                            - 17
the package 2 read to be used next is inspected by the
management control device 7 as    follows:  whether or not
the package 2 should be normally present at the game
table 11;  or by determining the package 2 to be at    least
one of the   following cases, whether or not the package 2
has been delivered at normal timing; whether or not the
package 2 is the irregular suspicious one;     whether or not
the package 2 should be on the game table 11;     or whether
the package 2 has not arrived at regular timing or for a
regular period   (it has not arrived at a normal expected
time).
 [0025]
      1) Whether or not the package 2 has been carried via
the predetermined delivery route 13,
      2) Whether or not the package 2 is the missing one
until now,
      3) Whether or not the package 2 has been registered,
      4) Whether or not the package 2 has been unused in
the game table pit 10 exceeding for a determined period,
      5) Whether or not the package 2 has been carried
from the unexpected game table pit 10,     or whether it has
been carried via no game table pit 10,
      6) Whether the package 2 is not used at any game
table 11 in the past.
 [0026]
      The ID code reader  (the bar code reader R is
included) is connected to a control device 112 on the

                            - 18
game table 11.    The suspicious package 2 is detected by
the management control device 7 from inspection results
of the ID code 4 of the package 2.    Presence of     the
suspicious package 2 is reported to the card shooter
device S   (or the other shuffle device etc.)   so that     the
detected suspicious package 2 is not used.     The card
shooter device S may include output means of alarm or a
notice based on the inspection results of the      ID code 4
of the package 2 in order not to use the suspicious
package 2, or to stop further use of the package 2.          The
management   step may further include a step of managing
whether or not all the registered ID codes 4 of the
packages 2 in the database 7b have been erased, or
whether or not the packages 2 have been authenticated to
be used at any game table 11 for a certain fixed period
(whether or not there are any packages 2 not used at the
game table for the certain fixed period    (one week, one
month,  or the like)  . The ID code reader R is   directly     or
indirectly connected to the card shooter device S on the
game table 11,   and is configured so as to send the       ID
code 4 of the package 2 to the management control device
7 in order to identify the ID code 4 of the package 2 to
be used next, and the card shooter device S receives a
command from the management control device 7.
 [0027]
      The management control device 7 collates all the ID
codes 4 of all the existing packages 2 or the packages 2

                             - 19
included in the carton CA that have been obtained by the
readers 451 and 551 in each game table pit 10 with the
registration ID codes 4 of the packages 2 in the database
7b at predetermined timing     (every five minutes, every
hour, or the like).     The registration ID codes 4 of the
packages 2 in the database 7b are basic data considered
to be present in the casino 6 as the packages 2 carried
(seem to be carried) to the backyard 8.      All the ID codes
4 of all the existing packages 2 or the packages 2
included in the carton CA that have been obtained by the
readers 451 and 551 in each game table pit 10 are
collated with the registration ID codes 4 of the packages
2 in the database 7b, whereby monitoring of all the
package 2 present in the game table pit 10 or the
packages 2 included in the carton CA is performed at
determined timing    (every five minutes, or not more than
or not less  than that)   . The management  control device  7
can check whether or not there are remaining packages 2
missing or considered not to be present in the game table
pit 10.   The management control device 7 may report
results of the above-described management      (collation
results thereof) to a management department of the casino
6.
 [0028]
      In monitoring and obtaining of the    ID codes 4,  it
can be confirmed whether or not all the registration ID
codes 4 of the packages 2 of the shuffled playing cards

                           - 20
have been deleted for appropriate timing, with the
shuffled playing cards being determined to be used ones
after the end of the game, by comparing all the ID codes
4 with the  ID codes 4 of the new packages 2 carried to
the backyard 8.   If one of the ID codes 4 of the packages
2 is not deleted, or is not authenticated to be used, it
means that the casino has inappropriate or suspicious
stock.
 [0029]
      The image obtained by the monitoring camera 12 may
be analyzed by the management control device 7 as follows.
      1) All the bar codes 3 relating to the ID codes 4 of
all the packages 2 in the   image are recognized.
      2) The bar codes 3 identified by a bar code reading
program are read as the ID codes 4.
      3) Each ID code 4 is registered together with a read
place as a proof of the presence of the packages 2 at
predetermined timing, such as every five minutes or every
hour.
      4) All the ID codes 4 of all the existing packages 2
obtained by the monitoring camera 12 are collated with
the registration ID codes 4 of the packages 2 stored in
the database 7b.
      5) In the database, it is calculated whether or not
all the registration ID codes 4 of the packages 2
considered to have been carried to the backyard 8 and to

                              - 21
have been present in the casino 6, or whether or not the
ID codes 4 of the packages 2 remain.
        6) The management control device 7 may report
results of the above-described management to the
management department of the casino 6.
 [0030]
        The calculated ID codes = all the ID codes 4 of the
packages 2 carried to      (unloaded in) the backyard 8 and
registered -     (minus) all the ID codes 4 of the packages 2
obtained by the camera 12 or the bar code readers R, 451,
551,    651 and 751 also including the    ID codes 4 erased or
authenticated to be used.       These calculations are
performed at all places      (all in the backyard 8,      in the
game table pit 10,     at the game table 11,     and on the
trolley    9 of each place).    The ID codes  4,   the number of
the packages lost after the presence of the packages has
been confirmed, places where the lost packages have been
present     (last places where the presence of the packages
have been confirmed)     are reported.   Monitoring    results
etc. of missing, the remaining ID codes 4, and the number
of the other existing packages may be displayed by a
monitor display 60 in the management department etc.
 [0031]
        In these steps of managing the packages 2 of the
shuffled playing cards, each ID code 4 of the packages 2
on the delivery route 13,      and all the trolleys 9 that
carry the packages 2 or the cartons CA from the backyard

                            - 22
8 may be monitored by the camera 12,    and further, it is
also possible to decide a place of the trolley 9 by a
sensor   (not shown), and to control the trolley 9 by an
automatic conveying vehicle system known as an AGV system
technology.
 [0032]
      The management control device 7 is programmed to
monitor each ID code 4 of the actual package 2.     In
addition, the management control device 7 calculates and
registers each individual    ID code 4 at all places based
on the places from all the existing actual ID codes 4,
and information obtained and analyzed by the camera 12
and the management control device 7, and thereby
registration IDs of the respective places obtained by the
monitoring camera are compared with each other, whereby
the lost ID codes 4 can be recognized.
 [0033]
      The method further includes a monitoring step of
managing the number of all the existing packages 2 of the
shuffled playing cards in the backyard 8, and the game
table pits 10 and the game tables 11 of all the play
tables, and grasping whether or not the packages on the
trolley 9 are lost during a carrying step by comparing
all the actual   ID codes 4 on the respective trolleys 9
with information of all the ID codes of the packages
obtained when the packages are carried to the backyard 8.
 [0034]

                            - 23
     The management step is very important for safe
operation of the casino.    All the existing actual ID
codes 4 are compared with information of the     ID codes 4
of all the packages obtained when the packages 2 are
carried to the backyard 8    (or all the game table pits 10
or game tables 11 of   the playing tables),  and thereby it
is recognized whether or not there is a lost package or
an additional package at all the places.     As a result,
all the actual packages 2 of the shuffled playing cards
are managed in the backyard 8,    in all the game table pits
10 or game tables 11 of the playing tables, and thereby
it is ensured that all the packages in the casino are
controlled.
[0035]
     Before the shuffled playing cards 1s are set in the
card shooter device S,   a cut card 1c is inserted
thereinto.   The cut card 1c is inserted into a latter
half  (the remaining portion is approximately one-quarter
or one-fifth) of the   shuffled playing cards 1s when used
for the game.   In order to prevent that ranks of the
respective cards 1 distributed during the game are
counted by players etc.,   and that ranks of the cards that
have not been drawn yet are predicted when they run short,
the cut card 1c is used to end the game in a state where
approximately twenty to forty cards are left in the card
shooter device S.   Usually, when the cut card 1c is drawn
during the game, use of the currently used shuffled

                                -  24
playing cards is     is canceled after the game or a little
after the game, and the game is ended.          The shuffled
playing cards 1s     in the card shooter device S are
exchanged for a new set,       and a game is newly started.
 [0036]
      In the example, the game table pit 10 is         installed
at the side of the game table 11,        and includes a storage
box 401.     The package 2 used in a next game is housed in
the storage box 401,       and the dealer  (D) takes out the
package 2 used in the next game from the          storage box 401,
and sets the shuffled playing cards 1s in the card
shooter device S.      Therefore, the storage box 401 is put
beside the dealer      (D) at the side of the game table 11.
 [0037]
      In addition to the storage box 401,        a carton cabinet
501 that stores the cartons CA may be further included.
The plurality of      (eighteen) packages 2 used in games from
the next time are stored in the storage box 401           (refer to
Figure   11).   The unopened carton CA including       the
plurality of     (eighteen) packages 2 is stored in the
carton cabinet     501  (refer   to Figure 5) .  The carton   ID
code 30    is attached to the carton CA, and the carton ID
code 30 attached to the carton CA always continues to be
read by the reader 551 installed in the carton cabinet
501.    The carton CA stored in the carton cabinet 501 is
taken out from the carton cabinet 501 in order to be used
in the next game after all the packages 2 in the storage

                            - 25
box 401 are used, the whole carton CA is moved to the
storage box 401 of the game table pit 10,     and the
packages 2 in the carton CA are used for the game.
 [0038]
      Next, there will be explained a method for housing
the carton CA into the storage box 401, and a method for
taking out the packages 2 used in the next game from the
storage box 401.
 [0039]
      After all the packages 2 in the storage box 401 are
used, a top lid 452a is opened, a leg 461 of a rotary lid
452b is pulled out to the    front, the rotary lid 452b is
rotated by 90 degrees to make it parallel to a floor
surface, and the leg 461 of the rotary lid 452b is stood
vertically to a floor surface     (refer to Figure 6).
 [0040]
      In a state where the rotary lid 452b is made
parallel to the   floor surface, the carton CA taken out
from the carton cabinet 501 is     installed on a back
surface of the rotary lid 452b     (refer to Figure 7).   At
this time, the carton CA is installed so that      the ID
codes 4 attached to the packages 2 included in the carton
CA appear on upper surfaces of the packages 2.       Packaging
of the carton CA is removed, and the ID codes 4 attached
to the packages  2  are exposed  (refer  to Figure  8) . Next,
gaps are formed between lines of the arranged packages 2,
projections 472 of a partition plate 471 are fitted in

                                  - 26
the gaps, and the partition plate 471 is             installed on the
upper surfaces of the packages           (refer to Figures 9 and
10).    Hereby, since a state where the gaps are present
between the packages 2 can be kept,           there is an effect of
making each package 2 easily taken out from the storage
box 401 later.     Here, tips of the projections 472 of the
partition plate 471 are each formed in a pointed shape,
and thereby it becomes possible to easily fit them
between the packages 2        (refer to Figure 9b).
 [0041]
      Next, the rotary lid 452b is rotated by 90 degrees
to thereby be returned to an original position.               The top
lid  452a is   then closed     (refer   to Figure    11) .  The
plurality of readers 451 are installed at scanning means
453 inside the storage box 401, each reader moves in a Z
direction by the scanning means 453 moving in the Z
direction, and the ID codes 4 of all the packages 2
stored in the storage box 401 always continue              to be read
 (refer to Figure 10).
 [0042]
      The game is ended as described above, and in order
to newly begin a game, the dealer           (D) exchanges a set of
the shuffled playing cards 1s in the card shooter device
S for a new set.     In order to exchange for the new set,
the dealer    (D) opens the top lid 452a of the storage box
401, and takes out the package 2 stored in the storage
box 401 by his    hand  (refer      to Figure  12) .   Next,  the

                             -   27
dealer   (D) reads the  ID code 4 of the package 2 newly
taken out from the storage box 401 by the reader R
included in the control device 112,      opens the package 2,
and sets the shuffled playing cards 1s in the card
shooter device S    (refer to Figure 1).
 [0043]
      As mentioned above, since the     ID codes 4 of all the
packages 2 stored in the storage box 401 always continue
to be read by the reader 451 in the       storage box 401,  it
is grasped which package 2 having which ID code 4 was
taken out when the dealer      (D) takes out the package 2
from the storage box 401.       It is determined whether or
not the grasped ID code 4 and the ID code 4 of the
package 2 used next read by the reader R       included in the
control device   112 coincide with each other, whereby it
can be confirmed whether or not the package 2 taken out
from the storage box 401 at the last minute is the
package 2 used for the next game by the card shooter
device S.
 [0044]
      Keys 456 and 556 are included in a lid 552      of the
carton cabinet 501 and the top lid 452a of the storage
box 401,   and the packages 2 in the storage box 401 and
the carton CA in the carton cabinet 501 can be prevented
from being taken out by locking the keys 456 and 556.          In
addition, a gap 462 is provided in a lower part of       the

                               - 28
storage box 401,      and packaging materials removed from the
cartons CA can be temporarily stored.
 [0045]
      Results of continuing to read the carton ID code 30
of the carton CA stored in the carton cabinet 501 by the
reader 551, and results of continuing to read the           ID
codes 4 of the packages 2 stored in the storage box 401
by the reader 451 are reported to the management control
device 7 through the control device 112.
 [0046]
      Further, means for displaying the reading results of
the ID codes 4 of the packages 2 stored in the storage
box 401 and the      reading results of the carton ID code 30
of the carton CA stored in the carton cabinet 501           (a
storage box lamp 483,      a storage box monitor 482,     etc.)
may be provided in the storage box 401 and the carton
cabinet  501  (refer    to Figure  5 etc.)   . Furthermore,   it is
also possible to display on the storage box monitor 482
the results of management by the management control
device 7, and a message sent from the management
department.    Note that the means       for displaying the
reading results, such as the storage box lamp 483 and the
storage box monitor 482 may be installed at a place for
the dealer   (D) to easily see during the game, for example,
near the top lid 452a.
