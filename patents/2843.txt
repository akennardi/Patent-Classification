TITLE
A method for detecting genetic variants related to hydrochlorothiazide using exome
sequencing data.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides a method for detecting 30 genetic variants related to
hydrochlorothiazide using exome sequencing data. To be more specific, the invention
provides a method that uses information we obtain on exome sequence data to identify and
evaluate possible genetic markers for hydrochlorothiazide for individuals.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Thiazide diuretics have been recommended as a first-line antihypertensive treatment,
although the choice of 'the right drug in the individual essential hypertensive patient'
still remains empirical. Essential hypertension is a complex, polygenic disease derived
from the interaction of patient's genetic background with the environment.
Pharmacogenomics could be a useful tool to pinpoint gene variants involved in
antihypertensive drug response, thus optimizing therapeutic advantages and
minimizing side effects.
Randomized trials on antihypertensive therapy do not show clinically relevant
differences between drug classes, with regard to the ability of lowering blood pressure
(BP), so that the choice of the 'right medication in the individual patient' remains
empirical  [ll. Thiazide diuretics remain a cornerstone of antihypertensive treatment, as
they are effective, relatively safe and substantially well tolerated for the management
of hypertension    [2], On the contrary, the mechanism to explain the well documented
                                               1

antihypertensive effects of thiazides is not fully understood.Moreover,regulation of
body sodium and blood pressure (BP) is achieved through the interaction of several
mechanisms, including sodium (Na) transport at the basolateral and luminaltubular
cell membranes along specific nephron segments. Moreover, physical, nervous, and
hormonal mechanismsmodulate this constitutive capacity of tubular cells to transport
Na according to the body's needs. The known target of thiazide diuretics is the Na
K-Cl transport in the distal tubule of the nephron, where they reduce the reabsorption
of sodium from the renal tubules, resulting in increased excretion of water and
electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium. Thiazides reduce
arterial peripheral resistance by activating calcium-activated potassium channels and
inhibiting several carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue, thus causing vasodilatation
[3]
After a large number of literature inquiries,we eventually screened out 30
hydrochlorothiazide related gene locus, mainly including thea-adducin gene
polymorphism (Gly460Trp)          [4], NEDD4   [5][6], KCNJI,Aldosteronesynthase
gene(CYPl 1B2)       [7], Angiotensin converting enzyme gene(ACE)              [4], Angiotensinogen
gene(AGT)". The effect of hydrochlorothiazide on reducing blood pressure was
analyzed by SNP analysis.
Compared with whole exome sequencing, this method is specifically used for
sequencing individualized therapy genes related to hydrochlorothiazide, filling the
gap ofindividualized medication of hydrochlorothiazide,               and providing
recommendations for physicians to prescribe drugs for patients.Through the
inspection method which specially designed for testing 30 locus,it has the advantages
of high efficiency, meets the requirements of high-flux, and greatly reduces the
detection time and the cost.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Providing a method for detecting genetic variants related to hydrochlorothiazide, this
invention aims at establishing a personalized medicationinstruction for thisdiureticat the
genetic level.We conducted a systematic search on three main databases to target 30 locus
related to the effect of hydrochlorothiazide treatment. After that, tools includingFastQC,
BWA, Picard-tools, GATK,ANNOVAR, and a Perl program we developed will be used
toidentify and analyze an individual's genetic variants which are related to the effect of
                                                     3

hydrochlorothiazide, by comparing the individual's 30 gene locus to reference genomeWith
the help of this invention, the doctor will be able to know the patient's individual condition
before treatment plan begins,which is the foundation of personalized medicine and can
increase the safety of patients as well aslower overall costs.
To achieve the purpose, the present invention reveals a new method of detecting gene
mutation connected with resistance based on exome sequence processing by the following
steps:
1. Extracting the targeted locus. In order to get the targeted locus which are relating to the
    effect of hydrochlorothiazide treatment, a systematic research was conducted in three
    database:PharmGKB, PubMed, and MEDLINE.Identified articles went through the
    processes of duplication removal and filtration using include/exclude criteria, and
    targeted locus were selected.
2.  Rough quality controlling. Raw read starts from the process of rough quality controlling.
    in which FastQC, a quality control tool, will be used. Clean read could be attained
    through the elimination of adapters and low-quality read.
3.  Mapping of the original reads.Clean data then will come into mapping, which is the
    beginning point of identification of the gene. Initially, raw read presents in the format of a
    FASTQ file, and Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) will be used to map the sequences in
    it against reference genome.Based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform,
    BWA is a read alignment package that efficiently align short sequences to human
    genome.After that, the reads become clear to be processed.The result of mapping will
    present as a SAM (sequence alignment) file.
4.  Preprocessing of the genome sequence. After step 1, data will go through preprocessing,
    in which we will use Picard-toolsand GATK.Picard is a set of command line tools, with
    the help of which we can manipulate high-throughput sequencingdata to sort the SAM
                                                 4

    file as well as marking the duplications. Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a software
    from Broad Institute for analysis of second-generation resequencing, and it has many
    tools with multiple functions, which will be used in the following sections of
    preprocessing. The BAM file we retrieve after sorting and duplication markingwill be put
    into RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner to realign INDELs, so that the incorrect
    match sequence and the missing part of sequence can be ruled out. Subsequently, to
    improve the quality of sequence, we evaluate the mass of the sequence by using
    BaseRecalibrator and PrintReads. Then comes the last step of preprocessing, in which we
    determine coverage histograms by operating DepthOfCoverage.
5. Recognition of mutation positions. First, SNVs and Indelsare identified through
    HaplotypeCaller. After that, filtration is conducted with the help of three tools of GATK,
    SelectVariants, VariantFiltration, and CombineVariants.Thenwe annotate the mutation
    positions through comparing the mutation database by usingANNOVAR. Finally, the
    mutation position related with hydrochlorothiazide will be selected by a Perl program that
    can select mutation positions according to needs. The result can provide doctors reference
    before they start treatment, so patients can get more personalized therapy.

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) is a common diuretic medication for high blood pressure
treatment. However, patients' respond toward HCT treatment significantly vary along
with genetic polymorphism. In order to get the targeted locus on which we will
conduct gene identification and annotation latter, we performed a systematic search
on three main database.
Search Strategy
A systematic search was conducted in the following databases: PharmGKB, PubMed,
and MEDLINE. In order to conduct a thorough systematic search about locus which
affect Hydrochlorothiazide medication, multiple searches were undertaken using the
following terms: "Hydrochlorothiazide AND/OR locus" "Hydrochlorothiazide
AND/OR gene" "HydrochlorothiazideAND/OR effect AND/OR locus"
"HydrochlorothiazideAND/OR efficacy AND/OR locus"
"HydrochlorothiazideAND/OR toxicity AND/OR locus".
242 articles were identified after the search of databases. After duplication removal
and screening for potential locus with inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 locus were
selected. (See Fig.2 and Table 1)

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Articles were included when they were: 1) English-written clinical trials (including
nonrandomized open trials and randomized controlled trials) or review article; 2)
studied the effect of Hydrochlorothiazide treatment at the gene level; and 3) published
between 20<removed-date>.
Locus were included when they annotations were based on at least a single significant
(not yet replicated) study or annotation for a variant-drug combination evaluated in
multiple studies. They were excluded when they were only based on a case report.
Rough Quality Controlling
Using FASTQC wipe off low quality of data to gain cleaner reads.Test data fastq file
areT_1.fastq, T_2.fastq. Operate the IFAETQC, generate four files in the fastqc directory.
         -fastqc -f fastq T_1.fastq T_2.fastq -t 10 -o fastqc

Step 2: The last step is to annotation using Perl which can help people to view the data
clearly (gene based, region based, filter based).

Due to the large amount of database, use the Perl to operate the database that you want to
see. This way is much easier for us to achieve genetic variants related to hydrochlorothiazide.
This step is an example to show how to output the rs number in the region 30000000
320000000.
