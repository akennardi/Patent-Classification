ABSTRACT;
A pair of bolt on angled handlebar/risers extension devices assembly to enable the adjustment in a
forward or backward tilted angle position of welded-on (or integrated) motorcycle handlebar/risers and or
handlebar risers.The devices are fastened inbetween the handlebar/risers assembly(or handlebar risers
assembly) and the upper section of the triple clamp assembly of the vehicle.

Description;
Field of invention
 The present invention relates to a pair of bolt on angled extension devices for welded-on (or integrated)
handlebars/risers assembly and or handlebar risers.
Background of invention
Welded-on or integrated motorcycle handlebar/risers assembly (some commonly known as
"T bars"handlebars or "Drag bars") offers no adjustment whatsoever to the motorcycle rider for comfort
or riding position.Motorcycle manufacturers fit those motorcycle handlebar/risers assembly on some of
their models as a one size fit all.However everybody has a different morphology,a taller person won't
need as much handlebar grip reach as a shorter person would or setting up the handlebar/risers assembly
to the individual's need is not possible. In a long ride the riding position of those handlebars can also
become tiring for the riders arms and discomfort may occur. The only costly remedie would be to buy
and swap for a different type of handlebar/risers assembly.
The present invention solves the adjustment problems associated with welded-on (or
integrated)motorcyle handlebar/risers assembly (also handlebar risers or the like)by providing a secured
tilting angle adjustment forward or backward(also a higher handlebar position) for a better handlebars
grip reach from which results in a more comfortable riding position.Because the adjustable angled bolt
on handlebar extension devices were designed not only to solve the problems as mentioned above but
they were also designed to easily be installed by anyone with a basic mechanical knowledge.
  Two comprising ,two sets of angled rod (ergonomically designed for the different needs and/or choices
of riding position)having and upper male threaded section to couple with the lower section but is also
drilled to accept a recessed inner bolt to fasten the device onto the lower end of the welded-on(or
integrated) handlebar/risers assembly or handlebar risers or the like and a lower section of the device is
female threaded to couple with the upper section.The lower section of the device is cut in a specific angle
and threaded to accept different bolt threads commercially available.
The devices bolts straight onto the lower end of the welded-on(or integrated) handlebar risers(some model
known as T-bars handlebars or welded-on Drag bars)and/or motorcycle handlebar risers assembly by
tightening the upper section of the devices from the inner recessed bolt after the angle position had been
chosen(to adjust to the desired riding position angle,the upper section of the angled handlebar extension
will be twisted along the axis in a clockwise or anti-clockwise position for a forward or backward riding
position).
 The lower part of the devices is then coupled with the upper section by thightening the upper and lower
sections of the devices together to form the bolt-on angled extension devices.The set- up; welded on (or
integrated)handlebar/risers assembly,and/or handlebar risers,are then secured from the upper section of
the vehicles triple clamp assembly.

CLAIMS;
1- A pair of adjustable bolt-on angled handlebar/risers extension devices assembly to provide riding
adjustment for welded-on(or integrated) motorcycle Handlebar/risers assembly and or risers assembly for
a motorcycle and or the like ofusing handlebars for steering purposes.
 2-The pair of adjustable bolt-on angled handlebar/risers extension devices assembly for welded-on(or
integrated) motorcycle handlebar/risers and/or handlebar risers assembly as in claim 1,comprises a pair
of high tensile angled rod,each having an upper and lower section which bolts together to forms the said
devices .
3-The upper section of the bolt-on adjustable extension devices assembly as in claim 1, is threaded to bolt
on to the lower double threaded section to form the said device,the upper section is also has a cavity to
accommodate a recessed hidden inner bolt which will be used to tighten the upper section of the device
to the lower threaded part of the welded on(or integrated) handlebar/riser assembly or risers or the like.
4- The lower threaded section of the adjustable bolt-on angled handlebar/risers extension devices
assembly as in claim 1,is then tightened after the desired riding angle position(forward or backward) has
been obtained by rotating the pair of adjustable angled devices along on their individual axis to enable the
welded on or integrated handlebar/risers assembly or handlebar risers ,to be tilted in a pull back or
forward riding position.
 5-Once the desired position has been obtained,the upper section of the adjustable bolt-on angled
handlebar/risers extension devices assembly as in claim 1, is first secured by tightening the inner recessed
bolt of each angled extension devices to the lower part of the welded-on (or integrated) handlebar/riser
assembly or handlebar risers .
 6- The upper section of the adjustable bolt-on angled handlebar/risers extension devices assembly as in
claim 1,is then tighten to the inner thread of the lower section of the adjustable angled device assembly to
form the said adjustable bolt-on angled extension device assembly.
 7-Finally the pair of adjustable bolt-on angled handlebar/risers extension devices assembly as in claim,
are each secured by tightening the lower section of the bolt-on angled handlebar/risers extension devices
from underneath the upper section of the triple clamp assembly of the vehicle.
