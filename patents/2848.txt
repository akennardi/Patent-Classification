PERCUSSION THERAPY SYSTEM AND APPARATUS
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]          The present disclosure generally relates to mattresses designed for use with
patients, and more particularly, to mattresses that provide percussion and/or vibration
therapy to patients.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]          Both patients and patient service providers benefit from products that
provide features that increase therapeutic effectiveness, provide additional benefits,
provide greater patient comfort and/or reduce patient cost. Part of the patient care services
provided by patient service providers includes the administering of certain therapies such
as percussion therapy while a patient is in bed. As known in the art, percussion therapy can
be useful for treating a variety of ailments. For example, percussion therapy can be useful
in breaking up fluid in the lungs to help prevent the fluid from settling and/or to aid in
removing the fluid from the lungs.
[0003]          Existing percussion therapy mattresses use air forced through bladders
and/or unbalanced mechanical motors to provide percussion therapy. These known
methods do not selectively provide percussion therapy to particular area of a patients body.
In addition, known methods are incapable of varying frequency of the percussion therapy
independent from the intensity of the percussion therapy.
[0004]          Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an improved method and apparatus
for providing percussion therapy to a patient that overcomes one or more of the

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0016]          The invention will be more readily understood in view of the following
description when accompanied by the below figures, wherein the reference numerals
portion of the first plurality of inflatable cells. In one example, the control module includes
a sonic percussion control module and a position control module. In one example, the sonic
percussion control module independently controls frequency and/or intensity of at least one
of the plurality of sonic percussion structures. In one example, the position control module
selectively raises and lowers at least one of the plurality of sonic percussion structure with
respect to a patient surface. In one example, the sonic percussion therapy system includes a
top cover. In one example, the top cover includes a planar surface and at least one
accelerometer. The planar surface is adapted to substantially cover the patient support
apparatus. In one example, the accelerometer is operatively coupled to the planar surface.
In one example, the accelerometer measures frequency and/or intensity of vibrations of the
patient support apparatus.

                                                 5
[0017]            The system, apparatus and method provide, among other advantages, sonic
percussion therapy having a sonic percussive waveform, wherein the frequency and
intensity of the waveform can be independently controlled to provide customized treatment
for each individual patient. In addition, the system, method and apparatus can selectively
target a particular area of the patient's body in order to provide customized treatment for
that particular area of the body. Furthermore, the sonic percussion structures are capable of
being retracted (e.g. lowered) when not in use and extended (e.g. raised) when providing
the sonic percussive waveform. Other advantages will be recognized by those of ordinary
skill in the art.
[0018]            In one example, the sonic percussion therapy assembly includes a first
inflatable cell, a second inflatable cell, and a sonic percussion structure. The second
inflatable cell is beneath the first inflatable cell. The sonic percussion structure is attached
to the first and second inflatable cells and disposed between the first and second inflatable
cells. In one example, the first and second inflatable cells move the sonic percussion
structure in response to fluid pressure. In one example, the sonic percussion structure
provides a sonic percussive waveform in response to at least frequency and intensity
information. In one example, the first inflatable cell inflates when the second inflatable cell
deflates. In one example, the second inflatable cell inflates when the first inflatable cell
deflates.
[0019]            In one example, a therapy control apparatus includes a sonic percussion
control module and a position control module. The sonic percussion control module
independently controls frequency and intensity of a sonic percussion structure. The
position control module selectively raises and lowers the sonic percussion structure with
respect to a patient surface. In one example, the position control module controls at least
one inflatable cell, operatively coupled to the sonic percussion structure, to one of inflate
and deflate. In one example, the position control module controls at least one inflatable cell
to deflate and concurrently controls at least one other inflatable cell to inflate. In one
example, the at least one inflatable cell and the at least one other inflatable cell are
vertically stacked. In one example, the therapy control apparatus includes at least one
accelerometer. The accelerometer determines frequency information and/or intensity
information of a sonic percussion waveform provided by the sonic percussion structure. In

                                               6
one example, the accelerometer determines a three dimensional position of the patient
surface. In one example, the sonic percussion control module selectively adjusts frequency
and/or intensity of the sonic percussion structure in response to the frequency information
and/or intensity information of the sonic percussion waveform. In one example, the
accelerometer is adapted to be operatively coupled to a patient lying on the patient surface.
In one example, the position control module concurrently raises a first portion of the sonic
percussion structure and lowers a second portion of the sonic percussion structure.
[0020]          As used herein, the term "module" can include an electronic circuit, one or
more processors (e.g., shared, dedicated, or group of processors such as but not limited to
microprocessors, DSPs, or central processing units) and memory that execute one or more
software or firmware programs, combinational logic circuits, an ASIC, and/or other
suitable components that provide the described functionality.
[0021]          Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary bed 10 includes a support structure
12, such as a frame, a patient support apparatus 14, such as a mattress, that is supported by
the support structure 12 and a fluid distribution support surface product 16. Although the
patient support apparatus 14 is included in a bed in this example, those of ordinary skill in
the art will appreciate that the patient support apparatus 14 can be used in other structures
such as a chair, a wheelchair, or other suitable structure. In this example, the fluid
distribution support surface product 16 serves as a type of inflatable top cover for a patient.
As shown, the fluid distribution support surface product 16 has a planar surface 18 adapted
to substantially cover the patient support apparatus 14. Also in this example, the bed
includes side safety panels 20 and end safety panels as known in the art and also includes a
therapy control module 21. The therapy control module 21 is operative to control
percussion therapy via communication path 22 and/or other desirable therapies such as
rotational therapy for example. Although the communication path 22 is a wired connection
in this example, the communication path 22 can be a wireless connection or any other
suitable connection.
[0022]          In some embodiments, the therapy control module 21 can include a
programmable fluid supply source 23 such as a programmable air loss pump as known in
the art or other suitable fluid pump known in the art. The programmable fluid supply 23

                                               7
provides low pressure fluid (e.g., air or other suitable fluid) through one or more tubes 24
to the fluid distribution support surface product 16. The programmable fluid supply source
23 need not be programmable and may be any suitable pump or other fluid supply source
as desired. By way of example only, such a fluid supply source may be of a type sold by
Kap Medical, Inc. located in Corona, CA, USA, or any other suitable air supply source.
[0023]          As shown, the fluid distribution support surface product 16 includes an
accelerometer 26 operatively coupled to the planar surface 18. In one embodiment, the
accelerometer 26 can be any known accelerometer capable of measuring acceleration in
three dimensions. In other embodiments, the accelerometer 26 can be capable of measuring
acceleration in one or two dimensions rather than three dimensions. The accelerometer 26
is operative to measure frequency and/or intensity information of vibrations provided
during percussion therapy. The accelerometer 26 can provide the frequency and/or
intensity information to the control module 21 via a wired connection 27 as shown or via
any other suitable interface such as a wireless connection for example. The frequency and
intensity information can then be used by the therapy control module 21 to selectively
adjust the frequency and/or intensity of the percussion therapy. In some embodiments, the
accelerometer 26 can be placed directly on the patient via sticky pads as known in the art
or by other suitable known methods. In addition, the accelerometer 26 can determine a
three-dimensional position (or other dimensional position) of the fluid distribution support
surface product 16.
[0024]          Referring now to Figure 2, an exemplary diagram of the patient support
apparatus 14 is depicted. The patient support apparatus 14 includes a plurality of inflatable
cells 200 and a plurality of sonic percussion therapy assemblies 201 within a frame 202.
The inflatable cells 200 can be any suitable fluid resistant material known in the art. In this
example, the patient support apparatus 14 includes four sonic percussion therapy
assemblies 201 although more or less sonic percussion therapy assemblies 201 can be
included. The sonic percussion therapy assemblies 201 in this example are arranged to
provide percussion therapy to the upper chest, lower back, thigh, and calf of a patient. In
some embodiments, it may be desirable to arrange one or more sonic percussion therapy
assemblies 201 within the patient support apparatus 14 in order to provide percussion
therapy to other locations of the patient.

                                                8
[0025]          The frame 202 includes a frame base 204 that extends throughout the open
area between the frame 202. As shown, the frame 202, which in this embodiment is an
inflatable frame, contains a plurality of inflatable cells 200. The inflatable cells 200 and
sonic percussion therapy assemblies 201 rest upon the frame base 204. As shown, the top
of the inflatable cells 200 and sonic percussion therapy assemblies 201 are not attached to
the frame 202, nor are such tops restricted. The fluid distribution support surface product
16 is placed over what are shown here as exposed inflatable cushion cells 200 and sonic
percussion therapy assemblies 201 such that the skin of the patient does not contact the
inflatable cells 200 or sonic percussion therapy assemblies 201. The plurality of inflatable
cells 200 inflate and deflate in response to the operation of the therapy control module 21.
[0026]          Referring now to Figure 3, in one embodiment, each of the sonic percussion
therapy assemblies 201 includes a first inflatable cell structure 300, a second inflatable cell
structure 302, and a sonic percussion structure 304. The first and second inflatable cell
structures 300, 302 can be made of any suitable fluid resistant material known in the art.
As shown, the first and second inflatable cell structures 300, 302 are vertically stacked. In
addition, the second inflatable cell structure 302 is beneath the first inflatable cell structure
300. The sonic percussion structure 304 is attached to the first inflatable cell structure 300
and the second inflatable cell structure 302 and disposed between the first inflatable cell
structure 300 and second inflatable cell structure 302.
[0027]          In this embodiment, the first inflatable cell structure 300 and the second
inflatable cell structure 302 are operative to move the sonic percussion structure 304 in
response to fluid pressure received via tubes 24. For example, the first inflatable cell
structure 300 can inflate while the second inflatable cell structure 302 concurrently deflates
and vice versa. In addition, the sonic percussion structure 304 is operative to provide a
sonic percussive waveform in response to frequency information, intensity information,
and/or other suitable information received via communication path 22.
[0028]          In some embodiments, the first and second inflatable cell structures 300,
302 can be standard inflatable cells as known in the art. In other embodiments, the first and
second inflatable cell structures 300, 302 can each include a diagonal seal 306, 308,
respectively. When the first inflatable cell structure 300 includes the diagonal seal 306 two

                                                9
separate inflatable cells are formed 310, 312 as shown. Similarly, when the second label
cell structure 302 includes the diagonal seal 308 two separate inflatable cells 314, 316 are
formed as shown. As such, the therapy control module 21 can selectively inflate and
deflate the inflatable cells 310, 312, 314, 316 in order to raise, lower, and/or rotate the
planar surface 18 of the patient support apparatus 14 and the sonic percussion structure
304. For example, in order to rotate the sonic percussion structure 304, the therapy control
module 21 can concurrently raise a first portion 320 and lower a second portion 322 of the
sonic percussion structure 304 by selectively inflating and deflating the inflatable cells
310, 312, 314, 316. An example of an inflatable cell structure that includes a diagonal seal
separating two separate inflatable cells is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,171,711, which is
hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[0029]          Referring now to Figure 4, a cutaway view of the sonic percussion therapy
assembly 201 is depicted. In this example, the first and second inflatable cell structures
300, 302 are standard inflatable cells and do not include the diagonal seal 306, 308. The
sonic percussion structure 304 includes a base structure 400 that is substantially the same
length as the first and second inflatable cell structures 300, 302. The base structure 400 can
be made of any suitable material such as foam for example. The base structure 400 is
operatively coupled to one or more sonic percussion speakers 402. The sonic percussion
speakers 402 can be any suitable speaker capable providing sonic percussive waveforms
and/or vibrations such as, for example, speakers sold by D2RM Corporation of Gardenia,
CA having a part number 8002-01. In addition, the sonic percussion speakers 402 should
be capable of providing a sonic percussive waveform having a frequency that is
independent from the intensity of the waveform.
[0030]          The sonic percussion speakers 402 provide a percussive waveform in
response to frequency, intensity, and/or other suitable control information received via
communication path 22. In one example, the frequency and/or intensity of the sonic
percussive waveform can be controlled via a pulse width modulated signal. For example,
in order to increase intensity of the sonic percussive waveform, a duty cycle of the pulse
width modulated signal can be adjusted so that the speaker is on more often than in a
previous duty cycle.

                                               10
[0031]          The therapy control module 21 controls the frequency, intensity, and/or
duration of the percussive waveform in order to provide percussion therapy to the patient.
The frequency, intensity, and/or duration of the percussive waveform can each be
controlled independently by the therapy control module 21 via the communication path 22.
As such, the therapy control module 21 can adjust the frequency, intensity, and/or duration
of the percussive waveform to a unique setting for each individual patient. This is desirable
because each patient may respond better to percussive waveforms at different frequencies
and/or intensities based on their particular body mass and/or other physical characteristics.
[0032]          In some embodiments, the control module 21 can automatically adjust the
frequency, intensity, and/or duration of the percussive waveform in response to feedback
information received from the accelerometer 26. In addition, each sonic percussion speaker
402 can be individually controlled so that one side of the patient can receive sonic
percussion therapy while the other side does not receive sonic percussion therapy. This
may be desirable, for example, when a user wishes to provide sonic percussion and or
vibration therapy to one lung of a patient and not the other lung.
[0033]          In some embodiments, a temperature sensor 403 can be operatively coupled
to the speaker 402 to mnitor operating temperature of the speaker 402. The operating
temperature of the speaker 402 can be provided to the control module 21 via the
communication path 22. The control module 21 can selectively disable the speaker 402
based on the operating temperature in order to prevent the speaker 402 from overheating.
[0034]          The sonic percussion structure 304 can also include an additional top
portion 404 in order to enclose the sonic percussion speaker 402 if desired. The top portion
404 can be made of any suitable material such as foam for example. In addition, the sonic
percussion structure 304 can be attached to the first and second inflatable cell structures
300, 302, in any suitable manner. In this example, the sonic percussion structure 304 is
disposed within a sheath 406 that is attached to the first and second inflatable cell
structures 300, 302. In this example, the sheath 406 includes a zipper 408 so the sonic
percussion structure 304 can be easily inserted into and removed from the sheath 406.

                                              11
[0035]          Referring now to Figures 5 and 6, alternative embodiments of the sonic
percussion therapy assembly 201 are depicted. In these examples, the sonic percussion
therapy assembly 201 includes an inflatable cell structure 500 attached to the sonic
percussion structure 302. The inflatable cell structure 500 can be made of any suitable fluid
resistant material known in the art. In addition, as with the first and second inflatable cell
structures 300, 302 of Figure 3, the inflatable cell structure 500 can include a single
inflatable cell 600 as shown in Figure 6 or two inflatable cells 502, 504 separated by a
diagonal seal 506 as shown in Figure 5. In addition, in some embodiments, the sonic
percussion structure 304 can be attached to a base structure 700 as shown in Figure 7. The
base structure 700 can be made of any suitable material such as foam for example. As
such, the sonic percussion structure 304 remains stationary during sonic percussion therapy
in the embodiment shown in Figure 7.
[0036]          Referring now to Figure 8, exemplary cutaway side views of the patient
support apparatus 14 are generally identified at 800 and 802. The patient support apparatus
14 includes a plurality of the sonic percussion therapy assemblies 201. In this example, the
patient support apparatus 14 includes four sonic percussion therapy assemblies 201
although more or less sonic percussion therapy assemblies 201 can be included. The sonic
percussion therapy assemblies 201 in this example are arranged to provide percussion
therapy to the upper chest, lower back, thigh, and calf of the patient 804. In some
embodiments, it may be desirable to arrange one more sonic percussion therapy assemblies
201 within the patient support apparatus 14 in order to provide percussion therapy to other
locations of the patient 802.
[0037]          The patient support apparatus 14 generally identified at 800 illustrates the
patient support apparatus 14 when the patient 804 is not receiving sonic percussion therapy
treatment. As shown, the sonic percussion structure 304 is retracted (e.g. lowered) and not
providing sonic percussion therapy to the patient 804. In some embodiments, the sonic
percussion structure 304 is retracted within the frame base 204. Although the sonic
percussion therapy assembly 201 in this example includes the first inflatable cell structure
300, the sonic percussion therapy assembly 201 does not need to include the first inflatable
cell structure 300 as noted above with reference to Figures 5, 6, and 7.

                                                12
[0038]          The patient support apparatus 14 generally unidentified at 802 illustrates a
patient support apparatus 14 when the patient 802 is receiving sonic percussion therapy
treatment. As shown in this example, the sonic percussion structure 304 is extended (e.g.
raised) toward the patient 802 and provides a sonic percussive waveform to the patient
802. As previously noted, the sonic percussion therapy assembly 201 can include the first
inflatable cell structure 300 or, if desired, need not include the first inflatable cell structure
300.
[0039]          Referring now to Figure 9, an exemplary functional block diagram of the
therapy control module 21 is depicted. The therapy control module 14 includes a sonic
percussion control module 900 and position control module 902. The sonic percussion
control module 900 independently controls frequency and intensity of the sonic percussion
structure 304. The position control module 902 selectively raises and lowers the sonic
percussion structure 304 with respect to the planar surface 18.
[0040]          The therapy control module 21 can also include a user interface 908 so that
a user can interact with the therapy control module 21 via user control information 905 in
order to provide therapy in the form of percussion, vibration, and/or rotational therapy. The
user interface 904 can also provide feedback information 906 received from the
accelerometer 26 to a user via a display 908. The feedback information 906 can include,
among other things, frequency, intensity, therapy duration, position of the planar surface
18, and/or any other suitable information. In addition, the user interface 904 and the
therapy control module 21 can be included in one unit if desired.
[0041]          In addition, the sonic percussion control module 900 and the position
control module 902 can receive the feedback information 906 in order to automatically
adjust the sonic percussion therapy and/or rotational therapy provided by the patient
support apparatus 14. For example, the sonic percussion control module 900 and sonic
position control module 902 can each include a suitable feedback control module (not
shown) such as, for example, a PI, a PD, a PID, and/or any other suitable feedback control
module in order to adjust the sonic percussion therapy and/or rotational therapy to a
desired therapy setting.

[0042]          The sonic percussion control module 900 is operatively coupled to the sonic
percussion structure 302. The sonic percussion control module 900 controls the frequency,
intensity, and/or duration of the sonic percussion therapy. As previously noted, the sonic
percussion control module 900 can adjust the frequency independent of adjusting the
intensity of the sonic percussion therapy. As such, the sonic percussion control module 900
can provide sonic percussion therapy that is customized to a particular patient.
[0043]          Furthermore, the sonic percussion control module 900 can control each of
the sonic percussion speakers 402 independently. In this manner the sonic percussion
control module 900 can selectively provide sonic percussion therapy to particular areas of
the patient 804. For example, the sonic percussion control module 900 can provide sonic
percussion therapy to a left lung of the patient 804 without providing sonic percussion
therapy to a right lung of the patient 804.
[0044]          The programmable fluid supply source 23 can include one or more fluid
supply pumps 907. Each of the fluid supply pumps 907 are in fluid communication with a
respective inflatable ell structure 908. For example, when the sonic percussion therapy
assemblies 201 include the first and second inflatable cell structures 300, 302, a first of the
fluid supply pumps 907 is in fluid communication with the first inflatable cell structure 300
and a second of the fluid supply pumps 907 is in fluid communication with the second
inflatable cell structure 302. As such, the position control module 902 can control the
programmable fluid supply source 23 to inflate the first inflatable cell structure 300 and
concurrently deflate the second inflatable cell structure 302 or vice versa. Those of
ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the fluid supply pumps 907 can be in fluid
communication with any other suitable cell structure desired to be inflated and/or deflated.
[0045]          Referring now to Figure 10, exemplary steps that can be taken by the
control module 21 in order to provide percussion therapy are generally identified at 1000.
The process starts in step 1002 when a user desires to provide sonic percussion therapy to a
patient. In step 1004, the control module 21 raises the sonic percussion structure 304 with
respect to a patient surface (e.g. the planar surface 18). In step 1006, the control module
independently controls the frequency and intensity of the sonic percussion structure 304.
The process ends in step 1008. As previously noted, the sonic percussion structure 304 can

                                               14
be lowered with respect to the patient surface (e.g. the planar surface 18) when sonic
percussion therapy is not being provided.
[0046]          As noted above, among other advantages, the sonic percussion system,
apparatus and method provide sonic percussion therapy having a sonic percussive
waveform, wherein the frequency and intensity of the waveform can be independently
controlled to provide customized treatment to for each individual patient. In addition, the
system, method and apparatus can selectively target a particular area of the patient's body
in order to provide customized treatment for that particular area of the body. Furthermore,
the sonic percussion structures are capable of being retracted (e.g. lowered) when not in
use and extended (e.g. raised) when providing the sonic percussive waveform. Other
advantages will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art.
