                                              ABSTRACT
5 A pressure regulating device for use with a breathing assistance and/or resuscitation apparatus,
  which conveys gases along a gases pathway to a patient, includes a mounting for connecting
  the pressure regulating device to a first outlet in fluid communication with the gases pathway.
  The mounting holds a valve member that selectively blocks, at least in part, the first outlet. A
  control member can be manipulated to adjust a property of the valve member. The valve
0 member at least partially blocks the first outlet when the pressure of gases in the pathway is
  below a selected level, and allows at least a portion of the gases to flow out of the first outlet
  when the pressure of said gases is above the selected level. The property includes a selected
  level of pressure whereby manipulation of the control member adjusts the level of pressure
  between a maximum level and a minimum level.

                                BREATHING ASSISTANCE APPARATUS
     Field of Invention
    The invention relates to the use of a pressure regulator in conjunction with a breathing
  5 assistance apparatus, particularly though not solely, for regulating the pressure of gases
    supplied to a patient from a Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) apparatus or for a patient
    resuscitation device.
    Background
 10 At the moment of their first breath, a baby's lungs are collapsed and filled with fluid.       The
    pressures needed to open their lungs and keep them open are several times that of a normal
    breath until the fluid is displaced and the lungs have filled with air. To generate these large
    pressures, the baby must have strong respiratory muscles, as well as a surfactant in their
    alveoli. The surfactant reduces the surface tension of the fluid within the alveoli, preventing the
15  alveolar walls from sticking to each other.
    Neonates have difficulty in opening their lungs and keeping them open. Reasons for this
    include:
20          a) Weak respiratory muscles and low surfactant levels resulting in insufficient pressure
               to open the lungs and, should they be resuscitated, quick tiring from the effort of
               keeping the alveoli open.
            b) Underdeveloped internal tissue structure to support the alveoli.
            c) Slower clearance of lung fluid. In very premature neonates, fluid may continue to be
25             secreted in the alveoli even after birth.
            d) A soft chest wall, horizontal ribs, and a flatter diaphragm contribute to reduce the
               inspiratory capacity.
            e) The mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood raises blood pressure in the
               lungs, increasing fluid movement from the blood vessels into the lung tissue. The
30             reduced blood oxygen level starves tissue of oxygen, weakening respiratory muscles.
            f) Weak neck muscles and a lack of neck fat reduce upper airway stability so that
               collapse on inspiration may occur.
            g) Collapsed, damaged alveoli secrete proteins that reduce surfactant function.
35  To alleviate this it is known to apply Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) during respiration,

      WO 2014/003578                                                                 PCT/NZ2013/000111
                                                        2
      resuscitation or assisted respiration (ventilation). In applying PEEP, the patient's upper airway
      and lungs are held open during expiration against a pressure that stops alveolar collapse. Lung
     fluid is pushed back into the circulating blood, alveolar surfactant is conserved, and a larger
     area of the lung participates in gas exchange with the blood. As blood oxygenation and carbon
  5  dioxide removal improves, more oxygen is delivered to growing tissue, while less oxygen and
     energy is consumed by respiratory muscles.           In the case of resuscitation or ventilation the
     pressure is varied between a Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) and the PEEP value until the
     patient is breathing spontaneously.
 10  To provide the PEEP across a range of flow rates, some method is required to regulate the
     pressure to prevent injury to patients, particularly neonates due to the fragility of their lungs and
     airway.
     It is known to provide a valve near the patient which actuates at a level of pressure (namely, the
15   PEEP value) to allow the gases to vent externally and reduce pressure in the stream delivered
     to the patient. Such valves may be spring-loaded. These require the use of high quality springs
     which must be individually tested to give a high tolerance spring constant to ensure that they
     actuate at a value substantially that of the maximum safe pressure. Both the manufacture and
     testing of such a spring result in high costs. Also such valves are known to have substantial
20   variation of the relief pressure with flow rate.
     To address issues with spring-loaded valves, umbrella valves have been used. Umbrella valves.
     provide a lower variation in delivered pressure.
25   US 2004/0040559, which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses umbrella valve designs
    for reducing the variation in delivered pressure that may be experienced with prior art valves.
    According to particular embodiments, the elastomeric member used to selectively close the vent
    is adapted such that as the flow rate increases, a larger portion of the flow at the inlet is able to
    pass through the vent, better regulating the pressure delivered to the patient.
30
    US 2004/0040559 further describes an arrangement which enables the PEEP value to be
    manually adjusted. This arrangement is shown in Figures 1 and 2. Referring to Figures 1 and
    2, gas enters the apparatus 330 via inlet 328 and generally exits via an outlet (in the base of
    apparatus 330 but hidden in the Figures provided) which couples to a mask or other patient
35  interface (not shown) to deliver air to the patient, typically an infant. The apparatus 330 further

   WO 2014/003578                                                                    PCT/NZ2013/000111
                                                        3
    includes a vent which terminates in an orifice 334 in a screw on cap 324 which engages with
   thread 326 on the main body of the apparatus 330. Air exits through the vent via nozzle 332
    and apertures positioned around the nozzle 332. As will be appreciated, due to the position of
   the nozzle 332 in relation to the orifice 334, rotation of the cap on the thread 326 will not
 5  significantly affect flow through the nozzle 332. However, rotation of the cap 324 does affect
   flow from the apertures around the nozzle 332 because as the cap is tightened, the orifice 334
    becomes partially blocked by the outer wall of the nozzle 332, reducing flow. Thus, rotation of
   the cap 324 enables the PEEP value to be adjusted.
10  US 4,239,038 describes a relief valve assembly for relieving excess pressure in a manual
    resuscitator that may result from a user exerting too much force to compress a self-inflating bag
   type reservoir of the resuscitator. The assembly includes a vent (generally similar to that shown
   in US 2004/0040559) that is adjacent an outlet for interfacing with a patient. According to one
   embodiment, as shown in Figures 3 and 4 herein, the valve assembly includes a threaded
15 portion 18 for connecting to the resuscitator. Valve element 23 is biased against a seat 22 to
   seal the opening. In the event there is excessive pressure in the resuscitator, the valve element
   23 moves upwards and away from the seat, allowing gas to be vented through aperture 21.
   According to one embodiment described in US 4,239,038, the valve element 23 is mounted on a
20 screw 24 via the end wall 25 of the cap whereby rotation of the screw 24 adjusts the force with
   which the valve element 23 bears against the seat 22, thereby adjusting the adjusting the
   pressure at which the valve assembly provides relief. While this provides adjustment of the
   relief pressure, a screwdriver or other like tool is required to do so. Further, overtightening of
   the screw 24 may urge the valve member 23 too far downwards such that valve member 23 and
25 screw 24 become detached from the cap. This could result in portions of the assembly being
   passed to the patient interface outlet with the potential risk of injury to a patient. Conversely,
   withdrawing the screw 24 too far from the cap may urge the valve member 23 into contact with
   the end wall 25 of the cap potentially damaging the valve member 23.                  This may affect
   performance of the valve assembly and again potentially result in parts of the apparatus (i.e.,
30 fragmented parts of the valve element 23) being passed to the patient interface.
   It is an object of the invention to provide apparatus which overcomes or ameliorates at least one
   problem associated with prior art arrangements.
35 Alternatively, it is an object of the invention to at least provide a useful choice to the public.

    Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments
20  Embodiments of the present invention include a connector for resuscitating a patient,
    particularly an infant or neonate, more particularly a prematurely born neonate. The delivered
    pressure is varied between Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) and Peak End Expiratory Pressure
    (PEEP) by the occlusion of the PEEP outlet. The PEEP outlet provides for variable PEEP, by
   adjustment. However, at any particular PEEP setting, preferred embodiments of the invention
25 provide for substantially flow independent fixed PEEP. The fixed PEEP valve avoids the need
   for adjustment as flow changes and provides more effective therapy.
   A duck billed valve may be included for suctioning of surfactant delivery during resuscitation.
30 Preferably, the connector is adapted to one handed use.
   Referring now to Figure 5 in which a typical application is depicted, a Positive End Expiratory
   Pressure (PEEP) system is shown in which a patient 119, shown as an infant, is receiving
   pressurized gases through a mask 128 (or endotracheal tube or other interface as are known in
35 the art) connected to an inhalatory conduit 121, preferably for resuscitation. Either the mask

                                                     11
     128 or the inhalatory conduit 121 can include the pressure regulator 134 to control the pressure
     of gas delivered to the patient.    The inhalatory conduit 121 is connected to the outlet of a
     resuscitator apparatus 115, which is in turn connected to a flow regulator and air supply 118
     (which preferably provides gas to the resuscitator at 50 psi or thereabouts).
  5
     It should be understood that the present invention is not limited to resuscitation, or the delivery
     of PEEP gases but is also applicable to other types of gas delivery systems, including those
     adapted to deliver gases to non-infant patients.     Further, while embodiments are described
     showing more sophisticated gas delivery apparatus, it will be appreciated that the invention is
 10  not limited to such applications and may also be used with manually powered arrangements,
     such as those described in US 4,239,038.
     A preferred embodiment of apparatus of the invention is shown in Figures 6 to 9. According to
     preferred embodiments, the apparatus is disposed within or coupled to the mask 128 although it
 15  will be appreciated that it may form part of a separate assembly provided it is proximate the
     patient.
     Referring to Figures 6 and 7, the apparatus 600 includes an inlet 602 fluidly connected to two
    outlets 604, 606. The inlet 602 receives gases and delivers these to a patient via a mask or
20  other patient interface (not shown) connected to first outlet 604. The gases may be delivered to
    the inlet 602 via a flow regulator and air supply 118 and resuscitator 115 as shown in Figure 5
    although other means for delivering pressurised gases may alternatively be used. Further, the
    gases may simply be air extracted and pumped from the patient's surroundings, and/or may be
    enriched such as by additionally coupling an oxygen reservoir or supply to the inlet, as is known
25  in the art. Further, the gases may be humidified using known humidifier arrangements.
    The second outlet 606 provides an external orifice which terminates a pressure regulator 601.
    The pressure regulator 601 may be used to vary the pressure between PIP and PEEP by
    selective occlusion of the orifice 634, such as by placement of a finger over it. A PEEP valve
30  608 is located between the inlet 602 and the second outlet 604.
    The PIP may be adjusted at the resuscitator 115 to a desired level. The delivered gases are
    varied between the PIP with the orifice 634 near the patient occluded and the PEEP with the
    orifice 634 unoccluded. In this fashion, resuscitation of a patient can be attempted by varying
35  between the PIP and PEEP at the normal rate of breathing.

     WO 2014/003578                                                                    PCT/NZ2013/000111
                                                       12
      The purpose of the PEEP valve 608 of preferred embodiments is to keep the PEEP at a
      reasonably constant level independent of changes in flow rate. Further, embodiments of the
      regulator 601 preferably provide for adjustment of the PEEP. Such adjustment may preferably
  5   be performed manually without the need for additional equipment or tools, such as a
     screwdriver.
      Desirably for infant respiratory assistance the PEEP value should be approximately 5 cmH 20,
      independent of the flow rate. Preferably the interface needs to be simple and cost effective, as it
 10  is a single-use product. Also, due to the nature of this application, a valve with many small
     separate parts, such as a spring valve, is not a viable option. Further, as will particularly be
     appreciated for resuscitation applications, time may be limited and delays caused by
     complicated adjustment, such as of the PEEP valve described in US 4,239,038, are preferably
     avoided. Further, while pressurised gas within apparatus 600 will tend to prevent contaminants
15   or debris being passed from the second outlet 606 to the first outlet 604 (and to the patient), the
     need to insert a tool into the second outlet, as required by US 4,239,038, increases the risk of
     this happening.
     As shown in Figures 6 and 7, the apparatus 600 may include a further inlet 603 including a duck
20   billed valve 605 which is normally closed and configured for introducing tubes therethrough and
     down the trachea for suctioning, delivery of surfactant etc. For the avoidance of doubt, the
     further inlet 603 may be omitted.
     As described in US 2004/0040559, new born neonates often lack surfactant in their lungs.
25   Embodiments of the invention, as shown in Figures 6 and 7, when used with an endotracheal
    tube, make it easy to administer surfactant to a patient without the need to remove the breathing
     assistance apparatus from the patient. By using a syringe or other device known in the art the
     operator can administer surfactant to the neonate by pushing the end of the syringe through the
    duck billed valve 605 located opposite the inlet to the patient (i.e., first outlet 604).
30
    The duck billed valve 605 is normally fluidly sealed but upon insertion of the syringe opens to
    allow the end of the syringe to enter the interior of the apparatus 600. The bills or flaps of the
    valve 605 may be formed from silicone rubber or other suitable materials known in the art and
    they seal around the end of the syringe keeping the apparatus 600 sealed. Because surfactant
35  is a viscous fluid this is advantageous over administering surfactant using multi lumen

    WO 2014/003578                                                                  PCT/NZ2013/000111
                                                      13
    endotracheal tubes.
    The duck billed valve 605 can also be used to suction a neonate to remove airway secretions.
    Suctioning is performed using a catheter inserted through the duck billed valve and down the
 5  endotracheal tube. The bills of the valve seal around the inserted catheter thereby maintaining
    airway pressure.      The duck billed valve is retained in a housing in such a way that any
    instrument inserted into the valve is guided directly into the top of an endotracheal tube (or
    nasal mask or other interface as are known in the art), fitted at the outlet to the neonate 304. To
    aid in performing this, a tube guide (not shown) may be provided inside apparatus 600 which is
10  aligned with the inlet 603 and the first outlet 604. An example arrangement is shown in Figure 6
    of US 2004/0040559.
    The apparatus is preferably shaped to enable ease of use.              More particularly, preferred
    embodiments enable one handed operation. The portion providing the first outlet 604 is wide
15  and short and in the embodiment shown, it is cylindrical. A flange (not shown) may be provided
    at the first outlet 604 so that when apparatus 600 is used with a mask, the flange enables the
    operator to apply pressure to fluidly seal the mask to the patient's nose and/or mouth. The
    construction of apparatus 600 enables an operator to use a digit to occlude orifice 634 to vary
    pressure between the PIP and PEEP. The operator may do this by placing their thumb and
20  middle finger about the first outlet 604 (or on an associated flange, if present) and use their
    index finger to seal orifice 634. The second outlet 606 is angled to allow the index finger to be
    in a natural position to occlude orifice 634.
   The pressure regulator 634 will now be described in more detail with reference additionally to
25  Figures 8A, 8B and 9.
   The PEEP valve 608 as shown is in the form of an umbrella valve made of an elastomeric
   material, positioned on a valve seat 610 (see in particular Figures 7 to 9). Preferably this valve
   is included as part of a nasal mask or endotracheal tube or other patient interface. As the flow
30 rate increases, the skirt or flap(s) 612 of the umbrella valve lift up, thereby allowing excess
   pressure to be vented therethrough. Preferred embodiments provide adaptive pressure relief so
   as to maintain the pressure inside the apparatus 600 at a substantially constant level.
   While the PEEP valve 308 is shown as an umbrella valve, the invention is not limited thereto.
35 Other valve means may be used such as flexible diaphragms. However, umbrella valves are

   WO 2014/003578                                                              PCT/NZ2013/000111
                                                    14
    preferred due to the ease with which they may be fitted to or removed from the apparatus and
    without the need for additional fixing means, the fixing being provided by the stem portion or
    shaft of the umbrella valve.
 5  While not limited thereto, according to preferred embodiments, the umbrella valve is configured
    in accordance with embodiments described in US 2004/0040559. More particularly, preferably,
    the valve is formed from Silastic liquid silicone rubber Q7-4840 and/or with dimensions as
    specified in Figure 3 of US 2004/0040559 wherein the periphery of the skirt or flap(s) 612 at or
    proximate to the valve seat 610 is thicker than at its centre, adjacent the stem. An umbrella
10 valve constructed in this manner does not act as a 'pop-off' valve like most umbrella valves as it
    is not designed to open at a specific pre-determined pressure known as the 'cracking pressure'.
    Rather, the valve of US 2004/0040559 is designed to open at a predetermined flow rate (e.g.
   below 5 litres/minute) and keep on opening as the flow rate increases causing the pressure to
   stay around a certain level as the flow increases. Most umbrella valves will open at a certain
15 pressure and not open any further as the flow rate increases, causing the pressure to increase
   as the flow increases.
   According to preferred embodiments of the invention, the tensioning of the skirt or flap(s) 612 of
   the PEEP valve 608 is adjustable by adjusting the relative position of the valve seat 610 as will
20 be described in more detail below.
   The pressure regulator 601 shown in Figures 6 to 9 includes a cap 622, seat member 611,
   PEEP valve 608 and mount 613.
25 The mount is configured to sealably couple the pressure regulator 601 to the second outlet 606.
   Any known coupling / sealing arrangement may be used and the invention is not limited to the
   specific arrangement shown. For example, rather than simply being adapted to be pushed on to
   the second outlet 606, a threaded, snap-fit or other form of engagement may be provided
   between the mount 613 and the second outlet 606. As will be appreciated O-rings and other
30 sealing means may additionally be provided. Further, all or portions of the mount 613 may be
   integral to the second outlet 606 although the arrangement shown is easier to manufacture and
   assemble, as well as readily enabling the complete pressure regulator 601 to be removed and
   replaced with another, if required.
35 Preferably, the cap 622 sealingly engages the mount 613 to prevent gases exiting other than

    WO 2014/003578                                                                  PCT/NZ2013/000111
                                                     15
    through the orifice 634. Preferably, this seal is provided, at least in part, at location 615 marked
    in Figure 8B.
    The mount 613 further positions and holds the PEEP valve 608 in position.                  As shown,
 5  preferably, the PEEP valve is fixed in position relative to the mount and consequently the
    second outlet 606, except for the skirt or flap(s) 612 which open and close to allow the PEEP
    valve 608 to operate.
    The seat member 611 is coupled to the mount 613 so as to enable the valve seat 610 to move
10  relative to the fixed position of the PEEP valve 608. According to the embodiment shown, an
    external thread 642 on the seat member 611 cooperates with an internal thread 644 on the
    mount 613 such that rotation of one relative to the other moves the seat member 611 as shown
    by the arrows marked A in Figure 8A. While this arrangement is preferred, other means for
    generating the same or similar relative movement of the valve seat 610 relative to the PEEP
15 valve 608 are included within the scope of the invention.
    In Figure 8A, the seat member 611 is in the lowermost position with the underside thereof
   abutting the mounting means 613. It will be appreciated that alternative arrangements may be
    used to limit the extent of movement in this direction. In Figure 8B, the seat member 611 is in
20 the uppermost position with the upper side thereof abutting projection or instep 614. Again,
   alternative arrangements may be used to limit the extent of movement. The seat member 611
   is positionable between the lowermost and uppermost positions shown in Figures 8A and 8B.
   To maintain the position of the seat member 611 in use, preferably the threaded engagement
   between the seat member 611 and the mount 613 and/or the sliding engagement between the
25 cap 622 and the mount and/or the sliding engagement between the cap and the seat member
   611 generate sufficient friction to substantially prevent unwanted adjustment (i.e., adjustment
   not directly generated by a user rotating the cap 622). To this end, the threaded engagement
   may be spring-biased so as to generate forces in the directions marked A in Figure 8A, thereby
   increasing the friction therebetween.
30
   The cap 622 in the embodiment shown is configured to snap fit to the mount 613.                 More
   particularly, a lip 646 of the cap 622 engages a lip 648 of the mount 613. While not limited
   thereto, preferably, the cap 622 is releasably fitted to enable it to be removed, thereby allowing
   access inside the regulator 601 such as to replace the PEEP valve 608.
35

     WO 2014/003578                                                                 PCT/NZ2013/000111
                                                      16
     The cap 622 further includes teeth 652 configured to mate with the projections 654 on the
      mount 613. The top or end of cap 622 terminates in orifice 634 and as shown in the markings
     thereon in Figure 6, is rotatable to adjust the PEEP. More particularly, when a user rotates the
     cap 622, the seat member 611 also rotates since the projections 654 mate with the teeth 652
  5  locking the cap 622 in position rotationally relative to the seat member 611. The rotation of the
     cap 622 generates movement in the direction A of the seat member 611 through action of the
     thread 642 against the thread 644. The movement of the seat member 611 is accommodated in
     the portion of the cap 622 that engages the mount 613. As shown, the teeth 652 are elongate,
     allowing the projections 654 to move in the direction A relative to the cap 622 while rotationally
10   fixing the cap 622 relative to the mount 613.
     While this arrangement is presently preferred, equivalent arrangements are also included with
     the scope of the invention. Further, to prevent wear of the skirt or flap(s) 612 of the PEEP valve
     608 caused by rotation of the cap 622 and the seat 610, the seat 610 may be rotatably isolated
15   from the seat member 610 such that it does not rotate.
     Further, it will be appreciated that it would be possible to slidably couple the cap 622 and seat
     member 611 assembly to mount 613.           However, the arrangement shown facilitates greater
     control of movement as well as providing for smaller adjustments to be made.
20
    Thus, the invention provides a pressure regulator that provides simple, controlled adjustment of
    the PEEP value by hand without the need for additional equipment.
    According to particular embodiments, the device of embodiments of the invention is preset
25  during manufacture or assembly such that the cap 622 is in a desired position for generating a
    selected PEEP pressure or pressure profile. This can avoid the need for users to adjust the
    setting for more "standard" cases.
     Improved results provided by the invention can be seen in Figures 10A when compared with the
30  results shown in Figure 10B for a device of the type shown in Figures 1 and 2 (Fisher & Paykel
    Healthcare Limited product code RD1300-10).              The results shown in Figure 10A were
    generated using a prototype made in accordance with the embodiment shown in Figures 6-9.
    Flow was generated using Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Limited's NeopuffTM resuscitator, details
    of which are annexed hereto and incorporated herein. Pressure was measured at the base of
35  the T-piece where the paient interface would be attached (i.e., at first outlet 604).

   WO 2014/003578                                                              PCT/NZ2013/000111
                                                     17
   Figure 10A shows how the PEEP varied as the flow rate increased from 5 to 15 litres per minute
   with the cap 622 in six different rotational positions.        Note that the "minimum" position
   corresponds to that shown in Figure 8A with the cap 622 fully wound to the left and the seat
 5 member 611 fully down. Conversely, the "maximum" position corresponds to that shown in
   Figure 8B.      As can be seen, even at higher flow rates, while the PEEP did increase, the
   increase was not significant compared to prior art arrangements. The variation in pressure
   across the range of flow was greatest with the cap 622 in the "minimum" position (namely 2
   cmH 2O) and least when the cap 622 was in the "maximum" position (namely 0.9 cmH 2 O),
10 ignoring the dip at 8 cmH 20.    Further, as can be seen by the lines being substantially parallel
   and the spacing therebetween being substantially equal, the rotation of the cap 622 was shown
   to vary PEEP substantially proportionally to the amount of rotation of the cap 622, providing a
   meaningful and intuitive change in the PEEP as a result of rotation of the cap 622.
15 Thus preferred embodiments of the invention are capable of providing a substantially constant
   or at least less varied PEEP across a range of flow rates with the PEEP being manually
   adjustable. Further, since the pressure flow curve at any particular position of the cap 622 is
   relatively flat (i.e., the PEEP does not vary significantly), any leakage between the patient
   interface or mask and the patient (which is common with masks during resuscitation), does not
20 drop the PEEP in the same way that prior art devices do, preventing collapse of the patient's
   lungs.
   Turning to the results shown in Figure 10B, which were generated in a similar manner but with
   the T-piece switched over, it can be seen that the variation in PEEP across the same range of
25 flow rates was greater for all positions of the cap. Notably, the minimum variation was recorded
   with the cap in the "minimum position", the PEEP differing across this range by 2.69 cmH 20,
   which was greater than the maximum variation of 2 cmH 2O in Figure 1OA for any given position
   of the cap.    Further, the PEEP increased more sharply when the flowrate exceeded 8 LPM,
   rather than the steady increase shown in Figure 1OA for the prototype according to the present
30 invention.
