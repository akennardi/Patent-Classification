NEBULIZER APPARATUS
Cross-Reference to Related Application
[0001] The content of Australian Patent Application No. 2013340468 is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety.
Field
[0002] The present invention relates to an apparatus for delivering an aerosol, nebulized liquid,
solid medicine, or a vapor to a patient's respiratory tract, and more particularly, to a nebulizer
with improved performance.
Background
[0003] Medical nebulizers for aerosolizing a liquid medicine that can be inhaled by a patient are
well known devices commonly used for the treatment of certain conditions and diseases.
Nebulizers have applications in treatments for conscious, spontaneously-breathing patients and
for controlled ventilated patients.
[0004] In some nebulizers, a gas and a liquid are mixed together and directed against a baffle.
As a result, the liquid is aerosolized, that is, the liquid is caused to form into small particles that
are suspended in the air. This aerosol of the liquid can then be inhaled into a patient's
respiratory tract. One way to mix the gas and liquid together in a nebulizer is to pass a quickly
moving gas over a liquid orifice tip of a tube. The negative pressure created by the flow of
pressurized gas is a factor that contributes to drawing the liquid out of the liquid orifice tip into
the stream of gas and nebulize it.
[0005] Some of the considerations in the design and operation of nebulizers include regulation
of dosages and maintenance of consistent aerosol particle size. In conventional nebulizer design,
pressurized gas may entrain a liquid against a baffle on a continuous basis until the liquid in a
reservoir is depleted. Continuous nebulization may result in a waste of aerosol during a patient's
exhalation or during a delay between a patient's inhalation and exhalation. This effect may also
complicate regulation of dosages because the amount of wasted aerosol may be difficult to
quantify. Also, continuous nebulization may affect particle size and/or density. In addition, there

                                                   2
may be excess medication lost to condensation on the nebulizer or mouthpiece during periods of
non-inhalation. On the other hand, interrupted nebulization may also affect particle size and
density as the nebulization is turned on and off.
[0006] There are several other considerations that relate to the effectiveness of nebulizer
therapies. For example, it has been suggested that nebulization therapy is more effective when
the generation of aerosol particles is relatively uniform, for example, producing particles of a
particular size, particles within a range of sizes, and/or particles a substantial percentage of
which are within a range of sizes. In addition, it may be advantageous for a nebulizer to be able
to generate a large amount of aerosol quickly and uniformly so that a proper dosage can be
administered.
[0007] A further consideration is the environment in which the nebulizer therapy may be
administered. For example, a wall outlet at a hospital may supply pressurized gas for use with a
nebulizer at a flow rate of 4 to 10 liters per minute in a range from 45 psi to 55 psi, whereas a
home care compressor may supply pressurized gas for use with a nebulizer at a flow rate of 3-5
liters per minute and at pressures of 15 to 30 psi. Regardless of the environment in which the
nebulizer therapy is administered, it is desirable to maintain and/or improve performance of
nebulizers.
[0008] Additional considerations in the design and operation of nebulizers relate to the size and
shape of the baffle, and the volume of liquid available for nebulization contained between the
reservoir and the liquid orifice.
[0009] Accordingly, with these considerations taken into account, there is a need for an
improved nebulizer.

Description of Embodiments
[0042] A nebulizer 10 is illustrated in FIG. 1. The nebulizer 10 is a small volume nebulizer and
includes a housing or container 12 defining an internal chamber 14. The housing 12 is formed of
a cylindrically-shaped side wall portion 18, a top portion 20, and a bottom portion 22. The
component parts of the housing 12 may be formed of separate, multiple pieces of material that
are connected together by welding, adhesives, etc., or more preferably, some of the component
parts may be formed together of a single piece of material formed by an injection molding
process. For example, the bottom, and side portions 22 and 18 may be formed of separate pieces
that are connected together, or preferably, these parts may be formed of one piece of molded
plastic. Any of a number of plastics may be suitable, including polycarbonate, or polycarbonate
blends. A cover 21 is removably mounted on the upper portion of the housing 12, such as by
means of a snap-on cover arrangement, twist-lock threads, screws or other types of fasteners.
The housing 12 is approximately 6 cm in height and has a diameter of approximately 4 cm.
[0043] A lower portion 23 of the chamber 14 serves as a reservoir for holding a fluid 25 for
nebulizing, such as a solution containing a medication. Located in the lower portion 23 of the
housing 12 is a nozzle assembly 24. Referring to FIGS. 1-3, the nozzle assembly 24 extends
downward from the chamber 14 of the housing 12 to a fitting 28 located external of the chamber
14 on a bottom side 22 of the housing 12. The fitting 28 is sized to connect to a supply 27 of
pressurized gas provided through conventional tubing 29. The pressurized gas may be supplied
by any suitable source, such as a conventional gas supply used in hospitals, a pump, compressor,
cartridge, canister, etc.
[0044] The nozzle assembly 24 is comprised of an outer tubular member 30, and an inner
tubular member 32. The outer tubular member 30 has an inner passageway 40 that defines a
liquid cylinder. The inner passageway 40 has a cross-sectional shape that is generally circular
along the length of the inner passageway 40. The inner tubular member 32, or gas nozzle, has a
passageway 34 that extends from an opening 36 in the bottom end of the fitting 28 to a gas
outlet orifice 38 located at a top end 39 of the nozzle assembly 24. The inner tubular member 32

                                                  7
is located in the inner passageway 40 of the outer tubular member 30. The inner tubular member
32 is sized to slide into the inner passageway 40 of the outer tubular member 30 so that it is
aligned therein. One or more liquid channels 42 are formed between the outer tubular member
30 and the inner tubular member 32. The one or more liquid channels 42 may comprise an
annular gap between the outer tubular member 30 and the inner tubular member 32, and/or any
cut-outs, passageways, slots, etc. formed between the inner tubular member 32 and the outer
tubular member 30, whether on the outer surface of the inner tubular member 32 (e.g., as one or
more slots), on the inner surface of the outer tubular member 30 (e.g., as one or more slots), or
any combination thereof (e.g., as an annular gap and slots). The one or more liquid channels 42
extend from a liquid reservoir opening 44 located at the reservoir 23 of the lower portion of the
chamber 14 to a liquid outlet orifice 46 located at the top end 39 of the nozzle assembly 24. The
one or more liquid channels 42 serve to convey liquid medicine from the reservoir 23 at the
bottom of the chamber 14 to the liquid outlet orifice 46 at the top of the nozzle assembly 24. The
one or more liquid channels 42 has a liquid volume or an equivalent liquid volume defined by
the aggregate volume between the outer tubular member 30 and the inner tubular member 32
(including any gaps, passageways, or slots) extending from the reservoir opening 44 to the
liquid outlet orifice 46. As explained below, dimensions of the components defining the liquid
volume may be selected to alter the performance of the nebulizer. In alternative embodiments,
such as those shown and described herein, the outer tubular member 30 and the inner tubular
member 32, or portions thereof, may have other than a cylindrical shape, such as for example, a
conical shape.
[0045] As shown in FIG. 3, the liquid outlet orifice 46 is located at a top end of the liquid
cylinder, or inner passageway 40 of the outer tubular member 30. The liquid outlet orifice 46
has an annular shape defined by the top ends of the outer tubular member 30 and the inner
tubular member 32 of the nozzle assembly 24. The gas outlet orifice 38 has a circular shape and
is located concentrically of the annular liquid orifice. In the present embodiment, the gas outlet
orifice 38 is approximately 0.56 mm diameter and the liquid outlet orifice 46 has an outer
diameter of approximately 2.79 mm to 3.18 mm and an inner diameter of approximately 2.13
mm. These dimensions are provided only by way of example and the nebulizer may be made in
other sizes with different dimensions, as explained herein, in order to alter the performance of
the nebulizer.

                                                   8
[0046] The top end 39 of the nozzle assembly 24 is formed by the top ends of the outer and
inner tubular members 30 and 32. In the present embodiment, the top end 39 is a generally flat
surface having a diameter of approximately 4.57 mm. In alternative embodiments, the top end
39 may have an other-than-flat shape, for example, the inner tubular member 32 may be spaced
above the outer tubular member 30 so that the liquid orifice 46 is located below the gas orifice
38. Likewise, the diameter may be larger or smaller.
[0047] The nozzle assembly 24, or a portion thereof, may be formed as part of the housing 12 as
a single piece of material in an injection molding process. For example, the inner tubular
member 32 may be formed of the same piece of injected molded plastic as the bottom of the
housing 12.
[0048] Referring again to FIG. 1, the nebulizer 10 also includes a chimney assembly 50. The
chimney assembly 50 is located in an upper portion of the chamber 14 above the liquid reservoir
23. The chimney assembly 50 includes a tubular body 51 that defines an internal passageway 52
that extends from an inlet opening 56 in the housing cover 21 to a chimney outlet opening at a
bottom end of the tubular body 51. Thus, the chimney assembly 50 serves as an inlet channel
for ambient air to enter into the chamber 14. The inlet opening 56 communicates with ambient
air (through ports of an actuator button, as described below) and the chimney outlet opening
communicates with the chamber 14.
[0049] Located on the lower end of the chimney assembly 50 is a baffle 60. The baffle 60 may
be formed of the same piece of molded plastic material as the chimney 50 or alternatively, the
baffle 60 may be formed of a separate piece of material that is attached by suitable means to the
rest of the chimney assembly 50. The baffle 60 is located directly opposite from the gas outlet
orifice 38 and the liquid outlet orifice 46 located at the top end 39 of the nozzle assembly 24.
The baffle 60 is movable so that the distance between the baffle 60 and the top surface 39 of the
nozzle assembly 24 can be varied. In the present embodiment, the baffle 60 has of a flat circular
or disc shape with a diameter of approximately 4.57 mm so that it extends over both the gas and
liquid orifices 38 and 46 out to approximately the edge of the top surface 39 of the nozzle
assembly 24. The baffle 60 therefore has a disc-shaped diverter surface area of approximately
16.40 mm .As used herein, diverter surface area refers to the surface area (whether flat, angled,
or curved) of the baffle located opposite from the gas outlet orifice 38 and the liquid outlet
orifice 46 that is provided for obstructing the flow of air and gas exiting the liquid outlet orifice

                                                   9
and the gas outlet orifice. As explained below, the dimensions of the baffle disc may be selected
to alter the performance of the nebulizer. In alternative embodiments, the baffle 60 may have an
other-than circular shape such as, for example, a rib, or a cone, or a hemispherical shape. It is
preferable that the baffle 60 have a size and shape such that the baffle 60 has a diverter surface
area at least 50% of the liquid outlet orifice 46. In another embodiment the baffle and nozzle
assembly remain fixed and are not movable such that the distance between the diverter surface
of the baffle 60 and the top surface 39 of the nozzle assembly 24 cannot be varied. In yet
another embodiment the baffle remains fixed and is not movable, but the nozzle assembly, or a
portion thereof, is movable such that the distance between at least a portion of the nozzle
assembly and the diverter surface of the baffle 60 can be varied.
[0050] The chimney assembly 50 is connected to the housing 12. Specifically, the chimney
assembly 50 is attached to the top portion 20 of the housing 12 by means of a membrane or
diaphragm 64. The membrane 64 is a ring-shaped piece of a flexible, resilient material, such as
silicone rubber. An outer rim or bead of the membrane 64 is secured in a groove in the top
portion 20 of the housing 12 and/or the cover 21. An inner rim of the membrane 64 is secured in
a slot formed by two parts of the chimney assembly 50. The membrane 64 has a rolled cross
sectional profile as shown in FIG. 1. This permits the membrane 64 to act as a rolling
diaphragm. The membrane 64 permits limited movement of the chimney assembly 50. The
chimney assembly 50 is connected to the membrane 64 so that the membrane 64 biases the
chimney assembly 50 away from the nozzle assembly 24 as shown in FIG. 1. When installed in
the manner shown in FIG. 1, in the present embodiment, the bottom of the chimney assembly 50
is approximately 3.81 mm away from the top surface of the nozzle assembly 24. In alternative
embodiments, the bottom of the chimney assembly 50 may be closer or farther away from the
top surface of the nozzle assembly 24.
[0051] Located at the top end of the chimney assembly 50 is an actuator 68. The actuator 68
connects to the tubular body 51 of the chimney assembly 50 and extends through the opening 56
at the top of the housing 12 in the cover 21. The actuator 68 includes a closed top side 70 with
one or more side opening ports 72.
[0052] Located in the chamber 14 at the bottom end of the chimney assembly 50 is a bell
shaped cover 74. The cover 74 extends from the opening at the bottom of the chimney
passageway 51 outward toward the inside wall of the cylindrical portion 18 of the housing 12.

                                                  10
The cover 74 includes a horizontal portion 75 and a vertical portion 76 that extends downward
from the horizontal portion 75 toward the top of the nozzle assembly 24. The cover 74 has an
open bottom side providing an air passageway around the bottom side of the cylindrical vertical
wall 76.
[0053] As mentioned above, the baffle 60 is movable relative to the nozzle assembly 24. The
present embodiment provides a means to limit the travel of the baffle relative to the nozzle
assembly 24. This may be accomplished in any of several suitable ways. In a present
embodiment, the movement of the baffle 60 toward the nozzle assembly 24 is limited by one or
more stop pins 80. The stop pins 80 extend up from the bottom portion 22 of the housing. In a
present embodiment, there are three stop pins. The top ends of the stop pins 80 are spaced away
from the bottom end of the vertical wall 76 of the cover 74. Because the chimney assembly 50 is
movable vertically due to its connection to the housing 12 by means of the flexible membrane
64, the stop pins 80 provide a lower limit to the movement of the chimney assembly 50. In a
present embodiment, the stop pins 80 are spaced so that when the lower edge of the vertical wall
76 of the cover 74 is brought into contact with the stop pins 80, a space 'h' is provided between
the baffle 60 and the upper surface 39 of the nozzle assembly 24. In the present embodiment, the
space 'h' is approximately between 0.64 mm and 1.14 mm, or more preferably approximately
between 0.76 mm and 1.02 mm, and most preferably approximately 0.84 mm. In alternative
embodiments, the space 'h' may be larger or smaller.
[0054] In alternative embodiments, movement of the baffle 60 toward the nozzle assembly 24
may be limited by means other than stop pins. For example, if the housing were formed by an
injection molding process, steps, shoulders, fins, or other structures, may be provided along the
walls of the housing in order to limit the downward travel of the chimney and/or baffle.
[0055] Also located in the chamber 14 is a diverting ring 82. The diverting ring 82 is located on
the inner wall of the cylindrical portion 18 of the housing 12. Specifically, the diverting ring 82
is positioned adjacent to the cover 74. The diverting ring 82 is sized to define a gap 86 around
the cover 74. The diverting ring 82 serves to impede large droplets of liquid that might form on
the inner wall of the housing 12 and divert large droplets back down into the reservoir 23 at the
bottom of the housing 12. In addition, the diverting ring 82 serves to provide a relatively
tortuous path for the flow of aerosol particles from the lower portion of the chamber 14 to the

                                                   11
upper portion. This tortuous path also serves to reduce the presence of larger particles and helps
to make the particle size distribution more uniform.
[0056] As mentioned above, the bottom of the chamber 14 serves as a reservoir 23 for a liquid
to be nebulized. In a present embodiment, the reservoir has a funnel-like shape to direct the
liquid to be nebulized in a downward direction toward the inlet 44. The reservoir portion of the
chamber 14-is formed of at least two portions or stages. In a present embodiment, an upper
portion 88 of the reservoir is relatively wide having a diameter approximately the same as that
of the cylindrical portion 18 of the housing 12 (e.g. 6 cm). The upper portion 88 is relatively
shallow (e.g. 7.94-6.35 mm). The upper portion 88 of the reservoir tapers in a funnellike manner
toward a lower portion 90 (or secondary well) of the reservoir. The lower portion 90 is
relatively narrow, but relatively deep (e.g. 6.35 mm). The lower portion 90 of the reservoir is
slightly wider (e.g. 15.88 mm) than the outer diameter of the nozzle assembly 24. The opening
44 from which the liquid is drawn is located at the bottom of the lower portion 90 of the
reservoir. In a present embodiment, the reservoir 23 also includes an intermediate portion 92
located between the upper portion 88 and the lower portion 90. The intermediate portion 92 of
the reservoir 23 has a height and a width between that of the upper and lower portions.
[0057] In the embodiment of the nebulizer shown in FIG. 1, the relative sizes and dimensions of
the upper, lower and intermediate portions of the reservoir 23 contribute to the generation of an
aerosol wherein the aerosol particle size and output is relatively uniform overall. As described
more below, the liquid in the reservoir 23 is drawn through the opening 44 and up the liquid
channel 42 in part by the negative pressure caused by the flow of gas across the liquid orifice 46.
The suction force provided by the gas flow both draws the liquid up out of the reservoir to the
top of the nozzle and entrains the liquid with a certain velocity in the air flow. As the liquid is
nebulized, the surface level of the liquid in the reservoir goes down, thereby directly increasing
the distance that the liquid has to be drawn up out of the reservoir to the orifice at the top of the
nozzle. As the distance of the top of the nozzle over the liquid surface increases, more energy is
required to draw the liquid up to the liquid orifice at the top of the nozzle assembly 24.
Assuming a relatively constant gas pressure, this increasing distance may have the effect of
decreasing liquid flow through the liquid orifice which in turn may affect the uniformity of the
aerosol particle size and rate.

                                                    12
[0058] The embodiment of the nebulizer in FIG. 1 reduces this possible adverse effect. With the
embodiment of FIG. 1, a relatively large portion of the liquid is stored in the upper portion 88 of
the reservoir and a relatively smaller portion of the liquid is stored in the lower portion 90 of the
reservoir. Since the large portion 88 of the reservoir is wide and relatively shallow, the surface
level of the liquid in the reservoir changes relatively slightly as the liquid in this portion of the
reservoir is drawn down. Therefore, there is little change in the energy needed to draw this
amount of liquid up from the reservoir to the liquid orifice 46 as this portion of the liquid is
depleted. When all the liquid in the upper portion 88 of the reservoir is nebulized, the remaining
liquid in the lower portion 90 of the reservoir is drawn into the liquid channel 42 and the height
of the top surface of the liquid falls rapidly. However, since the lower portion 90 of the reservoir
is relatively narrow, it contains only a small portion of the liquid being nebulized so there is
relatively little overall effect on aerosol particle size and output from this portion of the liquid.
[0059] The embodiment of the nebulizer shown in FIGS. 1-3 is adapted for use by a
spontaneously breathing patient, so the aerosol from the nebulizer is output to a mouthpiece or
mask that can be used by the spontaneously breathing patient. Accordingly, located in an upper
portion of the chamber 14 is an adapter 99 having a chamber outlet 98 that connects to a
mouthpiece 100. In alternative embodiments, the nebulizer may be used with ventilator systems
and instead of the mouthpiece 100, the adapter 99 would connect the outlet 98 to the ventilator
circuit.
[0060] To operate the nebulizer 10, a suitable amount of a liquid such as a medicine or water is
placed in the reservoir of the chamber 14. The liquid may be placed in the reservoir by first
removing the cover 21, membrane 64, and chimney 50, filling an appropriate amount of liquid
into the reservoir, and replacing the cover 21, membrane 64, and chimney 50 onto the housing
12. In a preferred embodiment, the cover, membrane and chimney are assembled together and
would be removable together as a unit. Alternatively, the liquid may be placed into the reservoir
through the mouthpiece 100, or further, the nebulizer may be provided pre-filled with the
appropriate amount of medicine from the manufacturer, or in yet another alternative, the
nebulizer may be provided with a resealable fill port. The source of pressurized gas 27 is
connected to the fitting 28. The source of pressurized gas 27 may be an external source, for
example, a hospital wall outlet that provides pressurized gas at a flow rate of 4 to 10 liters per
minute in a range from 45 to 55 psi, or a home care compressor that provides gas a flow rate of
3 to 5 liters per minute and in a range of 15 to 20 psi. Gas is delivered through the passageway

                                                   13
34 and is expelled from the gas outlet orifice 38 into the chamber 14. However, at this stage,
prior to inhalation by the patient, the gas travels upward from the gas outlet orifice 38 and
nebulization does not occur since the baffle 60 is in the non-nebulizing position. The membrane
64 holds the chimney assembly 50, including the baffle 60, away from the nozzle 24. In one
embodiment, when in the non-nebulizing position, the distance between the baffle 60 and the
top of the nozzle is approximately 3.81 mm. At this distance, the gap between the baffle 60 and
the nozzle 24 is such that the flow of gas does not create sufficient negative pressure over the
liquid orifice 46 to draw out the liquid.
[0061] To generate an aerosol with the nebulizer, the patient places the mouthpiece 100 to
his/her mouth. When the patient inhales, air is withdrawn from the chamber 14 reducing the
pressure inside the housing 12. The lower pressure in the chamber 14 causes the membrane 64
to flex drawing the chimney 50 down. The lower position of the chimney 50 is shown in FIG. 1
A. Downward movement of the chimney 50 is limited by the stop pins 80. When the stop pins
80 limit the downward movement of the chimney 50, the baffle 60 its diverter surface area are
spaced a predetermined distance 'h' from the top surface 39 of the nozzle assembly 24. In one
embodiment, the gap 'h' is approximately 0.84 mm. In alternative embodiments, the distance 'h'
may be larger or smaller, as described herein, in order to alter the performance of the nebulizer.
[0062] The pressurized gas, which may be continuously injected into the nebulizer through the
fitting 38, is diverted sideways approximately 90 degrees by the baffle 60. Since the gas outlet
orifice 38, baffle 60 and nozzle top 39 are generally circular, gas exiting the orifice 38 is
dispersed evenly in an approximately 360 degrees or radial pattern. The liquid medicine in the
reservoir is then drawn up the channel 42 and out of the liquid outlet orifice 46 in part by the
negative pressure caused by the moving gas passing over the liquid outlet orifice. The liquid
drawn into the diverted gas stream is aerosolized at least by the time it reaches the larger volume
space of the chamber. In one embodiment, the liquid medicine drawn out of the liquid orifice 46
has little or no impaction against the baffle 60. However, in alternative embodiments, the liquid
drawn into the gas stream may be directed against the baffle 60.
[0063] As the liquid is nebulized it travels into the chamber 14 along a path around the lower
edge of the cover 74. As the patient inhales, the nebulized liquid travels upward through the gap
86 between the cover 74 and the diverting ring 82, and out through the mouthpiece 100 to the
patient's respiratory tract.

                                                   14
[0064] When the patient ceases to inhale, the pressure in the chamber 14 rises. The biasing of
the membrane 64 is again sufficient to move the chimney 50 upward, increasing the distance
between the baffle 60 and the top surface 39 of the nozzle assembly 24, and causing
nebulization of the liquid to cease. In alternative embodiments, a spring, pneumatic valve, or
other biasing device may be utilized, alone or in combination with each other and the
membrane, to move the baffle 60 into a non-nebulizing position. Thus, the nebulizer
automatically cycles aerosol generation in time with the breathing cycle of the patient.
[0065] If the patient exhales into the nebulizer, no nebulization occurs since the baffle 60 is in
the non-nebulizing position due to the biasing of the membrane 64. Upward travel of the
chimney 50 is limited by the cover 21.
[0066] During inhalation, some air flow may be provided through the nebulizer in a path
through the chimney 50. This air flow into the chamber 14 may be provided from ambient in a
path provided through the ports 72, the chimney inlet 56, the chimney passageway 52, and the
chimney outlet. This air flow may continue during both inhalation when the chimney 50 is in
the lower position and exhalation when the chimney is in the higher position. Alternatively, the
air flow through the chimney 50 may be stopped or reduced during inhalation when the chimney
50 is in the lower position. Control of the airflow through the nebulizer during inhalation or
exhalation may be effected by suitable selections of the dimensions of the chimney inlet 56, the
chimney outlet, the actuator ports 72, the baffle ring 82, and other components that affect
airflow through the chamber, such as any filters.
[0067] In the embodiment described above, the membrane 64 provides an elastic triggering
threshold that permits cyclical nebulization to occur that coincides with the breathing of the
patient. This threshold is set to fall within normal human breathing parameters so that the baffle
moves into and out of proximity with the nozzle top as a result of the patient's normal breathing.
In one embodiment, this level may be approximately less than or equal to 3.0 cm of water.
[0068] It can be appreciated that the threshold may be established at different levels to account
for different classes of patients. For example, if the nebulizer is designed to be used with infants
or neonatals, the elastic threshold of the membrane may be lower than the threshold used for
adults. Similarly, a different threshold may be used for geriatric patients. The nebulizer may be
used also for veterinary applications, such as equine or canine. In veterinary applications, there

                                                 15
may be a relatively wide range of thresholds related to the various sizes of animals. Nebulizers
having suitably chosen operating thresholds can be designed for veterinary uses.
[0069] It is also recognized that the openings into the chamber, such as the opening 56, may
affect the operating threshold for nebulization. Thus, the operating threshold of the nebulizer
may be made readily adjustable by making the actuator 68 adjustable. Alternatively, the
operating threshold may be adjusted by selection of the size of the openings 56 and 72 into the
chamber which would also control air entrainment. This would permit the user to adjust the
thresholds, if desired. By appropriate adjustment of the operating thresholds, flow control
through the nebulizer can be provided. For example, it may be desirable that the patient not
inhale or exhale too quickly or too deeply. For adults, a suitable flow rate may be approximately
30-60 liters/minute. The openings into and out of the chamber may be suitably adjusted to
provide for these rates.
[0070] The nebulizer may be operated manually instead of relying on the breath-actuated
feature. To operate the nebulizer manually, the actuator 70 is pressed down toward the cover 21.
As mentioned above, the actuator 70 is connected to the chimney 50. Pressing the actuator 70
brings the baffle 60 down into the nebulizing position close to the nozzle 24. Release of the
actuator 70 causes the chimney 50 to rise due to the biasing of the membrane 64 thereby causing
nebulization to cease.
[0071] The breath actuation of the nebulizer is convenient and efficient. By cycling the
nebulization of the liquid, the nebulizer can be more efficient thereby reducing the cost of the
therapy.
[0072] An important advantage follows from the feature of this nebulizer that nebulization can
be cycled so as to occur in coordination with a physiological cycle of the patient. Specifically,
by nebulizing only during an inhalation, for example, the dosage of medication delivered to the
patient can be more accurately delivered and monitored. This enables this embodiment of the
nebulizer to provide for dosimetric medication delivery to an extent that has been otherwise
unavailable. By limiting the medication delivery to the inhalation cycle of the patient, a
dosimetric portion of the medication can be provided.
[0073] In addition, the nebulizer 10 provides for high output and uniform nebulization due to
the arrangement of the gas and liquid orifices 38 and 46 relative to the baffle 60. The annular

                                                   16
configuration of the liquid orifice 46 relative to the gas orifice provides for aerosol generation in
an approximately 360 degree direction. This enables a relatively high and uniform rate of
nebulization.
[0074] In a present embodiment, the membrane 64 is biased to keep the chimney in an upper,
non-nebulizing position except during inhalation. Thus, in the periods of time between
inhalations and exhalations, or if the patient pauses and removes the mouthpiece, nebulizing
does not take place. In alternative embodiments, the membrane 64 may bias the chimney
downward so that the nebulizer generates an aerosol or nebula except during exhalation. This
alternative may not be as efficient as the prior alternative, but may still provide significant
advantages over nebulizers that generate aerosol continuously.
[0075] In further alternative embodiments of the nebulizer, the gas orifice 38, the gas
passageway 34, or a portion thereof, may have a shape that modifies the force of the pressurized
gas against the baffle 60. For example, the gas orifice 38 may have a shape that facilitates the
change of direction of the gas when it is directed against the baffle, so that the force of the gas
would not move the baffle away during inhalation thereby helping to direct the gas out into the
chamber. In other embodiments, the geometry may be varied to tailor gas force and flow.
[0076] As mentioned above, the membrane 62 serves as a biasing member that moves the
baffle. Preferably, the membrane is constructed of a silicone rubber material. Other materials
capable of repetitive flexing, compression or expansion in response to the force of inhaled or
exhaled air, such as a spring, or elastic bellows, may also be used. The biasing member is
constructed so that it will move the baffle a predetermined distance away from or toward the
nozzle during the course of a patient's spontaneous or ventilated breathing.
[0077] In a present embodiment, the baffle moves up and down in response to the patient's
breathing. Alternative embodiments contemplate various means of bringing or diverting the gas
and liquid streams into proximity in a cyclical basis.
[0078] In alternative embodiments, for instance, instead of moving a baffle into proximity with
a gas outlet, the liquid jet or orifice can be moved toward the gas jet or orifice, or is otherwise
directed toward the gas jet or orifice, or vice versa. For example, as shown and described in U.S.
Patent No. 6,929,003 (the entirety of which is herein incorporated by reference), particularly
with reference to FIGS. 12 and 13 in U.S. Patent No. 6,929,003, a nozzle cover consists of two

                                                    17
portions. A first portion is fixed at the top of a gas nozzle, so that the pressurized gas outlet,
baffle, and annular orifice of a fluid outlet are all fixedly positioned with respect to one another
at a spacing suitable for nebulization. The second portion is attached to an actuator piston and is
moveable a predetermined distance up and down the axis of the gas nozzle so that the annular
orifice of the fluid inlet moves with the actuator piston. As with the previously described
embodiments, one or more fluid pathways are defined by spacing between the gas nozzle and
nozzle cover, grooves in the nozzle cover, grooves in the gas nozzle, or a combination of these
options. In the non-actuating position, the second portion is separate from the first portion such
that a gap of a predetermined distance exists between the two portions. As a result of the gap,
the first portion of the nozzle cover does not contact the fluid reservoir and there is no
continuous fluid pathway between the fluid orifices, in other words no pathway exists from the
reservoir and fluid inlet to the fluid outlet, so that no fluid may reach the fluid outlet. In the
actuating position, the second portion is moved up until it mates or abuts with the first portion.
The two portions cooperate to form at least one continuous fluid pathway between the fluid
outlet and the reservoir. The continuous fluid pathway permits the negative pressure over the
fluid outlet to draw fluid from the reservoir and initiate nebulization.
[0079] In alternative embodiments, the entire nozzle 24 can move instead of the baffle, or
alternatively, both the nozzle and the baffle can move. Also, in a present embodiment, the baffle
movement is up and down, but in alternative embodiments, the movement can be side to side,
rotating, or pivoting. Finally, in other embodiments, the baffle, orifices, nozzle, and other
elements may all be fixed so that he nebulizer is a continuous nebulizer rather than a breath
actuated nebulizer.
[0080] In alternative embodiments of the nebulizer, the liquid orifice may have shapes other
than annular. For example, the liquid orifice may be located aside the gas orifice. Alternatively,
the liquid orifice may be formed of a series of orifices positioned aside or annularly around the
gas orifice.
[0081] Further descriptions of some of the previously described nebulizers may be found in
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,823,179; 6,044,841; and 6,929,003, the entireties of which are herein
incorporated by reference. The concepts described herein may be applied to the foregoing U.S.
Patents and to other nebulizers as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,450,163; 7,270,123;
7,634,995; 7,905,228; and 8,397,712 (the entireties of which are herein incorporated by

                                                   18
reference), as well as to commercially available nebulizers, including for example, the
AEROECLIPSE@ 11 breathactuated nebulizer ("AEll" or "AEII BAN") available from Trudell
Medical International of London, Canada.
[0082] Baffle disc diameter (i.e., diverter surface area) and liquid volume (i.e., the aggregate
volume between the outer tubular member and the inner tubular member including channels,
gaps, passageways, or slots) are key components to nebulizer performance. Varying the size of
the baffle disc diameter and liquid volume can directly affect aerosol output rate, without
negatively impacting particle size (e.g., Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter, or "MMAD") and
the range of particles respirable deep into the respiratory system (e.g., the percentage of aerosol
particle population less than 4.7 pim, or "%<4.7pm"). With a smaller baffle disc diameter and a
larger liquid volume, the aerosol output rate is shown to be greatly improved, especially when
the nebulizer is utilized at lower air supply pressures, such as those seen on a home care
compressor.
[0083] Testing has shown that a smaller baffle disc diameter provides a greater aerosol output
rate than a larger baffle diameter. These results are unexpected and counterintuitive because
normal expectations are that a larger vacuum would be provided by a larger baffle disc, and that
the larger the baffle disc, the greater the pull on the liquid, thus resulting in a higher output rate.
Normal expectations are also that a larger baffle disc would provide better aerosolization since
the larger baffle offers more diverter surface area for break-up of liquid. Additionally, normal
expectations are that a larger baffle provides more opportunity for particle impaction and
aerosolization.
[0084] Testing has also shown that an increase in liquid volume, for example, by increasing
liquid cylinder cross sectional area (i.e., by increasing the annular gap between the liquid
cylinder and gas nozzle), or by adding additional channels or passageways or slots, will increase
aerosol output rate. These results are also unexpected and counterintuitive because normal
expectations are that a larger liquid cylinder crosssectional area would require stronger negative
pressure to draw up the liquid for aerosolization, and hence a larger baffle would be thought to
be required for a larger liquid cylinder cross-sectional area. Normal expectations are also that a
larger liquid cylinder cross-sectional area would result in larger residual volume.

[0085] Turning to FIG. 4, a cross-sectional view of a nebulizer 210 is shown with components
and dimensions representative of those found in the AEROECLIPSE@ II breath-actuated
nebulizer. The nebulizer 210 of FIG. 4 may be described as a nebulizer having a fixed baffle 260
and a liquid orifice 246 or portion thereof that is moveable, such as those described in U.S.
Patent No. 6,929,003. In this embodiment, the nebulizer 210 has a baffle disc diameter of 4.20
mm (or a diverter surface area of 13.85 mm 2), a liquid outlet orifice 246 diameter of 2.52 mm, a
liquid cylinder diameter of 5.55 mm at the top end 240a of the liquid cylinder 240, a liquid
cylinder diameter of 6.54 mm at the bottom end 240b of the liquid cylinder 240, three additional
liquid channels or slots 242 of 0.44 mm formed in the wall 239 of the liquid cylinder 240, and a
liquid gap 241 of 0.15mm formed between the outer tubular member, or the liquid cylinder 240,
and the inner tubular member, or the gas nozzle 232. This nebulizer 210 has an equivalent liquid
volume of 55 mm 3
[0086] FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the nebulizer 210 of FIG. 4 with particular
dimensions modified to improve performance of the nebulizer 210. The dimensions shown in
the embodiment of FIG. 5 are considered preferred dimensions in that they are believed to
provide optimal performance of the nebulizer. In this embodiment, a nebulizer 210' has a baffle
260' with a baffle disc diameter of 1.50 mm (or a diverter surface area of 1.77 mm 2), a liquid
outlet orifice 246' diameter of 2.52 mm, a liquid cylinder diameter of 7.00 mm at the top end
240a' of the liquid cylinder 240, a liquid cylinder diameter of 7.98 mm at the bottom end 240b'
of the liquid cylinder, no additional liquid channels or slots, and a liquid gap 241' of 0.88mm
formed between the outer tubular member, or the liquid cylinder 240, and the inner tubular
member, or the gas nozzle 232. This nebulizer has an equivalent liquid volume of 286 mm3 .
[0087] FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional side view of the 210 nebulizer of FIG. 4 showing ranges of
particular dimensions intended to enhance performance of the nebulizer 210. The ranges of
dimensions shown in FIG. 6 are alternative dimensions that are intended to result in improved
performance of the nebulizer. For example, a nebulizer 210" may have a baffle 260" with a
baffle disc diameter of 1.00 mm to 2.50 mm (or a diverter surface area of 0.79 mm 2 to 4.91
mm 2), a liquid outlet orifice 246" diameter of 2.22 mm to 4.50 mm, a liquid cylinder diameter of
5.50 mm to 9.00 mm at the top end 240a" of the liquid cylinder 240, a liquid cylinder diameter
of 6.50 mm to 10.00 mm at the bottom end 240b" of the liquid cylinder, no additional liquid
channels or slots, and a liquid gap 241" of 0.40 mm to 2.00 mm formed between the outer

                                                 20
tubular member, or the liquid cylinder 240, and the inner tubular member, or the gas nozzle 232.
This nebulizer may have a range of equivalent liquid volume of 80 mm 3 to 1000 mm3 .
[0088] FIG. 7 is cross-sectional side view of another embodiment of a nebulizer 310 shown
with ranges of particular dimensions intended to enhance performance of the nebulizer 310. The
nebulizer 310 of FIG. 7 is like the nebulizer 210 of FIG. 4 in that it may be described as a
nebulizer having a fixed baffle 360 and a liquid orifice 346 or portion thereof that is moveable,
similar to those described in U.S. Patent No. 6,929,003. However, the nebulizer 310 of FIG. 7
has a baffle 360 in the shape of a rib having a diverter surface area that covers at least 50% of
the liquid outlet orifice 346. This embodiment also has a liquid outlet orifice diameter of 2.22
mm to 4.50 mm, a liquid cylinder diameter of 5.50 mm to 9.00 mm at the top end 340a of the
liquid cylinder 340, a liquid cylinder diameter of 6.50 mm to 10.00 mm at the bottom end 340b
of the liquid cylinder 340, no additional liquid channels or slots, and a liquid gap of 0.40 mm to
2.00 mm formed between the outer tubular member, or the liquid cylinder 340, and the inner
tubular member, or the gas nozzle 332. This nebulizer 310 may have a range of equivalent liquid
volume of 80 mm3 to 1000 mm3 .
[0089] FIG. 8 is a cross-sectional side view of another embodiment of a nebulizer 410 with
ranges of particular dimensions intended to enhance performance of the nebulizer 410.
Specifically, the nebulizer of FIG. 8 may have a baffle 460 with a baffle disc diameter of 01.00
mm to 2.50 mm (or a diverter surface area of 0.79 mm2 to 4.91 mm 2 ), a liquid outlet orifice 446
diameter of 2.52 mm to 4.50 mm, and one or more liquid channels 442 formed in the wall 439
of the liquid cylinder 440 of a quantity and size that results in an equivalent liquid volume of 80
mm3 to 1000 mm 3.The nebulizer 410 of FIG. 8 omits the liquid gap formed between the outer
tubular member, or the liquid cylinder 440, and the inner tubular member, or the gas nozzle 432.
[0090] FIG. 9 is a cross-sectional side view of another commercial nebulizer 510 modified with
ranges of particular dimensions intended to enhance performance of the nebulizer 510. The
nebulizer 510 of FIG. 9 may be characterized as having a moveable baffle 560 and a fixed
nozzle assembly 524, such as those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,823,179 and 6,044,841. In
this embodiment, the nebulizer 510 may have a moveable baffle disc diameter of 1.00 mm to
2.50 mm (or a diverter surface area of 0.79 mm2 to 4.91 mm 2), a liquid outlet orifice 546
diameter of 2.25 mm to 4.50 mm, a liquid cylinder diameter of 5.50 mm to 9.00 mm at the top
end 540a of the liquid cylinder 540, a liquid cylinder diameter of 6.50 mm to 10.00 mm at the

                                                  21
bottom end 540b of the liquid cylinder 540, no additional liquid channels or slots, and a liquid
gap 541 formed between the outer tubular member, or the liquid cylinder 540, and the inner
tubular member, or the gas nozzle 532, such that the device has an equivalent liquid volume of
80 mm 3 to 1000 mm3 .
[0091] The combined effect of baffle size and liquid volume/liquid cylinder cross sectional area
on aerosol output rate is shown in FIG. 10 at various air supply pressures. In FIG. 10, an AEII
BAN device modified with a baffle disc diameter of 03.50 mm, and with existing liquid
volume/liquid channel dimensions, was filled with nebulizer solution (albuterol) and aerosolized
for 2 minutes continuously (dial set to continuous mode) while an inhalation flow of 28.3 1pm
was applied. The drug was collected onto a filter and assayed. The total amount of drug
collected in 2 minutes was then determined and divided in half to obtain the output per minute.
This was done for air supply pressures of 15 psi, 20 psi, and 50 psi. Next, the baffle disc
diameter of the AEII BAN was reduced to 1.50 mm and the cross-sectional area of the AEII
BAN liquid cylinder increased by 50%, which resulted in an increased liquid volume. This
device combination was then tested using the 2-minute continuous drug output test method
described above. Results show that the reduced baffle disc diameter and the increased liquid
volume/liquid cylinder cross-sectional area have greater aerosol performance -in this particular
test, improving aerosol output rate at the lower air supply pressures of 15 psi and 20 psi by as
much as 75%, and by approximately 10% at the higher air supply pressure of 50 psi.
[0092] In FIG. 11, similar two-minute continuous drug output testing was conducted, but in this
testing, the effect of baffle size alone on aerosol output rate was determined for given liquid
cylinder cross-sectional areas. First, an AEII BAN device was modified with a small baffle
diameter (1.50 mm) and then a large baffle diameter (3.50 mm) and tested using the 2-minute
continuous drug output testing previously described. For the same liquid volume/liquid cylinder
cross-sectional area, aerosol output rate was shown to decrease with an increase in baffle
diameter. Next, the AEII BAN liquid cylinder cross sectional area was increased by 50%. This
larger liquid cylinder cross sectional area was then combined with the same two baffle diameter
sizes of 1.50 mm and 3.50 mm. Again, 2-minute continuous drug output test results showed a
decrease in aerosol output rate with an increase in baffle diameter.
[0093] Further investigation into the effect of baffle size and liquid volume/liquid cylinder cross
sectional area on aerosol output rate was conducted by testing various baffle sizes in

                                                 22
combination with various liquid cylinder cross sectional areas under simulated breathing
conditions. An ASL5000 Test Lung was set up for this testing with the following test
parameters: Tidal Volume: 600mL, 1:E ratio 1:2, BPM 10. A 5 1pm air supply was applied to
the nebulizer as the driving gas. The following nebulizer combinations were tested:

[0094] Each device was first particle size tested using a Malvern Spraytech Unit to obtain
MMAD particle size data and %<4.7pm. Each nebulizer combination listed above was then
filled with 3 mL of nebulizer solution and placed on the breathing simulator apparatus. The
devices were tested with the dial set to continuous mode. A bacterial filter was placed at the
nebulizer outlet to capture the aerosol. Each device was run until "sputter" and bacterial filters
were changed every minute. Filters were assayed for total amount collected on each filter.
Respirable amount was calculated by multiplying the total amount collected on the filter by the
%<4.7pm. This equates to the respirable output per minute.
[0095] FIG. 12 shows the effect of baffle size on aerosol output rate for a preferred liquid
volume/liquid cylinder cross sectional area of a 50% increase in AEII liquid cylinder cross
sectional area. Results show that for a nebulizer device with the same liquid cylinder cross
sectional area, aerosol output rate improves with the smaller baffle diameter. In this particular

                                                  23
test, aerosol output rate increased by approximately 23% going from the larger 3.5 mm baffle to
the smaller 1.5 mm baffle.
[0096] The effect of liquid volume/liquid cylinder cross sectional area on aerosol output rate can
be seen in FIGS. 13 and 14. For a given baffle diameter, the cumulative respirable aerosol
output is plotted over time (output rate) for the various liquid cylinder cross sectional areas
tested. In FIG. 13, the baseline device for comparison purposes was the current AEII BAN
device. Results show that for a baffle size of 1.50 mm, aerosol output rate increases with an
increase in liquid cylinder cross sectional area. In this particular test, aerosol output rate
increased from the baseline device by 83% to 89% for increases in liquid cylinder cross
sectional area of 135% and 50% respectively. An increase in aerosol output rate of
approximately 45% was seen with the increase in liquid cylinder cross sectional area of 36%.
Another important aspect seen from the test results is the decrease in delivery time. That is to
say, delivery time decreases as the size of the liquid cylinder cross sectional area increases.
[0097] Increased aerosol output rate and decreased delivery time are significant from a
therapeutic standpoint because it means more medication can be delivered quickly, for example,
in the event of an asthmatic episode. It also means less treatment time for a patient -with more
medication being delivered per minute, the patient can receive the required dosage in less time.
This is important since a patient's time is valuable and many patients may forgo their treatment
if the treatment time is too long. By improving the aerosol output rate and decreasing delivery
time, patients may be more likely to complete their treatments, which may prevent asthmatic
episodes, and as result, reduce trips to the hospital.
[0098] FIG. 14 shows the effect of liquid volume/liquid cylinder cross sectional area on aerosol
output rate for a baffle disc diameter of 3.5 mm. The results from FIG. 14 again show an
increase in aerosol output rate with increase in liquid cylinder cross sectional area. The results
also shows a decrease in aerosol output rate compared to FIG. 13, where the only difference is
the smaller baffle diameter size (1.5 mm). Looking strictly at the effect of liqiud cylinder cross
sectional area on the 3.5 mm baffle, output rate increased compared to the baseline device of
this group (4.2 mm Baffle/Current AEIl BAN device) anywhere from 35% to 40% for the
various sized liquid cylinder cross sectional areas. Comparing results to those in FIG. 13,
aerosol output rate for the larger baffle 3.5 mm decreased by 20% to 26% for increases in liquid
cylinder cross sectional areas of 50% and 135% respectively, and 3% for the increase in liquid

                                                  24
cylinder cross sectional area of 36%. Again, delivery time is shown to decrease with an increase
in liquid channel cross sectional area relative to the baseline AEII device.
[0099] The effect of a small baffle size and liquid volume/liquid channel cross sectional area
can also be seen on the aerosol output rate of another commercially available nebulizer. As
shown in the cross-sectional views of FIGS. 15-17, another commercially available nebulizer
610 was tested along with several modified versions of that device. The nebulizer 610 of FIG.
15 may be described as having a fixed baffle 660 and a fixed nozzle cover 670 with a plurality
of liquid channels 642 formed in the outer wall 643 of the air supply post or inner nozzle 632.
The nebulizer of FIG. 15 omits any liquid gap formed between the outer tubular member, or the
liquid cylinder 640, and the inner tubular member, or the gas nozzle 632. The modified versions
of that device 610' involved an increase in the cross-sectional area of the liquid channels 642' to
obtain an overall 60% increase in volume of the liquid channels 642', as seen in FIG. 16, and
then decreasing the cross sectional area of the liquid channels 642" to obtain an overall 10%
reduction in volume of the liquid channels 642", as seen in the device 610" of FIG. 17. The
liquid channels 642, 642', and 642" of the nebulizers of FIG. 15-17 are compared in FIG. 18.
[0100] Testing of these nebulizers was conducted on the ASL5000 breathing simulator, using
the same parameters as previously described for the AEII nebulizer modifications discussed in
FIGS. 13 and 14. Furthermore, a 6 Ipm air supply was provided to the nebulizer as the driving
gas. Test results of the baseline nebulizer shown in FIG. 15 and modified versions shown in
FIGS. 16 and 17 are presented in FIG. 19. These test results confirm that aerosol output rate can
be affected by liquid channel cross sectional area (and hence liquid channel volume) -a small
baffle diameter combined with a large liquid channel cross sectional area provides an increase in
aerosol output rate. In the case of the commercially available nebulizer of FIG. 15, increasing
the liquid channel volume by 60% resulted in an increase in aerosol output rate of approximately
50%. Decreasing the liquid channel volume by 10% resulted in a decrease in aerosol output rate
of approximately 3%. Also important to note, aerosol delivery time decreased with the increase
in liquid channel volume and increased with the decrease in liquid channel volume. This is
consistent with test results for the modified AEII nebulizer testing.
[0101] The results detailed herein are significant because they indicate that both baffle diameter
and liquid volume/liquid cylinder cross sectional area impact aerosol output rate and aerosol
delivery time, while not negatively affecting particle size. By combining a small baffle disc

                                                  25
diameter with various sizes of liquid volume/liquid cylinder cross sectional area, the nebulizer
aerosol output rate and delivery time can be optimized for maximum benefit to the end user. The
nebulizer could be optimized for treatment by the patient at home or for treatment in a hospital,
depending on the requirements. For example, the objective may be to provide a nebulizer
treatment at home to an end user with a hectic daily life, and thus to provide a given amount of
medication to the end user in as short a time as possible in order not to disrupt the end user's
busy schedule. The nebulizer for this application could be a combination of a small baffle disc
diameter (e.g., 1.50 mm) with a large liquid channel size (e.g., 50% increase in AEII liquid
cylinder cross sectional area). Alternatively, the nebulizer application may be treatment in a
hospital for delivery of a medication requiring a longer delivery time (for instance due to drug
potency). In this case, the nebulizer for this application may be a slightly larger baffle disc
diameter (e.g., 2.50 mm) with a slightly smaller liquid channel size (e.g., 25% increase in AEII
liquid cylinder cross sectional area). In other words, depending on the patient requirements and
the driving gas pressure to be utilized with the device (e.g., homecare compressor or hospital
wall air supply), the appropriate combination of baffle disc diameter and liquid channel size
could be selected in order to provide the most effective nebulizer treatment to the end user.
[0102] The above nebulizer embodiments have been described for use in medical or therapeutic
applications. It is intended that the foregoing detailed description be regarded as illustrative
rather than limiting.
