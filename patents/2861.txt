                                                FIELD
15         The present disclosure is in the fields of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis; e.g., for
   the treatment of ischemic events such as stroke. It is also in the field of stem cells and
   cells derived from stem cells by genetic manipulation.
                                          BACKGROUND
20         In stable stroke, reinstating vascular flow is imperative for restoring nutrient
   supply in the brain. To repair vascular damage after prolonged ischemia, at least two
   sequential steps are needed. The first step is angiogenic sprouting of endothelial cells
   (ECs); this process entails the initial proliferation of endothelial cells and remodeling of
   the surrounding extracellular matrix. VEGF-mediated proliferation of ECs and matrix
25 metalloproteinases are among the major components of angiogenic sprouting. The
   second step is vessel stabilization; a process that relies on recruitment of vascular smooth
   muscle cells to encase the young vessels. Monocytes and pericytes are also involved in
   vessel stabilization, producing the appropriate arteriogenic factors and extracellular
   matrix proteins. In the absence of vessel stabilization by smooth muscle cells and
30 pericytes, regression of nascent vasculature can occur.
                                                   1

      WO 2013/112917                                                           PCT/US2013/023271
            Marrow stromal cells (MSCs, also known as mesenchymal stem cells)) have been
   shown to promote revascularization after cerebral artery occlusion and traumatic brain in
   jury. Omori et al. (2008) Brain Res. 1236:30-38; Onda et al. (2008) J Cereb. Blood
   Flow Metab. 28:329-340; Pavlichenko et al. (2008) Brain Res. 1233:203-213; Xiong et
 5 al.(2009) Brain Res. 1263:183-191. SB623 cells are a derivative of marrow stromal
   cells, obtained by transfecting marrow stromal cells with a vector containing sequences
   encoding a Notch intracellular domain (NICD). See, for example, U.S. Patent No.
   7,682,825 and Dezawa et al. (2004) J Clin. Investig. 13:1701-1710. SB623 cells elicit
   functional improvement in experimental stroke models. See, for example, U.S. Patent
10 No. 8,092,792 and Yasuhara et al. (2009) Stem Cells andDevelopment 18:1501-1514.
   Although the secretome of SB623 cells is comparable to that of the parental MSCs;
   different levels of specific trophic factors have been observed to be secreted by MSCs, as
   compared to SB623 cells. See, for example, Tate et al. (2010) Cell Transplantation
    19:973-984; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0266554. Moreover, many of
15 the factors whose expression levels differ between MSCs and SB623 cells have been
   reported to be involved in vascular regeneration.
            Because stroke is a leading cause of adult disability in the United States, and is
   the second leading cause of death worldwide, there remains a need for treatments to
   restore blood supply to, and promote reperfusion of, regions of stroke-induced ischemic
20 damage in the brain.
                                             SUMMARY
            The present inventors have discovered that descendents of mesenchymal stem
   cells that have been transfected with sequences encoding a Notch intracellular domain
25 (i.e., SB623 cells) have the surprising property of being able to synthesize and secrete
   factors that promote angiogenesis. Because angiogenesis, i.e., the formation of new
   blood vessels, is a critical part of the endogenous repair process in brain injury and
   disease, this discovery provides new methods of treatment for vascular disorders such as
   stroke.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           Disclosed herein are new methods and compositions for modulation of
   angiogenesis. In particular, factors secreted by SB623 cells (cells descended from MSCs
30 that have been transfected with a vector containing sequences encoding a Notch
   intracellular domain) promote survival and proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro under
                                                  13

      WO 2013/112917                                                            PCT/US2013/023271
   serum- and growth factor-deprived conditions, and stimulate vascular tube formation by
   human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In addition, conditioned medium from SB623
   cells promoted endothelial sprouting and branching in a rodent aortic ring assay.
            Practice of the present disclosure employs, unless otherwise indicated, standard
 5 methods and conventional techniques in the fields of cell biology, toxicology, molecular
   biology, biochemistry, cell culture, immunology, oncology, recombinant DNA and
   related fields as are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are described in the
   literature and thereby available to those of skill in the art. See, for example, Alberts, B. et
   al., "Molecular Biology of the Cell," 5th edition, Garland Science, New York, NY, 2008;

            For the purposes of the present disclosure, "angiogenesis" refers to the formation
   of new vasculature (e.g., blood vessels; e.g., veins, arteries, venules, arterioles,
   capillaries). Angiogenesis can occur by sprouting of new vessels from an existing vessel,
20 and/or by branching of a vessel. Angiogenesis also includes the attendant processes of
   matrix remodeling and cell recruitment (e.g., recruitment of smooth muscle cells,
   monocytes and/or pericytes).
            "MSCs" refer to adherent, non-hematopoietic stem cells obtained from bone
   marrow. These cells are variously known as mesenchymal stem cells, mesenchymal
25 stromal cells, marrow adherent stromal cells, marrow adherent stem cells and bone
   marrow stromal cells.
            Stroke
            "Stroke" is the name given to conditions resulting from impairment of blood flow
30 in the brain. Such cerebrovascular impairment can result, for example, from intracranial
   hemorrhage, or from reduction or blockage of blood flow in the brain (i.e., cerebral
                                                   14

      WO 2013/112917                                                            PCT/US2013/023271
    ischemia). Ischemic blockages can result from thrombosis (i.e., formation of a clot in situ
    in a cranial vessel or a vessel supplying the brain) or from a cerebral embolism (i.e.,
   migration of a clot to a site in the brain). The damage resulting from ischemic or
   hemorrhagic stroke usually results in impairment of neurological function. Additional
 5 information relating to different types of stroke, and their characteristics, is found in co
   owned U.S. Patent No. 8,092,792; the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in
   its entirety herein for the purpose of describing different types of stroke and their
   characteristics.
10          Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
            The present disclosure provides methods for promoting angiogenesis by
   transplanting SB623 cells to a site of ischemic injury in a subject. SB623 cells are
   obtained from marrow adherent stromal cells, also known as mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs), by expressing the intracellular domain of the Notch protein in the MSCs. MSCs
15 are obtained by selecting adherent cells (i.e., cells that adhere to tissue culture plastic)
   from bone marrow.
            Exemplary disclosures of MSCs are provided in U.S. patent application
   publication No. 2003/0003090; Prockop (1997) Science 276:71-74 and Jiang (2002)
   Nature 418:41-49. Methods for the isolation and purification of MSCs can be found, for
20 example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,486,359; Pittenger et al. (1999) Science 284:143-147 and
   Dezawa et al. (2001) Eur. J. Neurosci. 14:1771-1776. Human MSCs are commercially
   available (e.g., BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) or can be obtained from donors by, e.g.,
   bone marrow aspiration, followed by selection for adherent bone marrow cells. See, e.g.,
   WO 2005/100552.
25          MSCs can also be isolated from umbilical cord blood. See, for example,
   Campagnoli et al. (2001) Blood 98:2396-2402; Erices et al. (2000) Br. J Haematol.

            Notch Intracellular Domain
30          The Notch protein is a transmembrane receptor, found in all metazoans, that
   influences cell differentiation through intracellular signaling. Contact of the Notch
                                                  15

   extracellular domain with a Notch ligand (e.g., Delta, Serrate, Jagged) results in two
   proteolytic cleavages of the Notch protein, the second of which is catalyzed by a 7
   secretase and releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) into the cytoplasm. In the
   mouse Notch protein, this cleavage occurs between amino acids gly1743 and val1744.
 5 The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor, recruiting
   additional transcriptional regulatory proteins (e.g., MAM, histone acetylases) to relieve
   transcriptional repression of various target genes (e.g., Hes 1).
            Additional details and information regarding Notch signaling are found, for
   example in Artavanis-Tsakonas et al. (1995) Science 268:225-232; Mumm and Kopan

            Cell Culture and Transfection
            Standard methods for cell culture are known in the art. See, for example, R. I.
15 Freshney "Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Technique," Fifth Edition, Wiley,
   New York, 2005.
            Methods for introduction of exogenous DNA into cells (i.e., transfection) are also
   well-known in the art. See, for example, Sambrook et al. "Molecular Cloning: A
   Laboratory Manual," Third Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001;
20 Ausubel et al., "Current Protocols in Molecular Biology," John Wiley & Sons, New
   York, 1987 and periodic updates.
            SB623 cells
            In one embodiment for the preparation of SB623 cells, a culture of MSCs is
25 contacted with a polynucleotide comprising sequences encoding a Notch intracellular
   domain (NICD); e.g., by transfection; followed by enrichment of transfected cells by
   drug selection and further culture. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 7,682,825 (March
   23, 2010); U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0266554 (Oct. 21, 2010); and
   WO 2009/023251 (Feb. 19, 2009); all of which disclosures are incorporated by reference,
30 in their entireties, for the purposes of describing isolation of mesenchymal stem cells and
                                                   16

      WO 2013/112917                                                           PCT/US2013/023271
   conversion of mesenchymal stem cells to SB623 cells (denoted "neural precursor cells"
   and "neural regenerating cells" in those documents).
            In these methods, any polynucleotide encoding a Notch intracellular domain (e.g.,
   vector) can be used, and any method for the selection and enrichment of transfected cells
 5 can be used. For example, in certain embodiments, MSCs are transfected with a vector
   containing sequences encoding a Notch intracellular domain and also containing
   sequences encoding a drug resistance marker (e.g. resistance to G418). In additional
   embodiments, two vectors, one containing sequences encoding a Notch intracellular
   domain and the other containing sequences encoding a drug resistance marker, are used
10 for transfection of MSCs. In these embodiments, selection is achieved, after transfection
   of a cell culture with the vector or vectors, by adding a selective agent (e.g., G418) to the
   cell culture in an amount sufficient to kill cells that do not comprise the vector but spare
   cells that do. Absence of selection entails removal of said selective agent or reduction of
   its concentration to a level that does not kill cells that do not comprise the vector.
15 Following selection (e.g., for seven days) the selective agent is removed and the cells are
   further cultured (e.g., for two passages).
            Preparation of SB623 cells thus involves transient expression of an exogenous
   Notch intracellular domain in a MSC. To this end, MSCs can be transfected with a
   vector comprising sequences encoding a Notch intracellular domain wherein said
20 sequences do not encode a full-length Notch protein. All such sequences are well known
   and readily available to those of skill in the art. For example, Del Amo et al. (1993)
   Genomics 15:259-264 present the complete amino acid sequences of the mouse Notch
   protein; while Mumm and Kopan (2000) Devel. Biol. 228:151-165 provide the amino
   acid sequence, from mouse Notch protein, surrounding the so-called S3 cleavage site
25 which releases the intracellular domain. Taken together, these references provide the
   skilled artisan with each and every peptide containing a Notch intracellular domain that is
   not the full-length Notch protein; thereby also providing the skilled artisan with every
   polynucleotide comprising sequences encoding a Notch intracellular domain that does not
   encode a full-length Notch protein. The foregoing documents (Del Amo and Mumm) are
30 incorporated by reference in their entireties for the purpose of disclosing the amino acid
                                                  17

      WO 2013/112917                                                          PCT/US2013/023271
   sequence of the full-length Notch protein and the amino acid sequence of the Notch
   intracellular domain, respectively.
           Similar information is available for Notch proteins and nucleic acids from
   additional species, including rat, Xenopus, Drosophilaand human. See, for example,
 5 Weinmaster et al. (1991) Development 113:199-205; Schroeter et al. (1998) Nature
   393:382-386; NCBI Reference Sequence No. NM_017167 (and references cited
   therein); SwissProt P46531 (and references cited therein); SwissProt Q01705 (and
   references cited therein); and GenBank CAB40733 (and references cited therein). The
   foregoing references are incorporated by reference in their entireties for the purpose of
10 disclosing the amino acid sequence of the full-length Notch protein and the amino acid
   sequence of the Notch intracellular domain in a number of different species.
           In additional embodiments, SB623 cells are prepared by introducing, into MSCs,
   a nucleic acid comprising sequences encoding a Notch intracellular domain such that the
   MSCs do not express exogenous Notch extracellular domain. Such can be accomplished,
15 for example, by transfecting MSCs with a vector comprising sequences encoding a Notch
   intracellular domain wherein said sequences do not encode a full-length Notch protein.
           Additional details on the preparation of SB623 cells, and methods for making
   cells with properties similar to those of SB623 cells which can be used in the methods
   disclosed herein, are found in U.S. Patent No. 7,682,825; and U.S. Patent Application

           Uses
           As disclosed herein, the inventors have discovered that descendants of
   mesenchymal stem cells in which a Notch intracellular domain has been transiently
   expressed (i.e., SB623 cells) have angiogenic activity; and that said cells synthesize and
30 secrete angiogenic factors. Accordingly, transplantation of SB623 cells is useful for
   treatment of disorders in which a therapeutic benefit can be achieved by increasing

   angiogenesis in a subject. Such disorders include, but are not limited to, cerebral
   ischemia (e.g., stroke), cardiac ischemia (e.g., ischemic heart disease), ischemia of the
   bowel (e.g., ischemic colitis, mesenteric ischemia), ischemia of the limb, cutaneous
   ischemia, ocular ischemic syndrome (e.g., retinal ischemia) and cerebral palsy.
 5          Thus, SB623 cells as described herein can be used in a number of methods related
   to stimulation of angiogenesis. These include, but are not limited to, treatment of any of
   the disorders mentioned in the previous paragraph, augmentation of angiogenesis, repair
   of ischemic damage, preventing death of endothelial cells, enhancing survival of
   endothelial cells, stimulating proliferation of endothelial cells, and/or enhancing the
10 branching of blood vessels,
            Such methods can be performed in vitro or in a subject. The subject can be a
   mammal, preferably a human. Stimulation of angiogenesis by SB623 cells, and the
   attendant effects of such stimulation as disclosed herein, can occur, for example, in the
   central nervous system (e.g., in the brain).
15          Transplantation of SB623 cells can also be used in methods for providing one or
   more angiogenic trophic factors to a subject. Such factors include, but are not limited to,
   angiogenin, angiopoietin-2, epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor,
   heparin-binding epithelial growth factor-like growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor,
   leptin, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, placental growth factor and vascular
20 endothelial growth factor.
            In additional embodiments, SB623 cells can be used in combination with a second
   pro-angiogenic agent, in combination therapies for increasing angiogenesis in a subject.
   Said combination therapies can be used for all of the purposes set forth above. The
   second pro-angiogenic agent can be, e.g., a small molecule drug, a nucleic acid or a
25 polypeptide (e.g., antibody, transcription factor). Exemplary nucleic acids are triplex
   forming nucleic acids, ribozymes and siRNAs that activate expression of angiogenic
   proteins and/or block expression of anti-angiogenic proteins. Exemplary antibodies are
   those that bind to and/or inhibit the activity of angiogenic proteins (or other angiogenic
   agents). Exemplary transcription factors are those that inhibit transcription of a gene
30 encoding one or more anti-angiogenic protein(s), as well as those that activate the
   transcription of one or more pro-angiogenic protein(s). Anti-angiogenic and pro
                                                  19

   angiogenic proteins are known in the art. Exemplary anti-angiogenic proteins include
   pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) and placental growth factor (PlGF).
   Exemplary pro-angiogenic proteins include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
   angiopoietin, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).
 5          In certain embodiments, transcription factors as disclosed above are non
   naturally-occurring (engineered) transcription factors. An example of such a non
   naturally-occurring transcription factor is a non-naturally-occurring zinc finger protein
   that has been engineered to bind to a DNA sequence in cellular chromatin that regulates
   transcription of a target gene (e.g., a VEGF gene). Said engineered zinc finger
10 transcription factors comprise, in addition to an engineered zinc finger DNA-binding
   domain, a transcriptional regulatory domain (e.g., a transcriptional activation domain or a
   transcriptional repression domain), as are known in the art.
            Methods for engineering zinc finger DNA binding domains, to bind to a DNA
   sequence of choice, are well-known in the art. See, for example, Beerli et al. (2002)

   sequences and individual zinc finger amino acid sequences, in which each triplet or
   quadruplet nucleotide sequence is associated with one or more amino acid sequences of
   zinc fingers which bind the particular triplet or quadruplet sequence. See, for example,

    VP16 and VP64. Exemplary transcriptional repression domains include KRAB, KAP-1,
    MAD, FKHR, ERD and SID. Functional domains from nuclear hormone receptors can
    act as either activators or repressors, depending upon the presence of a ligand. See also

            Formulations, kits and routes of administration
            Therapeutic compositions comprising SB623 cells as disclosed herein are also
    provided. Such compositions typically comprise the SB623 cells and a pharmaceutically
 20 acceptable carrier. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into
    SB623 cell compositions (see below).
            The therapeutic compositions disclosed herein are useful for, inter alia,
    stimulating angiogenesis after occurrence of a stroke or other ischemic injury in a subject.
    Accordingly, a "therapeutically effective amount" of a composition comprising SB623
25  cells can be any amount that stimulates angiogenesis. For example, dosage amounts can
    vary from about 100; 500; 1,000; 2,500; 5,000; 10, 000; 20,000; 50,000; 100,000;
    500,000; 1,000,000; 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 cells or more (or any integral value

    once per week, twice per month, once per month, depending upon, e.g., body weight,
30  route of administration, severity of disease, etc.

             Various pharmaceutical compositions and techniques for their preparation and use
    are known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. For a detailed
    listing of suitable pharmacological compositions and techniques for their administration
    one may refer to texts such as Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed. 1985;
  5 Brunton et al., "Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics,"
    McGraw-Hill, 2005; University of the Sciences in Philadelphia (eds.), "Remington: The
    Science and Practice of Pharmacy," Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005; and
    University of the Sciences in Philadelphia (eds.), "Remington: The Principles of
    Pharmacy Practice," Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2008.
 10          The cells described herein can be suspended in a physiologically compatible
    carrier for transplantation. As used herein, the term "physiologically compatible carrier"
    refers to a carrier that is compatible with the SB623 cells and with any other ingredients
    of the formulation, and is not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Those of skill in the art
    are familiar with physiologically compatible carriers. Examples of suitable carriers
 15 include cell culture medium (e.g., Eagle's minimal essential medium), phosphate
    buffered saline, Hank's balanced salt solution+/-glucose (HBSS), and multiple electrolyte
    solutions such as Plasma-Lyte       A (Baxter).
            The volume of a SB623 cell suspension administered to a patient will vary
    depending on the site of implantation, treatment goal and number of cells in solution.
 20 Typically the amount of cells administered to a patient will be a therapeutically effective
    amount. As used herein, a "therapeutically effective amount" or "effective amount"
    refers to the number of transplanted cells which are required to effect treatment of the
    particular disorder; i.e., to produce a reduction in the amount and/or severity of the
    symptoms associated with that disorder. For example, in the case of stroke,
25  transplantation of a therapeutically effective amount of SB623 cells results in new vessel
    growth, vessel sprouting and vessel branching, e.g., in an area that has been damaged by
    ischemia. Therapeutically effective amounts vary with the type and extent of ischemic
    damage, and can also vary depending on the overall condition of the subject.
            The disclosed therapeutic compositions can also include pharmaceutically
30  acceptable materials, compositions or vehicles, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent,
    excipient, solvent or encapsulating material, i.e., carriers. These carriers can, for

    example, stabilize the SB623 cells and/or facilitate the survival of the SB623 cells in the
    body. Each carrier should be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the
    other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the subject. Some examples of
    materials which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include: sugars, such
  5 as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose
    and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose
    acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients, such as cocoa butter and
    suppository waxes; oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive
    oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols, such as propylene glycol; polyols, such as glycerin,
 10 sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate;
    agar; buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic
    acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol; phosphate
    buffer solutions; and other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical
    formulations. Wetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate
 15 and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents,
    sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be
    present in the compositions.
             Exemplary formulations include, but are not limited to, those suitable for
    parenteral administration, e.g., intrapulmonary, intravenous, intra-arterial, intra-ocular,
 20 intra-cranial, sub-meningial, or subcutaneous administration, including formulations
    encapsulated in micelles, liposomes or drug-release capsules (active agents incorporated
    within a biocompatible coating designed for slow-release); ingestible formulations;
    formulations for topical use, such as eye drops, creams, ointments and gels; and other
    formulations such as inhalants, aerosols and sprays. The dosage of the compositions of
25  the disclosure will vary according to the extent and severity of the need for treatment, the
    activity of the administered composition, the general health of the subject, and other
    considerations well known to the skilled artisan.
            In additional embodiments, the compositions described herein are delivered
    locally to a site of ischemic damage. Localized delivery allows for the delivery of the
30  composition non-systemically, thereby reducing the body burden of the composition as
    compared to systemic delivery. Such local delivery can be achieved, for example, by
                                                  23

    intra-cranial injection, or through the use of various medically implanted devices
    including, but not limited to, stents and catheters, or can be achieved by inhalation,
    phlebotomy, or surgery. Methods for coating, implanting, embedding, and otherwise
    attaching desired agents to medical devices such as stents and catheters are established in
  5 the art and contemplated herein.
             Another aspect of the present disclosure relates to kits for carrying out the
    administration of SB623 cells, optionally in combination with another therapeutic agent,
    to a subject. In one embodiment, a kit comprises a composition of SB623 cells,
    formulated in a pharmaceutical carrier, optionally containing, e.g., a pro-angiogenic agent
 10 (see below), formulated as appropriate, in one or more separate pharmaceutical
    preparations.
             Combination Therapies
             In certain embodiments, SB623 cell compositions can be used in combination
 15 with other compositions comprising substances that stimulate angiogenesis ("pro
    angiogenic agents"), e.g., for treatment of stroke. The compositions can be administered
    sequentially in any order or concurrently. Accordingly, therapeutic compositions as
    disclosed herein can contain both SB623 cells and a pro-angiogenic agent. In additional
    embodiments, separate therapeutic compositions, one comprising SB623 cells and the
 20 other comprising a pro-angiogenic agent, can be administered to the subject, either
    separately or together.
             In certain embodiments, a pro-angiogenic agent is a protein (e.g., fibroblast
    growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha,
    hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, sonic hedgehog, MAGP-2,
25  HIF-1, PR-39, RTEF-1, c-Myc, TFII, Egr-1, ETS-1) or a nucleic acid encoding such a
    protein. See, for example, Vincent et al. (2007) Gene Therapy 14:781-789. In other
    embodiments, a pro-angiogenic agent can be a small RNA molecule (e.g., siRNA,
    shRNA, microRNA) or a ribozyme that targets a nucleic acid encoding an inhibitor of
    angiogenesis. In additional embodiments, a pro-angiogenic agent can be a triplex
30  forming nucleic acid that binds to DNA sequences regulating the expression of a protein
    that inhibits angiogenesis, such as to block transcription of the gene encoding the protein.
                                                  24

       WO 2013/112917                                                            PCT/US2013/023271
            In additional embodiments, a pro-angiogenic agent is a transcription factor that
    activates expression of a pro-angiogenic molecule (e.g., protein). Naturally-occurring
    transcription factors (such as, for example, HIF- 1alpha) that regulate the expression of
    pro-angiogenic proteins, are known. In addition, synthetic transcriptional regulatory
  5 proteins can be constructed by genetic engineering. For example, methods for the design
    of zinc finger DNA-binding domains that bind to a sequence of interest, and methods for
    the fusion of such zinc finger DNA-binding domains to transcriptional activation and
    repression domains, have been described. See, for example, U.S. Patents 6,534,261;
    6,607,882; 6,785,613; 6,794,136; 6,824,978; 6,933,113; 6,979,539; 7,013,219;
 [0 7,177,766; 7,220,719; and 7,788,044. These methods can be used to synthesize non
    naturally-occurring proteins that activate transcription of any gene encoding a pro
    angiogenic protein. In addition, synthetic zinc finger transcriptional activators of the
    vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene have been described. See, e.g., U.S.
    Patent Nos. 7,026,462; 7,067,317; 7,560,440; 7,605,140; and 8,071,564. Accordingly,
 [5 a non-naturally-occurring (i.e., synthetic) zinc finger protein that activates transcription
    of the VEGF gene can be used, in combination with SB623 cells, for augmenting
    angiogenesis, e.g., in the treatment of stroke.
            In additional embodiments, a natural or synthetic transcriptional regulatory
    protein (e.g., a synthetic zinc finger transcriptional regulatory protein) that inhibits
  0 transcription of an anti-angiogenic molecule can be used as a pro-angiogenic agent.
                                              EXAMPLES
            Example 1: Conditioned medium
            MSCs and SB623 cells were obtained and/or prepared as described. See, for
25  example, U.S. Patent No. 7,682,825 (March 23, 2010) and U.S. Patent Application
    Publications Nos. 2010/0266554 (Oct. 21, 2010), 2010/0310529 (Dec. 9, 2010),

    which are incorporated by reference in their entireties for the purposes of describing the
    preparation of SB623 cells (variously referred to as "neural precursor cells" and "neural
30  regenerating cells" in those documents). Cells were cultured in growth medium, which
    contained alpha-MEM (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
                                                   25

    serum (FBS, Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2mM L-glutamine and 1%penicillin/streptomycin
    (both from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). MSCs and SB623 cells typically expressed CD29,
    CD90 and CD105; and did not express CD31, CD34, or CD45, as determined by flow
    cytometry.
  5         For use in the experiments described herein, frozen MSCs and SB623 cells from
    the same human donor were thawed, re-plated in growth medium, and allowed to recover
    for approximately one week. To obtain conditioned medium, cells were grown to
    approximately 90% confluence (~15,000 cells/cm 2), the plates were rinsed once with
    phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the medium was then replaced with OptiMEM*
 10 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), maintaining the same cell density. Conditioned
    medium was collected 72 hours later. Frozen samples of conditioned medium were
    slowly warmed to 370C prior to use.
            Example 2: Effect of SB623 cell-secreted factors on HUVEC survival
 15         Cerebral ischemia can result in loss of nutrient supply to the affected area. To
    determine if soluble factors from SB623 cells and MSCs have restorative effects on
    nutrient-deprived endothelial cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
    were cultured in medium depleted of serum and growth factors for 24 hours, then
    exposed to conditioned medium (CM) from MSCs or SB623 cells. Control cultures
 20 remained in serum- and growth factor-depleted medium without addition of CM.
    Viability and proliferative capacity of the HUVECs were then assessed.
            For these experiments, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were passed twice,
    then 7.5 x 105 cells were plated in EBM-2/ECGS medium (Endothelial Basal Medium
    2/Endothelial Cell Growth Supplements; Lonza, Walkersville, MD) on T-75 flasks coated
25  with 0.1% gelatin and cultured for 24 hours. The HUVEC monolayers were rinsed twice
    with warm PBS and incubated with 12 ml of fresh EBM-2 medium overnight at 37'C,
    5% CO 2 . Effects of CM were then assessed by withdrawing 6 ml of medium from each
    flask, and replacing it with 6 ml fresh OptiMEM (control), 6 ml MSC conditioned
    medium, or 6 ml SB623 cell conditioned medium (conditioned media prepared as
30  described in Example 1). After 7 days, non-adherent and adherent cells were collected,
                                                 26

       WO 2013/112917                                                          PCT/US2013/023271
    centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 5 min, and divided into three fractions for subsequent
    staining analyses (PI, Bel-2 and Ki67).
            To quantify cell death, cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI), since dead
    cells are permeable to P. Cells were stained with 5 ug/ml PI for 30 min at room
  5 temperature, and flow cytometry acquisition and analysis were conducted using the FL-2
    logarithmic channel of a BD FACSCalibur CellQuest program (BD Biosciences, San
    Jose, CA). For this assay, 3 different human donor pairs were tested. The results are
    shown in Figure 1. In control HUVEC cultures maintained in nutrient-deprived medium
    for 7 days, more than 70% of the cells were positive for propidium iodide staining.
 10 Addition of either SB623- or MSC-conditioned medium significantly reduced the
    percentage of propidium iodide positive cells (p<0.05).
            These results indicate that both MSC conditioned medium and SB623 cell
    conditioned medium significantly reduced death of endothelial cells (i.e., reduced the
    number of propidium iodide-positive HUVECs) resulting from serum and growth factor
 15 starvation.
            Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein originally identified as being overexpressed in
    certain B-cell lymphomas. Accordingly, the fraction of cells expressing the Bcl-2 protein
    was measured in serum/growth factor-starved HUVECs as an indicator of their apoptotic
    potential. For Bcl-2 measurement, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
 20 permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 for one hour. Following permeabilization, cells
    were stained for one hour, on ice, with fluorescein-conjugated anti-Bcl-2 antibody, then
    samples were washed, acquired, and analyzed on the FL- 1 channel of a BD
    FACSCalibur. Cells exposed to fluorescein-conjugated IgG were used as a negative
    control. For these assays, 3 different human donor pairs were tested.
25          The results, shown in Figure 2, indicate that presence of either MSC conditioned

    positive cells in cultures of serum-starved endothelial cells.
            The fact that conditioned medium from MSCs or from SB623 cells decreased the
    number of dead (PI-positive) cells and increased of the number of cells expressing the
30  anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein shows that both MSCs and SB623 cells secrete factors that
    enhance endothelial cell survival.

             Example 3: Effect of SB623 cell-secreted factors on HUVEC proliferation
             Ki67 is a protein present in cells exiting from the GO (quiescent) phase of the cell
    cycle; therefore Ki67 levels can be used as a measure of cell proliferation. The fraction
  5 of cells expressing Ki67 protein was measured in HUVECs that had been starved for
     serum and growth factors, then cultured with conditioned medium from either MSCs or
     SB623 cells.
             For Ki67 measurement, HUVECs were cultured and exposed to CM as described
    in Example 2. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1%
 10 Triton-X1 00 for one hour. Following permeabilization, cells were stained for one hour
    on ice with fluorescein-conjugated anti-K167 antibody, then samples were washed,
    acquired, and analyzed on the FL- 1 channel of a BD FACSCalibur. Cells exposed to
    fluorescein-conjugated IgG were used as a negative control. For these assays, 3 different
    human donor pairs were tested.
 15          Figure 3 shows that culture of starved HUVECs in the presence of conditioned
    medium from either MSCs or SB623 cells resulted in an increased fraction of cells
    expressing Ki67, compared to control HUVECs not exposed to conditioned medium.
    The fact that conditioned medium from MSCs or from SB623 cells increased the number
    of cells expressing the proliferation-associated Ki67 protein shows that both MSCs and
 20 SB623 cells secrete factors that enhance endothelial cell proliferation.
             The results presented in this and the previous example revealed significant
    increases in survival and proliferation of HUVECs when these endothelial cells were
    cultured for 7 days with MSC- or SB623 cell-conditioned medium, compared to culture
    in unconditioned medium (p<0.05).

             Example 4: Effect of SB623 cell-secreted factors on tube formation by
    endothelial cells
             A HUVEC tube formation assay was used to test the ability of MSCs and SB623
    cells to elaborate factors that stimulate vessel formation. See, for example, EJ Smith &
30  CA Staton, "Tubule formation assays," in Angiogenesis Assays - A CriticalAppraisal of

     Sussex, UK, pp. 65-87, 2006; and Goodwin (2007) Microvasc. Res. 74:172-183.
             HUVECs were passed five times in EBM-2/ECGS medium, then transferred to
     alpha-MEM/0.5%FBS/2mM glutamine/pen-strep, at a density of 1 x 105 cells/mi. After
  5  24 hours, HUVECs were harvested using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, rinsed, and resuspended
     in c-MEM/2mM glutamine/pen-strep at a density of 1x10 5 cells/mi. A mixture of 75 ul
     of HUVECs plus 75 ul of either MSC- or SB623-conditioned medium (Example 1), or 75
     ul OptiMEM medium as a negative control, was added to each well of a 96-well plate
    that had been pre-treated by adding 50 ul of Reduced Growth Factor (RGF)-basement gel
 10  (Invitrogen, Carslsbad, CA) per well and incubating the plates at 37*C for 45 minutes.
     For this assay, MSCs were obtained from 3 different human donors, and a portion of the
     MSCs from each donor were converted to SB623 cells.
             After 16 hours, the cultures were examined by phase contrast microscopy and
    photographed. The number of complete tubes (formed by contiguous cells) was
 15  quantified by an experimenter blinded to the group. A photograph showing results from
     one of the three donors is shown in Figure 4. The results of assays using MSCs and
     SB623 cells from all three donors, summarized in Figure 5, indicate that tube formation is
    strongly enhanced by conditioned medium from either MSCs or SB623 cells. Thus,
    MSCs and SB623 cells secrete factors that promote vasculogenesis.

             Example 5: Effect of SB623 cell-secreted factors on vessel outgrowth and
    branching
             Restoration of vasculature after ischemic injury requires that surviving endothelial
    cells receive signals that prompt their migration and invasion. Such signals may arise
25  from vascular smooth muscle cells, monocytes, and/or macrophages, among others. To
    test for secretion of factors involved in vessel sprouting and branching, the aortic ring
    assay was used. See, for example, Nicosia & Ottinetti (1990) Lab. Invest. 63:115-122
    and Nicosia (2009) J Cell. Mo. Med. 13:4113-4136.
             For preparation of aortic rings, adult Sprague-Dawley rats were euthanized prior
30  to dissection. After clamping off its two ends, the aorta was removed and placed in ice
    cold a-MEM/pen-strep medium prior to removal of the external adipose layer. Adipose
                                                   29

       WO 2013/112917                                                         PCT/US2013/023271
    free aorta was rinsed twice with ice-cold EBM-2/pen-strep medium before being
    sectioned into rings of 1.0 mm thickness. The aortic rings were then transferred to plates
    containing EBM-2/pen-strep medium and incubated at 37'C, 5% CO 2 for 6 days, with the
    medium replaced with fresh EBM-2/pen-strep medium on day 3, to deplete any
  5 endogenous rat angiogenic factors. At that point, the medium was replaced with alpha
    MEM/pen-strep medium and culture was continued for 24 hours.
             On day 0 of the aortic ring assay (seven days after beginning of culture), 50 pl of
    reduced growth factor (RGF) basement gel was deposited per well of a 24-well plate. An
    individual aortic ring was placed in the middle of each gel-coated well and overlaid with
 10 an additional 25 pl of RGF-basement gel. After allowing 30 minutes at 370 C/5%CO 2 for
    solidification of the gel, 500 pl of c-MEM/2mM glutamine/pen-strep was added to each
    well and incubation was continued for an additional 30 minutes. Then, 500 ul of either
    MSC- or SB623-derived conditioned medium (Example 1) was added. As a negative
    control, 500 pl of OptiMEM medium was used in place of conditioned medium.
 15          To assess the angiogenic activity of MSC- and SB623-derived factors, phase
    contrast photographs were taken on Day 10, and results were quantified by an
    experimenter blinded to the group, by counting vessel outgrowth and branching. Growth
    of new vessels was quantitated by measuring the number of vessels growing out from the
    ring; and vessel branching was quantitated by measuring the number of branchpoints
 20 present in vessels growing out from the aortic ring. For this assay, 7 different human
    donor pairs were tested.
             Representative results from Day 10 samples are shown in Figure 6, and results
    from seven sets of 10-day cultures are summarized and quantitated in Figure 7. Figure
    7A shows that conditioned medium from both MSCs and SB623 cells stimulated an
25  increase in the number of newly-sprouted vessels and in the degree of branching,
    compared to control aortic rings. Moreover, significant increases in vessel branching
    were observed in rings cultured in SB623 cell-conditioned medium (Figure 6C, Figure
    7A), compared with either rings cultured in MSC-conditioned medium (Figure 6B,
    Figure 7A) or rings cultured in unconditioned medium (Figure 6A, Figure 7A). These
30  results indicate that MSCs and SB623 cells secrete factors that enhance vessel sprouting

    and vessel branching. In particular, SB623 cells secrete factors that greatly enhance
    vessel branching (see Figure 7B).
            The data presented in the foregoing examples indicate that SB623 cell-secreted
    soluble factors promote several aspects of angiogenesis, which contribute to recovery in
  5 the injured brain.
            Example 6: Statistics
            For each experiment (which included 3-4 wells/group), a mean value was
    obtained for: (1) the treatment condition for each cell type (either MSC- or SB623 cell
 10 derived conditioned medium; one value per human donor tested) and (2) the untreated
    group (one value for each round of testing). For statistical comparison (SigmaStat,
    SystatSoftware, Chicago, IL) each of these values were used and comparisons were made
    using one way ANOVA between the following groups (1) Control (unconditioned
    medium; n=3), (2) MSC-conditioned medium (n=3-5); and (3) SB623 cell-conditioned
 [5 medium (n=3-5). Additional pair-wise comparisons were made using Tukey's test. An
    alpha value of 0.05 was used to determine whether the means were significantly different.
            Example 7: Identification of Angiogenic Factors Secreted by MSCs and
    SB623 Cells
 z0         The levels of certain cytokines and trophic factors in conditioned medium from
    MSCs and SB623 cells were measured. To obtain conditioned medium, MSCs or SB623
    cells were cultured in growth medium to -90% confluence (-15,000 cells/cm 2 ), at which
    point medium was removed, the cells were rinsed in PBS, and Opti-MEM* medium
    (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to give a concentration of ~150,000 cells/ml. The
25  conditioned medium was collected 72 hours later and assayed using a Quantibody*
    Human Angiogenesis Array 1 (RayBiotech, Norcross, GA) according to the
    manufacturer's instructions. For each source of MSCs, a portion of the cells were
    cultured directly as MSCs and a portion were converted to SB623 cells. Thus, a culture
    of MSCs from a particular donor and a culture of SB623 cells made from those MSCs,
30  are referred to as a matched "donor pair." In this experiment, four donor pairs were
    assayed. Results, expressed as protein concentration, were normalized to the number of
                                                 31

    cells present in the culture when the conditioned medium was collected. Figure 8 shows
    results, by donor, for angiogenin, ANG-2, HB-EGF and PIGF. Figure 9 shows results for
    these four factors, and six others, also by donor, and highlights the large amounts of
    VEGF produced by MSCs and SB623 cells.
  5           Table 1 shows protein levels averaged among the four donor pairs for the ten
    factors tested. Although levels of trophic factors secreted were variable among the
    different donors (as shown, for example, in Figures 8 and 9), levels of four of the factors
    (angiogenin, angiopoietin-2, HB-EGF and PIGF) were consistently different between
    MSCs and SB623 cells. Angiogenin, ANG-2 and HB-EGF were more highly expressed
 10 by SB623 cells, while higher concentrations of PIGF were produced by MSCs.

            Example 8: Effect of an inhibitor of VEGF signaling on HUVEC viability
    and proliferation
            In light of the large amounts of VEGF secreted by both MSCs and SB623 cells,
    the contribution of VEGF to the pro-angiogenic activities of MSC- and SB623
  5 conditioned media was tested using an inhibitor of VEGF signaling. SU5416 (VEGFR2
    kinase inhibitor III, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) blocks downstream signaling by
    VEGF receptor 2 (Flk-1) and, to a lesser extent, by VEGF receptor 1 (Flt-1) and other
    receptor tyrosine kinases, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis.
            HUVEC viability assays (propidium iodide uptake and Bcl-2 expression) were
 10 conducted as described in Example 2 on two batches of SB623 cell-conditioned medium,
    in the presence and absence of 50 nM SU5416; except that cells were cultured for five
    days, instead of seven, before assay. The inhibitor was added to cultures 30 minutes
    before addition of CM. Since higher concentrations of SU5416 can inhibit receptor
    tyrosine kinases other than VEGFR2, this SU5416 concentration was chosen so that
 [5 VEGFR2 signaling (but not signaling by , e.g., PDGF receptor, EGF receptors, or Flt3)
    was inhibited. The results, shown in Figures 1OA and 1OB, indicate that more cells take
    up PI (Figure 10A) and fewer cells express the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein (Figure 10B)
    when HUVECs are cultured in SB623 conditioned medium and SU5416, than when they
    are cultured in SB623 cell-conditioned medium alone. Thus, inhibition of VEGF
  0 receptor activity partially reduces the positive effect of SB623 cell-conditioned medium
    on viability of HUVECs, pointing to a role of the VEGF protein in these effects.
            The effect of the VEGF receptor inhibitor on stimulation of HUVEC proliferation
    by SB623 cell factors was also assessed. Assays for expression of Ki67 were conducted
    as described in Example 3, except that 50 nM SU5416 was added to cultures 30 minutes
25  before addition of conditioned medium, and cells were cultured for five days, instead of
    seven, before assay. The results, shown in Figure 11 and averaged from two donors,
    indicate that the enhancement of HUVEC proliferation observed in the presence of
    conditioned medium from SB623 cells was partially reversed by inhibition of VEGFR2.
            These results point to a role for VEGF, in addition to other SB623 cell-derived
30  factors, in the pro-survival and pro-proliferative activity of MSC and SB623 cell
    conditioned media.

            Example 9: Effect of an Inhibitor of VEGF Signaling on Tube Formation by
    Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs)
            HUVEC tube formation assays with conditioned medium from MSCs and SB623
  5 cells were conducted as described in Example 4, in the presence and absence of the
    VEGF2 receptor inhibitor SU5416. Cells cultured in the absence of conditioned medium
    were used as negative controls; and cells cultured in the presence of VEGF (10 ng/ml
    were used as positive controls. The results, shown in Figure 12, indicate that VEGF,
    MSC-conditioned medium and SB623 cell-conditioned medium all promote tube
 [0 formation; while the VEGFR2 inhibitor SU5416 reduces the stimulation of tube
    formation by all of these agents.
            Quantitation of tube formation was conducted, as described in Example 4, for
    HUVECs exposed to SB623 cell conditioned medium in the presence and absence of
    SU5416, at 16 and 40 hours after plating. The results, shown in Figure 13, indicate that,
  5 at both time points, inhibition of VEGFR2 completely reversed the positive effect of CM
    on tube formation.
            Example 10: Effect of an Inhibitor of VEGF Signaling on Vessel Outgrowth
    and Branching in an Aortic Ring Assay
 !0         Aortic ring angiogenesis assays were conducted as described in Example 5 on one
    batch of SB623 cell-conditioned medium, in the presence and absence of 50 nM SU5416.
    The inhibitor was added to cultures 30 minutes before addition of CM and rings were
    assayed after 10 days of culture. The results indicate that the vessel outgrowth and
    branching resulting from culture of aortic rings in SB623 cell-conditioned medium
25  (Figure 14, compare left and center panels) was reduced in the presence of the VEGF
    receptor inhibitor SU5416 (Figure 14, compare center and right panels). These results
    provide further evidence for the role of VEGF in the pro-angiogenic activities of SB623
    cell-conditioned medium.
