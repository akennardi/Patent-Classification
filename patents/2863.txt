                                    ABSTRACT
       A ramp system has a plurality of modular components adapted to be
interconnected in a desired configuration. The modular components include an
entry ramp module (io, 8o), an exit ramp module (So) and a landing module
(1oo, i8o) therebetween. Each modular component has a floorassembly (12),
handrail assemblies (14, 16) and leg assemblies (18). Each of the handrail
assemblies have posts (22, 24) which are adapted to support a handrail (26). The
posts are collapsible by folding inwardly towards a deck (28) of the floor
assembly through operation of a folding means (30) interconnecting the floor
assembly and each post of the handrail assembly. The posts of the handrail
assemblies are reversibly collapsible from an erect position, where the ramp
system can be used and the handrail assemblies can support users of the ramp
system, to a compact position where the ramp system can be stored, packaged
and transported until required for assembly on site.

                          MODULAR AND COLLAPSIBLE RAMP SYSTEM
            FIELD OF THE INVENTION
                    The present invention relates to a ramp system that can be
    5       assembled from modular components that are collapsible for storage,
            packaging and transportation purposes until required for assembly on
            site.
                   In this specification and claims, the term "ramp system" is
           intended to include in its meaning structural arrangements that include
  10       ramps, such as platforms or walkways with landings for which a ramp
           provides entry or exit.
                   The present invention also relates to a method of assembling a
          ramp system by interconnecting modular components, such as an entry
          ramp module, an exit ramp module and one or more landing module
  15      therebetween in a desired configuration, such as a straight through
          configuration, a left or right turn configuration, or a switchback
          configuration.
                  The present invention also relates to modular components for
         such a ramp system in which the modules include handrail assemblies
 20      that have posts which are adapted to support a handrail, the posts being
         reversibly collapsible by folding inwardly from an erect position towards
        a floor assembly-of the module to assume a compact position.
                  The present invention still further relates to such ramp systems
      - which are for reusable, temporary or permanent applications as
25      required.

                                               2
           BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
                  United States Patent No. 5,740,575 discloses a ramp kit
          comprising modular components that can be assembled to form ramp
          systems. The ramp kit includes a stand having support rails which
    5     extend between corresponding support posts, the rails being height
         adjustable to support an inclined ramp surface at a particular position
         along its length. However, the ramp system disclosed in this US patent
         has a number of significant limitations. Firstly, the support stand is
         relatively bulky, making it difficult to transport the components which are
   10    required to form a ramp system. Secondly, the range of height
        adjustment is quite limited and thirdly, height adjustment of each stand is
        reasonably time consuming as it involves alignment of holes formed in
        each end of two support rails with holes of support posts for subsequent
        insertion of two locating bolts.
  15            Australian Pateht Nos. 577,569 and 589,013 disclose modular
        component ramp kits having threaded support posts which are height
       adjustable to support an Inclined ramp surface at a particular position
       along its length. Height adjustment is provided by threadable movement
       of a support nut along the length of the threaded support post. However,
 20    the ramp systems disclosed in these Australian patents appear to be
      quite cumbersome and costly to manufacture. Furthermore, their
      stability may be less than desirable in certain applications.
      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
25             According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is
      provided a ramp system comprising a plurality of modular components
      adapted to be interconnected in a desired configuration, the modular

                                              3
          components comprising at least one of an entry ramp module, an exit
          ramp module and a landing module therebetween, each modular
          component comprising a floor assembly, handrail assemblies and leg
          assemblies, each of the handrail assemblies comprising posts which are
    5    adapted to support a handrail, the posts being collapsible by folding
         inwardly towards a deck of the floor assembly through operation of a
         folding means interconnecting the floor assembly and each post of the
         handrail assembly, the posts of the handrail assemblies being reversibly
         collapsible from an erect position, where the ramp system can be used
  10     and the handrail assemblies can support users of the ramp system, to a
        compact position, where the ramp system can be stored, packaged and
        transported until required for assembly on site.
                 Preferably, the folding means comprises a bracket and a fixed
        pivot pin, the bracket having a first end which receives the pivot pin so
  15    as to be pivotally mounted thereabout, and having a second end which
        is connected to a lower portion of a post of the handrail assembly, the
        pivot pin being mounted to the floor assembly.
                In a preferred form, the folding means further comprises a
       retaining clip having a planar first end secured to the bracket at a
 20    location above the pivot pin, and having a curved second end engaging
       around a part circumferential portion of the pivot pin and maintaining
      said engagement as the handrail assembly pivots between the erect
      position and the compact position, the curved second end of the
      retaining clip sliding over the part circumferential portion of the pivot pin
25    during such pivoting.
               It is preferred that the fixed pivot pin is mounted to the outside of
      an upright kick plate portion of the floor assembly;

                                             4
                  Preferably, the bracket comprises a main plate and a pair of side
         plates integrally connected to respective opposed sides of the main
         plate, the first end of the bracket comprising a pair of openings in the
         respective bottom ends of the pair of side plates and through which pair
   5    of openings the fixed pivot pin is received.
                 In a further preferred form, the kick plate portion of the floor
        assembly has a cut-out region comprising a first side edge and a second
        side edge facing the first side edge, the fixed pivot pin having a first end
        mounted to the first side edge of the cut-out.region and having a second
  10    end mounted to the second side edge of the cut-out region, the bracket
       passing pivotally through the cut-out region as the post of the handrail
       assembly pivots between the erect position and the compact position.
                Preferably, the bracket is located substantially on the outside of
       the kick plate portion when the post of the handrail assembly is in the
 15    erect position, and is located substantially on the inside of the kick plate
      portion when the post of the handrail assembly Is in the compact
      position.

         BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION
                Figures 1 to 11 depict a first ramp module 10 of a preferred ramp
        system of the invention. The ramp module 10 is a modular component
        of a ramp system that includes other modular components which are
   5    interconnected in a desired configuration. The ramp module 10 may
        serve as either an entry ramp module or an exit ramp module, or may
       serve as both of these, in a ramp system of a desired configuration.
               The ramp module 10 includes a floor assembly 12, a pair of
       opposed side handrail assemblies 14, 16 which are collapsible, and a
 10    pair of leg assemblies 18.
               Each handrail assembly 14, 16 includes a pair of posts 22, 24
       which support a respective handrail 26, and can be collapsed, only after
       an inner post 40 of the respective leg assembly 18 has been removed
      from within the respective post 22 so that each handrail assembly 14, 16
 15   is in a ready to compact condition, by folding the posts of the handrail
      assembly inwardly towards a deck 28 of the floor assembly 12 through
      operation of a folding means 30 which interconnects an upright kick
      plate portion 32 of the floor assembly 12 and a post 22, 24 of the
      handrail assembly 14, 16. There are two kick plate portions 32
20   extending upwardly from respective opposite sides of the deck 28.
              Each handrail assembly 14, 16 is reversibly collapsible from an
     erect position, such as is shown in Figures 1 to 7, where the inner post
     40 of each leg assembly 18 is within the respective post 22, and the
     ramp module 10 can be used as a component of a ramp system and the
25   handrail assemblies can support users of the ramp system, to a compact
     position, such as is shown in Figures 8 to 11; where the inner post 40 of
     each leg assembly 18 has been removed from within the respective post

                                            10
           22, and the ramp module 10, along with the other reversibly collapsed
           components of the ramp system, can be stored, packaged and
          transported until required for assembly on site.
                 The floor assembly 12 has angled load support members 34
    5     beneath the deck 28, and has a cross-beam 35 supporting the elevated
          rear end of the deck 28. The deck 28 is inclined upwardly to a desired
          degree from a front end to the rear end of the ramp module 10 (see, for
          example, Figure 3). The front end of the ramp module 10 may be
          supported directly upon the ground, but the rear end is supported upon
   10    the ground via the pair of opposing leg assemblies 18 which engage with
         respective post sockets 36 of the floor assembly. Each leg assembly 18
         (as shown in Figure 37) has a foot 38 which is supported directly upon
        the ground and has an inner post 40 which passes through the post
        socket 36 from beneath. The inner post 40 has leg length adjustment
  15    holes 41, a selected one of which can be superimposed over a selected
        one of similarly sized holes 43 through a post socket 36, and a bolt,
        locking pin or other fastening device may be inserted and retained
       through the superimposed holes to maintain the desired vertical length
       from.the foot 38 to the post socket 36. The corresponding post 22 of the
 20    handrail assembly then passes over the inner post 40 from above and its
       leading end is held in position by abutting the post socket 36.
                The folding means 30, shown in more detail in Figures 5 to 7and
      34-when the handrail assembly is in the erect position, and in Figure 35
      when the handrail assembly is in the compact position, has a bracket 42
25    and a fixed pivot pin 44. The bracket 42 has a lower first end 46 which
      receives the pivot pin 44. The bracket 42 is pivotally mounted about the
      pivot pin 44. The pivot pin 44 is mounted to the outside of kick plate

                                             11
          portion 32 of the floor assembly. The bracket 42 has an upper second
          end 48 which is connected to a lower portion of a respective post 22, 24
          of the handrail assembly. As best shown in Figure 36, the bracket 42
          has a main plate 50 and a pair of side plates 52, 54 integrally connected
    5     to respective opposed sides of the main plate. The first end 46 of the
          bracket 42 has a pair of openings 56, 58 in the respective bottom ends
          of the pair of side plates 52, 54. The fixed pivot pin 44 is received
         through these openings 56, 58.
                 Both of the kick plate portions 32 of the floor assembly 12 have
  10     cut-out regions 60, 62 (cut-out region 62 is best shown in Figures 34 and
         35). The fixed pivot pin 44 has a first end mounted to a first side edge of
         the cut-out region 60, 62 and has a second end mounted to a second
        side edge of the cut-out region 60, 62. In operation of the folding means
        30, the bracket 42 passes pivotally through its respective cut-out region
  15    60, 62 as the handrail assembly 14, 16 pivots between the erect position
        and the compact position.
                The bracket 42 is located substantially on the outside of the kick
        plate portion 32 when the handrail assembly 14, 16 is in the erect
        position, and is located substantially on the inside of the kick plate
 20    portion 32 when the handrail assembly 14, 16 is in the compact position.
       This is particularly advantageous as the bracket 42 will not obstruct any
       part of the deck 28 of the floor assembly 12 when the handrail assembly
       is in the erect position and the ramp system 10 can be used, and the
       bracket 42 will not protrude on the outside of the kick plate portion 32 of
25    the floor assembly 12 when the handrail assembly 14, 16 is in the
      compact position and the ramp system 10 can be stored, packaged and
      transported without the bracket 42 taking up more space.

                                               12
                     The folding means 30 also has a retaining clip 64 for retaining the
           bracket 42, and thus retaining its connected post of a handrail assembly,
           in all its positions (including the erect and compact positions and all
           positions therebetween) relative to the floor assembly 12. The retaining
     5     clip 64 (which is best shown in Figures 34 and 35) may be made of any
          resilient material, and has a planar first end 66 which is secured to the
          bracket 42 at a location above the pivot pin 44 (when viewed with the
          handrail assembly in the erect position) and has a curved second end 68
          which is engaged around a part circumferential portion of the pivot pin
   10     44. The curved second end 68 of the retaining clip 64 maintains its
          engagement with the pivot pin 44 by sliding over the part circumferential
         portion of the pin 44 as the handrail assembly pivots between the erect
         position and the compact position. The retaining clip 64 is configured, if
         required, to release the bracket 42, and thus release the post of the
  15     handrail assembly, from its retained position to the fixed pivot pin 44.
                  Figures 12 to 22 and 33 depict a second ramp module 80 of a
         preferred ramp system of the invention. The purpose and function of the
        ramp module 80 may be the same as that of the ramp module 10. Apart
        from the length of the ramp modules 10 and 80 (module 10 is 0.9 metres
 20     long and module 80 is I .8'metres long), there is very little other
       structural difference between the modules 10 and 80. Therefore, like
       features between the ramp modules 10 and 80 are identified in ramp
       module 80 with like numerals. The earlier description of the structure
       and function of those like features in ramp module 10 also applies herein
25     as a description of the structure and function of those features in ramp
       module 80.

                                             13
                  It is noted, however, that the desired vertical length from each
          foot 38 to the post socket 36 is larger in the ramp module 80 as shown in
          Figure 13 than it is in the ramp module 10 as shown in Figure 2. This
          increased height at the rear end of the deck 28 of the ramp module 80
    5     may be selected so that the module 80 can be used as the only entry
         and/or exit ramp module in the desired configuration of ramp system,
         such as when a landing module for which the ramp module 80 provides
         entry or exit, needs to be high off the ground and the deck 28 needs to
         be inclined at a steeper angle than that of the deck 28 in ramp module
  10     10. The module 80 can alternatively be used as a second entry ramp
         module connected at its front end to the rear end oft say, ramp module
         10 in circumstances where the deck 28 does not need to be inclined at
        the steeper angle. Examples of some of these configurations are shown
        in Figures 42 to 44.
 15             Figures 23 to 32 depict a landing module 100 of a preferred ramp
       system of the invention. The landing module 100 is a modular
       component of a ramp system that includes other modular components,
       such as ramp modules 10 and 80, which are interconnected in a desired
       configuration.
20             The.landing module 1O0 includes a floor assembly 102, a pair of
       adjoining corner handrail assemblies 104, 106, a free standing comer
      post 107, and four leg assemblies 18 which are similar in structure and
      function to the leg assemblies 18 in ramp modules 10, 80.
               Each handrail assembly 104, 106 includes a pair of posts 116,
25    118 and 118, 120, respectively, which support a respective handrail 122.
      Each handrail assembly 104, 106 and the corner post 107 can be
      collapsed, only after the handrails 122 have been removed and an inner

                                           14
          post 40 of the respective leg assembly 18 has been removed from within
          the respective post 107. 116, 118, 120 so that each post 116, 118,120
          of the handrail assembly 104, 106 and the corner post 107 is in a ready
         to compact condition, by folding the posts 107, 116, 118, 120 inwardly
   5     towards a deck 124 of the floor assembly 102 through operation of a
         folding means 126 which interconnects a post socket 128 at each corner
         of the floor assembly 102 and a post 107, 116, 118, 120.
                 Each post 107, 116, 118, 120 is reversibly collapsible from an
        erect position, such as is shown in Figures 23 to 28, where the inner
  10    post 40 of each leg assembly 18 is Within the respective post 107, 116,
        118, 120, and the landing module 100 can be used as a component of a
        ramp system and the handrail assemblies can support users of the ramp
       system, to a compact position, such as is shown in Figures 29 to 32,
       where the inner post 40 of each leg assembly 18 has been removed
 15    from within the respective post 107, 116, 118, 120, and the landing
       module 100, along with the other reversibly collapsed components of the
      ramp system, can be stored, packaged and transported until required for
      assembly on site.
                The floor assembly 102 has kerb rails 130 extending along the
20    edges of the deck 124 beneath.the handrails 122, and has cross-beams
      132 supporting all four side edges of the deck 124. The deck 124 is
      horizontal and all four corners are supported upon the ground via the leg
     assemblies 18 which engage with respective post sockets 128 of the
     floor assembly 102.
25             The folding means 126, shown in more detail in Figure 28 when
     the post 118 is in the erect position and in Figure 30 when the post 120
     is in the compact position, has a bracket 134 and a fixed pivot pin 136.

                                            15
                  The bracket 134 has a lower first end which is mounted to the
           post socket 128 and has an upper second end which engages the pivot
           pin 136. The pivot pin 136 is mounted to a bottom side surface of the
           post 120 and has opposed first and second ends that protrude from
     5     opposite edges of the bottom side surface of the post 120. The upper
           second end of the bracket 134 has one or more holes through which are
          engaged the protruding first and second ends of the pivot pin 136.
                 The bracket 134 is mounted to each of the four post sockets 128
          in such a way that, in operation of the folding means 126, the posts 107.
 -10      116, 118, 120 pivot between the erect position and the compact position
         through a vertical plane and, when in the compact position, lay
         horizontally above the deck -124 (as best shown in Figure 31). As shown
         in Figures 29 and 32, the posts, when in the compact position, are all
         arranged in a clockwise direction (when viewed from above the landing
  15     module 100), although they may alternatively be all arranged in an
        anticlockwise direction if the brackets are mounted to each post socket
        in a different way. This ensures that the height of the landing module in
        the compact position is as low as possible, as there is no overlapping of
        the posts.
 20             Referring to Figure 27, the two adjacent corner handrails 122 of
       the landing module 100 are interconnected to each other and to the post
        118, A comer connector piece 140 has opposed male ends which
       engage firmly within respective female ends of the adjacent corner
       handrails 122. Extending downwardly from each end of a handrail 122
25     is a spacing elbow panel 142, which terminates in an L-shaped bracket
       144. The L-shaped brackets 144 are so configured that, for post 118, an
       L-shaped bracket 144 from a first handrail 122 can engage a first pair of

                                          16
        adjoining corner surfaces of the post 118, and an L-shaped bracket 144
        from a second handrail 122, which is adjacent to and defines a comer
        with the first handrail 122, can engage a second pair of adjoining corner
        surfaces of the post (which are not already engaged by the L-shaped
   5    bracket 144 from the first handrail 122).
               Referring to Figure 38, a handrail 122 of the landing module 100
       has opposed female ends 146, 148, from each of which extends
       downwardly a spacing elbow panel 142 which terminates in an L-shaped
       bracket 144. Each L-shaped bracket 144 of handrail 122 is so
  10   configured to engage a respective post in the manner described above
       with reference to the L-shaped brackets 144 of the two adjacent corner
       handrails 122 which engage the post 118.
               Figure 39 depicts an entry handrail 150 that may be used on a
      ramp module, such as ramp modules shown in Figures 1, 12 and 33.
 15   The entry handrail 150 has an upper male end 152 which may engage
      firmly within a female end of a handrail 26, a curved rail portion 154, and
      a lower plate 156 for engaging, such as with bolts, a surface of a post 24
      of the ramp module. The male end 152 may be telescopically extendable
      within a straight upper region 158 of the curved rail portion 154.
20            Figure 40 depicts a first handrail connector 160 for connecting
     handrails extending at right angles to each other. Handrails
     interconnected by the connector 160 define a corner of the ramp system
     between a ramp module and a landing module. The handrail connector
     160 has a male end 162 which is formed at a slight angle of inclination to
25   a straight arm 164 of a curved connector portion 166. The male end 162
     may engage firmly within a female end of a handrail 26 of a ramp
     module. At the other end is a downwardly extending spacing elbow

                                           17
        panel 142 which terminates in an L-shaped bracket 144 for engaging a
        post.
                Figure 41 depicts a second handrail connector 170 for connecting
        handrails that are aligned to each other, but inclined relative to each
   5    other. Handrails interconnected by the connector 170 define a continuity
       of the ramp system between a ramp module and a landing module. The
       handrail connector 170 has a first male end 172 which is formed at a
       slight angle of inclination to a straight sleeve 174. The first male end 172
       may engage firmly within a female end of a handrail 26 of a ramp
 10    module. At the, other end is a straight male end 176, which may be
       directly connected through the sleeve 174 to the first male end 172, for
       engaging firmly within a female end of an aligned and adjoining handrail
      of a landing module. The straight male end 176 may be telescopically
      extendable within the straight sleeve 174.
 15           The straight through configuration of the ramp system shown, by
      way of example, in Figure 42 utilizes the ramp module 10 (as shown in
      Figures 1 to 11) at the entry end of the ramp system, the ramp module
      80 (as shown in Figures 12 to 22 and 33) connected to the exit end of
      the ramp module 10, and a landing module 180 (similar to landing
20    module 100 as shown in Figures 23 to 32 but with handrails rearranged).
      Connected to the ramp module 10 is a pair of entry handrails 150. The
     handrails of ramp modules 10, 80 are interconnected by a third handrail
     connector 182 which is a straight bar that engages firtnly within both of
     the facing female ends of the aligned and adjoining handrails of the
25   ramp modules. The ramp system shown in Figure 42 also utilizes a
     "corner defining" first handrail connector 160 and a "continuity defining"

                                           18
        second handrail connector 170. The decks of the ramp module 80 and
        the landing module 180 are interconnected by a transition plate 184.
                The corner configuration of the ramp system shown, by way of
        example, in Figure 43 utilizes a ramp module 190 (similar to ramp
   5   module 10 but with foot plate or leg assemblies 192 at the entry end of
       the module) at the entry end of the ramp system, the ramp module 80
       connected to the exit end of the ramp module 190, and the landing
       module 100. In most other respects, the ramp system shown in Figure
      43 is similar to the ramp system shown in Figure 42, and so like features
 10   are identified with like numerals.
               The switchback configuration of the ramp system shown, by way
      of example, in Figure 44 utilizes the ramp module 10 (as the entry ramp
      module), a pair of ramp modules 80 (one of which is the exit ramp
      module), and a pair of landing modules 100. It will be apparent from this
 15   configuration and those shown in Figures 42 and 43, that the
      configuration of modules can be varied in many different ways to suit the
     application or needs of the user.
              It will also be readily apparent to persons skilled in the art that
     various modifications may be made in details of design and construction
20   of the ramp system as described above without departing from the
     scope or ambit of the invention.
