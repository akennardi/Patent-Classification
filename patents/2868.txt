INHIBITORS OF HISTONE DEMETHYLASES
This is a divisional of Australian patent application No. 2013326554, the entire
contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to compounds capable of modulating the activity of
histone demethylases (HDMEs), which compounds are useful for the prevention and/or
the treatment of diseases in which genomic dysregulation is involved in the
pathogenesis, such as e.g. cancer.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The DNA of eukaryotic cells is packaged into chromatin by winding of the DNA around
histone proteins to form nucleosomes, the basic unit of chromatin. One of the
important functions of chromatin is to determine regions of active and silenced
transcription by changing the ordered chromatin structure. Such changes have
profound effects on cellular function since they affect fundamental processes as
differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, and are often referred collectively to as
"epigenetic" since they can lead to heritable changes that do not involve changes in
gene sequences (Quina, A.S. et al. (2006), Biochem. Pharmacol. 72; 1563-1569).
These highly controlled chromatin changes are mediated by alterations of histone
proteins associated with DNA in the nucleosome. Most notably, the N-terminal histone
tail of Histone H3 and histone H4 are subject to such covalent changes, which include
changes in methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination. The addition
or removal of these groups on histones is mediated by specific enzymes, e.g. histone
methyl transferases and histone demethylases for methyl groups, histone
acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases for acetyl groups, etc. In the event that
they activity or expression of these "epigenetic" enzymes is not correctly controlled
and regulated it may lead to disease. Cancer, in particular, is an area of high
importance in relation to dysregulated epigenetic enzyme activity due to the role of
epigenetics in cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, but epigenetics may also
play a role in other diseases like metabolic, inflammatory, neurodegenerative and
cardiovascular diseases. Therefore the selective modulation of aberrant action of
epigenetic enzymes may hold great promise for the treatment of human disease
(Kelly, T.K. et al. (2010), Nat. Biotechnol. 28; 1069-1078, and Cloos, P.a.C. et al.
(2008), Genes. Dev. 22; 115-1140).

                                                            1A
Methylation and demethylation of lysine residues on the histone H3 tail constitute
important epigenetic marks delineating transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin.
For example, methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9) is usually associated with
epigenetically silenced chromatin (Fischle, W. et. al. (2003), Curr. Opinion Cell Biol.
 15, 172-83; Margueron, R., et al. (2005), Curr. Opinion Genet. Dev. 15, 163-76) while
methylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 is associated with transcriptionally active
chromatin. Similarly, the lysine 27 histone H3 (H3K27) mark is found in association
with gene activation (Barski, A. et al. (2007), Cell, 129, 823-37; Vakoc, C. et al.
(2006) Mol. Cell. Biol. 26, 9185-95; Wagner, E.J. & Carpenter, P.B. (2012) Nature
Mol. Cell

        WO 2014/053491                                                           PCT/EP2013/070457
                                                     2
    Biol 13, 115-26). There are, however, many exemptions from these general rules of association
    between methylation states of epigenetic marks and the effect they have on transcription.
    As documented by studies of the SUV39H1 knockout mouse, loss of the tri-methyl variant of the
    H3K9 mark results in chromosomal aberrations and predisposes to cancer (Peters, A.H. et al.,
  5 Cell 107, 323-37, 2001). The JMJD2C protein (KDM4C, GASC1) has been identified as an eraser
    of the H3K9 mark (a histone demethylase) and may therefore promote cancer if its expression
    and activity is not tightly controlled (Cloos, P. et al. (2006), Nature 442, 307-11; Klose, R.J. et
    al. (2006), Nature 442, 312-16; Liu, G. et al. (2009), Oncogene 28, 4491-500). For example,
    JMJD2C has been shown to induce transformed phenotypes like growth factor independent
 .0 growth, anchorage independent growth and mammosphere formation, if it is overexpressed in
    cells (Liu, G. et al. (2009), Oncogene 28, 4491-500). These findings are supported by the
    overexpression of JMJD2C in a range of human tumours like squamous cell carcinoma,
    metastatic lung carcinoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer and several others (Yang, Z.Q. et al.
    (2000) Cancer Res. 60, 4735-39; Yang, Z.Q. et al. (2001) Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 92, 423-28; Hu,
 .5 N. et al. (2005) Cancer Res. 65, 2542-46; Liu, G. et al. (2009) Oncogene 28, 4491-500;
    Wissmann, M. et al. (2007) Nat. Cell Biol. 9, 347-53), indicating the potential importance of
    JMJD2C as an oncogene.
    The JMJD2A protein (KDM4A, JHDM3A) shows similar properties to JMJD2C. JMJD2A shows high
    sequence identity to JMJD2C in its JmjC catalytic domain, is an eraser of the H3K9 mark and has
  0 also been shown to be overexpressed in prostate cancer (Cloos, P. Et al., Nature 442, 307-11,
    2006). JMJD2A has been shown to interact with the estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) and
    overexpression of JMJD2A enhances estrogen-dependent transcription and the down-regulation
    of JMJD2A reduced transcription of a seminal ER-alpha target gene, cyclin D1 (Kawazu et al.,
    (2011) PLoS One 6; Berry et al., (2012) Int J Oncol 41). Additionally, it has been shown that
 .5 catalytically inactive JMJD2A is compromised in its ability to stimulate ER-alpha mediated
    transcription, suggesting that inhibitors of JMJD2A may be beneficial for the treatment of ER
    alpha positive breast tumours (Berry et al., (2012) Int J Oncol 41).
    Likewise, an eraser of the tri-methyl variant of the H3K4 mark, JARID1B (KDM5B, PLU1) has also
    been identified as potential oncogene. In cancer JARID1B most likely acts as a repressor of
30  tumour repressor genes via removal of the H3K4 tri-methylation leading to decreased
    transcriptional activation in the affected chromatin regions. The oncogenic potential of JARID1B
    is demonstrated by its stimulation of proliferation in cell lines and further validated by shRNA
    knockdown studies of JARID1B expression showing inhibition of proliferation in MCF7 human
    breast cancer cells, in SW780 and RT4 bladder cancer cells, in A549 and LC319 lung cancer cells
35  and in 4T1 mouse tumour cells in vitro and/or in mouse xenograft experiments (Yamane K. et al.
    (2007), Mol. Cell 25, 801-12; Hayami S. et al. (2010) Mol. Cancer 9, 59; Catchpole S et al.
    (2011), Int. J. Oncol. 38, 1267-77). Finally, JARID1B is overexpressed in prostate cancer and is
    associated with malignancy and poor prognosis (Xiang Y. et al. (2007) PNAS 104).

        WO 2014/053491                                                           PCT/EP2013/070457
                                                    3
    JARID1A (KDM5A, RBP2) is also an eraser of the tri- and di-methyl variant of the H3K4 mark.
    JARID1A is overexpressed in gastric cancer (Zeng et al., (2010) Gastroenterology 138) and its
    gene is amplified in cervix carcinoma (Hidalgo et al, (2005) BMC Cancer 5). It has been
    suggested that JARID1A is fine-tuning progesterone receptor expression control by estrogens
  5 (Stratmann and Haendler (2011) FEBS J 278). Together with JARID1B, JARID1A has been
    implicated in the maintenance of a slow-growing population of cancer cells that are required for
    continuous tumor growth and that are resistant to cytotoxic and targeted therapy (Roesch, et al,
    (2010) Cell 141; Sharma, et al., (2010) Cell 141). JARID1A is required for the tumor initiation
    and progression in Rb+/- and Men1-defective mice (Lin, et al., (2011) PNAS 108). Data from
 .0 Pasini show that JARID1A binds to Polycomb group protein target genes which are involved in
    regulating important cellular processes such as embryogenesis, cell proliferation, and stem cell
    self-renewal through the transcriptional repression of genes determining cell fate decisions
    (Pasini et al., (2008) Genes & Dev 22). Additionally, JARID1A were also shown to binds the PRC2
    complex and being regulator of PRC2 target genes (Pasini et al., (2008) Genes & Dev 22).
 .5 Another potential oncogene, an eraser of the di-methyl variant of the H3K36 mark, JHDM1B
    (KDM2B, FBXL10) has been shown to be highly expressed in human cancers (Tzatsos A et al.
    (2009), PNAS 106 (8), 2641-6; He, J. et al. (2011), Blood 117 (14), 3869-80). Knock-down of
    FBXL10 causes senescence in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which can be rescued by
    expression of catalytic active (but not catalytic inactive) JHDM1B (Pfau R et al. (2008), PNAS
  0 105(6), 1907-12; He J et al. (2008), Nat Struct Mol Biol 15, 1169-75). JHDM1B demethylates
                                                                4
    H3K36me2 on the tumor-suppressor gene Ink4b (p15           k b), and thereby silences the expression
    of this senescence-mediating gene in MEFs and in leukemic cells (He, J. et al. (2008), Nat Struct
    Mol Biol 15, 1169-75; He, J. et al. (2011), Blood 117 (14), 3869-80). The catalytic dependency
    of JHDM1B is further shown by He et al. as catalytic activity is required for development of
 .5 leukemia in a mouse AML model.
    Inhibitors of the histone demethylase class of epigenetic enzymes, and in particular the potential
    oncogenes JARID1B, JARID1A, JMJD2C, JMJD2A, and JHDM1B, would present a novel approach
    for intervention in cancers and other proliferative diseases. Being one of the most devastating
    diseases, affecting millions of people worldwide, there remains a high need for efficacious and
30  specific compounds against cancer.
    Embodiments of the invention provide novel series of compounds capable of modulating the
    activity of histone demethylases (HDMEs), at least some of which compounds are useful for the
    prevention and/or the treatment of diseases in which genomic disregulation is involved in the
    pathogenesis, such as e.g. cancer. By way of further example, malnutrition or poor nutritiion is
35  thought to have an adverse epigenetic effect and the compounds of the invention may therefore
    be expected to have beneficial effect in treating such effects of poor nutrition. Furthermore,
    epigenetic changes have been found to be linked to behaviour. Accordingly, compounds
    according to the invention may be useful in behaviour modification.       Alternatively or additionally

                                                       4
    such compounds may be useful for exploring the extent to which different demethylases are
    inhibited by similar compounds as an investigation of the structure and functionality and
    mechanism of action of the demethylases.

    DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION
    Compounds of Formula (I)
30  As mentioned above, the present invention relates to compounds of Formula (I)

        WO 2014/053491                                                             PCT/EP2013/070457

          N
    The above definition of the compounds of Formula (I) is referred to herein by the expressions
    "compounds of Formula (I)" as defined herein, "compound of Formula (I) as defined herein", or
    simply "compounds of Formula (I)", etc. It should be understood, that such references are
  5 intended to encompass not only the above general formula, but also each and and every one of
    the embodiments, etc. discussed above or in the following. It should also be understood, that
    unless the opposite is stated, such references also encompass isomers, mixtures of isomers,
    pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs of the compounds of Formula (I).
    Without being bound by any particular theory, the current results and X-ray crystallography
 .0 studies give reasons to believe that the HOOC-pyridine-CH2-N< motif, cf. Formula (I), plays an
    important role when designing compounds capable of modulating the activity of histone
    demethylases (HDMEs).        Furthermore, it is believed that the substituent combination -A-Y plays
    a role in establishing affinity for said histone demethylases. Histone demethylases contain an
    iron atom on which their activity depends. It is furthermore believed that the pyridine nitrogen
 .5 and the nitrogen atom of Formula (I) also play a role in the binding of a particular cavity of the
    histone demethylases where the iron atom lies, probably by chelation of the iron itself.
    It is also believed that the A-Y chain, itself and through its substituents, interacts with the area
    of the demethylase known to accommodate the lysine chain of the substrate. As the
    experimental results presented below in the examples clearly demonstrate, there is a wide range
  0 of possibilities for the -A-Y group that modulate activity at various demethylases, imparting
    selective inhibition. Some demethylases have the lysine chain area lined with acidic residues
    and compounds with basic groups in Y show enhanced potency on these enzymes. Similarly,
    some demethylases are better inhibited by compounds with apolar groups in the Y chain. Yet
    other demethylases are better inhibited by compounds with non-charged polar groups in the Y
25  chain. Yet other demethylases are better inhibited by compounds with non-charged polar groups
    in the Y chain.
    More particularly, it is believed that the carboxylic acid substituent of the pyridine ring plays a
    role in binding to a particular cavity of histone demethylases.

    It is to be understood that in the Formula (I), Y is not H when A is -CH 2-. Generally speaking, it
    is believed to be advantageous if the moiety -A-Y has a certain "size" with respect to the number
    of atom (disregarding hydrogen atoms) and/or the molecular weight. Also a limited flexibility of
 .5 the moiety -A-Y appears to play a certain role.
    Hence, it is believed that the moiety -A-Y should preferably consist of at the most 40 heavy
    atoms, such as at the most 30 heavy atoms, or at the most 25 heavy atoms, or at the most 20
    heavy atoms. Preferably, the moiety -A-Y will consist of at least 3, or at least 4, or at least 8 or
    at least 10 heavy atoms. In some embodiments, the moiety -A-Y preferably consists of 3-40
  0 heavy atoms, such as 4-30 heavy atoms, or 4-25 heavy atoms, or 4-20, or 8-30, or 8-20, or 8
    15 heavy atoms. By the term "heavy atom" is meant all atoms in the moiety except the
    hydrogen atom(s).
    Moreover, it is believed that the compounds of Formula (I) should preferably have a molecular
 .5 weight of at least 130, or at least 150, or at least 180, or at least 250, but not more than 1000,
    or not more than 800, or not more than 500, or not more than 400 and may be within any range
    constructable from these preferred upper and lower limits, such as 130-1,000 g/mol, or 150
    1,000 g/mol, such as 180-800 g/mol, e.g. 225-600 g/mol or 250-500 g/mol, or 250 to 400.
    In some embodiments, and in order to introduce a limited flexibility of the moiety -A-Y, the
30  moiety includes 1-4 rings, i.e. rings derived from cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, heterocyclyl,
    heteroaryl and/or aryl. In some variant, the moiety -A-Y includes 1-3 cyclic moieties selected
    from monocylic cycloalkyl, monocyclic heterocyclyl, monocylic heteroaryl, dicyclic heteroaryl and
    monocyclic aryl. Small substituents such as alkyls groups or hydroxyl on alkyl chains also
    reduce flexibility and favor certain conformations.
35  It may be preferable that if -A-Y does not include a ring, it includes at least one, for instance
    from 1 to 3, branches, each of which independently may be of from one heavy atom to six heavy
    atoms, for instance from one to three heavy atoms, or from one to two heavy atoms. It is

    atom or at least one oxygen.

    Isomers
    The compounds of Formula (I) may exist as geometric isomers (i.e. cis-trans isomers), optical
    isomers or stereoisomers, such as diastereomers, as well as tautomers. Accordingly, it should be
 .0 understood that the definition of compounds of Formula (I) includes each and every individual
    isomers corresponding to the structural formula: Formula (I), including cis-trans isomers,
    stereoisomers and tautomers, as well as racemic mixtures of these and pharmaceutically
    acceptable salts thereof. Hence, the definition of compounds of Formula (I) is also intended to
    encompass all R- and S-isomers of a chemical structure in any ratio, e.g. with enrichment (i.e.
 .5 enantiomeric excess or diastereomeric excess) of one of the possible isomers and corresponding
    smaller ratios of other isomers.
    Diastereoisomers, i.e. non-superimposable stereochemical isomers, can be separated by
    conventional means such as chromatography, distillation, crystallization or sublimation. The
    optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional
  0 processes, for example by formation of diastereoisomeric salts by treatment with an optically
    active acid or base. Examples of appropriate acids include, without limitation, tartaric,
    diacetyltartaric, dibenzoyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic acid. The mixture of
    diastereomers can be separated by crystallization followed by liberation of the optically active
    bases from these salts. An alternative process for separation of optical isomers includes the use
 .5 of a chiral chromatography column optimally chosen to maximize the separation of the
    enantiomers. Still another available method involves synthesis of covalent diastereoisomeric
    molecules by reacting compounds of Formula (I) with an optically pure acid in an activated form
    or an optically pure isocyanate. The synthesized diastereoisomers can be separated by
    conventional means such as chromatography, distillation, crystallization or sublimation, and then
30  hydrolyzed to obtain the enantiomerically pure compound. The optically active compounds of
    Formula (I) can likewise be obtained by utilizing optically active starting materials and/or by
    utilizing a chiral catalyst. These isomers may be in the form of a free acid, a free base, an ester
    or a salt. Examples of chiral separation techniques are given in Chiral Separation Techniques, A
    Practical Approach,   2 nd ed. by G. Subramanian, Wiley-VCH, 2001.

    Pharmaceutically acceptable salts
    The compound of Formula (I) may be provided in any form suitable for the intended
    administration, in particular including pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs
    of the compound of Formula (I).
  5 Pharmaceutically acceptable salts refer to salts of the compounds of Formula (I), which are
    considered to be acceptable for clinical and/or veterinary use. Typical pharmaceutically
    acceptable salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the compounds of Formula (I) a
    mineral or organic acid or an organic or inorganic base. Such salts are known as acid addition
    salts and base addition salts, respectively. It will be recognized that the particular counter-ion
 .0 forming a part of any salt is not of a critical nature, so long as the salt as a whole is
    pharmaceutically acceptable and as long as the counter-ion does not contribute undesired
    qualities to the salt as a whole. These salts may be prepared by methods known to the skilled
    person. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, e.g., those described and discussed in
    Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17. Ed. Alfonso R. Gennaro (Ed.), Mack Publishing
 .5 Company, Easton, PA, U.S.A., 1985 and more recent editions and in Encyclopedia of
    Pharmaceutical Technology.
    Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts include acid addition salts formed with
    inorganic acids e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, hydroiodic, metaphosphoric, or
    phosphoric acid; and organic acids e.g. succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric, citric, tartaric, benzoic,

    and galacturonic acid; and arylsulfonic, for example benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic,
    methanesulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acid; and base addition salts formed with alkali metals
 .5 and alkaline earth metals and organic bases such as N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine,
    chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine (N-methylglucamine),
    lysine and procaine; and internally formed salts.
    Solvates
    The compound of Formula (I) may be provided in dissoluble or indissoluble forms together with a
30  pharmaceutically acceptable solvent such as water, ethanol, and the like. Dissoluble forms may
    also include hydrated forms such as the mono-hydrate, the dihydrate, the hemihydrate, the
    trihydrate, the tetrahydrate, and the like.
    Prodrugs
    The compound of Formula (I) may be provided as a prodrug. The term "prodrug" used herein is
35  intended to mean a compound which - upon exposure to certain physiological conditions - will
    liberate the compound of Formula (I) which then will be able to exhibit the desired biological
    action. A typical example is a labile ester of a carboxylic acid, in particular the pyridine carboxylic

    Inhibitory effect
  5 The inventors have surprisingly found that compounds of Formula (I) as defined herein have an
    inhibitory effect on the activity of one or more HDMEs. In this respect said one or more HDMEs
    may be any HDME, however preferably the one or more HDMEs are selected from the JmjC
    (Jumonji) family, more preferably said one or more HDME(s) are HDME of the human JmjC
    family and even more preferably are HDME belonging to the KDM6, KDM5, KDM4 or KDM2
 .0 families. The present invention also relates to a compound of Formula (I) as defined herein in a
    method for inhibiting HDMEs. The method includes contacting a cell with a compound of Formula
    (I). In a related embodiment, the method further provides that the compound is present in an
    amount effective to produce a concentration sufficient to inhibit the demethylation of a histone in
    the cell.
 .5 Thus, preferably in an assay for demethylation of a histone substrate by said HDME, then
    preferred compounds of Formula (I) are compounds capable of reducing or preferably inhibiting
    said demethylation by said HDME. Said histone substrate may be any histone, but preferably is
    histone H3 or a fragment thereof, even more preferred: a fragment comprising K4, K9, K27, or
    K36 of H3. Preferably, said inhibition is determined as the IC50 of said compound of Formula (I)
  0 in respect of the said demethylation assay.
    Preferred compounds of Formula (I) which have an IC 50 at or below 1 pM, more preferably less
    than 300 nM, for example less than 100 nM, such as less than 50 nM in respect of demethylation
    of any of said histone substrates by any of said HDME. Thus very preferred compounds of
    Formula (I) which have an IC50 at or below 1 pM, more preferably less than 500 nM, for example
25  less than 100 nM, such as less than 50 nM in respect of demethylation of histone H3 methylated
    at least on one lysine.
    In a preferred embodiment IC50 is determined as described in Example 2 herein below. Thus,
    particularly preferred are compounds of Formula (I) which have an IC 50 at or below 1 pM, more
    preferably less than 500 nM, for example less than 100 nM, such as less than 50 nM when said
30  IC 50 is determined as described in and one of the Examples herein below.
    Particularly preferred compounds of Formula (I) are compounds that lead to a decreased tumour
    size and/or decreased number of metastases when tested in a xenograft model (Morton and
    Houghton, Nature Protocols, 2 (2) 247-250, 2007).

    or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, diluents and/or carriers. The compounds of
    Formula (I) may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable
    carriers, diluents or excipients, in either single or multiple doses. Suitable pharmaceutically
    acceptable carriers, diluents and excipients include inert solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous
  5 solutions and various organic solvents.
    The pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers
    or diluents as well as any other known adjuvants and excipients in accordance with conventional
    techniques such as those disclosed in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st
    Edition, 2000, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.
 .0 The pharmaceutical compositions formed by combining a compound of Formula (I) as defined
    herein with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients can be readily
    administered in a variety of dosage forms such as tablets, powders, lozenges, syrups,
    suppositories, injectable solutions and the like. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid
    such as talc or starch which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets,
 .5 the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in
    suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.
    The pharmaceutical compositions may be specifically prepared for administration by any suitable
    route such as the oral and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal,
    intravenous and intradermal) route. It will be appreciated that the preferred route will depend on
  0 the general condition and age of the subject to be treated, the nature of the condition to be
    treated and the active ingredient chosen.
    Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration include solid dosage forms such as capsules,
    tablets, dragees, pills, lozenges, powders and granules. Where appropriate, they can be
    prepared with coatings such as enteric coatings or they can be prepared so as to provide
25  controlled release of the active ingredient such as sustained or prolonged release according to
    methods well known in the art.
    For oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, a compound of Formula (I) as defined
    herein may suitably be combined with an oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier
    such as ethanol, glycerol, water or the like. Furthermore, suitable binders, lubricants,
30  disintegrating agents, flavouring agents and colourants may be added to the mixture, as
    appropriate. Suitable binders include, e.g., lactose, glucose, starch, gelatin, acacia gum,
    tragacanth gum, sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes or the like.
    Lubricants include, e.g., sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate,
    sodium acetate, sodium chloride or the like. Disintegrating agents include, e.g., starch, methyl
35  cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum, sodium starch glycolate, crospovidone, croscarmellose
    sodium or the like. Additional excipients for capsules include macrogols or lipids.

    For the preparation of solid compositions such as tablets, the active compound of Formula (I) is
    mixed with one or more excipients, such as the ones described above, and other pharmaceutical
    diluents such as water to make a solid pre-formulation composition containing a homogenous
    mixture of a compound of Formula (I). The term "homogenous" is understood to mean that the
  5 compound of Formula (I) is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition
    may readily be subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets or capsules.
    Liquid compositions for either oral or parenteral administration of the compound of Formula (I)
    include, e.g., aqueous solutions, syrups, elixirs, aqueous or oil suspensions and emulsion with
    edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil. Suitable dispersing or
 .0 suspending agents for aqueous suspensions include synthetic or natural gums such as
    tragacanth, alginate, acacia, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, gelatin, methylcellulose or
    polyvinylpyrolidone.
    Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous and non
    aqueous injectable solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders to
 .5 be reconstituted in sterile injectable solutions or dispersions prior to use. For parenteral
    administration, solutions containing a compound of Formula (I) in sesame or peanut oil, aqueous
    propylene glycol, or in sterile aqueous solution may be employed. Such aqueous solutions should
    be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient
    saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous,
  0 intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. The oily solutions are suitable
    for intra-articular, intra-muscular and subcutaneous injection purposes.
    The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard
    pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.
    Depot injectable compositions are also contemplated as being within the scope of the present
25  invention.
    In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, the compositions of a compound of Formula (I)
    may include one or more additional ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavouring agents,
    colourant, surface active agents, thickeners, preservatives, e.g. methyl hydroxybenzoate
    (including anti-oxidants), emulsifying agents and the like.
30  A suitable dosage of the compound of Formula (I) will depend on the age and condition of the
    patient, the severity of the disease to be treated and other factors well known to the practicing
    physician. The compound may be administered for example either orally, parenterally or topically
    according to different dosing schedules, e.g. daily or with intervals, such as weekly intervals. In
    general a single dose will be in the range from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably from

    General Methods and Materials
 .5 Table 1 below shows examples of compounds according to the invention and indicates routes
    that may be employed in their synthesis. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa
    Aesar , Matrix, Combiblock, Oakwood, and Chembridge. Anhydrous solvents were Aldrich
    Sure/SealTm brand. All reactions were carried out under a dry nitrogen atmosphere using dry
    solvents. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography carried out on Sigma-Aldrich
  0 0.25 mm silica gel plates (60    A, fluorescent indicator). Spots were visualized under UV light
    (254 nm). Flash column chromatography was performed on Biotage SNAP Flash System, or
    silica gel 60 (particle size 0.032-0.063 mm) obtained from Silicycle, Inc. Low-resolution ES
    (electrospray) mass spectra were obtained using a Micromass Quattro Ultima mass spectrometer
    in the electrospray positive (ES+) or negative (ES-) ion mode. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded
25  on a Bruker AM-300 spectrometer and were calibrated using residual nondeuterated solvent as
    internal reference. Spectra were processed using Spinworks version 2.5 (developed by Dr. Kirk
    Marat, Department of Chemistry, University of Manitoba). Preparative HPLC was performed on
    Waters 2996 with Photodiode Array Detector, Waters 600 Controller, Waters 100 pump, and
    Waters 717 auto sampler, with UV detection at 254 and 280 nm. Flow rate: 15 mL/minute, run
30  time 30 minutes. Solvents: 0-100% (H 20-MeOH), with and without added TFA (0.1%). Column
    used was Supelco C18, 25 cm x 21.2 mm, particle size 10 micrometer.
    Ethyl 2-formylpyridine-4-carboxylate was prepared analogously to Queguiner, G. and Pastour, P.
    ( Comptes Rendus des Seances de l'Academie des Sciences, Serie C: Sciences Chimiques
    (1969), 268(2), 182-5).

   General Procedure A (Ester hydrolysis)
   The ester (Ethyl 2-({[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]amino}methyl)pyridine-4-carboxylate (a)) was
   dissolved in MeOH-THF-H 20 (1:1:1) and LiOH (1.0 equiv) was added. The reaction mixture was
   stirred at room temperature and monitored by TLC. Solvents were removed in vacuo. Worked up by
LO dissolving in water and extract with Et20. The aqueous basic layer was acidified with 1N HCI to pH 1,
   and the solution was concentrated to dryness to afford the hydrochloric acid salt of title compound
   as a colorless solid.

   Example 2: Histone lysine demethylase AlphaLISA assays for IC50 value determination.
   This example demonstrates the ability of compounds of the invention to inhibit the activity in vitro of
   tested enzymes (Table 2a).
 o Assays are performed analogously to the protocol described by PerkinElmer (Roy et al. PerkinElmer
   Technical Note: AlphaLISA #12, Apr. 2011). Results are seen in Table 3.
   General method
   Enzymes are dissolved in enzyme buffer and incubated for 10 min before 5 pL is added to 5 pL 3%
   DMSO solutions of compounds in enzyme buffer. Incubated for another 10 minutes, before 5 pL
 5 substrate solution is added and the reaction mixture is incubated at room temperature for the given
   period. 10 pL acceptor beads, suspended at given dilutions in Epigenetic Buffer (Perkin Elmer ALO08)
   from stock, are added and the suspension is incubated 60 minutes in the dark at room temperature,
   before 10 pL suspension (at the given dilutions in Epigenetic Buffer) of streptavidin donor beads
   (Perkin Elmer 6760002) in Epigenetic Buffer is added. After incubation at room temperature in the
30 dark the plates are read. Reaction conditions are seen in Table 2b.

  Example 3: Histone Lysine Demethylase Immunofluorescence Assays for IC50 value Determination
  in Cell
  Histone Lysine Demethylase Immunofluorescence Assays for IC50 value Determination, non
  transfected cells
5 This example demonstrates the ability of compounds of the invention to inhibit demethylation of
  H3K4 in a human osteosarcoma cancer cell line.
  General method
  U20S cells were harvested and seeded into multi well plates into media containing compound. The
  media used was DMEM containing 5 % FBS and pen/strep. 20 hours after incubation of cells with
0 compounds, the cells were washed once in PBS, harvested by fixation with formaldehyde 4 %
  aqueous solution, and washed 2 times in PBS. Subsequently, the cells were permeabilized in PBS
  with 0.2 % Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Blocking was performed in PBS with 0.2
  % Triton X-100 and 5 % FBS for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with
  aH3K4me3 primary antibody (Cell Signaling, #9751S) diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution over night
5 at 4 0 C. After incubation with primary antibody, the cells were washed 3 times with PBS, incubated
  with secondary antibody diluted 1:1000 (Alexa fluor 594 goat anti rabbit IgG, Invitrogen, A11012)
  and Hoechst, 20 pg / ml (Sigma, 33342) in blocking solution, and washed again 3 times with PBS.
  Finally, PBS was added and high throughput imaging and analysis were performed by an IN Cell
  Analyzer 1000 (GE Healthcare). The IC50 values seen in Table 4 were based on an average measure
0 of the staining of the H3K4me3 mark in cells.

  Example 4: Cell proliferation Assays for EC50 value Determination
  This example demonstrates the ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit the proliferation
  of a human breast cancer cell line.
  General method
5 MCF7 cells were seeded at 1250 cells/well in 50pl medium/well in black 96 well plates. Cells were
  incubated for 24 hours before addition of compound. Compounds were diluted in complete medium
  (50pl/well) and added to the plates in duplicates. The total volume of medium in the wells was 100
  pl, and the final concentration of DMSO 0.5 %. Complete medium used was DMEM with GlutaMAX
  containing 10 % FBS and pen/strep.
0 120 hours after addition of compounds, the plates were harvested and analyzed by ATPlite 1 Step
  (Perkin Elmer, cat no 6016739) according to the manufactures recommendation. Briefly, 100 pl ATP
  lite solution was added to each well, plates were vortexed at 700 rpm 2 minutes, followed by 20
  minutes incubation in the dark, and then analyzed for luminescence on EnSpire 2300 Mulitilabel
  reader (Perkin Elmer). EC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 6. Results are seen in
5 Table 5.

    Example 5: Histone Lysine Demethylase Immunofluorescence Assays for IC50 value
    Determination in Cell
    This example demonstrates the ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit
  5 demethylation of a specific H3 lysine in a human osteosarcoma cell line transfected to express a
    specific histone lysine demethylase.
    General method
    U20S cells were seeded 24 hours before transfection. Transfection was performed with Fugene
    HD transfection reagent as recommended by the manufacturer. 6 hours after transfection, the
 .0 cells were harvested and seeded into multi well plates into media containing compound. The
    media used was DMEM containing 5 /b FBS and pen/strep. 20 hours after incubation of cells with
    compounds, the cells were washed once in PBS, harvested by fixation with formaldehyde 4 0/
    aqueous solution, and washed 2 times in PBS. Subsequently, the cells were permeabilized in PBS
    with 0.2 /b Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Blocking was performed in PBS with
 .5 0.2 /b Triton X-100 and 5 /b FBS for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with
    primary antibodies diluted 1 pg / ml in blocking solution over night at 4 0 C. The primary
    antibodies used in the assays were HA.11 (Covance, MMS-101P) and the antibody detecting the
    mark specified in the Table 6 below. After incubation with primary antibodies, the cells were
    washed 3 times with PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies diluted 1:1000 (Alexa fluor 594
 )0 goat anti rabbit IgG, Invitrogen, A11012; Alexa flour 488 donkey anti mouse IgG, Invitrogen,
    A21202) and Hoechst, 20 pg / ml (Sigma, 33342) in blocking solution, and washed again 3 times
    with PBS. Finally, PBS was added and high throughput imaging and analysis were performed by
    an IN Cell Analyzer 1000 (GE Healthcare). The robot software analyzed individual cells and
    divided these into HA+ (transfected cells) and HA- (non-transfected cells). The IC50 values in
25  Table 7 below were based on an average measure of the staining of the mark specified in the
    Table 6 below in the transfected cells.

In this specification, unless expressly otherwise indicated, the word 'or' is used in the
sense of an operator that returns a true value when either or both of the stated
conditions is met, as opposed to the operator 'exclusive or' which requires that only
one of the conditions is met. The word 'comprising' is used in the sense of 'including'
rather than to mean 'consisting of'. All prior teachings acknowledged above are
hereby incorporated by reference. No acknowledgement of any prior published
document herein should be taken to be an admission or representation that the
teaching thereof was common general knowledge in Australia or elsewhere at the date
hereof.
Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context requires
otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and "comprising",
will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of
integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of
integers or steps.
The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived from
it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an
acknowledgment or admission or any form of suggestion that that prior publication (or
information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general
knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.
