           SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DISTRIBUTING MEDIA CONTENT
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]         The present invention relates to a system and method for providing
media content to one or more viewers.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]         At a large event, such as a sporting event like the Formula 1 Grand
Prix or the Tour de France for example, an event attendee will not be able to view
the action around the whole event area due to the size of the area. Accordingly, the
viewer's experience at these events is limited.
[0003]         One known solution to this problem is to telecast the action on the track
onto a big screen, where the video feed is captured by a video recording camera at
different locations around the track. However, these big screens are not visible to all
attendees at the event.
[0004]          Existing systems for broadcasting video to a user device (such as a
television screen or a mobile device) involve a video camera device for capturing a
video feed, which is then transmitted to a remote station for encoding the information
into a format suitable for broadcasting and reception by the user equipment. These
existing broadcasting systems however suffer from latency issues. Therefore, while
a user in the event area could tune into the broadcasted content on his/her mobile
device to view the action around distant or other locations in the event area, the
user's viewing of this content on his/her mobile device will not be in real-time thereby
limiting the viewer's experience at the event.
[0005]          Embodiments of the present invention seek to provide a system for
providing media content to one or more viewers with lower latency (i.e. substantially
in real time) and/or to provide media content for high-density viewing and/or to at
least provide the public with a useful choice.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[00034]        Referring to Figure 1, the system 100 according to an embodiment of
the present invention for distributing content to one or more user electronic devices
900 includes a digital video camera 120, an encoder 140, and a wireless access
point 160.
[00035]       The digital video camera 120 is configured capture content data from
the real world. As user herein, 'content data' includes one or more of audio data,
image data, and video data.       The digital video camera 120 interfaces with the
encoder 140 via a Serial Digital Interface (SDI) video interface. However, according
to other embodiments, the digital video camera 120 may interface with the encoder
140 via a High Definition SDI (HD-SDI) video interface or via a High Definition
Multimedia Interface (HDMI) video interface, via a Display Port, Digital Visual
Interface (DVI), or via a Universal Serial Bus (USB).
[00036]       The digital video camera 120 is a physically separate device from the
encoder 140. However, in other embodiments, the digital video camera 120 and the
encoder 140 are part of the same device. For example, the encoder 140 may be
housed within the digital video camera 120.
[00037]       The encoder 140 is configured to receive the content data captured by
the digital video camera 120 and encodes the data into a format suitable for
reception by the user electronic devices 900.     The format used by the encoder 140
is preferably H.264 format or MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced Video Coding (AVC).       The
format used by the encoder may alternatively be H.265 format or MPEG-H Part 2.
[00038]       The encoder 140 is particularly configured for transmission over a
transport stream having the following settings:
       a video packet identifier of 33;
       an audio packet identifier of 36;
       a program clock reference packet identifier of 33; and
       a program map table packet identifier of 32.

[00039]        The encoder 140 is further configured to perform forward error
correction (FEC) on the content data that is received by the transmitters.   The FEC
used by the encoder 140 is Pro MPEG FEC 10. The FEC is performed at a rate of
less than about 20% of the transport stream bandwidth, which would result in a
latency of less than 2 seconds.
[00040]        The encoder 140 is configured for transmission over an average
transport stream bandwidth of between about 500 kbps and about 4 Mbps,
preferably about 1 Mbps and about 1.5 Mbps. The invention allows the system to
operate for high density (i.e. transmission of data to a plurality of user electronic
devices) at low bitrates of about 500 kbps to about 3 Mbps, while maintaining the
high definition streaming. The encoder 140 is configured to transmit the content data
to the transmitter(s) in a multicast configuration.
[00041]        The specific encoding techniques and settings employed by the
encoder 140 result in a latency of less than about 100ms. In contrast, the average
latency for an existing conventional system can be between 1OOms and 250ms.
[00042]        The wireless access point 160 is configured to receive encoded
content data from the encoder 140 and to transmit the encoded content data to the
user electronic devices 900. The wireless access point 160 is configured to convert
the multicast transmission from the encoder 140 into a unicast configuration, which is
then transmitted to the user electronic devices 900.
[00043]        The wireless access point 160 is configured to support transmission of
the encoded content data to up to about 40 user electronic devices.         As will be
described in further detail below with reference to Figure 5, the system may
comprise more than one wireless access point, wherein each wireless access point
is configured to support transmission of content data to up to about 40 user
electronic devices.     The wireless access point 160 is configured to operate on a
2.4GHz frequency band and/or on a 5GHz frequency band.          It will be understood
that the wireless access point could be operated in accordance with one or more
wireless local area network standards.

[00044]       Where the wireless access point 160 is configured transmit the
encoded content data in accordance with wireless standard IEEE 802.11a, the
wireless access point 160 is configured to transmit content data at one or more data
rates of about 18.0 Mbps, 24.0 Mbps, 36.0 Mbps, 48.0 Mbps, and 54.0 Mbps.
[00045]       Where the wireless access point 160 is configured transmit the
encoded content data in accordance with wireless standard IEEE 802.11g, the
wireless access point 160 is configured to transmit content data at one or more data
rates of about 18.0 Mbps, 24.0 Mbps, 36.0 Mbps, 48.0 Mbps, and 54.0 Mbps.
[00046]       Where the wireless access point 160 is configured transmit the
encoded content data in accordance with wireless standard IEEE 802.11b, the
wireless access point 180 is configured to transmit content data at one or more data
rates of about 1.0 Mbps, 2.0 Mbps, 5.5 Mbps, and 11.0 Mbps.
[00047]       Where the wireless access point 160 is configured transmit the
encoded content data in accordance with wireless standard IEEE 802.11n, the
wireless access point 180 is configured to transmit content data at one or more data
rates of about 24.0 Mbps, 36.0 Mbps, 48.0 Mbps, and 54.0 Mbps.
[00048]       Where the wireless access point 160 is configured transmit the
encoded content data in accordance with wireless standard IEEE 802.11ac, the
wireless access point 180 is configured to transmit content data at one or more data
rates of about 24.0 Mbps, 36.0 Mbps, 48.0 Mbps, and 54.0 Mbps.
[00049]       Due to the closed-circuit nature of the system 100, the wireless access
point 160 does not require any filtering and application control, which further
improves the latency.
[00050]       The specific settings employed by the wireless access point 160 result
in a latency of less than about 200ms.
[00051]       The user electronic device is configured to have a buffering time for
content received from the transmitter of about 2 seconds.

                                             I I
[00052]        Figure 2 shows the method 200 according to an embodiment of the
present invention for distributing content data to one or more user electronic devices
in an area, which may be an event area (such as a sporting arena for example). The
method 200 involves the data capture device positioned in the area capturing a video
feed (at 220), an encoder converting the video feed into a format suitable for
reception by user electronic devices (at 240), and a transmitter (wireless access
point) receiving the encoded video feed from the encoder (at 260) and transmitting
the video feed to the user electronic devices (at 280).
[00053]        It will be readily appreciated that the system 100 of Figure 1 and the
method 200 of distributing content data of Figure 2 can be scaled accordingly
depending on the size of the event area and the number of user electronic devices in
the event area to be serviced.        For example, there may be more than one data
capture device positioned in the event area to capture content data from different
locations in the event area in order to increase the user's visibility of the event area.
In this configuration,      the   data capture devices capture content data          and
communicate the data to the encoder for encoding and subsequent transmission to
the user electronic devices via the transmitter. Alternatively, there may be more than
one encoder provided in the event area that communicates with a respective one or
more of the plurality of data capture devices. In addition, there may be more than
one wireless access point to support a higher number of user electronic devices.
Where there are a plurality of wireless access points, the wireless access points are
arranged and configured to provide seamless data communication and coverage as
the user electronic device moves from a first cell that is serviced by one wireless
access point to a second cell that is serviced by another wireless access point.
[00054]        Referring to Figure 3, a system 300 according to another embodiment
of the present invention is disclosed for distributing content data to a user electronic
device. The system 300 is similar to the system 100 of Figure 1, and like reference
numerals used for the system 300 of Figure 3 with the addition of 200 indicate like
elements as the system 100 of Figure 1. In the embodiment shown in Figure 3
however, the system 300 further comprises a server 370 for authenticating the user
electronic device(s). In this embodiment, a network switch 350 is provided, which is

                                            I C.
configured to selectively control traffic between the server 370 and the encoder 340
to the wireless access point 360. The network switch may communicate traffic to
and from the server via the Internet for example. The server 370 is configured to
provide additional content to the user, which may be advertising (such as
promotional     content from    event sponsors)     and/or event    messages.    Unlike
conventional systems however, the server does not receive content data from the
data capture device 320 for subsequent transmission to the user electronic devices.
In this way, the latency of the overall system is significantly reduced compared to
conventional systems.
[00055]        It will however be appreciated that, according to other embodiments of
the invention, the network switch may not be provided. According to these other
embodiments, the wireless access point is provided with inbuilt routing capabilities,
which allows for data communication with the server via a network (which may be
the Internet for example).
[00056]        Figure 4 shows a timing diagram according to an embodiment of the
present invention, particularly for the system shown in Figure 3.         A user of an
electronic device 900 seeking to access the content provided by the system will be
required to first obtain authentication from the server 370.      The user electronic
device connects to the wireless access point 360 and sends a request for
authentication (at 410) to the wireless access point 360, which is subsequently
routed by the network switch (at 420), via the Internet for example, to the server 370.
[00057]        The server 370 receives the request for authentication and makes a
determination as to whether the user electronic device is authorised to access the
content provided by the system. The server may for example assess whether a user
identification included in the request from the user electronic device corresponds to
an existing identification stored in one or more computer data storage devices. The
existing identifications in the data storage devices may be a list of attendees of the
event in which the system is configured to operate for example. The server 370
sends its decision (at 430) as to whether the user electronic device 900 is authorised
to access the content to the wireless access point 360, which subsequently transmits

                                            I I.,
the decision (at 440) to the user electronic device 900 as to whether the user
electronic device is authorised to access the content.
[00058]       If the user electronic device 900 is granted access by the server 370 to
the content, the user electronic device 900 is provided with an access token, which
includes the settings for the user electronic device 900 to view the content data. The
access token may for example define an access session by the electronic device to
the content for a limited period of time. For a sporting event, the limited period of
time may correspond to the duration of the sporting event for example.
[00059]       The data capture device 320 transmits content data to the encoder 340
(at 450), which encodes the content data as described above. The encoded data is
transmitted to the wireless access point (at 460) for subsequent transmission to the
user electronic device 900 (at 470).
[00060]       The server 370 may be configured to provide further content to the
user electronic device 900, such as advertising material or event messages. Where
the further content is desired to be transmitted to the user electronic device 900, the
server 370 transmits the further content to the wireless access point 360 (at 480),
